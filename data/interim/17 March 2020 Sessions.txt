PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 17 MARCH 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Soni, good morning everybody. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are starting a little later than we should have 
because there was a matter that I needed to discuss with Mr Soni.  And 
I think we must start with that Mr Soni.  We will start with that so that 
everybody knows how today stands. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Chairperson having reflected on evidence that 
10 
has been led since last week and some of the evidence led by Ms 
Ngoye I – we have come to the conclusion that it may be necessary for 
us to make further enquiries and investigations into certain matters.  I 
do not need to detail them at this stage Chairperson but those 
enquiries would in fact give you especially but the public a better 
picture of what is it that PRASA – the investigations into PRASA be 
revealed.    We have some of the versions we do not have all of the 
versions and we need to pursue those we submit in order for you to 
give you a complete picture.  So what I am going to propose obviously 
subject to your approval Chairperson is that after Ms Ngoye’s evidence 
20 
today we adjourn the proceedings in relation to PRASA and perhaps 
because there is nothing else said but in relation to PRASA until we are 
able to give you a more complete picture and that should not take more 
than about two or three weeks for us to complete the investigations 
Chairperson. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 3 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I think that – that is important because for 
example yesterday there were some important documents that we – 
needs to be obtained apart from some that Ms Ngoye said she could 
get.  I know that there was also a document that was referred to in Mr 
Molefe’s evidence (indistinct) PRASA’s that also needs to be searched 
for and found if possible and obtained.  So I think – I think it would be 
– it would help that when the evidence is presented we already have a 
complete picture by way of at least statements, affidavits so that before 
the witness finishes the versions of people that she implicates in some 
wrongdoing we will have been put to her. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that subject to a cross-examination application 
being granted subject to that when she is finished she would have 
finished her evidence as far as we are concerned. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be – should be the same with Mr Molefe 
because he was going to come back tomorrow. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is necessary to also obtain certain affidavits in 
relation to his evidence.  I am sure with Mr Dingiswayo as well. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That there may be others that we do not need to 
detail.  But also there is a personal matter that I need to attend to 
which is also another reason.  So we will try and go up to the end of Ms 
Ngoye’s evidence and then we will adjourn and then we will resume 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 4 of 211 
 
once the investigation is complete. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson just again for the record we are 
emboldening in making that proposal to you because you will recall at 
the outset I said we intended presenting the evidence in two stages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So the second stage will now encapsulate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  This plus what we had intended (indistinct) (Chair 
speaking of Mr Soni). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, no thank you.  Okay.  Ms Ngoye you are still 
10 
under oath is that alright? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now Ms Ngoye yesterday we finished your 
evidence in relation to the Siyaya (indistinct). 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And just to put it in context you will recall that the 
reason you highlighted the Siyaya matters is because the first of the 
person who received benefits from Siyaya or runs Siyaya – the identity 
of the person.  You remember that? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And who is that person? 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Mabunda. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right.  Now earlier yesterday when you gave 
evidence you indicated… 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 5 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  I am sorry I think she is referring to Mr Mabunda for the 
first time if I am not mistaken.  Maybe she can give full names? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Full names. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or names that you know rather than just Mr Mabunda. 
MS NGOYE:  I –  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you cannot remember his name? 
MS NGOYE:  The name escapes me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Okay.  He will be in some 
10 
document. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Is it not Mr Makhensa Mabunda. 
MS NGOYE:  Makhensa Mabunda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Makhensa Mabunda.  Thank you Counsel. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now yesterday when you gave evidence in 
referring to the major beneficiaries of these contracts one the names 
you mentioned was Mr Mabunda who is the other person that you 
identified as a major beneficiary of PRASA contracts/ 
MS NGOYE:  Well it is Mr Moodley Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What Moodley is he? 
MS NGOYE:  I think I am having a bad day today Chair in remembering 
the names.  Mr… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Roy Moodley. 
MS NGOYE:  Roy Moodley yes.  So it is Mr Roy Moodley the first one 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 6 of 211 
 
and the second is Mr Mabunda those are the two gentlemen I referred 
to in my evidence. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to Mr Mabunda and his company, 
the Siyaya companies you refer to the disputes that had been referred 
to arbitration. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Are there any disputes that have been the subject 
matter of litigation in relation to Mr Moodley’s companies if I could put 
it broadly? 
MS NGOYE:  Well yes in relation to Mr Moodley’s companies we have 
10 
got you know other matters that have not necessarily been referred to 
here.  One of the companies that Mr Moodley is associated with and is 
a director of is the Royal Security Company and I do know that in 
relation to that specific company there is current litigation happening.  
That company provides security for PRASA and I think it is a well-
known issue that the security contract is with PRASA taking PRASA to 
court.  So Royal Security is one of those companies. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And have there been any matters in which you 
have been involved where Mr Moodley’s companies are the subject of 
litigation? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Siyangena is the big one Chairperson.  Siyangena 
Technologies is the big one where Mr Moodley you know is also 
involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have to find a way of not confusing Siyaya and 
Siyangena.  Siyangena relates – is associated with Mr Roy Moodley? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 7 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Also yes.  Siyangena is not the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who else? 
MS NGOYE:  It is Mr Roy Moodley and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  His son. 
MS NGOYE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His son. 
MS NGOYE:  His son was Strawberry Worx. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS NGOYE:  The advertising portfolio. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  So he basically is more involved in this one, the 
Siyangena Contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so… 
MS NGOYE:  And the Prodigy one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So out of all the names that get mentioned in regard 
to Siyangena here he is the person associated with Siyangena? 
MS NGOYE:  His name does come up Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is there somebody else in Siyangena who gets 
mentioned in the – who else? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes quite a bit.  There is Mr Ganjo (?). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NGOYE:  There is Mr Montana himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NGOYE:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the person that – the person from Siyangena that 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 8 of 211 
 
PRASA really interacted with mostly would have been Mr Roy Moodley? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right.  And Siyaya? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry Mr Chair I would just like to place on record 
to assist the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Siyangena is a company that does not have Mr 
Moodley as a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is their company so they must be clear on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We follow the witness’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  The witness is familiar with who the directors are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As well including these other companies like 
20 
Strawberry Worx and Prodigy’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Whilst they may have been appearances in certain 
instances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 9 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As the witness correctly points out here and there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But ultimately these are not his companies and I 
put it in inverted commas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Because the witness is familiar with who the 
directors are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As the Head of Legal she would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I just want to clarify so – for Judge.  So then we 
have Siyangena which is a different company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you have Siyaya which has different 
directors and different role players. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Which is – that is just to assist Judge on that 
aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay 
now as far as you are concerned Siyangena is associated with Mr Roy 
20 
Moodley? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair there is – there is – in fact if I can clarify that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  There is a company that was paid by Siyangena that is 
associated with Mr Roy Moodley. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 10 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And I will come to that Chairperson in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But when – from your point of view when I hear 
the name Siyangena I must think of Mr Roy Moodley? 
MS NGOYE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And Siyaya? 
MS NGOYE:  Siyaya is Mr Makhensa Mabunda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Without going into details you were saying that 
Siyangena paid a company which is associated with Mr Roy Moodley. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What is the approximate amount Ms Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  It is R500 million Chairperson.  Chair I must also say that 
this was also picked up you know when the media brought this to the 
attention of PRASA.   So the investigations that we conducted did not 
pick up this.  This was an issue that was picked up in the media but 
however PRASA then incorporates this issue in relation to the 
(indistinct) you know submission and it is included in there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to the dispute between PRASA and 
Siyangena what is the nature of the dispute and where is the dispute? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson the dispute between PRASA and Siyangena 
is around you know payments of monies that Siyangena says it is owed 
by PRASA.  But where PRASA wants to review and set aside all the 
contracts that had been concluded with Siyangena.  So we would like 
that – those contracts to be set aside and as part of those contracts 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 11 of 211 
 
there have been arbitration proceedings that have been brought by 
Siyangena in relation to their payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I will say this because I wanted to say – as I 
said I think was it during Mr Popo Molefe’s evidence a litigant does not 
review it is the court that reviews and set aside. 
MS NGOYE:  Okay the court.   
CHAIRPERSON:  A litigant applies to the court. 
MS NGOYE:  For the review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And ask the court to review and set aside in certain 
decisions. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NGOYE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now can I ask you to look at Bundle B and FS3B 
Chairperson that is at Bundle B page 126. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  There are – are you familiar with these papers Ms 
Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes I am Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right.  Firstly would you tell the Chairperson what 
this – what this document is? 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson this is the application that was brought by 
PRASA in relation to the Siyangena contracts applying for the review 
thereof. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 12 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now before we look at what PRASA intends to 
review please give the Chairperson a brief background of the contracts 
that are the subject matter of the review application? 
MS NGOYE:  Chair there is quite a number of contracts that – that are 
involved in this matter.  In fact you know I would be referring to phase 
1 and phase 1 extension of the contract and then there was phase 2.  
So effectively there is about four and the amendment that was also 
introduced in – in you know in the proceedings that we found out about 
when we were going to court.  So the first part of the Siyangena where 
Siyangena was involved as a sub-contractor that contract is not is 
10 
dispute.  It is only in relation to where there were extensions of that 
contract which were – did not follow procedure that are in dispute.  So 
we have got in respect of that the extension of the pilot phase which is 
the extension of what was done in the (indistinct) cup period and then 
the 2010 Soccer World Cup as well.  You know the process that was 
followed in appointing Siyangena in respect of that.  And then also the 
extension to that contract as well as well as the first – the second 
phase which we call the second phase where again Siyangena was 
appointed to you know work on our stations in relation to the ISAMS 
contract.  And the final one is the amendment, the addendum which we 
20 
– I – we only saw for the first time Chairperson when Siyangena took us 
to court.  When we had requested that they stop working on PRASA had 
requested that they stop working on our sites.  They took us to court 
applying for an interdict.  And that is when we became aware of the 
other addendum in relation to their contracts. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 13 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Just to put it in context Ms Ngoye.  This 
application is an application by PRASA to ask the court to review and 
set aside some of the contracts you have referred to? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay we will deal with those contracts because 
you deal with it in the affidavits but let us deal with them systematically 
otherwise it is going to be all over the place 
MS NGOYE:  That is fine Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay in relation to the papers in the Siyangena 
matter have you now made a different affidavit for the purposes of the 
10 
commission? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair I had to because in my first affidavit the one 
that I signed on the 14 April the one we were dealing with yesterday I 
do make reference you know to the Siyangena companies and the 
litigation that PRASA is involved in.  So I needed to do the 
supplementary affidavit so that I can deal further with the – the issues 
that PRASA raise in the Siyangena application.  So this is why there is 
this supplementary affidavit which I have made. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Please look at Bundle E and if I can ask you to 
look at the documents that is marked SS7C. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say SS7C? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  C? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is right at the end of Bundle E. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 14 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Sorry Chair.  I have got it Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Will you explain to the Chairperson what is the 
purpose of this affidavit? 
MS NGOYE: Sorry Chair annexure to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually before you do that can I just check 
particularly with the transcribers are you able to hear Mr Soni quite 
well?  I think sometimes he stands a little too far from the microphone.  
The transcribers.  I do not think they can hear me. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  They do not even seem to be (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will somebody find out from them whether they hear 
10 
when Mr Soni speaks?  The transcribers and let us know.  But try not to 
speak from – far from the… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I do not know whether it is going to put it in the 
centre or not but as long as you try to – wherever it is as long as you 
try not to be too loud.  Too far from it.  I see things fall apart.  Okay 
whatever is convenient as long as when you speak you are not too far 
from it.  I am just scared that the transcript might have too many 
inaudibles in the end.  I am trying to avoid that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That – as you please Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think somebody wants to tell you whether they 
can hear you.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I am told they can hear Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I am – I am… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But I will still attend to the concern. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 15 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  To the concern.  Ms Ngoye can you tell the 
Chairperson what the purpose of – well firstly do you confirm that what 
is contained in this affidavit is true and correct? 
MS NGOYE:  I do Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what is the purpose of this affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just to confirm this is one of your affidavits? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  This is one that is made on the 15 March. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  Chair the – the application papers 
in PRASA’s review application are – you know are part of the bundles 
that have been put before the commission.  And the purpose of this 
affidavit is to refer to specifics in – in the main affidavit of Siyangena 
that PRASA has highlighted.  You know in relation to the Siyangena 
applications. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in this affidavit you deal with a number of 
issues but you start off with if you look at paragraph 6 you start off with 
two preliminary points.  Will you tell the Chairperson what the first 
preliminary point is please? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson the review application that is now before the 
courts is the second review application.  PRASA had applied before to 
review the contracts but because of the 180 Rule in terms of PAGA we 
– we were obviously not successful in that regard and when the 
concourt decided on the (indistinct) case you know referring to issues 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 16 of 211 
 
of legality PRASA saw it fit to then go back to court to then issue the 
second review application. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry before you go on just to put things in 
context.  The – you refer to this would I be correct in paragraph 13 of 
your founding affidavit I am going to refer to your affidavit in the review 
applications as the founding affidavit and that appears at page 141 of 
SS3D would that be correct? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now who made the affidavit in the first application 
for review that went before court that was dismissed? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Doctor Popo Molefe was still the Chairperson of PRASA at 
the time so he made that application Chair. He signed the paper for the 
application. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then when you went back to court on the 
basis of the present application who made the founding affidavit? 
MS NGOYE:  I had to make the founding affidavit Chairperson in my 
capacity as the Head of Legal and that is why my name is on the 
papers. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright and then you indicate in paragraph 7 what 
that application is about.  Would you explain to the Chairperson? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  The application Chairperson is to review and set aside the 
contracts that had been… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  To have reviewed and set aside? 
MS NGOYE:  Have reviewed and set aside.  We are learning as we go 
along Chair.  Those contracts of Siyangena that I highlighted 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 17 of 211 
 
Chairperson before. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And just in brief what were the basis on which 
PRASA had brought that up – as in just in brief? 
MS NGOYE:  Sure.  Chair there was – the processes that are required 
to be followed in you know appointing suppliers in relation to these 
contracts were not followed.  So effectively you know there was no 
authority to enter into these contracts and we did not comply with the 
Section 217 of The Constitution in terms how matters of you know 
Procurement need to be dealt with.  Our own Supply Chain processes 
were flouted in relation to how these contracts were entered into. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And any legislation? 
MS NGOYE:  There is the PPPFA as well which obviously was also not 
complied with. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you make another point about certain 
dealings between people and PRASA and attorneys for Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What – are you going to come back to those 
dealings? 
MS NGOYE:  I will come back to those – to those Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Now you then set out how these contracts 
20 
came into being and you do that at paragraph 9.  Will you set that out 
as simply as possible for the Chairperson Ms Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.  Chairperson in 2009 you know during the 
Confederations Cup Process PRASA in fact appointed two construction 
companies Enza and Rainbow Construction to assist in the development 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 18 of 211 
 
of two stations.  This was the Nazarec station as well as the 
Doornfontein station.  And in that process this was handled by Intersite.  
You will recall Chairperson I said that Intersite was a subsidiary of 
PRASA.  At the time Intersite was Intersite Property Management 
Services of PRASA and it ran with that process of appointing those 
suppliers.  And those suppliers appointed Siyangena as their sub-
contractor.  So as far as we are concerned there is no issue with that 
contract.  I think it was important to highlight it so that you know there 
is context as how Siyangena then is involved in relation to the other 
matters.  The second issue Chairperson that is being challenged is that 
10 
immediately after that (indistinct) process PRASA again you know gave 
about seven of our stations to be developed to Siyangena without 
following process.  This is – this is one which we call the Pilot Phase.  
Effectively the extension of the Pilot Phase.  So you – what we are 
actually saying Chair is that in relation to that particular contract no 
process was followed.  In fact this is one of those matters that was 
dealt with by the Public Protector who also found that there was no 
processes followed procurement-wise SCM was flouted and so on.  So 
you know that is the other contract that we wish to review. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Ms Ngoye sorry to trouble you. You mentioned a 
20 
Pilot Project and mentioned the extension are the two the same?  In 
other words the Nazarec and Doornfontein contract is that the Pilot 
contract and then the seven is the extension of that Pilot Contract. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay and now that you deal with in paragraph 10 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 19 of 211 
 
of your affidavit. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry (inaudible). 
MS NGOYE:  And Chair the other contract that we wanted to review is 
what I refer to as the Phase 1 of the tender that Siyangena was 
appointed for.  And in… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry before you get to Phase 1 if you followed 
your affidavit Ms Ngoye it is going to help because your affidavit I am 
talking about your SS7C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must say if you need assistance. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  I need assistance Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody can assist you. 
MS NGOYE:  I think – I am not sure if I have got these files properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let somebody will come there. 
MS NGOYE:  SS7.  Will you help me?  May I ask Counsel are you 
referring to the affidavit? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  To the affidavit … 
MS NGOYE:  The supplementary affidavit? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Okay.  Not confuse myself because referring to the 
20 
application ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    I said I will refer to that as the founding affidavit 
and I will refer to the one you are now looking at as the supplementary 
one. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 20 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:    Okay, so we deal with the supplementary one? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Yes. 
MS NGOYE:    I am with you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Now if you look at paragraph 9 in paragraph 9 
you raise a number of matters in regard to the extension of the 
contract, ...[indistinct] pointing out the irregularities? 
MS NGOYE:    Yes Chair, the extensions I thought I said that the 
extensions were obviously not – did not follow process in terms of you 
know what needs to be done when procurement of services is required, 
so they were irregular indeed and this was what was found. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, I am sorry, I may be the one who is lost 
now, I am looking at paragraph 9 in – at page 388, is that where we all 
are? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Yes that is where we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Ms Ngoye in that right in the middle of that 
paragraph you say second, you make an important point there, what is 
that point? 
MS NGOYE:    In paragraph 9. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Paragraph 10 
20 
MS NGOYE:    Okay.  First it is not procurement, second Siyangena had 
not been the original contractor but only a sub-contractor, the 
extension has no legal basis because there was no privity of contract 
between Sengena and/or Intersite or PRASA so effectively Chair in the 
CONFED Cup Sengena is a sub-contractor and then the extension to 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 21 of 211 
 
that pilot Siyangena is appointed even though they were sub-contracted 
to the first, so they were not even a party to those contracts that were 
entered into with PRASA in relation to the CONFED Cup stations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the contract was with one entity and Sengena was 
a sub-contractor to that entity. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when it came to the extension instead of doing 
an extension with the entity with whom – with which PRASA had a 
contract it did an extension with the sub-contractor? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Something that’s difficult to follow. 
MS NGOYE:   It doesn’t happen like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   Okay 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    But you make another point in that paragraph 
and you say what implied here the CONFED Pilot Contract was a 
contract between Intersite and Enzo and Rainbow am I right? 
MS NGOYE:    That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And in regard to the extent here who was – who 
were now the contracting parties. 
MS NGOYE:    In relation to the extension Chairperson PRASA was the 
20 
contracting party. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    But would that be proper and lawful?  
MS NGOYE:    Well Chair these stations belong to PRASA at the end of 
the day you know so effectively PRASA would be contracting party.   I 
guess when it went to Intersite, Intersite was the property management 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 22 of 211 
 
portfolio of PRASA, there again you know the rationale of taking these 
contracts through to Intersite was also something that was an issue 
Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    In paragraph 11 you point out that the Public 
Protector had dealt with this matter in her report, can you tell the 
Chairperson what that was? 
MS NGOYE:    Chairperson the Public Protector dealt with this in the 
Derailed Report, there’s two Derailed Reports, so the first derailed 
report that I guess Mr Malefa was referring to, that’s the one I am 
referring to, so the Public Protector had – you know was forwarded 
10 
information dealing with this particular contract. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Yes and she says that contract was worth 
R1.95billion. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair.    
So effectively what happened Chair with the Public Protector 
PRASA gave the Public Protector information not in respect of the 
stations that were expended so – and that is why the Public Protector 
then refers to an amount of R1.9billion.  That amount in fact was an 
amount in relation to a contract that was concluded in the Phase 1 of 
the transactions that we concluded with PRASA so there was that you 
20 
know misrepresentation that was made to the Public Protector by 
PRASA and that is why she makes that finding, but when you look at 
what the Public Protector was given to deal with is the extension which 
she found to be irregular. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Just to put it in context, the pilot is extended, 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 23 of 211 
 
that is the matter that the Public Protector investigated? 
MS NGOYE:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And you say that the amount of that extension 
was not R1.95billion? 
MS NGOYE:    No it was not Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    But there is another contract where the amount 
is R1.95billion? 
MS NGOYE:    That is correct Chair, that’s right. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    You are going to come to that? 
MS NGOYE:    I will come to that one Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well tell me what is the correct number or the 
amount for the one where you say it is not the correct amount? 
MS NGOYE:   I am not actually sure what the number is, we could 
never pick up what the number is of the seven, it ranges between 
800million Chair and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is less than the ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:   It is less than, it definitely is because this increase I 
mean extension related to seven stations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   So the other one of one billion is more stations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Chairperson just because Ms Ngoye has 
mentioned 800million you will remember the Public Protector in her 
report says the complaint was it was 800 – the extension was 
800million but she says in effect it was R1,95billion so if she had been 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 24 of 211 
 
given the correct information you would have come to the correct 
conclusion that the amount of that extension was R800million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Alright, then you’re saying that in fact that refers 
to the Phase one, now in regard to the extension in paragraph 12 you 
deal with the problems that you think ...[indistinct] the award of the 
extension.    
MS NGOYE:    That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Could you tell the Chairperson what those are? 
MS NGOYE:    Chairperson in this paragraph I highlight in respect of 
10 
the Sengena proposal how Mr Gantshu, I have referred to Mr Gantshu 
before, had indicated you know to Mr Montana that you know Sengena’s 
price was too excessive it didn’t comply really with the specifications 
that we required you now for the gates that we were looking for and 
also the gates that Sengena was going to provide to PRASA were not 
suitable, and he raises these issues in any event in relation to that 
extension. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Can I ask you to please look at the founding 
affidavit at page 389, this is SA7B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a different affidavit from the one we have 
20 
been looking at? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson I am looking at the founding affidavit 
and the review application. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is in another bundle. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That’s in Bundle B, sorry Bundle E. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 25 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   E? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, sorry, Bundle B Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   B for Beatrix, Bundle D or Bundle BA, ja okay. 
MS NGOYE:    What page counsel? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    (Inaudible – microphone off) 
MS NGOYE:    167. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, 126, page 126? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    167 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   167, oh but that’s the one starting at 126 I guess. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    That’s right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   167. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson if I could explain if it is going to be 
confusing then I needn’t do it, I am just conducting this exercise so that 
you can navigate yourself between the supplementary affidavit and the 
founding affidavit when you are considering the whole matter, so I am 
just trying – but if it is going to be confusing we can just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no it is not confusing.   167? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, at paragraph 17.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Have you got it? 
20 
MS NGOYE:    No, I don’t have it, I think I am not looking at the right 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay page 167. 
MS NGOYE:   Did you say SS7? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    No, SS3.  Have you got that Ms Ngoye? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 26 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:    I do. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Now will you refer the Chairperson to those 
paragraphs, or to those sub-paragraphs in which Mr Gantshu expresses 
concerns about the extension? 
MS NGOYE:    It’s paragraph 17.6 Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And what does he say there? 
MS NGOYE:    He sent an email to Mr Montana and in that paragraph3 
he says after interrogating the operation methods and comparing with 
other install gates elsewhere in the world it turns out that these gates 
were not suitable. 
10 
 
He goes on in paragraph he said in our efforts to centralise 
this procurement we approached ESS. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And who is ESS? 
MS NGOYE:    ESS is a group of companies – is part of a group of 
companies that belong to TMM Holdings.  Now TMM Holdings was the 
main company and Siyangena and ESS were subsidiaries to that 
company.   It says to provide PRASA with a quotation to supply all the 
2010 stations.  It turned out that their gates are fully imported and very 
expensive.  So he says that in that letter and then the third issue that 
he raises is that in an unnumbered paragraph of that letter we referred 
20 
to he says that they were not budgeted for in the original scope. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Alright, thereafter you point out in paragraph 13 
that there was a change in heart, what – how did that come about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that’s paragraph of? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, of the supplementary affidavit Chairperson. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 27 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS NGOYE:    Well in the supplementary Chair I state that following 
that telephone call which – with Mr Montana that Mr Guntsha made you 
know he requested Mr Montana to approve the extension, so even 
though you know those issues were there he still made the request for 
the extension to be approved. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    If I could just stop you there, that change of 
heart came about as a result of what?   Of that telephone call was it 
not? 
MS NGOYE:    Yes of course, yes it was the telephone call that he had 
10 
had with Mr Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And based on that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am sorry why do you say it was a result of the 
telephone call? 
MS NGOYE:    Chairperson because before you know the letter that he 
writes he highlights all these issues and you know after making the call 
to Mr Montana you know based on what he said there was a change of 
heart. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am asking is whether are you basing 
that on what somebody said or ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS NGOYE:   It is just part of the evidence that we were able to get 
Chairperson in relation to the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh from the ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:   From the investigations Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you will talk to ...[intervenes]  
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 28 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Mr Gantsho yes with reference to the papers Chair 
that telephone discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure that I know what the basis is 
for saying that. 
MS NGOYE:   Chair perhaps I must also state that because this matter 
is before Court, obviously we’re just bringing it to the Commission just 
to highlight the irregularities that are there and this was the subject of 
the forensic investigation that was conducted, so a lot of the 
information that is available to PRASA in relation to these matters was 
obtained through the forensic investigation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that’s fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Just in relation to the Chairperson’s question 
about why do you say there is a telephone call can I ask you to look at 
page 168 now of your founding affidavit, paragraph 17.71. 
MS NGOYE:    Chairperson that paragraph reads that Mr Gantsho 
refers to a telephone discussion with Mr Montana during which Mr 
Montana advised him that the contract with Siyangena for the extension 
on the basis that Siyangena was contracted and installing similar 
systems at NASREC and Doornfontein, stations under the Intersite 
contract.   
20 
 
So this is information that we were able to piece together so in 
his email I guess he speaks to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, thank you Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    So Mr Gantsha now is in favour of the extension 
as a result of this telephone call, or according to him as a result of this 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 29 of 211 
 
telephone call, according to him as a result of this telephone call with 
Mr Montana, what happens next, you set that out in paragraph 14. 
MS NGOYE:    Well three days later Chairperson you know Mr Montana 
approves the request, but he approves it subject to you know the matter 
being referred to finance for budgetary purposes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And in respect of finance’s attitude what was, 
what did your investigations reveal? 
MS NGOYE:    Chairperson these matters were not budgeted for, in fact 
one of the executives that was responsible for the strategic asset 
development side of – within PRASA –raised a number of questions. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Who was that executive? 
MS NGOYE:    It was Mr Piet Sibola. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And where do you highlight that in your founding 
affidavit? 
MS NGOYE:    In paragraph 17, 16 Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    At page 174 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 17? 
MS NGOYE:    16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   16, at page 174, let’s complete the reference Mr Soni 
for purposes of the transcription. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Oh sorry, yes it is SS3D page 174 paragraph 
17.16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV VAS SONIC SC:   And we needn’t go into all of them with you, just 
summarise what the main ones were please Ms Ngoye. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 30 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:    Chairperson Mr Sibola raised issues around you know 
non-compliance for instance with the CIDB process and that Siyangena 
did not comply with it, you know raised the issues around the 
procurement process and raised the issues of there not being budget, 
in relation to this matter and also you know the fact that this type of 
contract would be a BBB contract which would warrant PRASA to 
comply with legislation really in relation to entering in these types of 
contract. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    In fact in regard to the CIDB non-compliance he 
goes further, he says Siyangena was not certified. 
10 
MS NGOYE:    That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Now these were the concerns that Mr Sibola 
raised, what – how were these concerns addressed if you look at 
paragraph 16 of your supplementary affidavit you deal with it there. 
MS NGOYE:    Chair the concerns were raised at Head Office, at 
PRASA, but however because these were not finalised at PRASA it was 
then decided to refer the matter to Intersite which is a subsidiary of 
PRASA so that decision making process was then removed from PRASA 
itself and given to Intersite for Intersite to continue with the process. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Why do you think that happened? 
20 
MS NGOYE:    Well Chair I mean clearly there was no support you know 
of this particular contract you know at PRASA and I guess in my 
observation really when one looks at this is around the fact that you 
know because processes were not going to be followed somebody else 
must deal with it, so it was trying to move away from really having to 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 31 of 211 
 
deal with the issues that were raised by people at PRASA and giving in 
to Intersite because the instruction to Intersite could then be coming 
from Head Office. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    You will recall yesterday when you gave 
evidence in regard to the Strawberry Worx matter. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes I do Chair.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:    You remember there was a dispute about where 
the contract should rest and they had, you were then the CEO of 
Intersite and you said that they threatened that they were going to take 
the matter from Intersite to PRASA? 
10 
MS NGOYE:    That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And they did that? 
MS NGOYE:    That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Is this a similar manoeuvre in the opposite 
direction?   I am just asking if that is the analogy that one can draw? 
MS NGOYE:    I think it is Chair, you know if it doesn’t work here move 
it there, and allow those ones to continue with it, because I think for 
me also what I understood is that you know Intersite being a subsidiary 
and you will recall I did indicate that Mr Montana was the Chairperson 
at Intersite, you know and the fact that challenging Mr Montana was 
20 
really an issue at PRASA, you know so moving those things across to 
Intersite, the instruction across to Intersite would have then you know 
meant that he has also you know ...[indistinct] over them to deal with 
the contract. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What is the next development thereafter, now that 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 32 of 211 
 
the matter is moved to Intersite? 
MS NGOYE:   Well we’ve got a Mr Jabulani Sendani who worked at 
Intersite, so he then made the submission you know for these 
contracts, for this process to be concluded at Intersite but we had an – 
and had requested a Mr Kulu Nxuba to approve these contracts, the 
submission of these contracts for on statement to the Group CEO.  
 
When Mr Nxuba refused to do that, he refused on the basis 
that the amount involved was even about you know the CEO of Intersite 
and he needed permission from the Board of Intersite. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And was such permission granted? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   No Chair there was no – we couldn’t find anything that 
showed that you know the Board even granted permission for these 
contracts to be concluded. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As far as you – the information at your disposal is 
there was no Board approval for that? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But what nevertheless happened? 
MS NGOYE:   Well the contracts were entered into, Sengena was then 
you know “given the tender” and they proceeded with the stations. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in paragraph 17 of your affidavit – I mean of 
20 
your founding affidavit, that’s in the review application you frequently 
make reference to the role played by Mr Gantsho, is that correct? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And why is that, why do you refer to that in 
paragraph 17 of your founding affidavit? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 33 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Chair Mr Gantsho was the one that was really 
championing you know this matter, so he was the one that you know 
was making sure that this – as you recall he spoke to Mr Montana and 
convinced Mr Montana to allow PRASA to enter into these agreements, 
so one could safely say that because he championed this process and 
that’s why there’s a lot of reference to him in the documentation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And of course you refer later in your affidavit to 
Mr Gantsho again. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then that was the extension of the pilot phase. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That’s one set of contracts, the pilot phase and 
then the extension. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What is the next contract that is concluded in 
relation or between PRASA and Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:   This is what we call phase one of the projects Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what did that entail? 
MS NGOYE:   It also turned to be a once again a contract that was 
given to Siyangena in relation to 69 stations of PRASA. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So originally there were seven, Doringfontein plus 
five and then you say 69 would then that be an extension to 62 
stations? 
MS NGOYE:   Well no Chair, remember the – yes, yes you are correct, 
you are correct, so it’s the nine that happened, because the two was 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 34 of 211 
 
Nasrec and Doringfontein and then the seven was the one that related 
to the extension of the pilot phase and this one was phase one, it was 
an extension of yes those two, so the 69 included that seven that was 
referred to above. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Can I just again start off with you have the pilot 
phase or two, Doringfontein and Nasrec. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Siyangena is not a party to those contracts.    
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then it’s extended to seven, Siyangena is a party 
10 
to that. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That then is now extended to 69, or to a further 
62. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So these further extensions originate from the 
contract which Siyangena was not a party. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair if you look at it, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But Siyangena ends up being the direct beneficiary 
of extensions. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and to many train stations. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and what happened to the entity that had 
originally entered into the first contracts along these extensions, was it 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 35 of 211 
 
pushed aside, was it still going along, what was happening? 
MS NGOYE:   Well ...[indistinct] and Rainbow Chair were the 
companies that appointed Siyangena so they basically fell off the radar, 
one Siyangena you know was then introduced into the ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the sub-contractor took over? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   (laughing) ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Two becomes 69. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the original entity fell off completely, didn’t 
provide, as far as you know even any capacity that Siyangena might not 
have had to deal with so many train stations. 
MS NGOYE:   No it was not involved Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not involved. 
MS NGOYE:   So those two companies were not involved at all, once 
Siyangena came to the fore Siyangena became the main player with 
PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now how did it come about that Phase one was 
20 
implemented, you deal with that in paragraph 20? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair in relation to Phase one the CPO at the time, the 
Chief Procurement Officer at the time was a gentleman by the name of 
Mr Chris Nbata, he then gave instructions to a senior manager in the 
procurement space, Ms Mathiso Moshode to have that meeting with 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 36 of 211 
 
eight companies that had been identified to participate in this next 
phase of the project, so there was a briefing session that was held with 
eight companies that had been identified, and that is how the start of 
Phase one you know comes about. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And how was that process managed, the 
restricted process, well before I get to that was that an legitimate way 
of extending a contract? 
MS NGOYE:   No it was not Chair because you know when the – what 
we picked up was when those eight companies were in the meeting 
naturally they asked for an RFP, a request for proposal document, and 
10 
when Ms Moshode, remember Ms Moshode is given instructions by the 
boss to say this is a meeting, go chair this meeting and with these 
eight companies in relation to this next phase of the project, so when 
she enquires or they, the companies that had been invited, enquires 
about the document, the RFP whether it was issued or not, and when 
Ms Moshode, because she wouldn’t have known, enquired whether 
there was an RFP document it came out that there clearly wasn’t an 
RFP document that was present, so from a process perspective Chair it 
just shows that you know no process was followed in that respect, 
that’s not how you do these type of transactions. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Can I just understand it, and it is not entirely 
clear and I know you will explain later that you had a limited set of 
documents, but as you understand what unfolded is that instead of an 
RFP being issued out to the world as it were it was – an invitation was 
sent to just eight companies? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 37 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Is there any indication of how those eight 
companies were chosen? 
MS NGOYE:  I cannot remember Chair how that invitation came about, 
so I am not really ...[indistinct] to that.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But if proper procurement processes had been 
followed what was the process that should have been followed? 
MS NGOYE:   Well Chair the normal process would be to invite people, 
you know you advertise the tender so that you can have participants 
you know coming through and responding to the tender that you would 
10 
have invited, you would have you know advertised but because there 
was no tender that was advertised so we didn’t have the RFP that those 
suppliers, the eight were looking for, so there were stages missing in 
the process. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, the Ms Mashudi can’t find the RFP whom 
does she go to, to locate the RFP? 
MS NGOYE:   Ms Mashudi then goes to Mr Gantshu to ask for the RFP. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what does Mr Gantshu do? 
MS NGOYE:   Well Mr Gantshu then asked Ms Mashodi to actually 
request those companies that had been invited to propose a best 
20 
solution for PRASA, so once again you can see things are done you 
know backward, they are not done properly, so in that process that’s 
where you then ask the companies to you now propose a best solution 
for PRASA, you just don’t do things like that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am just trying to understand then, I understand

you say it is not processed but what would this whole enterprise about?   
I mean PRASA wants to now enter Phase one, ordinarily it should send 
out an RFP outlining what work it needs to be done, what the 
approximate cost is going to be and so on, but in this case it sought 
information from the eight people whom he had chosen. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And is such a procedure countenanced by any 
aspect of PRASA or PRASA’s procurement ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:   It is not compliant Chair, it does not comply with our 
processes, our SEM processes, so clearly from that prospective that 
10 
process as granted.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now what eventually happened, so companies are 
asked to deal with this matter, or well to produce solutions, what then 
happens? 
MS NGOYE:   They do produce the solutions Chair and a bid evaluation 
committee is then set up to evaluate the responses that came from 
these companies, effectively they sat for two days in December 2010.    
 
Chair I think one of the things that one must mention, which is 
important, is that you will recall this particular process was intended to 
deal with those stations for the 2010 World Cup and when you look at 
20 
when it happened, this thing happened long after the 2020 World Cup 
had finished. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you say – when you look at – what period are 
you looking, do you look at paragraph 21? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct, that’s from the bid evaluation committee, 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 39 of 211 
 
so from a process perspective after receiving the documentation the bid 
evaluation will then evaluate the responses that come from the 
respective bidders. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And just for the record when was the World Cup?    
MS NGOYE:   June 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the point you were making about when you said 
let’s look at when this happened, and saying when what it was for was 
the point you were seeking to make that the need, for this head 
following away in the light of the fact that the World Cup had come and 
gone. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the point you are making? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct, in terms of also my following procedure, 
but the argument that could be put forward was there was urgency 
around the person, that’s how you knew to confine the process to eight 
companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS NGOYE:   But when you look at what then happened it clearly did 
not serve the purpose of dealing with the stations that were required 
for the 2010 walk-on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the position be that even though originally the 
idea may have been to do this for the World Cup when it may have 
become clear that it wasn’t going to be ready before the World Cup, it 
was proceeded with in any event on the basis that it would be helpful to 
PRASA anyway? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 40 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair I think that was the ultimate intention, to 
proceed anyway with this but also Chair I think from a process 
perspective within PRASA the planning has got to be done properly, the 
budgeting has got to be done properly for this type of work to be 
undertaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS NGOYE:   And none of that you know had happened and that’s we 
still have partially done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you see I am asking these questions so that I 
appreciate the point you see to make.   One point would be the need 
10 
had fallen away ...[intervenes]  
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...therefore there was no need for them to proceed 
with this project once it was clear that it wasn’t going to be ready  for 
the World cup, that’s one point. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Another point would be to say either in addition to 
the first point or as a standalone point to say processes that ordinarily 
would have to be followed for this to be done, whether for the World 
Cup or not for the, were not followed because it was said it is for the 
20 
World Cup based on urgency but once it became clear that this was not 
going to be ready for the World Cup then it shouldn’t have been 
proceeded with because then there was no need or basis to justify 
...[indistinct] processes if it was now being done just for PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 41 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You make both points? 
MS NGOYE:   Both points Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson I see it is just quarter past eleven 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, let us take the tea adjournment, we will 
resume at half past eleven, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson.  Now Miss Ngoye we 
were at the stage where you say the BEC had met in regard to this 
contract.  What was their decision? 
MS NGOYE:   Chairperson the BEC had decided to proceed with the with 
– with the appointment of Siyagena and they would have to refer that to 
the BEC you know for recommendation then to Mr Montana and then to 
the Board.   
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well if you look at what you said at paragraph 21, 
you – you just, what – what did they say there?   
MS NGOYE:   Well Mr Montana at paragraph 21 I did show that this is 
when the BAC the BEC sat but I guess when the recommendation was 
given to Mr Montana he decided he does not want to proceed with – with 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 42 of 211 
 
the process anymore and once again you know it shows in the papers that 
Mr Gansho you know was relentless.  He just effectively assured the team 
not to be discouraged and he would do something about it.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Chair we have a situation, sorry Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I may as well just say this for what it is worth, the 
name Siyangena is interesting but I do note that it is not Siyabangena.   
MS NGOYE:   It is angena Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Those who understand Isizulu and the current township 
language will have a certain connotation I think Mr Soni understands it to 
but if not somebody will explain and it is quiet interesting in the context 
10 
of what happened here the name here, okay yes.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:    So, we have a situation where Mr Montana says no 
you are not to proceed.   
MS NGOYE:    That is correct Chair.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Then Mr Gansho assures the team, what - how did 
that come about? 
MS NGOYE:   Well Chair effectively the discussions that were held 
between Mr Montana and Mr Gansho around that the time resulted in a 
change of heart, I think he was sure you know Mr Gansho that you know 
after speaking to Mr Montana, Mr Montana would change his mind 
20 
because as I said initially he championed this course so I think he needed 
to see it to finality.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And the point I am trying to make here Miss Ngoye 
one if the reasons that the procurement system, any procurement system 
has a whole series of decision makers, for example an inter analysis 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 43 of 211 
 
would be done by the department in the BEC and then the BAC, would 
mean that each of these, each of them has a particular role to play and 
their decisions would be all fundamental to a fair process.   
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And what does Mr Gansho’s assurance to the team 
on whatever that means what – what does that do to that process?   
MS NGOYE:   Well it inter fears with the process Chair, you know and I 
cannot also explain or understand why actually after the BEC had looked 
at the – at the responses that came from the various bidders that Mr 
Montana had to be consulted, because invariably from the BEC the 
10 
process would go to the BAC and then if it is within his limit, authority 
wise he would then be able to say yay or nay.  So, you know this 
consultation with Mr Montana after having decided that we are going to go 
through with this process, just did not make sense.  It just shows you that 
no proper processes were followed in this regard.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Well let me suggest something else and it is not  a 
question of just making sense, it means if I am going to make this 
suggestion to you and tell me if you agree.  Did the entire process in 
subverted  
MS NGOYE:   Of course, it is.  It is subverted 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Now that was on the in December 2010.  What 
happens next? 
MS NGOYE:   Chairperson as part of the processes as I explained from 
BEC which is the Bid Evaluation Committee you will go to the BAC which 
is the Bid Adjudication Committee it is the committee that will then work 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 44 of 211 
 
out the submission from the- from the BEC.  When the BEC- BAC sat on 
the 14 t h of February all of sudden there was a revival  
CHAIRPERSON:   2011 [intervenes].  
MS NGOYE:   2011 Chair that matter suddenly came back to life.  Mr 
Montana refuses it from the BEC side but where the BAC sits in 2011 you 
– you find that the period the matter had come to life because they- they 
made a submission to the BAC for the conciliation.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Gansho reassurance then has some basis? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, he clearly knew what he was doing. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now what did the – excuse me Chair.  What did the 
10 
BAC then decide? 
MS NGOYE:   Chairperson the BAC had a problem dealing with the 
submissions that was made by the – by the BEC, a lot of questions that 
were asked by the BAC in fact in a nutshell you know they did not agree 
with the process issues are wrong, budget issues around you know why 
not going out to a formal tender process were raised by the BAC during 
that time so effectively there was no support of the submission by the 
BEC to the BAC and also at the time what was referred to the BAC was 
that there was a contest between now Siyagena and Protea a company 
called Protea – Protea Coin.   
20 
 
Now if you look at what was involved Chairperson from a pricing 
perspective you know it was odd that the – the – the - the submission that 
was made by Protea was sitting at 1.3 billion in relation to this particular 
transaction and but when you look and I will go into that evidence 
Chairperson ultimately what was awarded for Siyagena the maths – the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 45 of 211 
 
numbers never lie.  I mean clearly Protea Coin should have been the 
successful party if you look at the number that was ultimately forded to 
Siyagena in relation to this process.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Now a submission was made to the BAC and what 
was that submission? 
MS NGOYE:   That submission was really the effectively the – the –the 
from the BEC to request that they consider the appointment of Siyagena. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    And were they to make a recommendation to some 
MS NGOYE:   Yes so after the BAC, the BAC would then recommend the – 
the – the transaction to the FCIP which is there Finance Capital 
10 
Investment Committee of the Board so from that process it went from a 
subcommittee of the Board.  So that is the recommendation they would 
have made to the Board as the BAC 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    But the BAC in any case took a decision in what 
was its decision you deal with it paragraph 23 
MS NGOYE:   Chair yes in paragraph 23 I do point out that what was 
submitted to the FCIP was the proposal to Siyagena to the value of 1.9 -
1.1billion rand for the entire transaction so this is what the BA –the FCIP 
had to consider. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Well if you look at the third line of paragraph 23 
20 
you –you if you could just read that the next sentence into the record 
starting with having deliberated 
MS NGOYE:   Reads into the record. 
“Having deliberated on this submission the BAC 
decided not to recommend the award to Siyagena 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 46 of 211 
 
however PRASA documents show a document with a 
signature that purports to be that of the Chairperson 
of the BAC Miss Taran Ngubani in a minute of the 
BAC that records the decision recommending the 
award to Siyagena for an amount of 1.1 billion” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    What are you-you trying to suggest with –with that 
Miss Ngoye that from your –your founding affidavit and in the review 
application 
MS NGOYE:   Once again Chair you know if it does not pass master it 
should not proceed.  Now if the FCIP had decided not to recommend this 
10 
particular issue to –to-to the Board for approval because when they 
considered the submission they said they decided that not to recommend 
the – the submission they received from the BAC was that the 
appointment should not be made in favour of.  But what then happened 
Chair I guess I must continue, and I refer to this minute of that was 
purported and I say purported because [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry maybe there is some mistake in paragraph 
23.  Or unless I am confused.  The submission requested BAC to 
recommend to the FCIP the appointment of Siyagena for the project 
called ISAMS for a tender of 1.1 billion rand and for a period of five 
20 
months.  Having deliberated on the submission the BAC decided not to 
recommend the award to Siyagena or the possible appointment.  So, it is 
not at – at FCIP level as yet, at that stage. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, okay. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 47 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   So when the BAC said because of the issues they had 
raised and the concerns that came from that meeting they decided not to 
recommend it to the BAC and that is how I refer to this minute which is 
purportedly signed by Miss Taran Ngubani because there were issues 
around that minute because also that minute came long after the matter 
was referred to the FCIP by Mr Mbata. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Could you- could you expressly tell the 
Chairperson what you are trying to say the BAC makes a decision not to 
recommend.  
MS NGOYE:   They do Chair, they make [intervenes]. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    But what is – what is the minute what does the 
minute of that meeting record? 
MS NGOYE:   The minute of the meeting Chairperson according which - 
according to the evidence we have was not even signed at the time by the 
Chairperson.  This is Miss Taran Ngubani and what became evident you 
know through the investigation process was it was very clear that the BAC 
does not agree that this process must be completed.  So you know and 
that is why I talk to the purported minute that was now signed that had a 
signature that was signed by Miss Taran Ngubani which she obviously 
then you know objected to and said it was not her signature as part of the 
20 
investigation process that we did.  So clearly from the process 
perspective the BAC had decided we are not going to recommend this 
thing to – to -to the FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you said the minutes of the Board –of the BAC. 
MS NGOYE:   Of the BAC ...[intervenes].  
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 48 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were not signed? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if that is the case how do you know what their 
decision was? 
MS NGOYE:   Well we have got a copy of those minutes Chair and there 
was a record a recording of [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have a recording? 
MS NGOYE:   That is it  
CHAIRPERSON:   So, when you listen to the recording it is quite clear 
that [intervenes]. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   It is very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MS NGOYE:   It was very clear 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then the recording has been transcribed. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay but in –in in at some stage a document was 
discovered that appeared to be signed by the Chairperson [intervenes].  
MS NGOYE:   By the Chairperson, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Suggesting that the BAC had decided that Siyagena 
should be awarded. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say in the stations seems to have suggested 
that the then Chairperson of the BAC said she had not signed. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 49 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So, the minute was in fact a forgery for falsely 
representation. 
MS NGOYE:   That is what Miss Taran Ngubani effectively says in – in 
another proceeding where she was asked to explain you know the 
existence of that minute.  She indicated her signature was forged and she 
had never signed that minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it established did PRASA conduct any other 
investigation to establish whether that was true? 
MS NGOYE:   Well Chair I do not think it went further than that because 
as part of the –the –the process that PRASA was conducting at the time.  
10 
Miss Taran Ngubani then decided not to you know proceed with the 
hearings [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   And to resign.  So PRASA did not follow through and check 
up on that valid- the validity of that signature so we did not do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now if I could just deal with that issue and I know 
that it is not immediately here.  If the contention allegation is that the 
minutes were forged clearly a crime had been committed. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Has this matter been reported to the Police well this 
and other matters relating to this contract? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair this matter and everything that has transpired as 
far as you know the –the -the mallard ministration of this and 
noncompliance with processes has been reported. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 50 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well if it is reported to the Police it would have to 
be beyond mallard ministration.  It would have to be criminal conduct 
[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   It would be fraud as well and so on yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, now was that reported to the Police? 
MS NGOYE:   It was reported Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what – what is the outcome of those Police 
investigations? 
MS NGOYE:   Well Chair there has not been much really that has come 
from the Police side in relation to the matters that we have referred to 
10 
you know through PRECCA you know for instance matters to the Hawks 
and I cannot remember if Doctor Motana gave evidence to the fact that 
you know  [intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Doctor Molefe. 
MS NGOYE:   I mean Doctor Molefe gave evidence to the fact that a lot of 
work that was done and referred for investigation there was no traction 
really effectively to that.  And that is why he then had to also you know 
sue the DCPI for –for work not done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And well knowing who –knowing who did that signature 
20 
on that document that purported to be that of the Chairperson might throw 
light on who wanted what but I accept that maybe for PRASA’s purposes 
once the Chairperson says it is not my signature then they may have said 
well then nobody can claim that such a decision was taken if the person if 
the Chairperson says it is not her signature. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 51 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then it may well be that from our side or our place 
we do not – we do not need to do anything about it but it may well be that 
it is something that could throw light if it was to be known who’s – who 
had put in that signature. 
MS NGOYE:   Chair perhaps I can help by saying that in the –the 
disciplinary proceedings that Miss Taran Ngubani had to go through.  She 
makes an allegation that her signature was forged by Mr Chris Mbata that 
is what she alleges in that proceeding [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   and perhaps maybe the papers relating to that proceeding 
maybe helpful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   As well as the commissions so that you can see what the 
Chairperson of the BAC says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes –no –no I think that would be important and if that 
is the allegation and given the role that Mr Mbata I think seems to have 
played it might be important to establish whether indeed it is Mr Mbata 
who purported to forge the Chairperson signature.  So obviously they 
ought to be documents that have Mr Mbata’s signature at PRASA and a 
20 
comparison of signatures and expert and writing expert is it could throw 
light okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So, the next step in this process is what 
Miss Ngoye? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 52 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  In the proceedings that you have referred 
to in which you say Miss Ngubani alleged that it was Mr Mbata who had 
forged his – her signature and do you know whether she was saying that 
because she recognised that handwriting as that of Mr Mbata or whether 
she knew some more information about how that had happened. 
MS NGOYE:   Well I guess Chair during the proceedings Miss Ngubani 
really because Mr Mbata had played a major role really in also submitting 
these papers to the FCIP even after knowing that the BAC had not 
approved these things.  The submission that she believed that the only 
person that could have done that was Mr Mbata. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  I think with all this latest information I 
think something should be done to see whether or whose signature that 
was.  Thank you 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   From the BAC if the matter is to go forward which 
committee would it go? 
MS NGOYE:   It would have to go to the FCIP Chair.  So maybe I could 
also put some light into – into effectively what had happened.  The 14t h of 
February the BAC sits and does not recommend this thing in fact they 
raise a whole lot of questions and the expectation would be Mr Mbata 
would go back to the BAC after having resolved the issues that were 
20 
raised by the BAC but this did not happen.  Three days later on the 17 t h 
of February you know the FCIP sits and Mr Mbata then submits this 
proposal to the FCIP for recommendation to the Board but you know it 
had not been approved there and there was not a further meeting of the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 53 of 211 
 
BAC that would have allowed Mr Mbata to do that but what we found is 
that three days later on the 17 t h this matter sits before the FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is interesting.  So, you say that if the BAC 
refuses or refused as it refused to make a decision that Siyagena even be 
awarded contract.  The matter should have not gone to a [intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   FCIP.  
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whoever was sponsoring the matter I use the term 
Mr Mbata in this case.  He should have gone back to the BEC 
10 
[intervenes].  
MS NGOYE:   The BAC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The BAC after attending the queries. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so that is [intervenes].  
MS NGOYE:   That will raise ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   What should happen? 
MS NGOYE:   That is it because [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he is able to attend to them [intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And rectify the –the –the whatever errors maybe there. 
MS NGOYE:   It cannot proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It cannot proceed. 
MS NGOYE:   Because the BAC said no.  
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 54 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he is able to in his view satisfactory attend to the 
queries and managing from the BAC would he then be entitled to later on 
have it placed before another meeting of the BAC for them to see whether 
now they can make a proper decision.  
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That- that is what would happen. 
MS NGOYE:   Ja that is what would have to had happened because the 
BAC says no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   And raises questions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   Tell us where the battered is for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   And you know why have we not gone out to tender for 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   Such a big transaction he must have had to satisfy those 
issues first before he takes it to the FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now when a matter comes before the FCIP would not 
the FCIP normally require proof that the BAC has made the right decision 
20 
the recommendation that makes it necessary for the matter to come 
before the FCIP. 
MS NGOYE:   It would have to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would have to? 
MS NGOYE:   It would have to. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 55 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because 
they 
are 
supposed 
to 
look 
at 
the 
recommendation of the BAC. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is right. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if Mr Mbata within three days after the BAC 
refused placed the matter before the FCIP how would it have been 
possible in circumstances where there was no recommendation from the 
BAC. 
MS NGOYE:   Chair this is the issue of that minute.  Remember when the 
10 
Chairperson of the BAC signs off on a minute that – that supports the 
appointment of -of -of Siyagena then you know it give credence to the 
matter being referred now to the FCIP.  So in the report that Mr Mbata as 
the CPO would make – they would have attach what transpired at the BAC 
and then the-the the FCIP would then consider all the information they 
have get given in the report that would have been prepared by Mr Mbata. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in the position that Mr Mbata placed before the 
FCIP this minute that is alleged to have been got and suggested that the 
BAC had decided to recommend Siyagena. 
MS NGOYE:   It is only explanation Chair so he - he yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   Because otherwise the FCIP would not have [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would not have entertained the matter. 
MS NGOYE:   Ja, yes Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 56 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are – are you saying you the that document 
that is now alleged to have been forged was definitely placed before the 
FCIP. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   May I follow up with two questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We know that a document was presented to the 
FCIP that is the one that MR Mbata presented to them. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But that is the one that Miss Ngubani distances 
herself from.  She says that she did not sign that minutes. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I want to ask you a prior question and that is in 
regard to the meeting of the 14 t h the BAC meeting of the 14 t h of February. 
This–did Miss Ngubani say that the BAC had not in fact approved the – 
the award to Siyagena. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair in fact Miss Ngubani was very vocal if you listen 
to the recording she just did not take it in terms of the submissions that 
was made before the BAC she flatly refused because she – the questions 
20 
that you can hear from the recordings really showed that this is no the 
process that she was going to support. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So on any basis whatever was presented to the 
FCIP we can say safely here and in this commission so that the –the -the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 57 of 211 
 
BAC did not prove that the matter be sent to the FCIP contrary to what 
was said in that minute. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now the second issue and it arises from what 
Chairperson has said was.  Whilst there was this minute from the BAC to 
say look we – we think the award should be made to Siyagena but they 
had a different fiduciary duty they were not simply required to accept the 
recommendation of the BAC they were required to check all the processes 
before the matter came before the BAC and how the BAC handled the 
matter. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Chair you know the thing – the way things happened at 
PRASA that is simply the expectation.  You know that you satisfy yourself 
fully as to what as transpired but I guess in –in you know the way things 
work is that from the submission that was made by the BAC would not 
necessary also go backwards.  When it gets to the FCIP you know the 
FCIP will just you know saddle itself with what is before it.  I guess 
questions would be asked you know, you know what processes were there 
and so on and I guess what happened in this particular case was is that 
Board assumed you know that everything you know was in order but again 
Chair if you look at the amount of money that was involved it was an 
20 
amount that was way beyond the – the -the authority of the group CEO 
and I think I would like to make a submission that says for that type of 
matter to appear before a subcommittee of a Board before it was you 
know taken up to tender the Board would have had to approve that this 
particular transaction is taken out to tender so one would have expected 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 58 of 211 
 
that questions maybe asked to say what process was followed in this 
regard.  I do not think that happened. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, so they would have had to ask them if they 
were acting in terms of their fiduciary duties in terms of the PFMA being 
the – the accounting authority of –of PRASA that one would assume then 
that they would inquire as to why was this matter not before us prior to 
the process being stopped. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the from the information you have that was not. 
MS NGOYE:   No, it is evident Chair from what transpired that clearly that 
10 
did not happen. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Anyway, the matter is now before the FCIP as you 
say in paragraphs 24 and 25 in your affidavit what happens then? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair the submission that was made to the BAC, right was 
for Siyangena to be appointed and the value of the transaction was 1.1 
billion rand.  But when it went now to the FCIP the amount was increased 
to 1.9 billion rand.  So it was no longer that 1.1 that was shown to the 
BAC to consider.  So you can already see that there is no justification or 
explanation of why you would then have then produced an amount of 1.1 
to the BAC, you then go to the FCIP and hype it up to 1.9 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is about 8- and additional 800 million rand ... 
(intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just thrown in. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 59 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And having regard to the documents that were placed 
before the BAC and the documents that were placed before the FCIP, in 
what document does this change?  Is there an alteration in some 
document that was before the BAC, alteration of the number of the 
amount or is there a new document that was not before the BAC that is 
put into the documents that will go to the FCIP? 
MS NGOYE:  Chair the document that was placed before the BAC spoke 
to 1.1 so remember also that the BAC does not support the submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  So effectively it is a new document that then contains this 
10 
number of 1.9.  Which would have not been taken back to the BAC 
because all this happened 3 days after the BAC had given a clear 
indication that they are not going to support this process.  So it does 
show that a separate new document was then created which reflected the 
number 1.9 which is not what was taken to the BAC. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What was the number in the forged document?  
When I say number, what was the amount set out in the document that Ms 
Ngubane says is a forged document? 
MS NGOYE:  It is 1.9 Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So that document had not only wronged- I mean not 
20 
only misrepresented what the decision of the BAC was but also 
misrepresented the amount that the contract would be worth? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct.  Because if you look at the minutes Chair, 
the minute does not also capture what was in the recording.  So you can 
see there was alterations of things that were discussed there and it 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 60 of 211 
 
becomes evident that.  And also from the fact that Ms Tara Ngubane says, 
look I do not know this document it is not my signature that is on there, 
shows very well if it had been the minute of the BAC it would have 
reflected 1.1 billion because that is what was presented to them.  But 
because this document appears from somewhere with her signature and 
different information on there shows a clear misinterpretation that was 
then sent to the FCIP for consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it possible to get the documents- the set of 
documents that served before the BEC, the set of documents that served 
before the BAC and the set of documents that served before the FCIP?  
10 
You have got that somewhere at PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  We got- yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  If we can get those, it is basically all the levels, 
BEC, BAC, FCIP. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So one can have the- so I can have the documents in 
front of me I can see where the differences are in terms of what was 
placed before which level. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Are there an annexed to the affidavit in the founding 
of it? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, they will be part of the documents that support the 
review application Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It would be easy to access those Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  As long as we have got them. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 61 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the Commission. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now Ms Ngoye you also make a second point in 
paragraph 26 about an auditee in respect of what happened at the FCIP 
meeting on the 17 t h of February.  What is that? 
MS NGOYE:  Chair the other issue that comes up as part of the agenda 
item at the FCIP is the approval of the budget.  And what is reflected in 
there is an amount, for this specific project for instance in terms of the 
gates and security processes was an amount of 317 million that was 
allocated to this project, right.   
10 
 
So the same board considers this amount from a budgetary 
perspective but has approved a transaction the FCIP in fact recommends 
a transaction that is way above this amount that they would have 
considered as a budgetary amount for the MTF where this product was 
concerned.  So there is an anomaly there Chairperson.  Because clearly if 
you know that there is no budget for this you should not then entertain an 
amount that is greater than that which you have budgeted for.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  At the risk of perhaps being too pedantic, the same 
meeting indicates or approves an amount of 1,95 billion rand in respect of 
this contract. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And at some stage during that same meeting it is 
told that the budget is 317 million. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 62 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Would you be able if you were asked to explain that 
sort of anomaly? 
MS NGOYE:  I do not know if I can explain it.  It should not have 
happened.  I mean it is common sense I guess we won a sitting.   You 
have got to analyse these things properly and applying your mid you 
would have picked up that there is something amiss as far as this is 
concerned.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What we- you have highlighted some of the 
irregularities in regard to the matter before the FCIP.  And from the FCIP 
where would the matter go to next? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  The matter went to the board Chair.  So from the FCIP it 
goes to the board because the FCIP recommends to the board which then 
approves. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And the FCIP’s recommendation to the board was a 
contract at 1,95 billion rand. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct but the minutes does not show Chair, of the 
board meeting Chair, does not show the amount that the board reflected.  
So the minute, the board when it is taken there effectively it says to the 
team negotiate with Siyangena on this contract but it does not talk to the 
amount. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was before them ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  Was 1,9 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was 1.9? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 63 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if they said negotiate, they knew that they were 
saying negotiate in respect of 1.9? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they did not want the contract to be concluded at 
1.9 they would have said if- depending on what they meant when they say 
negotiate, one thing is they could be saying, negotiate a lower price or 
they could be saying negotiate everything and conclude a contract and we 
leave it up to you. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if they did not want the contract to be concluded on 
10 
the basis of 1.9 billion, they would have said, well negotiate but if the 
price does not come down to whatever with a figure, then do not sign. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  That is the expectation that one 
would have had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  When you look at these things in the manner in which they 
are supposed to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  So there is a clarity all the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if they said negotiate without putting any conditions 
in terms of what amount it means that they had no particular discomfort 
about a contract being concluded on the basis of that amount. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 64 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  But also Chair if you look at it, it is a huge amount.  It is 1.9 
... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is about 2 billion. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  But the- one would have expected that there is also a 
requesting when did the tender go out, all those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  It has to have been asked. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And ja, one does not ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also, the issue of the budget is it not? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we have budget for this? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the most obvious question. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as you say then they higher the amount then more 
cautious. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The board rule should be and the more it should ask 
probing questions. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And ask for documents and so on. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 65 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, I guess we- it will be important to get even 
the minutes of these various levels when laid out with this issue, BEC, 
BAC, FCIP and board.  So one gets a good picture because it is- there 
are strange versions. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to your evidence up to 9 regard to 
phase 1 ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Soni. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So the people who sit in the BEC, BAC and FCIP are 
officials of employees of PRASA, no board members sit there? 
MS NGOYE:  The BEC and the BAC are the employees of PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  The FCIP ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is a subcommittee of the board. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  It is a subcommittee of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  So it is only board members.  The management that goes to 
20 
the FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Would just be for purpose of presentation the matters to the 
FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 66 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  But they are not members of the FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well, I was asking that question because I was 
wondering whether somebody who may have sit at one of these levels 
would not pick up the discrepancy on the price when the matter came 
before the board.  But if board members were only at- advice at ... 
(intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  FCIP level and they were misled into thinking that this 
was the price that had already been attached to this project, they might 
not have any issues when it came before the board. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas if somebody who have sat at BAC level 
happened to be aware that this matter was before the board and saw the 
figure they will say, hang on, when this thing was before us the figure was 
1.1 so how do you explain this. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  It is very unfortunate Chair and I think what we picked 
up because of the anomalies that were happening in PRASA around the 
submission of documentation to the FCIP.  Because of these issues that 
the chairperson for instance on the FCIP is not the person that prepares 
the report that goes to the FCIP.  The report is prepared by the CPO the 
20 
Chief Procurement Officer and the chairperson of the FCIP does not have 
sight of what then is referred to the FCIP by the CPO.  So there is that 
missing link. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ordinarily the report that will go to the FCIP would 
have been prepared by the chairperson of the BAC. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 67 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  That- well, it should have been- that is not how it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is normally. 
MS NGOYE:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what happens normally? 
MS NGOYE:  That is it.  But it did not happen that way at PRASA.  It was 
the Chief Procurement Officer who prepared a report to the FCIP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But what I am trying to understand then you see 
you say at PRASA.  What I am trying to understand is what the practice 
was at PRASA generally?  And that what happened on this occasion was 
something that did not accord with practice at PRASA. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair, at PRASA in stead ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it always prepared by this ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  The CPO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Procurement- oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So we found out in other transactions Chair that 
were done where the board started questioning certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Well we then went back to the chair of this of the- 
CHAIRPERSON:  The FCIP. 
MS NGOYE:  The BAC. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The BAC, ja. 
MS NGOYE:  They would not necessarily agree.  I remember one matter 
yes when the chair of the BAC said, but that is not the report that I would 
have sanctioned as the chair of the BAC to go to the FCIP.  So that 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 68 of 211 
 
continuity was just not there.  So you have one person being in control of 
a particular process but you have another preparing a report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it is quite strange if it is referred to as a report of 
the BAC to the FCIP. 
MS NGOYE:  No it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is not prepared by the BAC or the chairperson of 
the BAC. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because actually it means it is not a report of the BAC.  
It means that someone ... (intervenes) 
10 
MS NGOYE:  It is the report of the CPO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This report of what the proceedings- how the 
proceedings were. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but that was PRASA practice? 
MS NGOYE:  Well that is how we did things Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now Mr Mbatha was the Chief Procurement Officer, 
is that correct? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  In that capacity would he be a member of any of the 
committees like the BEC or the BAC? 
MS NGOYE:  Well he- no.  He makes submissions.  So he would be the 
one that ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  He effectively sponsors. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 69 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  That is it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Things that comes before this committees. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And would he attend the BAC meeting? 
MS NGOYE:  He would have attended the BAC meeting Chair because ... 
(intervenes) 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  (indistinct) is not. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  That is it.  Because the questions that are posed would be 
posed to him.  So in this respect he was present at the BAC meeting. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And this highlights the anomaly raised by the 
Chairperson that the person who has an interest in why they are asking 
the BAC to sanction or reject a contract is the person who is then going 
to do the report for the FCIP. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in your evidence up to now relating to phase 1 
Ms Ngoye you have detailed the irregularities and so on.  In paragraph 28 
you summarise that.  Could you just summarise just so that we have a 
20 
sort of picture of how irregular the process was? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.  So effectively there was no open tender process.  
And there was not even a request to deviate from the open tender 
process.  There was no RFP and there were no evaluation criteria 
because that would be stated in the tender documentation.  So effectively 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 70 of 211 
 
bidders were asked to really make, I say a shot in the dark, and hope that 
PRASA would be happy with it.  And that is why I then earlier on refers to 
Protea Chair.  Protea Coin submitted a response, their amount was 1.3 
billion.  Now if you had then looked at the amount that was finally 
awarded 1.9, the award should have gone to Protea Coin because they 
were the cheaper ones.  But it did not it went to Siyangena. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what do you say about that in paragraph 28? 
MS NGOYE:  Protea- I did not mention that Protea Coin tendered the 
price of 1.3 billion which is must cheaper than Siyangena.  It lost because 
of a funding model that apparently is part of the submissions that 
10 
Siyangena made, it provided a funding model.  But that funding model 
was not a requirement that everybody knew they had to give this part of 
the responses they made to PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when you say Protea Coin tendered contract wise 
was 1.3 billion and it was much cheaper than Siyangena’s one.  You are 
comparing that price with 1.9? 
MS NGOYE:  That is 1.9 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  Because that was ultimately the amount that sat at the 
board at the FCIP. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But at- we know that at ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  BAC.  
CHAIRPERSON:  BEC level ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  And BAC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the prices would have been there.  Is that right? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 71 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do we know whether at BAC level all the prices 
would have been there and at FCIP and at the board? 
MS NGOYE:  All the prices would be there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been there. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, they would have had to be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Because you- as part of the reporting you then show who 
came where and so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  So because Siyangena was still competing ... 
10 
(intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Throughout the process with Protea Coin and so 
on. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Protea Coin’s price was there?  Siyangena’s price 
was there? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And basically, both at FCIP and the board level- the 
FCIP and the board had to look at 1.9 billion and 1.3 billion? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And on each- okay, in each case they chose 1.9 billion? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instead of 1.3 billion. 
MS NGOYE:  3, yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 72 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the minutes of these- of the FCIP and the board 
and I know Mr Soni might still have been planning to go there, is there- 
does the FCIP and does the board when the matter comes before it, deal 
with what justifies taking- giving the contract to Siyangena at 1.9 billion 
when Protea Coin is at 1.3? 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They do not? 
MS NGOYE:  No.   
CHAIRPERSON:  How is that possible? 
MS NGOYE:  It is not reflected on the minutes.  One would expect you 
10 
would see that in the minutes but the deliberations did not factor that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody said, but the difference in the price is so vast? 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether there was anything that 
Siyangena had put into the documentation that anybody could or that they 
sought to use to say, in case somebody else has a lower price well you 
will still be justified in awarding us the contract because of A B C D that 
they do not have and, ja? 
MS NGOYE:  This was the funding model that I referred to Chair.  So as 
part of their submission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Remember at the time PRASA was saying we do not even 
have money to run with this process? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 73 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  So they prepared a funding model which would then assist 
PRASA in carrying out this particular transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Protea Coin did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And with that benefit that they had furnished to PRASA, they 
were the ones that were considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Because Protea Coin really loses on the basis that there is 
no funding model. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And it- when you think about it, it does make sense that 
PRASA would have wanted somebody to suggest how we are going to 
fund this thing.  Because the evidence that has been given shows that 
there was no budget really for this so this funding model would have 
assisted the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm.  I may have missed this but the funding model, are 
we going to deal with it at some stage Mr- how beneficial was- what was- 
did it have real value to PRASA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now earlier in your affidavit, your supplementary 
affidavit the one you looking at, you made the point that nobody knew 
what a funding model was. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 74 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now just taking that into account and it seems to 
have played an important role in making the- in having the award made to 
Siyangena.  Effectively what did the funding model entail in respect of 
budget?  Because what we see is at PRASA 1,9 million rand as opposed 
to 1,3 million rand but to what extend did Siyangena fund anything for 
PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:  Well in the end it did not happen Chair.  When the whole 
process started it was clear that PRASA does not have money to 
undertake this project from a budgetary perspective.  So Siyangena then 
proposed to say, we will give you a funding model that would then assist 
10 
you guys in terms of carrying out this project.  But what happens in the 
end is that that funding model does not even play a role in fulfilling that 
contract that PRASA had entered into with Siyangena.  So they did not 
give money to PRASA as an example to assist PRASA with carrying out 
the project so that PRASA could then pay back at the time that they had 
the necessary monies.  So it was a proposal that was made by Siyangena 
right up front.  Remember this process is not proper Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I think what council is asking is, tell me the 
features of this funding model that Siyangena put forward.  I think you are 
talking at- you are talking about after the contract has been concluded 
20 
that ultimately, they did not deliver on the funding model.  But at the time 
they put- when it was simply a proposal, what was its important features 
MS NGOYE:  Well it is around how they would assist PRASA in funding 
the project.  So they would pay.  They would effectively ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will provisionally fund the project themselves. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 75 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  That is it.  And then they would be paid by PRASA when 
PRASA has got the sufficient funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Effectively they would lend PRASA money. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then later on when PRASA had money then PRASA 
would basically ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  Pay back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Refund them. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct.  Because at that time it was very clear that 
there is no money for this project. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  And that is one of the issues.  Remember Mr Gunjo 
had raised it up front that it had only been on the budget for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MS NGOYE:  And when you also look at the NTF amount that was put to 
the board of 317 million, it is way less than that was required for this 
project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that in- to the extend that they put up a funding 
model that is Siyangena, that they would have charged an interest for the 
loan. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  I am sure.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you get to know how much of the 1.9 billion 
award effectively have been interest and how much really would have 
been the capital? 
MS NGOYE:  Well Chair I do not think I would ... (intervenes) 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 76 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not. 
MS NGOYE:  Venture into that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  But when you look at what the BAC was settled on, it was 
an amount of 1.1 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  So that is what ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is with the funding model being part of the 
proposal, ja. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this extra 800 million was just thrown in? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what I think Mr Soni wanted and what I am 
interested in is, what it is in the proposal that in this funding model that 
may have been so attractive to the BAC members, no- the FCIP members 
and the board that they would think, it is fine that 800 million- additional 
800 million rand is fine.  We go with Siyangena not with Protea Coin.  But 
of course, I think one of the points you have been making is without a 
funding model there would be no project.   
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because PRASA did not have the money for this. 
MS NGOYE:  We did not have the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it seem therefore that either the board would say, we 
take the only party that has got a funding model or we do not proceed 
with this whole thing at all. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 77 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was- that was the choice. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Because the basis on which Siyangena really is the 
successful party is on the funding model. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  That is why I say when you compare the price of Protea 
Coin with that of Siyangena, ultimately that was presented for approval.  
Siyangena was much higher than Protea Coin.  The expectation that you 
10 
though had is the Protea Coin would then succeed because it was at 1.3 
billion and Siyangena’s price as reflected in the documentation that was 
sent to the FCIP was 1.9.  So the funding model would have helped been 
an advantage that the- Siyangena had.  But also remember Chair, the 
Protea Coin was not asked to provide a funding model so they did not 
know that they had to even provide a funding model.  The issue of the 
funding model was only known by Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no, I think I have missed that. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought they were all asked. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  No, Protea Coin was not aware that it had to provide a 
funding model in respect of its contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the only person who would have and should have 
made them aware, would have been Mr Mbatha? 
MS NGOYE:  The CPO together with Mr Gunjo. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 78 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Gunjo. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they did not. 
MS NGOYE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please Mr Chairperson.  One of the things 
that you referred to earlier and I asked you to please look at paragraph 
15 of the supplementary affidavit.  You might remember you referred to 
matters that Mr Sebola had raised.  One of the issues he raised is what 
was being considered was a public private partnership. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to public private partnerships I take 
it that there are different mechanisms or different procedures that 
would be followed if you are asking for the private sector to be involved 
with an organ of state in a particular contract? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  In terms of Treasury rules PRASA 
is a – is a Schedule 3B and take for instance Transnet is a Schedule 
2B.  So issues pertaining to public and private partnership PPP are 
specified to the Treasury Regulations in relation to entities falling 
within the Schedule 2B aspect and not 3B.  You know so PRASA could 
20 
never enter into public private partnerships.  Because also the process 
is very tedious.  I think when one looks at the regulations from National 
Treasury you understand that it is not – is not an easy process to follow 
and it is a process that really is run then by National Treasury because 
there is a lot of things that are involved in that process.  So PRASA is 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 79 of 211 
 
not allowed to enter into PPP’s. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And so if it chose Siyangena on the basis that it 
had provided a – a funding model it would in fact be entering into as 
public private partnership. 
MS NGOYE:  Well effectively yes you know and that is why Mr Sebola 
was concerned you know. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you finalise paragraph 28 Ms Ngoye with 
other points. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr Soni somebody will need to speak about 
this on the model and evaluate it in terms of its merits and demerits so 
10 
that one can see whether the FCIP and the Board in coming to the 
conclusion that they should award the contract to Siyangena and not 
Protea Coin they did nothing more than just act in good faith on what 
appeared to be a sensible decision to them or whether one is able to 
say but really with ease I saw features in this kind of model.  Nobody 
could in good faith have thought that this is the way to go. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry Ms Ngoye I am just then finalising your 
paragraph 28 and you say the – you talked about minutes being forged 
20 
could you tell the Chairperson what that is about? 
MS NGOYE:  These are the minutes Chair from the BAC that one 
speaks about.  You know the fact that the BAC minutes had not been 
signed but you then have a copy of the minutes that are now signed 
and this is obviously the allegation that Ms Tara Ngubane makes to say 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 80 of 211 
 
look I do not know anything about those minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So it is a clear indication that you know there was 
a forgery of the documentation that went to the XTIP.  But also in what 
we have seen in the evidence in relation to the minute of the Board 
where the Board does not specify an amount.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  But the excerpt that gets then prepared is prepared on the 
basis of the resolution of the Board having approved R1.9 billion.  This 
is what I am referring to and this is the evidence we were able to pick 
10 
up you know when we did the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So in addition to the BAC minutes being forged as 
indicated by Ms Ngubane there is evidence that there is a discrepancy 
between what the Board decided and the resolution – the written 
resolution? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you make the point that the minutes in 
respect of the budget were self-contradictory? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  I explained that you know say it is 
20 
317 it is R1.9.  I mean if you look at it in totality it does not make 
sense that you would approve a transaction of R1.9 billion when you 
have only a budget of R3.17. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So I am just asking and perhaps this – this may 
not be something you can answer.  The Board at that meeting says or 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 81 of 211 
 
the FCIP says we have only got R317 million but we are accepting the 
tender for R1.95 billion.  Did they in that indicate that this is because 
Siyangena has provided a funding model which allows us to overcome 
the budgetary constraint? 
MS NGOYE:  I guess one could explain it that way Chair if you really 
think about it because it just does not make sense that you – you know 
your budget is about 3. – 317 million and yet you approved a tender of 
R1.9 you know one would think that they also relied on this funding 
model that Siyangena makes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no, no I am asking a different question.  I am 
10 
saying in explaining why it accepted the amount of R1. – an amount of 
– a contract of R1.95 billion did the Board say that notwithstanding that 
we only have a budget of R317 million this allows us to overcome that 
difficulty? 
MS NGOYE:  No I – I – that is not reflected Chair – it does not – the 
minutes do not show that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – well you should know.  When was the – 
when was PRASA going to be required to pay back the loan as it were?  
This R1.9 billion loan when it had what R300 and? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  R317 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R317 million. 
MS NGOYE:  Well Chair I do not know and maybe I should say also you 
know from a regulatory process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 82 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  PRASA just cannot go out and request loans or enter into 
those type of transactions without the necessary approvals being 
granted by National Treasury being one of the – the institutions that 
would have had to consider PRASA you know asking for a loan.  The 
reality is that PRASA is a subsidised entity obviously gets its money 
from you know government and it is – so there was restrictions really 
around borrowings and so on.  So PRASA would have had to comply.  
So I do not know you know when and how PRASA would have been able 
to justify that loan that it had made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the contract or the funding model provided not 
10 
indicate as to when Siyangena would be paid?  Because I guess that 
we are calling it a loan they may have had another term for it but we 
are saying effectively it is a loan to PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  It is a loan ja.  I cannot recollect Chair if – if – but we can 
check it.  We can check what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not even remember whether… 
MS NGOYE:  That was even in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you saw it or? 
MS NGOYE:  No I cannot recall seeing it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just wondering if in terms of how long it would 
20 
take for them to be able to pay that kind of money if they had R300 and 
something million in the budget.  And I mean first the fact that the FCIP 
and Board saw fit to approve Siyangena’s price at R1.9 billion when 
there was R1.3 million from … 
MS NGOYE:  Protea Coin. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 83 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Protea Coin on the face of it says but how is that 
possible and then of course you explain that without the funding model 
even Protea Coin would not – even if they wanted to give the contract 
to Protea Coin they – they would not be able to because they did not 
have the money? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they had to go to somebody who – who was going 
to give them a funding model and Siyangena was providing that.  But 
still you have to – you have to say when would they be required to pay?  
In – on what terms because it might not make sense to say you are 
10 
going to pay this amount in a years’ time, in two years’ time or 
whatever I am not sure.  So if that is the case then it compounds the 
confusion. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know the questions just (inaudible) to say what 
was going on. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How could the FCIP not pick up this conundrum? 
MS NGOYE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was their solution to it?  What about the Board?  
20 
Because before you can approve they have got to say what is my 
answer if somebody says how are you going to pay this back?  You 
must be able to say, this is our answer and it is doable. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.  I guess well we can find the document Chari. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 84 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  From the model. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we… 
MS NGOYE:  There is a lot of paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  That is involved in this (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we need to look at that because one needs to 
know whether to the extent that there may be wrong things that may 
have happened one needs to know who was – who may have been 
involved.  In what way.  Was it negligence?  Was it incompetence?  Or 
was it intentional?  Was it criminal? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  But Chair when you look at the – how the matter unfolded 
and how the payments were made you know monies was coming out of 
PRASA to pay this. So effectively you know in relation to this first 
phase of the project PRASA had paid a substantial amount of money 
out of its own coffers to Siyangena.  So then when you look at it really 
at the end of the day this funding model did not even benefit PRASA 
because it still paid you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course that might not affect the Board. 
MS NGOYE:  No that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I assume it might affect the management. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  The management ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who – who made those payments. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now that was Phase 1 of the contract and was that 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 85 of 211 
 
the end of Phase 1 or where – was there another twist to Phase 1? 
MS NGOYE:  There was another twist to Phase 1 Chair.  So Phase 1 
was then extended again where from 69 twelve more stations were then 
included.  So effectively Siyangena just got given twelve more stations 
to say add on.  And the bat as well the expectation would be you need 
to follow procedure you know it (indistinct).  It was just an addition to 
the 69 that it had already had.  So once again you can safely see that 
we were not doing things in accordance with how they are supposed to 
be done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And just to illustrate the – the growth of the – the 
10 
contract.  It starts off with two where Siyangena is a sub-contractor.  It 
then ends up with seven as the main contractor.  There is becomes 69 
and now with this extension it becomes 81. 
MS NGOYE:  It is 69 plus 12 – 70. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  81. 
MS NGOYE:  Is it? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes 69. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am not counting so I am looking at 92. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is 81 Chair. 
MS NGOYE:  Okay Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  81? 
MS NGOYE:  It is 81 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is 81. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And how much did this – these twelve additional 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 86 of 211 
 
stations or – ja did they cost PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:  It was R350 million Chair for the additional twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that on top of the R1.9 billion? 
MS NGOYE:   R1.9 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it now becomes about R2.2? 
MS NGOYE:  R2. – ja.  R2.2 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  When it was – when the contract was originally 
given to the entity to which Siyangena was the sub-contractor how 
much was the price then? 
MS NGOYE:  I just (indistinct) because it was two stations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   At the time you know the amount would not even have 
been… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  I cannot remember exactly what the amount was but it 
was not (Chair speaking over Ms Ngoye). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was two stations ja? 
MS NGOYE:  It was only two stations that were required to be done at 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay no thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And in regard to this extension you make the point 
that it was – that there was an irregularity and could you identify that 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 87 of 211 
 
irregularity? 
MS NGOYE:  It is around the procedure Chair.  You do not just extend.  
Even if there was a tender say you do not extend the scope of the 
contract without following process again.  So you know naturally it just 
does not work like that.  You have to – if you want to extend the scope 
of the contract you would have to take it out to tender again.  So this 
was not – this was not done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No all of these extensions involved in – that we are 
talking about here would they have been sponsored as it were by the 
Chief Procurement Officer? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  He was part of it Chair.  So he would have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was part of it? 
MS NGOYE:  So he was part – so effectively between the Chief 
Procurement Officer and the Group CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  You know all these things would be sponsored and they 
would have to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it would be it is either both or one of them? 
MS NGOYE:  It had to be both. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it had to be both. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Because – that is it Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And – and at the time – at the time of these 
contracts – these extensions you were not yet Head of Legal 
Department? 
MS NGOYE:  No I was at Intersite Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 88 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were at Intersite? 
MS NGOYE:  At Intersite ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long had you been with PRASA at the time with 
Intersite PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:  Intersite I was at 2011 until 2014 – August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  And then I went across to PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when did you come to PRASA for the first time? 
MS NGOYE:  PRASA is in the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  PRASA including Intersite? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2011? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NGOYE:  But I would not have been involved because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not have been involved? 
MS NGOYE:  And also at the time Chair Intersite was no longer doing 
what the previous Intersite was doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  So in this – in my case Intersite was an asset investment 
20 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  And the focus was different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Do you know how long Mr Mbatha had 
been at PRASA around this time? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 89 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Well if I recall Chair I mean there was a time when Mr 
Mbatha indicated that he had been at PRASA for more than 20 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  So he had been at PRASA for a long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the – do you know how long he had been 
Procurement Officer as at that – this time? 
MS NGOYE:  No I would not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MS NGOYE:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But are you able to say I mean him being Chief 
10 
Procurement Officer he must have known what procedure is required. 
MS NGOYE:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or required to be followed if they were to be 
extensions? 
MS NGOYE:  Of course Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and the – and the CEO would have known also? 
MS NGOYE:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Just finally on the extension if no process had 
been followed would it have gone through the BEC, BAC and the FCIP? 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair.  You know I mean this was just an additional 
twelve stations to – to Siyangena.  If it went back Chair there would 
obviously be – have been you know concerns that would have been 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 90 of 211 
 
raised you know by the – by the BAC and the DEC again.  It should 
have been you know especially where the BAC is concerned 
considering that they have not approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am looking at Mr Soni I am not sure whether it 
is what he was looking for it – just my understanding.  What I would 
like to know is what would have been the process? 
MS NGOYE:  The procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be followed if there was to be an extension? 
MS NGOYE:  Well if there was to be an extension Chair of – of the 
contract again we talk to the scope increase you know and this issue is 
10 
also regulated by National Treasury to say you cannot vary the contract 
and increase the scope to more than a particular percentage of the 
contract.  So one would have expected that it would have had to go 
back to the BAC and then to the SCIP for consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it not have been necessary to – to issue a 
request for its – in other words start right from the beginning. 
MS NGOYE:  That too Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because… 
MS NGOYE:    You do not know if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You could have a situation where you decide to give 
20 
the contract in regard to other train stations to ask somebody. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and if you do not invite other people you – you 
are denying them an opportunity to bid for those train stations and you 
do it by saying we are just extending this existing one. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 91 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.  The value of the extension Chair would play a 
role as to whether the matter goes back to procurement – a process to 
advertising or not.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS NGOYE:  Because in terms of – in terms of the Treasury 
Regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  If I recall I think the percentage is increased now to 15%.  
So if at the time it was more than 10% of the value of the contract the 
variation then you would have to go out to tender.  So that – the 
10 
contract value and what it is that would have been paid here would 
determine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Whether that process would have to be followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  So it depended (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that does make sense because you do not 
want to invite too much for a very small. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Amount in value but once the value goes beyond a 
20 
certain amount you might then be justified in saying let us hear what 
other people can tender. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And for the record the amount being R350 million 
would be exactly more than 10% of the R2 billion or almost R2 billion 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 92 of 211 
 
extension con – Phase 1 contract? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry just on that score Ms Ngoye the R350 
million would that not have had to have Board approval given that Mr 
Montana could only contract up to R100 million? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  Mr Montana’s authority in terms of 
the delegations of authority was limited to R100 million.  It would had 
you know things done properly and gone to the – to the Board for 
approval. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But from what you know did this extension did not 
10 
go to the Board? 
MS NGOYE:  No it did not go to the Board Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So that would be a further basis to impugn really 
the award of the extension to Siyangena? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  I mean if you look at how things 
were done you know it was like does it matter?  Let us go ahead and do 
it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Would that have been reflected in the financial 
statement of PRASA at the end of that year that is say 2011/12? 
MS NGOYE:  Sorry what reflects it?  What is it reflecting? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The amount of the extension or the amount of the 
contract? 
MS NGOYE:  I do not want to venture into that Chair because I am not 
sure.  I have not necessarily looked at the – the financials so I did not 
want to say yes they were.  I cannot recall if the amount was reflected. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 93 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I suppose what we would have to do is to look at 
the – the financial statements and see whether in fact these matters 
are reflected as set out in your affidavit? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then Ms Ngoye you go into Phase 2 of the project. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson I see it is five to one.  I am not sure 
we will finish this in the next five minutes.  I do not mind continuing 
but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I think – I think I may have thought that we 
10 
would be able to finish with her before lunch but I think we – we have 
been doing what needs to be done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will have to come back after lunch. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And continue and finish. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay so I think let us take the lunch adjournment 
and we will come back at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson.  Ms Ngoye we’d 
finished now with phase one and the extension to it and we were going 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 94 of 211 
 
to start with phase two, you remember…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Will you tell us what – well will you tell the 
Chairperson what phase two is about? 
MS NGOYE:   Chairperson, phase two is about another award, this time 
the number of stations was 161 number of stations that were awarded 
to Siyangena.  So phase two deals with the process to appoint 
Siyangena, ultimately, as the preferred bidder. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the number was 161? 
MS NGOYE:   161 Stations that…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is separate from phase one? 
MS NGOYE:   Separate from phase one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it’s also for Siyangena? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You remember that we said that the earlier 
phases including phase one and all the extensions brought to 81, that’s 
161 you are talking about is another 80 or another 161? 
MS 
NGOYE: 
 
 
It’s 
161 
separate 
from 
what 
Siyangena 
had 
been…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so phase one has got its own train stations, 
phase two has its own train stations? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now was it a smooth process, the award in 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 95 of 211 
 
respect of phase two? 
MS NGOYE:   It was also not a smooth process Chair, however, in 
respect of phase two at least this time we had a RFP that was issued 
as part of the tender process, so the starting point, I suppose was, you 
know, kosher in terms of how things are supposed to be done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And was it a fair process? 
MS NGOYE:   No once again, it was not a fair process Chairperson 
because instead of PRASA, in its request, for suppliers to tender 
asking for functionality it specified a particular brand that the suppliers 
or the bidders would have had to comply with or be able to support and 
10 
that particular brand was a brand only associated with Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed let me just ask this question in 
relation to phase one.  Such non-compliances as we may find in phase 
one with procurement processes would there be any basis for any 
official within PRASA who was involved in making any decision to say, 
it was just negligence, I didn’t pay attention but it was not deliberate? 
MS NGOYE:   I find it difficult Chairperson for anybody to say that, the 
processes are clear, we had a supply chain management, you know 
policy that required us to do things in a particular way and anybody, 
especially in that area, because it was a procurement area, would then 
20 
want to come and say, you know we’re negligent, would not be truthful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And – so are you in a position to say any non-
compliance is – where procurement process is a requirement under 
phase one, could only have been intentional and deliberate? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 96 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   May I follow up on that, you answer is an 
emphatic, no it couldn’t have been non-deliberate, you’re emphatic it 
was deliberate? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now is – do you say that on account of the 
various irregularities together with the nature of the irregularities or is 
there some other basis on which you’re making that assertion? 
MS NGOYE:   It’s all the [indistinct] that really were present 
Chairperson, you know, the simple issue of saying put something out to 
10 
tender and let it be competed upon properly, we all understand, you 
know, as a State owned entity and our governance in relation to what 
we should do in relation to tenders, Section 217, no-one can say who 
works for a State owned enterprise, that they don’t understand the 
provisions of Section 217, fair processes, equitable and so on.  You 
can’t say that, you know, so if you decide to then have a process that 
does not comply with that which is rigged, in my opinion, you know, 
then clearly you know exactly what you’re doing. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And if you look at all these contracts and the 
extensions starting with the first – well after the first two to Enzo and 
20 
Rainbow was there any open process that was followed throughout the 
phase one aspect. 
MS NGOYE:   No Chair, there wasn’t, there was no RFP issued, you 
know, there was no open tender issued.  Even when, you know, those 
eight suppliers were called into that meeting, when they themselves 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 97 of 211 
 
asked for a RFP we couldn’t produce one.  We then said to them, 
develop something that would work for PRASA, you know, how does 
one explain that any further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve heard evidence in regard to other parastatals 
where it would appear that somebody would say – well I didn’t follow 
this procedure because the procurement provisions and the Supply 
Chain 
Management 
Policy permits 
that 
we 
don’t 
follow 
these 
procedures under certain circumstances and those circumstances are 
A, B, C, D, E and in my view this was an A or B or C situation but those 
who look at the whole thing and say, no it was like self created urgency 
10 
or they say, well there is just no way anybody could have said this fits 
in to this situation but nevertheless they are able to put up something, 
whether you believe it or not is another thing.  Are you aware of 
anything that those who may not have complied with certain procedures 
in relation to phase one that they are putting up or have put up in the 
past to try and justify why they didn’t comply? 
MS NGOYE:   No Chair there was just no justification and there was not 
even urgency, you know, at least in the case of urgency you would say, 
look we had to deal with things very quickly and therefore we had to – 
the procurement policy would have provided for that but when  you look 
20 
at, you know, the work that was done you can’t actually read urgency to 
that you can’t even attribute the fact that this particular company was a 
sole supplier was a single source, you know where in terms of the 
policy you would be able to do certain things and justify it.  In this 
respect you know, the fact that, in the phase one process you invited 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 98 of 211 
 
eight suppliers to come in.  It’s a clear indication that you appreciate 
that there would be competitors out there who would want to participate 
in an open tender process.  So I can’t see any justification from anyone 
within PRASA who would be able to then say, yes we had to do this 
because of urgency because Siyangena, for instance is a sole supplier 
and sole source there was just no justification for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to phase one and a special reference to the 
various extensions would the main people be Mr Montana and Mr 
Mbatha. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should they have made sure there was compliance? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and in regard to Mr Mbatha are you aware of any 
opportunity where he has – any occasion where he has had an 
opportunity to put up a justification, if he has one? 
MS NGOYE:   No I’m not aware Chair Mr Mbatha…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’re now aware, nobody confronted him or 
anything? 
MS NGOYE:   Well we did Chair, the organisation did as part of the 
process of dealing with consequence management and subjecting Mr 
20 
Mbatha to a disciplinary process, that process was not completed to 
have allowed him to put that justification forward.  In fact, I guess 
because of other issues and the reasons he gave for not being able to 
attend the disciplinary process, you know.  An unfavourable judgement 
was being taken against him because he didn’t present himself to the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 99 of 211 
 
hearing 
so 
one 
would 
not, 
then 
understand, 
what 
Mr 
Mbatha…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if he wanted to put up his justification, that was 
an opportunity. 
MS NGOYE:   Correct Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:   He might have elected not to use it. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what about Mr Montana? 
MS NGOYE:   Well Mr Montana was out of the picture at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja he was out ja. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, but the one thing you are sure of is the 
non-compliances that you have pointed out in relation to phase one, 
could never have been based on negligence or ignorance of the 
requirements, they were deliberate? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And just finally if I could follow up on what the 
Chairperson has pointed out, the phase one including the pilot phase 
involved amounts exceeding R2billion? 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As I understood your evidence, the only process 
that was followed – not the decision making process, the process that 
was followed was those eight people being invited? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair.  The eight people that had been 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 100 of 211 
 
invited, but once again, I still contend that it was just selecting eight 
people and not necessarily putting it out, you know, as a tender 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So actually what was required was to put the whole 
thing out to tender…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not done? 
MS NGOYE:   No it was not done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The situation – the procurement policy, the 
procurement provisions did not require that you just pick and choose 
10 
whoever you want to invite? 
MS NGOYE:   No Chair not in this circumstance, you know, there might 
be other circumstances but not this one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And just to finalise the point, that was the only 
decision in which the BEC and the BAC played their role? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the FCIP? 
MS NGOYE:   And the FCIP yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So all the other decisions and all the other 
20 
contract – or the contracts that we concluded were done by PRASA 
officials without any of this being subject to some scrutiny? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you spoke – you referred to the amounts having 
been above Mr Montana’s delegated authority, is that correct? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 101 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to the extensions? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And is that the position with regard to all the 
extensions that are involved in phase one that he was involved in? 
MS NGOYE:   The – all the amounts was above his delegations – all the 
amounts in relation to phase one and the extension thereof was above 
his delegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All the amounts? 
MS NGOYE:   All the amounts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said his limit was R100million? 
MS NGOYE:   R100million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So obviously they were far above that? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And once again that could not have been out of 
oversight, he would have known his limit? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if he approved this extensions, he did so 
20 
knowing that he was acting outside of his delegated authority? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in relation to phase two now, you say that 
there was a RFP but the complaint made was that they had asked for 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 102 of 211 
 
certain brands of equipment to be used?  
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Soni, please don’t forget your next 
question.  In terms of the Supply Chain Management Policy and in 
terms of other instruments and prescripts as you know them at PRASA 
are there circumstances under which the Group Chief Executive Officer 
would be – or was authorised to exceed his delegated authority on 
certain conditions? 
MS NGOYE:   No Chair there were none. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not at all? 
MS NGOYE:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   If there was anything above his delegation of authority, 
even in terms of signing of contracts that are above his delegation of 
authority he would have been given that permission by the Board, to 
say, we then authorise you Group CEO to then enter into this contract 
after the Board would have, obviously, considered the issues and have 
had supported the submissions that were made to it but otherwise he 
just wouldn’t…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it wouldn’t happen. 
MS NGOYE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He would have to refer that to the Board? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in respect of the fact that certain brands had 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 103 of 211 
 
been identified to be used to comply with the tender requirements, what 
is PRASA’s policy? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair our policy, you know, does not support the 
mentioning of brands when we go out into the public requesting for 
tenders to be – for people to participate in our tenders.  So that issue 
is not there, you can’t mention a brand in a tender process because 
then it makes it un-competitive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you talk about mentioning, you mean, in the 
documents that you issue to the public? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair, you can’t specify a brand. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes you can just specify what you need. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair but not a brand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And was this a complaint that was made by any of 
the tenderers? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes it was Chair, in fact, two of the bidders, you know, 
had a problem with it because the brands that were specified favoured 
Siyangena to the detriment of the other bidders. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now when you say the brands – those brands 
were identified in the RFP. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And in respect of favouring Siyangena, why do 
you say that the use of that brand would favour Siyangena? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair the way this process started, in fact, was that there 
was an unsolicited proposal, effectively, that was made by Siyangena in 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 104 of 211 
 
relation to phase two.  So in there it was very clear that their brands 
are the brands that support the Babylon and Delmaya system and that 
was then, what was used effectively, you know, to take the matter out 
to tender reflecting those two brands and it followed from the 
unsolicited proposal that was made by Siyangena in relation to phase 
two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who would have been responsible for the 
inclusion of the brands? 
MS NGOYE:   Well the Supply Chain Management area, in this regard 
the CPO, the Chief Procurement Officer at the time was a gentleman by 
10 
the name of Mr Jasapet Konghula [?], so he ran with this process, you 
know, from a procurement perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had he replaced Mr Mbatha? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And in relation to the issue of this RFP how long 
before the issue of this RFP had Mr Konghula replaced Mr Mbatha? 
MS NGOYE:   I can’t remember the times Chair but what I know is that 
at the time that this particular process was involved Mr Mbatha had no 
longer been the CPO, Mr Konghula had confirmed the [indistinct]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now did Mr Mbatha resign when there was a 
disciplinary hearing or what had happened? 
MS NGOYE:   No Chair, he got moved to another area within the 
organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He’s still there? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 105 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Well he left now because the disciplinary process that 
continued in his absence, found him guilty and therefore he was 
dismissed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay was that disciplinary process Chaired by an 
outsider by any chance? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A lawyer? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would that a be recent decision that he or she 
made? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay do we have that? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We will get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ja, so it’s important that we have that and he 
didn’t take the issue any further, Mr Mbatha? 
MS NGOYE:   Well he went to the CCMA Chair to challenge the 
dismissal, you know, so that process has still not been completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s still going on? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So just so that Chairperson has an idea of 
timelines, Mr Konghula replaces Mr Mbatha? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   At the time – at that time…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The timeframe, maybe to say, Mr Mbatha was moved 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 106 of 211 
 
from procurement more or less at that time in that particular year and 
then Konghula came in, do you remember when that was? 
MS NGOYE:   If anything, I think Mr Mbatha, if I recall Chair Mr Mbatha 
was removed as the CPO perhaps end of 2011/2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, because this process is a 2013 process, the second 
phase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the disciplinary hearing would have taken place 
when? 
MS NGOYE:   It’s not long ago Chair, remember this is a subject of an 
10 
investigation so what had happened is that – because also the Public 
Protector had picked this up. Now as part of the remedial actions 
PRASA obviously had to follow consequence management processes to 
make 
sure 
that 
those 
people 
that 
had 
been 
identified 
in 
the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the disciplinary process is a recent…[intervenes].  
MS NGOYE:   It’s not…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A year or two ago. 
MS NGOYE:   It’s last year actually Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But in between, after Mr Mbatha had been 
removed, you say he was removed, he moved to another section of 
PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And he remained at PRASA until the disciplinary 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 107 of 211 
 
inquiry. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So from about 2012 to about 2018/2019 he 
remained at PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct he was the Chief Information Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he removed by Mr Montana? 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair, it was the recent – the last Board that had the 
Board…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana? 
MS NGOYE:   Ms Kwinana’s Board that initiated the disciplinary 
10 
proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   And appointed a law firm to run with those processes, so 
it was last year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh his removal as CPO was also a recent thing? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Indistinct] moved from CPO…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   No sorry Chair, CIO, Chief Information Officer.  So CPO 
being the Chief Procurement Officer…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I understand but initially I was under the 
impression that he was removed as CPO around 2011 maybe 2012, 
maybe 2013 but then I thought you were saying it only happened 
recently. 
MS NGOYE:   No Chair CPO as the Chief Procurement Officer was 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 108 of 211 
 
around 2011/2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he was removed from there, it would have 
been during Montana’s time. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say he was not removed by him? 
MS NGOYE:   No he was not removed – he was removed by him as a 
CPO but he was not dismissed by Mr Montana…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I mean from the position of CPO. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct, he was removed by Mr Montana, that’s 
correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no that’s fine.  
MS NGOYE:   Yes, sorry we’re at cross purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that’s fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Was there any reason given for Mr Mbatha to be 
removed from the position as CPO to CIO?  
MS NGOYE:   I wouldn’t know the reasons Chair, I mean, I think the 
practice at PRASA was that you found ourselves being moved ever so 
often so one never understood the rationale of, you know, moving 
people, it happened to a lot of us that we were moved.  At one point, I 
think as employees we would make fun of the slogan of PRASA to say 
20 
be moved, referring really to the employees within the organisation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Within PRASA what would be a more prestigious 
position, being the Chief Procurement Officer or the Chief Information 
Officer? 
MS NGOYE:  I would say…[intervenes]. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 109 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was it a parallel? 
MS NGOYE:   That was a parallel move. 
CHAIRPERSON:   More or less …[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   Ja it’s got no salary increase, it was a parallel move 
because, you know, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MS NGOYE:   Because at one-point Chairperson the CPO was an 
Executive position right and that’s what Mr Mbatha was, he’s always 
been an Executive in the organisation.  When Mr Konghula came on 
board it was then a GM position, a General Manager position so he did 
10 
not have the same status as that of Mr Mbatha. So there were changes 
to the operational structure that did no place Mr Konghula at an 
Executive level, however, Mr Mbatha from being moved from the CPO at 
Executive level went to the CIO which was still an Executive 
appointment. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now one of the things you say in the – if you 
could read the last sentence of paragraph 34, Mr Ngoye. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes I’m saying there it’s not surprisingly given that the 
specs were tailor made for Siyangena, it was awarded the contracted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I don’t know who drafted the affidavit, specs, I 
20 
guess should have been specifications. 
MS NGOYE:   Oh sorry it was an urgent process Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But in the Swifambo matter relating to the 
purchase of the locomotives that’s – one of the reasons that the SCA 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 110 of 211 
 
expressly said the tender was invalid because specifications for the 
locomotives had been tailored made for Swifambo, do you recall the 
judgement? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   When you used the word “tailor made” in your 
affidavit did you have that in mind? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair, I mentioned earlier that the – it was an 
unsolicited proposal that was made by Siyangena to PRASA for the rest 
of the stations.  So effectively, you know, tailor making it was making it 
to suit the proposal that Siyangena had made. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So the specifications that were put out in the 
RFP, how were they related to what was offered in the unsolicited 
proposal from Siyangena? 
MS NGOYE:   Well the mention of the brand Chair is a give away you 
know, in the circumstances, because only Siyangena could support 
Delmaya and Babylon and therefore the other bidders were excluded 
from participating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What brand was this that was mentioned? 
MS NGOYE:   It’s a brand, it’s called Dalmaya and the one was 
Babylon. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why would Siyangena be the only one that could 
access it? 
MS NGOYE:   I guess because they were the- they were regarded, like 
the OEM, the original, you know…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, manufacturer? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 111 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That’s it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   Ja, so they’re the ones that supported – they were the 
only ones that could support that brand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm okay thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So can you recall what the amount of that – of 
phase two was, more or less? 
MS NGOYE:   It was over R2billion Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over R2billion? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Phase one was initially R1.1 then R1.9 but ultimately 
R2.2 or there about. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes with the inclusion of the R250. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then phase two was? 
MS NGOYE:   Over R2billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over R2billion. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes it was 161 stations Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but just to – you were talking about – we were 
talking about the brand now and you were making the point that only 
Siyangena could come up with the brand that was required.  So is the 
position that, in regard to phase one, only Siyangena was told that they 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 112 of 211 
 
needed to include a branding model in the [indistinct] or in their 
proposal? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair because they are the only ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the other ones were not told? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to phase two then the brand was put in that 
ensured that only Siyagena could win. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct.  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, under phase one because the others did not know 
about the funding modal they stood no chance of winning? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, under phase two is [intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   The brand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the brand or there is a requirement of a popular 
brand.  They also stood no chance of winning. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So if I could just go back to phase one, when you 
say that Siyagena was told, is it something you know or something you 
assume because they had included there funding modal. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What I understand Chair  is that as part of the 
discussions that happened you know when there was I mean you know I 
started by saying it was a subcontractor and from a subcontractor you 
know they got to be given the seven   You know and they were 
communicating with people within PRASA, you know and discussing how 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 113 of 211 
 
best it is to assist PRASA in doing this project. And therefore, you know 
with those discussions came the issue of the funding modal to say no we 
will help you out.  If you cannot afford it we will help you out and 
therefore they are the ones that knew that knew that you know that would 
be received very well by PRASA because they had been interacting with 
the people in PRASA, Chair, to the exclusion of obviously all those other 
eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise how would they have known that PRASA 
would not have the budget to fund this? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   The discussions were happening internally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the quiet.  Ja, Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you say that on the basis of the investigation 
that you did in preparing for the founding affidavit in the review matter? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then as seems to be the practice there is 
the phase two and then there is something added to it.  Could you tell the 
Chairperson about that addendum to that phase two contract? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair, the addendum was a mystery to PRASA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am – I am sorry Miss Ngoye.  That is so difficult for 
me to understand.  How anybody could think that a job for two billion – 
over two billion could really not go out to an open tender in 
circumstances where there is no justification or a light upon that is 
provided for in Procurement Provisions and Supply Chain Management to 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 114 of 211 
 
say we are justified in not doing - following this procedure.  It is just so 
[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   Bizarre, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It took me big amounts and obviously there will be 
questions about that.  If we are talking small amounts maybe it might not 
notice.  If you are talking big amounts you have to know that people will 
want to find out. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And people will ask questions.  So, I just do not 
understand what are the answers that you think you will give when you 
10 
are asked questions?  You – you understand 
MS NGOYE:   I – I get you Chair.  I do.  And I think you know that is why 
the investigations revealed you know the amount of corruption and 
maladministration and all sorts that and fraud that were happening in 
these – in these processes.  Noncompliance with legislation and that is 
why at the time PRASA, the Board of Doctor Popo Molefe decided he 
needs to have these contracts set aside because the investigations 
revealed these issues that could not be explained, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I do not want us to forget Mr Soni before we finish 
on phase two.  Let me go back to the question of deliberate, intentional 
20 
welting of processes and procedures as opposed to oversight, ignorance 
or anything like that to make sure she covers all of those as she sees 
things and so the facts that emerged from various investigations.  It is 
important that those be dealt be with head on to say if somebody is going 
to come and defend noncompliance they must know that the – the – the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 115 of 211 
 
suggestion is that it was intentional, it was deliberate, it was no 
oversight.  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Absolutely.  Yes, and they must have all the 
documents available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All the documents available.  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, sorry, we were talking about the addendum 
and you were saying there was a strange aspect to this.  Please can you 
explain the Chairperson what happened? 
MS NGOYE:   Chairperson, when the Board of PRASA at the time of 
Doctor Molefe decide what was you know looking at these contracts we 
10 
were given an instruction by the Board to say tell Siyagena to stop 
working because we are not going to pay them because of these 
irregularities.  And Siyagena brought an interdict against PRASA, the 
High Court in Pretoria and as part as their papers they produced this 
addendum.  Now nobody at PRASA knew about the addendum.  We 
searched and the business unit that was managing the contract of 
Siyagena was not even aware that there was addendum.  We searched, 
you know, the documentations within PRASA looking for this addendum it 
was not found.  So this addendum was produced by Siyagena for the first 
time at the meeting, at Court in fact and we were alarmed because we did 
20 
not know what the document was for and we searched, you know, 
vigorously effectively to try find this document and we just could not find 
it in the records of PRASA.  But this document was signed by 
Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And have we got it here? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 116 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We do not have that document that Mr Chair, but we 
will obviously [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is critical. 
MS NGOYE:   it is part of the bundle, Chair, for Court but we will have to 
bring it also here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know I think Mr Soni you were trying to avoid bringing 
too many documents into the commission but some of them are critical.  
Ja.  So, if it is going to be important to go through again and maybe 
revise your selection.  Okay, now what do you remember what kind of 
date that addendum would have been signed? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Let me just – let me just, if I am not mistaken if I recall 
Chair, it was April 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I guess you Mr Soni is still going to ask you 
about what - about its contents. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, well can I just start off by making this point 
that around the 31 s t of March 2014 Mr Montana had formally said that he 
was going to leave PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, chair. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So, this document is signed after that time? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Montana signs on behalf of PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 117 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, what – what was the – the –the, what services 
were Siyagena to provide in respect of that addendum? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair, it was effectively a type of a maintenance contract, 
you know, where Siyagena in relation to phase one would replace, you 
know, certain equipment with others because from a – from a – from a 
phase one I think at the time had run for a period of three years and so if 
Doctor. if there needed to be a change to the equipment then Siyagena 
would then again come in and be able to provide the maintenance. 
 
But, what we found interesting also about this addendum was that 
you would have expected there would be service level agreement to say 
10 
this is how you are going to do things and this is you know the process 
that you would follow.  We could not find that Service Level Agreement 
that related to the - to that addendum.  But what we understood was the 
requirement at the time was that PRASA will then have to pay Siyagena 
an amount of I think it is 10 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   A month 
MS NGOYE:   A month.  Ten million a month for those services.  So, so 
when Siyagena was suing PRASA through the arbitration process for 
monies owed it would include this ten million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, we are dealing with phase two.  Phase two is 
20 
related to an additional a hundred and sixty-two – sixty-one. 
MS NGOYE:   A hundred and sixty-one, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A hundred and sixty-one train stations. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is an addendum. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 118 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   An addendum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  The addendum is for maintenance.  Maintenance of 
what of the train stations? 
MS NGOYE:   Okay, of the equipment that Siyagene would have 
CHAIRPERSON:   Used. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, so if it needed to be changed that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   So that addendum related to them having to that work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you remember how long what the duration was 
intended to be for that - for those services to be provided by Siyagena? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   I cannot remember, Chair.  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over a few years? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, it would have been.  Remember that the phase one 
project was actually near completion at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   And then this addendum came out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The addendum related phase one and phase two? 
MS NGOYE:   I think it was phase one and two Chair, but I stand to be 
corrected I will have to check on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But phase one definitely? 
20 
MS NGOYE:   But phase one definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say they were to be paid ten million rand a 
month? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 119 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:    That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which means in twelve months that will be one hundred 
and twenty million? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and nobody knew about this addendum that is why 
you had to look for it? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  We saw it for the first time when 
Siyagena’s attorneys produced it, we knew about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   When you say they produced it that surely would 
10 
have been part of the papers they presented to Court? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  When they served us the papers 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [indistinct] 
MS NGOYE:   That we had papers in support of the incident.  That is 
correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Can I just raise this, that maintenance agreement 
was in relation to equipment that had been supplied in phase one? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  Definitely phase one as I say I 
cannot remember if it extended to phase two. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That equipment this given the times because this is 
2014 that equipment would be at least two or three years old? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Let me just ask you this and I will just ask as a 
general proposition, this was electronic equipment, would I be correct? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 120 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But surely in those two years equipment would have 
evolved so much that that equipment would effectively have been almost 
ancient when one looks at technological development? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair.  It is possible. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Has anybody examined where there is such a 
contract that is worth entering into in other words spending 10 million 
rand to maintain equipment that might now be outdated technologically 
speaking? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair, that is why, you know, one is saying it was just a 
10 
bizarre situation we were faced with.  Especially, with the business that 
was managing the particular contract was not even aware that there was 
this addendum that related to maintenance of the equipment.  So, you 
know, we were all surprised to see this document and we just did not 
know how it came about.  You know, so it for us it was just in fact we 
thought that this document was created outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you remember whether somebody within PRASA 
had witnessed Mr Montana’s signature on the addendum? 
MS NGOYE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no witness, or you cannot remember? 
20 
MS NGOYE:   I cannot remember.  Ja, I cannot remember this witness.  
But definitely it was [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But 
probably 
you 
would 
have 
remembered 
that 
somebody you knew that witnessed, that is it. 
MS NGOYE:   That is it.  Ja. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 121 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you cannot remember when it was? 
MS NGOYE:   No, no I cannot recall.  But I know that the document was 
all I remember Chair is that the document was signed by Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and some of us are not so good with technology, 
Miss Ngoye, but in terms of the old language I want to say when you went 
through the file to PRASA’s file where all documents, agreements and 
correspondence relating to that project were supposed to be there was no 
that memorandum was not there. 
MS NGOYE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You probably did not go to a physical file and you 
10 
[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   We looked we even one of the companies that we had 
employed during the investigation Fax Consulting could basically - 
remember I spoke about our computers being imaged?  So could basically 
go into the information of PRASA and pull out you know anything that we 
requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So, it definitely was not there? 
MS NGOYE:   It was just not there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now the interesting thing that [intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Sorry.  I am terribly sorry 
please do not forget the point you on.  Now you say that the investigators 
had imaged your computers, PRASA’s computers and they did not find 
this addendum, is that right? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 122 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words as far as you understand the 
Constitution, that addendum was never entered into any PRASA 
computer? 
MS NGOYE:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore, it could not have been created from a 
PRASA computer? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It could only have been created from outside of 
PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:   That is what – well, that is the conclusion we came to, 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because otherwise all documents that are created 
within PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:   Would have been found. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would be found within PRASA computers. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, the interesting thing about and I know you 
have mentioned other interesting things, but the interesting thing about 
this addendum is, it is called an addendum to phase two, am I right? 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But it is actually related to phase one. 
MS NGOYE:   To phase one because you could not have had phase two 
was just beginning, you know, phase one would have been the one that 
would require changes to their equipment.  But, ja, that is why a lot of 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 123 of 211 
 
things did not make sense when we looked at it.  Our conclusion with 
their investigating team and our attorneys was that there was clearly 
something I missed here.  It did not make sense. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well in any case, phase one had phase one then it 
had an extension then it had an addendum all in the space of about 6 
months? 
MS NGOYE:   Effectively, Chair.  It is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then three years later it will be odd to say then 
that this is a further addendum to phase one? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you suggesting in any way that the reference to in 
the addendum to phase two, which was wrong from what you have said, 
was deliberate? 
MS NGOYE:   It was premature, Chair.  You could not have made 
reference to phase two because in terms of, remember also one 
understands that there is warranty periods, you know in relation to the 
equipment that would have been provided to PRASA.  So, phase two - 
they were still in the process I mean phase two was only completed in 
fact last year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, what I am asking is it is strange that you 
20 
have said the addendum is written phase two because phase two is just 
starting, at that time? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Phase one got completed three years before.  Is that 
right? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 124 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, I am asking the question whether you think the 
person who wrote phase two on the addendum did so intentionally or it 
might have been an oversight? 
MS NGOYE:   I think it was an oversight Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm? 
MS NGOYE:   I think it was an oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think it was an oversight? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes.  Ja.  I think it was an oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  I do not think that somebody may 
10 
have thought it is going to be strange for a document that comes up 3 
years after the completion of phase one will be written phase one in terms 
of maintenance and then wrote phase two because phase two is just 
starting so it would be ...[indistinct]  you think that is unlikely.  You think 
that because phase one had just – phase two had just started what was 
being talked about was phase two and in the process and somebody wrote 
phase two? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, Chair the whole thing just did not make sense to us.  
You know, here we are in the midst of the phase two work still being 
done, you know, it has not been completed and you then you know create 
20 
this addendum for purposes of phase two instead of you call it phase two 
but you refer to phase one which was supposed to be completed at the 
time.  It just did not make sense I mean I my view [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may be over – oversight, you say. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 125 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   My view is that you know in a haste you know you then do 
not check what it is you have put on the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, can that be correct and I am saying this in this 
the document headed Addendum to Phase Two but the substance the work 
to be done is in relation to phase one. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair and that is why I am saying, you know because 
we could not make sense we could not find this document the only thing 
that we could deduce was that you know, things were done in a rush and 
therefore people did not apply their minds when they were putting the 
10 
documents together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But counsel is saying in effect it would look strange 
that somebody who knows that this document relates to work that belongs 
to phase one would write at the top phase two because of oversight. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When he knows the old document is about phase one. 
MS NGOYE:   Phase one.  Ja.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There must be so much to remind him that this is about 
phase – phase one and therefore for him to change this if it was 
oversight. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair.  Look I do not understand really what happened 
and if one can explain it as I said you know this is just pounced on us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes.  No, that is fine.  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I suppose that all that one can do is draw 
insurances from all the facts put together? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 126 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Including the fact that this about the time Mr 
Montana and his leaving. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, just finally on that in respect of that addendum 
whether it is correctly called Addendum to phase one or phase two had 
any claims been made by PRASA between April 2014 to the time that 
Siyagena sued for the money owing in terms of that contract? 
MS NGOYE:   Are we talking to phase one? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, no this addendum here.  That is [intervenes]. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   No, there was no payment in relation to the maintenance.  
Remember this was maintenance.  So, we did not because we did not 
know about this so nothing could have been attributed to the payment in 
relations to the maintenance.  So, the payments that was done in relation 
to the work that Siyagena had performed for PRASA was in relation to the 
contracts themselves and not the maintenance portion. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Miss Ngoye you are making a slightly different 
point.  This agreement is concluded in April 2014? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  Well, it is purportedly.  I do not 
know want to say that it is concluded because I do not know. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is what we had before. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, that agreement says PRASA must pay 
Siyagena 10 million rand a month for maintenance of phase one 
equipment? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 127 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, that ten million rand a month becomes due at 
the time the agreement kicks in. 
MS NGOYE:   It should. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, I mean [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time of signature or soon thereafter? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so it was signed in April twenty ...[intervenes].  
10 
MS NGOYE:   Fourteen 
CHAIRPERSON:   Fourteen.  The actual performance of the maintenance 
work by Siyagena was supposed to start immediately? 
MS NGOYE:   But it could not have started immediately, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm? 
MS NGOYE:   It could not have started immediately because [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because they were busy with phase two? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, you got warranties, you know, that would help you at 
least with you know changing ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maintenance. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Maintenance issues in relation to the phase one so it would 
then have to kick in after the warranty period lapsed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 128 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you remember up to when the warranties would 
have been valid? 
MS NGOYE:   I do not recall, Chair.  I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the position that you do not know whether at the 
time of the signing of the addendum the warranties [intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   The warranties ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Had kicked in were no longer operational? 
MS NGOYE:   I cannot recall, Chair.  I do not want to make submissions 
to that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   See because that too creates a problem about the 
10 
propriety about entering into that contract.  Mr Montana is about to leave, 
if the warrant is only going to expire 6 months from then, what is the need 
to enter into the contract before he leaves? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, chair.  I mean I will say again you know we 
found it interesting that this document was just produced at the time that 
it was produced and the fact that we could not find it and that is why I am 
saying Chair internally in relation to the payments for maintenance we 
could not find, you now, the fact that PRASA had paid for maintenance 
anywhere in relation to the phase one contract.  The business unit that 
was responsible for this contract if they knew about it would have known 
20 
that they would have had to pay this maintenance as well but because 
they did not know you know there would not have been any justification 
from them to pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the unit at PRASA that ...[intervenes].  
MS NGOYE:   It was PRASA Cress.  It was the Corporate Real Estate. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 129 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  They did not know anything about it. 
MS NGOYE:   No, we asked the CEO at the time was, Taran Ngubani, and 
she looked with her team and they did not know about it.  We asked 
procurement ...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   They never asked for anything like that, as far as you 
know? 
MS NGOYE:   No, when we asked, we asked as we received the 
document, so we went back and said we need to check ourselves whether 
this document exists.  We went to procurement and procurement did not 
have a record of the document.  We went to the business unit that was 
10 
managing the project to ask if they knew about this document and they 
did not know as well. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But the grace, oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you ask him, and I will come back. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I do not mind.  I know my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to complete the picture now, I am taking you to 
something else, he made by PRASA to Siyagena of the work done with 
regard to phase one over the 3 years before this addendum was find was 
did PRASA pay anything? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, we did Chair.  I think we paid over 1 billion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, had you in the meantime found money? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, we had money.  We paid over 1 billion.  I think in 
respect of phase one at the time the Board requested us to stop paying 
Siyagena, we were owing Siyagena about six hundred million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have paid about 1.6 billion.  
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 130 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   For phase one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For phase one. 
MS NGOYE:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What is also intriguing is the first time you get to 
know about this document is when PRASA tells Siyagena to stop working. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, if Siyagena, if there was such an agreement, I 
am coming back to the point you made.  We must accept we do not know 
if there was any but if there was such an agreement then one would 
expect that if money is due in terms of an agreement Siyagena would 
10 
have asked for payments in terms of that. 
MS NGOYE:   They would have invoiced.  Definitely, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And had there been any [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Just will you not just repeat 
that question, please?  I did not follow. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So if there was such a contract then one must 
assume that at the time you told him to stop, money is owing to Siyagena 
because that is why they do not want to stop. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, had - based on the investigations you had 
20 
done and the team, had it been found out whether Siyagena had sent any 
invoices in regards to that 10 million rand a month? 
MS NGOYE:   Chairperson, what happened is that in relation to phase one 
the contract was obviously not known so there was no submission of an 
invoice in relation to the maintenance of it.  What we then found out was 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 131 of 211 
 
in relation to the matters pertaining to phase 2 that in Siyangena’s 
invoices there would be reference to this maintenance agreement.  But 
obviously at the time we had put a hold, the board had put a hold on 
payment of these amounts to Siyangena so no monies would have been 
paid in relation to this addendum for Siyangena.  But they included the 
amount that PRASA owes them. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Can I ask- oh sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just I need to get my timeframes right.  
Roundabout when in terms of month and year was PRASA discovering or 
were you discovering- did you discover that there was this addendum?  It 
10 
was signed in 14- in April 2014. 
MS NGOYE:  Mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when did you discover- when was it that Siyangena 
took you to court? 
MS NGOYE:  We asked Siyangena to stop I think it was in 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016. 
MS NGOYE:  The latest 2016, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  It could be 2016/2017 when the board said, look based on 
the investigations that we have stop paying Siyangena. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  So it was ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would have been around- could have been 2017. 
MS NGOYE:  2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 132 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  2016, ja Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  The board of Dr Popo Molefe was still in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that was about 3, 2 and half years or 
thereabout after. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the signing. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So during that period PRASA had not made any payment 
in regard to this addendum? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The maintenance one. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had made payments in regard to phase 1. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  The work that have been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The work that have been done. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  Because there was a process also Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say that Siyangena had included references to 
20 
this addendum and maintenance work in their invoices. 
MS NGOYE:  After. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After. 
MS NGOYE:  After we found out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, after you found out. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 133 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Remember they- ja, they still bill us Chair.  They continue to 
bill us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  In fact, what happened Chair with the interdict, we lost the 
interdict and so they were allowed to continue to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And so, they continued ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they started billing you for the first time in regard to 
this addendum. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they had this addendum, it was signed in April 2014 
but did not say anything about payment.  Did you know- did you get to 
know at any stage whether from after the signature, the signing of the 
addendum, whether they actually did the work in terms of the addendum? 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair there was not any evidence that showed that ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they did the work. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja, there was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  What I know Chair is that the CEO Mr Tara Ngubane- I mean 
20 
Ms Tara Ngubane when he interviewed her in relation to wanting to 
understand what actually transpired she indicated the thoroughness of 
looking at the work that Siyangena would have done before payment and 
they would question obviously things that they did not agree with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 134 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  So speaking to her there was no mention of the fact that 
this contract was in existence (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess they would not have performed 
maintenance work without the client knowing ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they were performing maintenance work. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja, they would not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But one thing until the interdict application by 
Siyangena there is no invoice from Siyangena relating to these 10 million 
10 
rand a month? 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Until the interdict application Siyangena brought, 
there is no invoice from Siyangena to PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  There is no invoice Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what would you then deduce from the fact that 
there is no invoice in- we are now looking at 2017 when this interdict 
application is brought. 
MS NGOYE:  It is suspect Chair.  One wonders what could have happened 
20 
and one is thinking about the issues of once again corruption and ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  (indistinct)  
MS NGOYE:  And all sorts. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 135 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you- I would think that even if you are very rich if 
you have done work that entitles you to 10 million rand a month you 
cannot forget sending an invoice. 
MS NGOYE:  No.  No, you cannot.  You cannot- that is why I am saying 
Chair it was just bazaar for us to say, now there is this other thing.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And there is this other expectation from PRASA in terms of 
payment requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Which we did not seem to see. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know Mr Soni or maybe Ms Ngoye as well, if this 
has not been done, it is necessary to get somebody in the relevant train 
stations where the maintenance work would have been done.  Who would 
have known the maintenance work was done in the particular train 
station?  That is apart form somebody staying at head office who- it would 
be made important just to who says, no, I was here during those years.  
There is no way anybody would have come in here and performed 
maintenance work without me or my staff knowing and if they had come in 
my absence my staff would have told me. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Indeed.   
20 
MS NGOYE:  We will request that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And Mr Chairman if that interdict application now 
becomes quite important as well ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 136 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Because one would then see what case Siyangena is 
making in relation to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So we need to get those papers as well. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So just now in respect of these different phases you 
in paragraph 39 wish to emphasis certain matters.  Will you do so please 
to the Chairperson Ms Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson in paragraph 39 I say in respect of all these 
contracts ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, what paragraph? 
MS NGOYE:  Paragraph 39. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  39 okay. 
MS NGOYE:  Of the supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  I state that in all these contracts PRASA was simply not 
authorised to proceed with the work contemplated in phase 1 and phase 2 
and the addendum.  These transactions were not budgeted for and no 
approvals were even obtained from the Minister of Transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do no know if you deal with this elsewhere.  Under 
what circumstances would the approval of the Minister of Transport be 
required? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Chairperson there is a materiality issue that applies within 
state-owned enterprises.  So but also ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what is the materiality issue? 
MS NGOYE:  The materiality in terms of the amount of money that is 
regarded as material.  But what I found at PRASA Chair is that I am not 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 137 of 211 
 
sure that we are doing the materiality process correctly.  Take for 
example right now the materiality that has been identified in terms of the 
amount at PRASA is sitting at 58 million.  But then you have the authority 
of the Group CEO at a 100 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS NGOYE:  How I understand these work- these to work especially in 
relation to my experience from Transnet was that you would agree the 
materiality with the shareholder.  So anything that is above the materiality 
that you would have agreed with the shareholder would then have to go to 
the shareholder for approval. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS NGOYE:  So if you look at these amounts I mean I think at one point 
PRASA was sitting at 48 million as a materiality framework, a number that 
was included in our framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS NGOYE:  But the authority of the Group CEO would have been above 
that.  So effectively you could not have- and this is my submission Chair.  
You could not have a materiality framework of a particular amount and a 
delegation of authority above that materiality framework.  It should not 
have worked like that.  And in any event, anything above a billion in 
20 
relation to what PRASA would have indicated as a materiality framework 
would have required the minister’s approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying the position as you understand is 
that if a state-owned entity is going to commit itself financially beyond a 
certain amount, it needs the approval of the relevant minister. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 138 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the case of PRASA that would be the Minister of 
Transport. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say the reference to materiality is really refers 
to that grey whole ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is specified ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  In the materiality framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess the reference to materiality must simply 
means once it reaches a certain point the financial commitment reaches a 
certain point, it matters for the shareholder ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore, you must tell the shareholder and get 
approval. 
MS NGOYE:  And also, in terms of a PFMA Chair it would be ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Also, in terms of PFMA. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Yes, it would be a major acquisition from- for PRASA which 
have entered into these types of transactions.  So PRASA was acquiring 
assets that were material. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 139 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the requirement that you must obtain the approval 
of the minister materiality instance, is that provided for in the PFMA?  Is 
it provided for in some other legal instrument? 
MS NGOYE:  The PFMA talks to that the acquisition of a significant asset, 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS NGOYE:  And what happens is that for you to be able to determine 
what is material, you agree the figure with the shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS NGOYE:  So that would be incorporated in the shareholders contract 
10 
which in the agreement that the minister concludes with the board.  So 
that should the board- should an amount be above that which is agreed 
with the minister a PFMA would kick in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Minister approval must be obtained. 
MS NGOYE:  The PFMA would kick in as well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the PFMA talks about a material ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  A significant asset, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A significant asset.  Oh okay. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. And then materiality would then determine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Really what would then be regarded as significant in the 
biggest scheme ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Where the organisation is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Soni if we can get the relevant ... (intervenes) 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 140 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  It is in Section 54. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Provisions, ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja, in Section 54 of the document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay, thank you.  So you say the materiality 
threshold, if I can call it that in regard to ask between the minister and 
PRASA was 48 million. 
MS NGOYE:  At the time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  Because I think we are sitting at 50 odd million rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So yes, we are talking about billions. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  They were talking about billions.  It is just too big an 
amount for PRASA not to engage the minister and get his approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Of course, in regard to- well that is in regard to 
the whole contract the addendum would or well for the whole year 
addendum would have been above the- that threshold. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And these thresholds would have been well known 
obviously to the Group CEO. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then Ms Ngoye in your affidavit you deal with 
certain financial dealings between PRASA officials and an attorney 
associated with Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 141 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Let us just go back to the point you made earlier as 
to who was driving the process just prior to phase 1 starting.  Who was 
the PRASA official at the head of that? 
MS NGOYE:  I speak about Mr Gunjo Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And the decisions that were there ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what was Mr Gunjo’s name?  Do you know? 
MS NGOYE:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not seen the name yet.  I just see the surname. 
MS NGOYE:  (indistinct)   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe somebody will look for it in the meantime.  
10 
You can continue.  I think ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  I know the name but I forgot. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Can I ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  I will have to look for it Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I will look for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be found later.  I will get it. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now and who is making all of the decisions in 
relation to these contracts? 
MS NGOYE:  The decisions were made by Mr Montana. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The contracts or the transactions that you talk about 
and you say they caused a giant shadow over the propriety of these 
contracts.  Whom do they concern? 
MS NGOYE:  They concern both Mr Gunjo and Mr Montana Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 142 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in you founding affidavit in the review 
application you identify those at paragraph 21.  Am I correct? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  If you tell the Chairperson very briefly- well let us 
start off withy in regards to Mr Montana, how many transactions do you 
say are matters of concern? 
MS NGOYE:  Four property transactions Chairperson that were picked up 
by the investigators. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And in regard to Mr Gunjo? 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Gunjo there is one property that was picked up. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So let us start off with Mr Montana.  There a four 
you say. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But you identified and you do not have to give too 
many details but if you could just tell the Chairperson what the essence 
of those contracts are and why they prompt concern. 
MS NGOYE:  Well Chairperson these- we say they are property 
transactions because they are related to the houses that Mr Montana had 
bought at the time.  The first transaction ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said at the time. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  At the time the Siyangena contract was we were ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  The original or the addendum? 
MS NGOYE:  All of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During those years. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 143 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  During those years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS NGOYE:  So ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is 2011 to 2015 or thereabout. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS NGOYE:  The investigations pick up that there is a number of 
contracts that property dealings the Mr Montana was involved in.  And 
four of these were identified and what was bazaar Chairperson about 
these transactions was- is it has been alluded in the affidavit, was that 
10 
you had an attorney who at the time was a conveyer over the attorney.  
One would regard him as the attorney for Siyangena.  Was the person 
that was assisting Mr Montana in the procurement of these contracts of 
these properties.  And when you look at the amounts involved Chair you 
would recognise that they were substantial amounts.  For instance, one of 
the properties was about 11 million rand.  And what the investigations 
picked up was that these properties were not bonded so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All four of them? 
MS NGOYE:  The first one was.  He bought the property for a billion- not 
a billion, it is 1 odd million and he sold it for 6 million.  So that one ... 
20 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I guess that has no issue on. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  There was one for about 11 billion ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Million. 
MS NGOYE:  I mean million, sorry Chair, not billion.  Million. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 144 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry.  Ms Ngoye ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us answer that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Let us do it in stages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Otherwise we all- we are going to be all over the 
place.  Let us start off with paragraph 21.4. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You call that the first transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does not mention again what ... (intervenes) 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  SS3. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which bundle so that if they pick up the transcript they 
will know. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Bundle B SS3B Mr Chairperson and at page 359. 
CHAIRPERSON:  359? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I was looking at the- is that B as well? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, there is a B1 and a B2 Chairperson because the 
Siyangena imperatives are about four other cases ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this one has B so it does not say B1 or B2 and this 
one is B ... (intervenes) 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I am going to return to you at once Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, will you change that quickly to make sure.  B2 is 
supposed to be the ones that says Court Applications Continue? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is so. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 145 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, will somebody just check this thing so that we do 
not have to always keep on having to correct.  So the bundle in which 
court applications commence will be marked as Bundle B1. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Bundle or the lever arch file which- in which court 
applications continue will be marked as Bundle B2. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, that is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let us get this sorted out. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay at page 359. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  359 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  At page- paragraph 21.4 Ms Ngoye you deal with the 
first transaction. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  If you could tell the Chairperson briefly what the 
concern is relating to that transaction. 
MS NGOYE:  Well Chairperson in this transaction Mr Montana, this 
relates to a property in Parkwood.  Mr Montana had purchased a property 
in 2014 for 1.8 million.  He then sells the property to Precise Trade.  Now 
20 
Precise Trade is a company where one of the directors of Precise Trade is 
the lawyer representing Siyangena, Mr van der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm-hmm. 
MS NGOYE:  So one- the issues of conflict arise in that regard.  But also, 
in respect of this property it was valued at just over 3 million. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 146 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He bought it for 1. ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  1.8 
CHAIRPERSON:  1.8 million? 
MS NGOYE:  1.850 million, yes.  And then he sells ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MS NGOYE:  It is (indistinct) on file Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I bought for 1,850 in July 2008, is that right? 
MS NGOYE:  On the 4 t h of July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  4 t h of July 2008. 
MS NGOYE:  2008. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  He pays that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you say he sold it ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  For 6.8 
CHAIRPERSON:  In 2014. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja continue. 
MS NGOYE:  For 6.8 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the attorney who represented Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  The company Precise Trade is a company ... 
20 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sold to a company. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right.  Where he is a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 147 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
MS NGOYE:  And the purchase price was 6.8 ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that would have been ... (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  There was a profit of 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 6 years after he had bought it. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS NGOYE:  The profit for that amount was ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the amount was 6.8 now. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was- he made quite a good effort. 
MS NGOYE:  Profit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  4.95 million Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and it is over 6 years. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the- I think you were saying, you wanted to tell 
me what the value of the property was. 
MS NGOYE:  The market value at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm? 
MS NGOYE:  The market value of the property at the time ... (intervenes) 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Was 3.3 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3.3 million. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  So Precise Trade bought it for much more than what 
was the market value. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was 5 May 2014. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was- and the addendum was April 2014. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he signed the addendum- they signed the 
addendum. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the addendum that ... (intervenes) 
10 
MS NGOYE:  (indistinct)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You could not- PRASA people could not find.  Did not 
know anything about. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you cannot remember if there was a witness within 
PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:  No, I cannot recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From within PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mm-hmm. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So if I can just identify who Mr van der Walt was.  
Please look at SS3B page 360- bundle B2 SS3B page 361 paragraph 
21.10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I was still trying to look for the name of the 
purchaser at- in paragraph 21.5 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 149 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh, sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot see the name.  You did mention the name of a 
company but I cannot see it here. 
MS NGOYE:  It is Precise, Precise Trade Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm?  Is it in here? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is 6 lines from the top of the page ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, Precise Trade. 
MS NGOYE:  Precise Trade Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  And you said one of the directors … 
(intervenes) 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Is Mr van der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr van der Walt. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was representing Siyangena. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In its transactions with PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And if you could go to paragraph 21.10 you identify 
exactly Mr van der Walt’s role. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  So at the time of this particular 
transaction that is reflected in 21.10 indicates that Mr van der Walt was 
the attorney for Siyangena.  And Siyangena was performing work on the 
phase 1 project and then to be appointed to phase 2.  So he was involved 
in advising Siyangena at the time but Siyangena was … (intervenes) 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 150 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hoping for his running phase 2. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you say he was the sole director of Precise 
Trade? 
MS NGOYE:  At the time Chair.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in the review application, who represented 
Siyangena? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  In the review application we had a Mr van der Merwe, Gert 
van der Merwe, representing Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were Mr van der Merwe from a different law firm?  Or is 
it the same law firm? 
MS NGOYE:  I do not know if they were together with Mr van der Walt.  
But what I know is that Mr van der Merwe was the attorney and has been 
the attorney of Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was- when you say he was the attorney for Siyangena 
and you say you do not know whether … (intervenes) 
MS NGOYE:  They were in the same company. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was from the same law firm.  In terms of 
correspondence, do you remember whether there was a change of law 
firms in regard to the interdict?  Whether PRASA started to get 
correspondence from a different law firm or not? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 151 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  No, the law firm that has always represented Siyangena … 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remains the same. 
MS NGOYE:  Was yes, represented by the lawyer Mr Gert van der Merwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you- Mr van der Walt or van der Merwe.  You say 
van der Merwe? 
MS NGOYE:  van der Merwe was the attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MS NGOYE:  van der Walt was involved in assisting Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  But was not the attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr van der Merwe. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was an attorney and was not councilor in the interdict 
or is that something you are not sure about? 
MS NGOYE:  In the interdict it was Mr van der Merwe that represented 
Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as councilor or as the attorney? 
MS NGOYE:  As the attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As the attorney. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  As the attorney Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  But you say the correspondence remained 
with the law firm. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  okay. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 152 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Even to date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then the second transaction you deal with at 
paragraph 21.12 on that same page, page 361.  Will you tell the 
Chairperson very briefly what that transaction was about? 
MS NGOYE:  This was a … (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 21 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  21.12 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  12, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  This was a sale of property at Waterkloof Pretoria Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And what was the purchase price? 
MS NGOYE:  The purchase price was 10.5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was purchasing, was it Mr Montana? 
MS NGOYE:  Well in terms of 21.15 Chair you refer that the purchase 
price was 10.5.  The purchase price had to be paid in cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  10,5 million rand. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  It had to be paid in cash into a trust account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was paid in cash. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  Into a trust account of Van Rensburg Inc Attorneys 
20 
upon signature of the contract.  So they were the ones that were doing 
the convincing of the transaction.  This particular contract lacks because 
Mr Montana failed to pay the purchase price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 153 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes but then if you look at paragraph 21.16 the last 
sentence there. 
MS NGOYE:  In relation to the same property, yes Mr Montana then 
agreed to pay a non-refundable deposit of 3.5 million which was 
subsequently paid. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then 21.17 tells you who the sale agreement 
was between. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.  So the sale agreement Chair was between Anmani 
represented by Ms De Beer and Minor Property Trust represented by Mr 
Johan Smith a trustee.  The beneficiaries of the Minor Property Trust are 
10 
the children of Mr Montana.  So the purchase price was 11 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It went up to R3.5 million that has originally been 
the expected purchase price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am getting confused. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Initially – well there was a reference to R10.5 million 
being the purchase.  And then you said that agreement fell through 
because Mr Moyane – Mr Montana failed to pay the purchase price.  
But he had agreed to pay a non-refundable deposit of R3.5 million 
which was paid. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now the – 20 – paragraph 21.17 talks about R11 
million and a sale agreement.  Is that in regard to the same property? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct – that is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there was a new agreement? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 154 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The previous agreement had been between Mr 
Montana and the seller and this one involved trust. 
MS NGOYE:  Well it – you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure about that? 
MS NGOYE:  Well this one because was – the purchaser became the 
trust. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MS NGOYE:  And what we found out was that trust belonged to Mr 
Montana’s children. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  So the connection that is made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Is that you know it was in relation to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And was there a deposit to be paid for this or 
(indistinct). 
MS NGOYE:  The R3.5 her paid.  On 201.18 Chairperson on page 363 
we indicate that the balance of the R7.5 million was paid by Precise 
Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Am I right to say the R10.5 
20 
million was the subject of a certain agreement which involved Mr 
Montana as one of the parties? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That lapsed? 
MS NGOYE:  It lapsed because he could not raise the funding. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 155 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he had paid R3.5 million that was not refundable. 
MS NGOYE:  When it was revised.  The transaction was revised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they paid when another – a new agreement was 
entered into. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the same property. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now not with Mont – Mr Montana as such but with 
a trust – with his trust. 
MS NGOYE:  With his children’s trust. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where the children were beneficiaries. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but was that R3 – so he paid the R3.5 million 
when they have to deal with the second transaction – with the 
agreement involving his trust? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair.  And then at the top the first 
agreement was forR10.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And then this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was for R11 million. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Went up to R11 – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So – but then 21.18 you say he says the 
balance – I guess the balance after the R3.5 million. 
MS NGOYE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The balance in an amount of R7.5 million was paid by 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 156 of 211 
 
Precise Trade Mr Smith then requested that the contract be altered to 
reflect Precise Trade as the purchaser.  Okay talk to me about that? 
MS NGOYE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is happening there? 
MS NGOYE:  These (indistinct) are very complex Chair and I am going 
to speak to what is contained in the – in the founding affidavit.  So – so 
what if you recall Precise Trade one of the directors in Precise Trade is 
an attorney for Siyangena.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Van Der Walt. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MS NGOYE:  Now when this particular transaction happens Mr Montana 
can only raise R3.5 non-refundable he accepted it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  It becomes bizarre that the balance of the transaction is 
paid by the Precise Trade entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  Where you know you have the lawyer for – for Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Being you know the sole director paying the balance of 
20 
this price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  You know so I mean when you look at it (indistinct) and 
then also you know then they request to have the property now the 
purchaser being changed to Precise Trade. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 157 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Montana paid R3.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The deposit ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja and then you know the balance is paid and that 
company was – the property was intended for the beneficiary – his 
beneficiaries.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NGOYE:  But now you know Precise Trade takes over this 
transaction and completes it and it is then registered as the purchaser. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So ultimately it was registered as Precise 
10 
Trade’s property? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and I see this was happening in 2014? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Towards the end of the year? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Soni. 
MS NGOYE:  21.19 Chair you know indicates that on the 26 November 
2014 Ms De Beer met Mr Montana at the property.  Ms De Beer and Mr 
Montana did the walkabout and the keys were handed to Mr Montana of 
20 
that property where Precise Trade had paid the balance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the property that was – that was now registered 
in the name of Precise Trade? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The key was handed over to Mr Montana.\ 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 158 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  To Mr Montana yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And just for completeness sake in paragraph 21.18 
there is a reference to Mr Smith.  Who was Mr Smith? 
MS NGOYE:  I cannot recall. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  He was the trustee.  If you look at… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think… 
MS NGOYE:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the previous page. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja in the previous page.  He was a trustee of the 
10 
children’s trust. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson I – have you got a reasonable picture 
of the second transaction here? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think so insofar as one can get.  Ja so – so it 
ends – it starts being – it starts with a situation where the purchaser is 
Mr Montana’s trust and the beneficiaries of the trust are Mr Montana’s 
children. 
MS NGOYE:  Children yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Montana pays R3.5 million. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as a deposit and then an arrangement is made in 
terms of which Precise Trade pays. 
MS NGOYE:  Pays the balance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The balance of R7.5 million. 
MS NGOYE:  5. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 159 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is registered in Mr … 
MS NGOYE:  In Precise Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Precise Trade’s name. 
MS NGOYE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on the 26 November 2014 … 
MS NGOYE:  The keys were given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The keys for the property are given to Mr Montana 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Montana.  Now who knows this? 
MS NGOYE:  This was picked up. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who knows that this is the position? 
MS NGOYE:  This was picked up by the – by the investigation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  When the forensic investigations were done and there was 
a follow through on these transactions it revealed that this is what had 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no what I want – but what I want to know is, how 
do they come across is it because they interviewed Ms De Beer and got 
a statement from her?  Is it because they came across a letter in some 
file where somebody refers to the fact that Ms De Beer and Mr Montana 
20 
had a walk through inspection and that Ms De Beer handed Mr Montana 
the keys that is what I want to confirm? 
MS NGOYE:  Chair it is pos... 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is unlike the transactions you know purchase 
agreement that can be found in documents and who the purchaser was, 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 160 of 211 
 
what the deposit was?  Who has this knowledge – personal knowledge 
of it? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Chairperson can I – I do not want to give 
evidence but I thought if I could… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It will shorten the inquiries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  In the answering affidavit Siyangena deals with 
10 
these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Not in detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And I am going to take the witness to those to be 
answered.  But in addition Mr Montana files an affidavit which is not 
part of the papers so we will look at that to see what his answer is to 
each of these allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But – well if this is taken from a certain affidavit 
then it is fine if I am told it is in somebody’s affidavit. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is 21.19. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is part of the investigation but the point I am 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 161 of 211 
 
trying to make Chairperson is that we do have Siyangena’s versions on 
these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And you will see that the dispute is quite narrow in 
respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Maybe let me go back to – to you as a 
witness because this is your affidavit.   
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.  But this is (indistinct) affidavit I must say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will say on this date Ms De Beer met Mr Montana 
at the property. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms De Beer and Mr Montana carried out a walk 
through inspection of the house and Ms De Beer handed the keys to Mr 
Montana. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this is quite important. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the light of the fact that you have just told us that 
the house was registered in Precise Trade’s name. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  After initially the purchaser had been… 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Montana or his trust. 
MS NGOYE:  His trust, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His trust.  So now who – do you have personal 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 162 of 211 
 
knowledge of this? 
MS NGOYE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have? 
MS NGOYE:  Not personal knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  This is – this is what you know was part of the 
investigation (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is what is in records that PRASA has. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That came from the investigators. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Following the investigation – the work that the 
investigators had done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But do you know what their source of 
information was? 
MS NGOYE:  The investigators went out Chair to interview you know 
the various people that they picked up as being people who were 
mentioned in the documents that they found in relation to the properties 
you know. So that work allowed them to be able to approach different 
individuals and ask them exactly what transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It is not satisfactory.  So I need somebody to 
20 
check what was the basis on which the investigators said on this date 
Ms De Beer and – met Mr Montana at the property and Ms De Beer and 
Mr Montana carried out a walk through inspection of the house and Ms 
De Beer handed the keys to Mr Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 163 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  And I guess Ms De Beer whoever she is can be 
interviewed or may have been interviewed to say what does she know 
about that. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MS NGOYE:  Ja.  Chair I would like to say you know because I am the 
deponent of this and obviously some of the information was 
communicated to me so I do not have direct knowledge of some of the 
issues here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  And it would be dealt with accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  You know by the lawyers in the matter before court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no you may have said at the beginning of your 
affidavit that you are not relying on your personal knowledge. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you rely on some records but if you – if you were 
able to say, I said this here because in the records that we have at 
PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  In the documents. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I came across a statement by Ms De Beer or Mr 
Montana that said this then I would understand that. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  There is copies – there is annexures Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 164 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  To the documents that indicates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  You know email correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  That was picked up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Through the investigations, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there – is it your conclusion that you reached 
based on … 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Those emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes on emails exchanged between who and who?  Ms 
De Beer? 
MS NGOYE:  Ms De Beer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Montana. 
MS NGOYE:  And Mr Montana yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh those – those are within the records of PRASA? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the first thing to look for and make available 
and – and but apart from the emails I think Mr – Ms De Beer should be 
20 
approached for an affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you.  It is just that it is – it is very 
strange because now the keys get given to … 
MS NGOYE:  To Mr Montana. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 165 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Montana at a time when in terms of the 
documents he is supposed to have nothing to do with this house. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Previously if it was at a time when the purchaser was 
the… 
MS NGOYE:  The trust. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Trust then one would understand. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it has been suggested that Precise Trade. 
MS NGOYE:  Precise Trade. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should be the purchaser now. 
MS NGOYE:  Precise Trade now is the purchaser – that is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now one expects somebody from Precise Trade to 
receive the keys. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not Mr Montana. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then at paragraph 21.22 you deal with the third 
20 
transaction and where is that property situated? 
MS NGOYE:  This transaction is a property in Sandhurst Chairperson.  
199 Empire Place in Sandhurst. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just to round off the – the second 
transaction.  As these things were happening buying of property, 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 166 of 211 
 
deciding who is going to be the purchaser, Mr Montana’s trust or… 
MS NGOYE:  Precise… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Precise Trade or who Siyangena was continuing to do 
work  
MS NGOYE:  For PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And just again in context that was ended in 2016 
or 2017 Ms Ngoye?  The – that is when the interdict came when he 
(indistinct) 
MS NGOYE:  Yes that is when the interdict – that is right. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So 2014 certainly … 
MS NGOYE:  Was the – was in the process when Siyangena was doing 
work for PRASA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in relation to the third transaction starting at 
paragraph 31.22 in the third sentence of that paragraph you set out 
where you got this information from. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Could you tell the Chairperson where this 
information is from? 
MS NGOYE:  So in relation to the Sandhurst property Chair the facts 
relating to this transaction were contained in a sworn statement by a Mr 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 167 of 211 
 
Louis Green an estate agent that was employed by Pam Golding 
Investments who was instructed by Mr Coller and – to sell the property 
in Sandhurst during about the middle of 2014.  So that statement is 
attached to the papers that are in court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We will obviously get a copy of that statement.  
Now in brief what was the issue in regard to this property? 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Montana made an offer to purchase in Sandhurst in the 
amount of R13.9 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was – you say in 20 – April of 21.23. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to this property on or about 26 October 
2014 Mr Montana visited the show day – well you start by saying the 
Sandhurst property had been placed on show on several occasions. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On or about 26 October 2014 Mr Montana visited the 
show day and expressed an interest in purchasing the aforesaid 
property.  You say Mr Montana made an offer to purchase the 
Sandhurst property in an amount of R13.9 million. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the offer was accepted by the seller on the 28 
October 2014. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay continue. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes.

ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then what happened next that is contained in 
paragraph 21.24? 
MS NGOYE:  So on the 6 November 2014 Mr Green received an email 
from Mr Van Der Walt.  Mr Van Der Walt is Precise Trade.  A letter 
from… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Green again is the – that is the estate agent? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct.  From Pam – Pam Golding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Pam Golding. 
MS NGOYE:  So he receives an email from Mr Van Der Walt and the 
letter is also attached Chairperson.  There is a number of emails that 
10 
are also attached to the – to the affidavit.  In the letter the attorneys 
confirmed that they had R5 million in trust – in a trust account with 
Investec Bank. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  And on the 7 November Mr Green received a further 
email.  This is the…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  Hang on one second.  This Mr 
Van Der Walt is that the same as the attorney for … 
MS NGOYE:  Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Siyangena. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the estate agent in regard to the Sandhurst 
property receives an email from Mr Van Der Walt on the 6 November. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and then there is a trail of emails and in the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 169 of 211 
 
letter Mr Van Der Walt confirmed that they had R5 million in a trust 
account with Investec. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
MS NGOYE:  So on the 7 November – so effectively this transaction 
was dealt with you know… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think let us go to the emails because I 
want to know what was the letter saying apart from – or is that all that 
it was saying that they had that R5 million in that account? 
MS NGOYE:  No – in the trust account? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chaiar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the important thing it was saying 
MS NGOYE:  Well yes that is what we thought was important Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.   
MS NGOYE:  So on the 7 t h… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what – what I am wanting to connect is who is he 
acting for now when he writes to Mr Green – Mr Van Der Walt? 
MS NGOYE:  Our view that he is acting for Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Does it say in the letter, in the email or not? 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember? 
MS NGOYE:  I cannot remember if it says but if you look at the interest 
was shown by Mr Montana at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 170 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:  In relation to this property and when you look at you know 
what was happening during the transactions with Siyangena at the time 
you know the – what became bizarre was that the attorneys now of 
Siyangena were you know assisting Mr Montana in concluding these 
transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have these emails here? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We do not have them here Chair.  But we will – 
they are attached to – or on the… 
MS NGOYE:  To the papers. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Attached to the founding affidavit already. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they are necessary because these bits and pieces 
they can become very important. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know but you say you do not remember whether 
in that email Mr Van Der Walt does say expressly who he is acting for? 
MS NGOYE:  No I do not recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not recall that? 
MS NGOYE:  No. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What do you say in paragraph 21.25? 
MS NGOYE:  There was another instruction on 21.25 on the 7 t h Mr 
20 
Green received a further email from Mr Van Der Walt to which was 
attached a proof of payment.  So Mr Van Der Walt sends this email to 
Mr Green into a trust account of Pam Golding for and on behalf of Mr 
Montana.  So in the next – in the next – the first email I was alluding to 
the fact that I – I am not sure that he mentioned that he was acting on 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 171 of 211 
 
behalf of Mr Montana.  But when the payment was made you know he 
then reflects that it is made on behalf of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it became clear. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes it becomes clearer now that he is acting on behalf of 
Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NGOYE:  So there is attaching the proof of payment. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then what happens next? 
MS NGOYE:  And then on the 25 November… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not get – you did not get a copy of the 
10 
agreement in regard to this one? 
MS NGOYE:  In relation to this property? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see there has not been a reference to the 
agreement. 
MS NGOYE:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes alright. 
MS NGOYE:  And then again in the same month Chairperson on the 24 
November Mr Green the estate agent received another letter from Mr 
Van Der Walt confirming an instruction from his client Mr Montana so it 
becomes clearer now that Mr Van Der Walt is also acting for Mr 
20 
Montana where Mr Montana has asked that the buyer be changed to 
Precise Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so in regard to this transaction the – the idea 
that the purchaser should be Precise Trade emerges … 
MS NGOYE:  From Mr Montana. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 172 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Again. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And now Mr Van Der Walt says that comes from 
Mr Montana. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the second transaction it was said to 
have come from Mr Smith who was a trustee. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes who was a trustee? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Mr Montana’s trust? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Just on the question of Mr Montana’s interest in 
this property would you read what paragraph 21.29 says Ms Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:   
“Mr Montana” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Of – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Well that last sentence of paragraph 
21.26 seems important. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you want to deal with that? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last sentence of paragraph 21.26. 
MS NGOYE:  So the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Drafted by Mr Van Der Walt. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 173 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  Instructed Mr Green who was the estate agent to allocate 
the deposit paid on behalf of Mr Montana to Precise Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the situation is that Mr Montana visited the 
property during one of the show days, liked it, subsequently made an 
offer which must have been accepted and he paid an amount of R5 
million … 
MS NGOYE:  What we are told Chair is that that amount comes – you 
know the attorneys Van Der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Is the one that confirms that that amount was sitting in 
their trust account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes so – but what I am saying is, this amount is 
paid either on his behalf or by him but it goes via Van Der Walt? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Attorneys. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at that stage the payment is being made on 
behalf of Mr Montana because he is going to purchase the property? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then later on Mr Van Der Walt says Mr Montana 
has said the purchaser should be Precise Trade? 
MS NGOYE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The company whose sole director is Mr Van Der Walt. 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Van Der Walt.  That is correct Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 174 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the same company that … 
MS NGOYE:  Had been doing work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the second transaction. 
MS NGOYE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had taken over … 
MS NGOYE:  That property as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That property as well. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then now Mr Van Der Walt says to the estate 
agent, that R5 million that – they had already paid it or not? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they had paid already to the estate agent it 
should now be taken as a deposit for Precise Trade. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is not something one comprehends unless one 
reads it over … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you have got to... 
MS NGOYE:  Ja you have got to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Try follow it here. 
20 
MS NGOYE:  Ja you have to go through it over and over again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NGOYE:  To understand what actually happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then at paragraph 21.28 you will see that 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 175 of 211 
 
there is a reference to the seller Mr Coller. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And there is communication to – with Mr Montana.  
Could you please read that into the record Ms Ngoye? 
MS NGOYE:  So now the property was signed on behalf of Precise 
Trade but Mr Coller, the seller right addressed an email to Mr Montana 
asking him to indicate whether he had any interest in taking occupation 
of the property before transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When does this happen in relation to the finalisation 
of the transaction? 
10 
MS NGOYE:  The seller of the property? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes is that around the time when Mr Van Der 
Walt writes and says take that R5 million to be a deposit from Precise 
Trade or is that months later 
MS NGOYE:  No it is in the same month Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is about the same month 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  This is a few days later Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  This is 21.26. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think what happened is that you went too much 
ahead of me. 
MS NGOYE:  Oh sorry. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the full purchase price was R13.9 million for this 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 176 of 211 
 
property hey? 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let me just have a look here.  Oh that is quite 
interesting. Yes 28. – 21.28. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Coller was the seller? 
MS NGOYE:  Was the seller. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He writes to… 
MS NGOYE:  Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Montana in an email asking him to indicate 
10 
whether he had any interest in taking occupation of the property before 
transfer. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he is wanting to see whether – so that if he wants 
to come in before the transfers are done. 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They can talk about occupational interest and so on.  
Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then 
20 
MS NGOYE:   So Mr Montana continues to be involved in the 
transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No response is found in the emails to this letter or to 
this email from Mr Montana? 
MS NGOYE:  Well he continues to get involved in the transaction so 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 177 of 211 
 
there was an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NGOYE:  For example the email address Mr Montana that was used 
was stipulated as – as a contact for the transferee so there was 
communication between the seller and Mr Montana.  In addition 
because the conveyers who obviously would be acting on behalf of the 
seller in this regard.  So that – that communication was happening 
when Mr Montana was involved.  In addition the conveyances 
addressed regular progress … 
MS NGOYE:  And these documents are also available in the founding 
10 
affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what will be necessary Mr Soni is that all 
these annexures that are not here but are somewhere they will need to 
be made available and there needs to be something that tells whoever 
reads here where to find them. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson what I am going to propose subject to 
your approval is we have a special set of documents relating to all 
these transactions with all the annexures. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  There and just a summary of what each of those 
transactions entail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  And it may be – it may be that 
some way need to be found to have something on each page where an 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 178 of 211 
 
annexure is referred to which says if you want to see that go to that 
page or that bundle. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  That would… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That it is page whatever. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – because when you read you immediately 
want to look… 
MS NGOYE:  To those annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you know and you are disappointed when you do 
not find it. 
10 
MS NGOYE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  I see here it 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is four o’clock.  I was just going to tell you 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A few minutes past – four minutes past four.  I think 
we both underestimated how long we would take.  I thought we would 
finish before lunch but – but no time has been wasted.  It has all been 
very important. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Evidence.  Now how far are we from finishing with 
20 
her? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson can I just say that it is just the – the 
one more transaction after this and then Mr Gango’s transaction.  But 
what I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is still that first affidavit or not? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 179 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We had decided Chairperson that we will deal with 
that in the second phase and the main reason is it is a matter in which 
Ms Kweyama has a major interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Maybe we should just have all of that evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is a very self-contained (indistinct) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And one would be able to deal with it in about two 
and a half hours in all. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You know rather than dealing with it in stages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – so to finish here you need about how much 
time for today? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  About – about twenty minutes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About twenty minutes.  No that is fine.  Ms Ngoye you 
can still stay? 
MS NGOYE:  I can Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can?  Okay alright.  I think counsel for is also 
alright.  Okay I think let us take a short break and then we come back 
20 
and then we continue and then we finish. 
MS NGOYE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 180 of 211 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s proceed. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Inaudible mic not on]. 
MS NGOYE:   [Inaudible]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Inaudible – mic not on]. 
MS NGOYE:   So the signed…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your mic is off. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   My learned friend wishes to be excused because 
it doesn’t involve his client directly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, thank you. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry Ms Ngoye I just wanted to …[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We were talking about the property being 
transferred to [indistinct] Trade. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now that happens on the 6 t h of March, what 
happens on the 12 t h of March…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, are you deliberately skipping 21.30, it 
seems important. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, as you please Chairperson I, in fact, intended 
20 
to do it earlier.  I intended to deal with it earlier before …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Would you please, Ms Ngoye, read into the record 
an email that Mr Montana addresses to the seller of the property on the 
3 r d of February 2015. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 181 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That’s at paragraph 21.30. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct, it says 
 
“We 
were 
not 
aware 
of 
the 
delays 
of 
the 
payment 
of…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I think just start from the paragraph itself, 
on 3 February 2015. 
MS NGOYE:   On 3 February 2015, Mr Montana addressed an email to 
Mr Colla [?] regarding the payment of the transfer costs in respect of 
the property, a copy of the email is attached Chairperson to the 
10 
documents, before Court, in the email Mr Montana sais that, 
 
“we were not aware…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are quoting now. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct I’m quoting sorry Chair, I’m quoting in 
inverted commas, 
 
“We are not aware of the delays in the payment of fees and 
 
the consequent breach of contract. I’m aware that our 
 
attorneys were busy with the VAT registration of the Trust, 
 
this may have contributed to the delays. I have asked the 
 
attorney to abandon the VAT registration for now and ensure 
20 
 
transfer is concluded immediately without further delay.  I 
 
have discussed the matter with our attorney, Mr Riaan van 
 
der Walt who has since been in contact with Thalita [?].   He 
 
made an undertaking to settle the fees by today or latest 
 
tomorrow morning”. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 182 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So what does that indicate in relation to Mr 
Montana’s association with the property? 
MS NGOYE:   Well effectively Chair, he must be the person concerned 
obviously in relation to this particular transaction because he seems to 
be taking over – he’s involved in the communications that are 
happening even with the Estate Agency but also what is interesting is, 
he keeps referring to the attorney, Mr van der Walt having to settle the 
payments for his. So that’s what one can deduce from this. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And when he refers to the attorneys in what 
capacity are the attorneys acting in relation to this property, according 
10 
to Mr Montana’s email? 
MS NGOYE:   Well they’re his attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the reference to our attorneys there, in the email 
you say is a reference to Mr Riaan van der Walt? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, who is the sole Director of Precise Trade? 
MS NGOYE:   Precise Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But nevertheless on the 6 t h of March that property 
is transferred, to whom is it transferred? 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Its transferred to Precise Trade Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now after that transfer, to whom is 
communication relating to the property addressed? 
MS NGOYE:   It’s addressed to Mr Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Will you just indicate what the nature of that 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 183 of 211 
 
communication is? 
MS NGOYE:   Paragraph 21.32 Chair on 366 we talk about, on the 12 t h 
of March 2015 the sellers of the Sandhurst property addressing emails 
to Mr Montana, the email was attached to the document as well that’s 
before Court Chair it says…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No sorry can I ask you to read who the email is 
addressed to? 
MS NGOYE:   The email is addressed to Mr Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No please read it, if you read…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Read [indistinct].   
10 
MS NGOYE:   Sorry I’m not with you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page 367 right on the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the top. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, I was going there Chair, it says, 
 
“Hi Lucky”. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And who, in this context, would Lucky be? 
MS NGOYE:   Lucky is Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s his name? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue, read. 
MS NGOYE:   It says, 
 
“I called Eskom today to let them know we have sold 119 and 
 
to try to transfer the electricity account out of Janet’s name, 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 184 of 211 
 
 
however, the process seems to need both parties.  We need  to 
give Eskom a move-out instruction to terminate our  account and then 
the new owners need to give them the  
move-in 
instructions 
to 
activate the new owner’s account.   
However, 
when 
we 
give 
them the move-out instruction they  
will cut-off the electricity 
supply until the move-in order is  given. I obviously don’t want to 
leave you without electricity,  
the pond and the wine cellar are 
linked and the wine cellar  
needs power to pump out water and 
prevent flooding.  Would  you please let me know as soon as you are 
able to do the  
account transfer with Eskom so that we can co-
10 
ordinate the  
instruction to happen on the same day”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this is after the property has been transferred to 
Precise Trade. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the sellers are now talking about logistics in 
terms of moving out and making arrangements with Eskom to ensure 
that the – they are not billed for the electricity when they no longer live 
at the house.  
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they sent an email to Mr Montana and not to 
20 
Precise Trade. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And not to Mr van der Walt who is the sole Director 
of Precise Trade? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair, they speak to Mr Montana. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 185 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   They talk to Mr Montana on the basis that he – they 
understand that he is the person who is going to be living in the house. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then what’s the next communication Ms 
Ngoye, that’s at 21.33? 
MS NGOYE:   So on the 19 t h of March 2015 Mr Louis Green addressed 
an email to the seller of the Sandhurst property regarding the repairs to 
the gate motor, the security cameras and the transfer of the electricity 
account, and once again that email is attached to the Court Papers 
10 
Chair, we make that available. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Green is who? 
MS NGOYE:   Mr Green was the Estate Agent.  So he says, Mr Green, 
he writes to Janet and I quote Chairperson, he says, 
 
“Hi Janet, I chatted with Lucky, Lucky being Mr Montana, 
 
regarding the repair of the gate motor, the security cameras 
 
and the transfer of the electricity account.  He has confirmed 
 
that the appointment at 9h30 on Friday the 20 t h of March 
 
2015 and has requested they only attend to the gate motor.  
 
He will, at his expense re-instate the security video system.  
20 
 
He has also requested that you hold off as far as the transfer 
 
of the accounts is concerned.  He is extremely busy at the 
 
moment and undertakes to pay all that is related to the bills 
 
until the transfer has been done.  He has indicated that, 
 
should he be able to attend to it within the next few weeks, 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 186 of 211 
 
 
that he should be able to attend to it within the next few 
 
weeks.  Your indulgence in this regard will be much 
 
appreciated.  Could you please advise who the gardening and 
 
pool services companies are as he would like to continue with 
 
their service”, 
 
So this is what – obviously Mr Green relaying this information 
to, you know – yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in the next paragraph there is a further 
reference to Mr Montana’s involvement with this property, could you 
briefly tell the Chairperson what that is? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Is this 21.34? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   So a further thread of emails Chair relating to the 
Sandhurst property transaction at that time is attached to the founding 
affidavit, in particular, I wish to draw attention to the email addressed 
by the seller, the pool service company dated 31 s t March 2015 in which 
it said, and I quote, 
 
“Hi [indistinct] , this is just to confirm that we have notified 
 
the new owner, Lucky, that the pool cover part has arrived 
 
and we are waiting his instructions to carry out the repairs.  
20 
 
We have also given the Pam Golding Agent, Louis Green your 
 
contact details so that they can get in touch with you directly, 
 
if necessary”. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now at paragraph 21.35 you make an interesting 
observation.

MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair, so it will be noted that Mr van der Walt was 
sole Director and shareholder of Precise Trade and Invest is not copied 
on any of the abovementioned emails, the emails are direct to Mr 
Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And when you say that, what do you intend to 
convey? 
MS NGOYE:   Well effectively that, you know, Mr Montana, at the end 
of the day was the person that the property was bought on behalf of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in this last email you read which is at the top of 
page 369, this is an email from the seller of the property. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Addressed to – who is it addressed to? 
MS NGOYE:   To the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the pool service company? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it’s addressed on 31 March 2015 and he tells the 
pool service company that the new owner of the property is the person 
to whom he refers as Lucky? 
MS NGOYE:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that person is Mr Montana? 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Lucky Montana, that’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and he says to the pool service company he’s 
awaiting Mr Montana’s instructions as to the carrying out of repairs. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 188 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now thereafter there follows a rather infesting 
communication, would you tell us [indistinct] what that is? 
MS NGOYE:   So on the 10 t h of May Chair, 2016 Mr Green sent an 
email to Mr Montana, Mr Green…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now 2016? 
MS NGOYE:   This is 2016 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that’s a year and 2015 has passed since these 
other emails? 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   So Mr Green advised that he sellers of the Sandhurst 
property had found two extra keys for the electric pool cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry – yes okay, they had found two extra keys 
for the electric pool cover. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Green sends this email to Mr Montana. 
MS NGOYE:   Mr Green. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Green sends it to Mr Montana? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Mr van der Walt responded, a copy of these emails is 
also attached, he then says in an email…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja please read the email. 
MS NGOYE:   He says, 
 
“Hi please explain why you have cc’d Mnr L Montana, I’m just 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 189 of 211 
 
 
thinking that Mnr is meneer, in this email, you are well aware 
 
of the fact, and as already explained to you last year before 
 
the property was even bought by my company that Mnr L 
 
Montana has nothing to do with Precise or the property.  
 
Please refrain from this action in the future, this is 
 
confusing”, 
 
No it’s not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughter], yes continue Mr Soni. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
And 
I’ll 
tell 
you 
why 
its 
not 
confusing…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it’s not confusing at all. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But you then put some context to that Ms Ngoye 
an that’s at paragraph 21.37. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair, so the papers in the previous application were 
issued on the 2 n d of February 2016, the Sandhurst property transaction 
was mentioned in those papers, the above email was sent, only after Mr 
Montana was confronted with allegations contained in those papers and 
two days before Mr van der Walt deposed to the confirmatory affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it’s not confusing at all, yes.  So Mr van der Walt 
now says to Mr Green the Estate Agent, what are you doing what does 
20 
this property have to do with Mr Montana. 
MS NGOYE:   Mr Montana, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And obviously what you say at paragraph 21.37 
appears to have prompted that email. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 190 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I mean that communication. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct, so when the application was made he had 
to cover up there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Thereafter we deal, at paragraph 21.38, with the 
fourth transaction. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And this involved a property in which suburb? 
MS NGOYE:   It’s in Hurlingham Chairperson, it’s situated at 12 
10 
Montrose Road in Hurlingham. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Green appears to be the Estate Agent 
again. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now very briefly…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Green is the Estate Agent here as well? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS NGOYE:   In 21.40. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is with regard to the fourth transaction? 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How far apart were these properties, usually Estate 
Agents are restricted to an area isn’t it or certain areas [indistinct] to 
one another. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   They’re not too far away, I know because I stay 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 191 of 211 
 
near…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they’re not too far apart. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   They ordinarily would have been entailed two 
separate Estate Agents belonging to the same company, they’re not too 
far apart. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes Ms Ngoye. 
MS NGOYE:   Must I continue to 21.40? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   So Mr Green was mandated by Mrs Gaviser [?] to market 
10 
and sell the Hurlingham property.  So the property was placed on show 
which Mr Montana attended on about October 2014.  Mr Montana, 
having viewed the property, immediately expressed an interest in 
purchasing the property.  On about 15 October 2014 Mr Montana 
requested that the offer to purchase be forwarded to Mr Smith. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now this is Mr Smith…[intervenes]. 
MS NGOYE:   The Trustee. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The Trustee. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair of the minor property Trust, his 
children’s. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the purchase price of this property, I’m 
trying to look for it. 
MS NGOYE:   Purchase price is R12million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hm? 
MS NGOYE:   R12million. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 192 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay that’s in 21.41? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS NGOYE:   So the minor property Trust…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I’m sorry, the first – the second property 
was paid for through – by Mr van der Walt, is that right? 
MS NGOYE:   Precise Trading, that’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That property was also paid for – well the deposit of 
R5million was said to have been paid by or on behalf of Mr Montana 
through Mr van der Walt? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And later on when it was – the plans changed 
Precise Trade must be the purchaser, Mr van der Walt said that amount 
must be taken as Precise Trade’s deposit. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which means if the R5million had come from Mr 
Montana he would now be owed money by Precise Trade. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then of course, we see Mr Montana being 
involved quite throughout and correspondence being addressed to him. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s the third transaction and that was 
R13.5million. 
MS NGOYE:  That’s correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and the one before was R11million. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 193 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   It was R10.5million and then it went to R11million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes it went to R11million, so this one we are dealing 
with here now is R12million. 
MS NGOYE:   R12million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All these purchases are happening in 2014, is that 
right? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then at paragraph 21.42 the details of who 
signed the offer and so on are set out, could you please summarise the 
10 
position for the Chairperson? 
MS NGOYE:   So the offer was signed by Mr Smith, the Trustee Chair, 
in his capacity as the Trustee of the minor property Trust, however, 
both Mr Smith and Mr Montana represented to Mr Green that the 
property was being purchased by Mr Montana and there’s reference to 
correspondence to that effect Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then what happens thereafter? 
MS NGOYE:   And the offer was rejected by the seller. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And after it was rejected? 
MS NGOYE:   So on the 23 r d of October 2014 the minor property Trust, 
20 
through an email from Seresa David, Ms David, made another offer to 
purchase the Hurlingham property for an amount of R13.5million and it 
was again – proof of that email correspondence is attached to the 
papers before Court. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in the offer to the – by the minor property 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 194 of 211 
 
Trust it was subject to payment of the deposit of R2.4million and the 
purchaser obtaining a bond of R9.6million, is that correct, that appears 
at paragraph 21.41? 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair – that is correct in 21.41 it says so, 
the offer was subjected to payment of a deposit in the amount of 
R2.4million and the purchaser obtaining a bond of R9.6million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And when the offer was made for R13.5million 
what happened to the bond finance clause? 
MS NGOYE:   So that clause was deleted Chairperson and this is 
referenced in 21.44 which indicated that the offer was a cash purchase, 
10 
furthermore the sale was subject to payment of a deposit in the amount 
of R2million, so the bond was no longer an issue here because there 
was cash available to purchase the property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you see in paragraph 21.41 you say an offer of 
R12million was made to the seller by minor property Trust represented 
by Mr Smith, was subject to a payment of a deposit in the amount of 
R2.4million and the purchaser obtaining a bond for R9.6million, okay 
that offer was rejected and then three days later minor property Trust 
made an offer for R13.5million and that was a cash – that was to be a 
cash purchase. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And an important point is, it’s no longer subject to 
a bond being approved.  
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 195 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then there is a development on the 3 r d of March 
Mr Ngoye, what was that? 
MS NGOYE:   A new offer to purchase was submitted where Mr Montana 
was substituted for the minor property Trust as the purchaser. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does this mean this offer of R13.5million was 
rejected?  
MS NGOYE:   No Chair, so they make the offer of R13.5million but 
because it’s a cash sale you know and the bond requirement is not an 
issue anymore and one would surmise that in relation to that 
transaction the purchaser would have been Mr Montana and that’s why 
10 
on the 3 r d of March 2015 they signed a new offer, I suppose it’s in 
relation to the same property Chairperson but they changed the name 
of the purchaser here to being the Trust and not Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the new offer is for how much? 
MS NGOYE:   It’s the R13.5million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s R13.5million still that one. 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct Chair, it’s the same amount as what was 
offered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The previous offer was from the Trust. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   That’s correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Who is this new offer from? 
MS NGOYE:   The new offer to purchase was submitted by Mr Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So Mr Montana is now substituted for the Trust as 
the offeree? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 196 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, what 21.45 says Chair is that the new offer to 
purchase was submitted in which Mr Montana was substituted for the 
minor Trust property as the purchaser. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then – now in relation to this – to that offer 
certain payments were made and these are reflected in paragraph 
21.46, what were those payments? 
MS NGOYE:   So on the 24 t h of March 2015 Precise Trade Chair, paid 
the deposit of R2million into the Trust account of Janine Bredekamp, a 
conveyancer attending to the transfer of the Hurlingham property and 
there’s proof of that. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright and then 21.47 there is still obviously an 
amount of R11.5million. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   When is that paid? 
MS NGOYE:   So there were various delays Chair, as reflected in 21.47 
relating to the payment of the balance of the purchase price in the 
amount of the R11.5million and a copy of a letter between Mr van der 
Merwe, Mr van der Merwe is the attorney for Siyangena…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Van der Walt. 
MS 
NGOYE: 
 
 
Sorry 
Mr 
van 
der 
Walt 
sorry 
and 
Ms 
20 
Bredekamp…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe van der Merwe as well but the one who deals 
with Siyangena the most is Van der Walt. 
MS NGOYE:   Correct Chair so Mr van der Walt wrote in quotes he says:  
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 197 of 211 
 
“We herewith confirm that we hold instructions from 
our client to confirm in writing that his delay in 
rendering a guarantee is not due to his mala fides, 
but due to unforeseen circumstances pertaining to 
the sale of one of his properties of which the profits 
out of the sale is earmarked to be utilised for 
payment of this property.” 
That is the rendering of the guarantee and he further on says:  
“It was conveyed to our officers that such funds will 
only be available during the last week of May 2015 to 
10 
be transferred to our offices where after our offices 
will invest the funds in an interest bearing account 
with Investec to enable our offices to render a 
guarantee as stipulated in your letter of 30 March 
2015 through Investec.” 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And was that amount then paid? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, they outstanding purchase price was eventually paid, 
Chairperson on the 15th of May 2015. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Now, in your affidavit, in your founding affidavit in 
the review papers you do not indicate that that purchase by Mr Montana 
20 
had had actually been finalized because remember Mr Montana is now 
substituted as the offer reads in place of the trust. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  That was his quest.  
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   But on the information at your disposal that sale 
did take place? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 198 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And Chairperson we will obviously make the 
necessary enquiries from our side, see who the owner of the property is 
on the official record.  So those are the four transactions relating to 
Mr Montana? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Now, there is one transaction relating to 
Mr Gansho? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Now, could you explain to the Chairperson in 
10 
summary form how this took place? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, Mr – in 2011 Chairperson Mr Gansho approached a 
certain Mr Murphy regarding a property which was situated in Durban.  
The purchase of that property in the Point Precinct in Durban and 
Mr Murphy had to depose to  an affidavit searching out the sequence of 
events that led to the sale of that unit and a copy Mr Murphy’s affidavit 
was also attached to the papers, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Now, Mr Murphy had nothing to do – was he the 
owner of that property? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, Mr Murphy had placed a unit including the furniture 
20 
and fittings, I think he was the owner, Chair.  Approached Mr Murphy, if I 
recall Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Oh, sorry.  It was owned by the scattered Murphy 
Family Rrust. 
MS NGOYE:   That is right, sir he was ...[intervenes].  
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 199 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   What was Mr Murphy’s role in that? 
MS NGOYE:   Let me just find it here, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   I suppose given the names he would have been 
associated with his trusts. 
MS NGOYE:   Well, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Yes.  What was the selling price of this property? 
MS NGOYE:   It was three million and fifty thousand. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Now, that was placed on sale? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And what did Mr Gansho do in relation to that 
10 
property? 
MS NGOYE:   Mr Gansho approached Mr Murphy and indicated an interest 
in purchasing the property, Chair.  As well as the furniture, some furniture 
that was in the property. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And did he visit the property, Mr Gansho? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, he visited the unit on several occasions Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And eventually the negotiations were concluded, 
what did Mr Gansho do at the conclusion of those negotiations? 
MS NGOYE:   So, Mr Gansho for the first-time informed Mr Murphy that 
he was not in fact the purchaser of the property.  Mr Gansho advised Mr 
20 
Murphy that Mr van der Walt would contact Mr Murphy and provide further 
details. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Then what happened next? 
MS NGOYE:   So, Mr Murphy was the contacted by Mr van der Walt who 
advised that the purchaser was to be an entity called Grand Tower Trade 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 200 of 211 
 
and invest all four (Pty) Ltd.  Mr van der Walt is the sole Director and 
shareholder of Grand Tower and confirmation to that he has attached to 
the papers, Chair, of directorship from the auditors of Grand Tower. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Alright.  If the sale was negotiated between 
Mr Gansho and Mr Murphy, am I right? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct.  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And in regard to the payments who made the 
payments? 
MS NGOYE:   The chance relating to the payments of the purchase price 
when he negotiates and agreed with Mr van der Walt, Chair, as a 
10 
representative of Grand Tower. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And was there then an agreement that was 
concluded? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  So, Mr Murphy and the Grand Tower 
concluded their agreement for the sale and purchase of that unit and 
furniture and fittings and the agreements are also provided, Chair.  How 
can they not provide it? 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   In regard to, so we know now the property was not 
in Mr Gansho’s name but in the name of Grand Towers. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   What is the link though that the investigations were 
still able to establish between Mr Gansho and that property on the 
Waterfront? 
MS NGOYE:   But, Mr van der Walt has been the link, Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 201 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Now, in relation to Mr Gansho and the property, if 
you look at paragraph 21.56 and property. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes.  There was an e-mail that was addressed by 
Mr Gansho to the Reverend Maromo and in that e-mail Mr Gansho wrote, 
“Visit the following link for information on your 
accommodation my apartment is C7 to 10.  Enjoy 
every moment if any questions or need anything just 
call me.”  
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   What would that appear to indicate?  That e-mail? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, that effectively Mr Gansho you know was the owner 
10 
because you do not lease somebody else’s property Chair or invite people 
to occupy somebody’s property if you are not necessarily the owner 
thereof. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI(SC):   Now, 
after 
the 
investigation 
started, 
was 
Mr Gansho interviewed by PRASA or the investigators? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And what did he say during that interview? 
MS NGOYE:   Mr Gansho in fact on the 12t h of August 2016 he says when 
I first saw the apartment [intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Oh, sorry.  Before I go into that.  Was the interview 
20 
with Mr Gansho recorded? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair.  The investigators and this is you know 
obviously during the forensic investigation that was done by Wilsons. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And now what you are now reading is what? 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 202 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   A transcript of the interview with Mr Gansho which was held 
on the 12 t h of August 2016. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   What does he say then? 
MS NGOYE:   Read into the record.  
“You see, when I first saw the apartment, we were 
busy with our 2010 projects at the time so at some 
point [intervenes].”  
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Sorry, the 2010 projects being what? 
MS NGOYE:   Would be those projects, the development of the stations, 
Chair, in relation to phase one of the project and the extension of the 
10 
pilot phase. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   So, he says – he says at some point we would be made 
missing.  Sorry, at some point we would be made missing our flights 
coming back because of the durations of the meetings and all that.  One 
of the colleagues in Durban said at the waterfront where people can stay 
we used to sleep in different apartments there.  So we slept there and at 
one time I went there with the family and then he looked at the place the I 
got curious, I asked which one of these apartments are selling.  Mr 
Murphy said he is selling in that I think it is C10.  We went in there, we 
20 
looked at it, if we came there on a Thursday or a Friday we sleep over on 
Saturday then we will invite some of the guys who we were with at the 
meetings.  One of the guys who was – who wants went there whose Mr it 
does not show. It does not reflect it is not audible I do not know his name 
is he is Alvin.  He is from Siyagena.  In one instance I think it is 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 203 of 211 
 
Mr Mellerkamp, so you really got interest in this particular apartment and 
then I approached Mr Murphy to say I would like to buy this then this 
Alvin guy said he is also interested, their company is also interested and 
he said you look very much interested in this and I said yes I am but I 
think it is too steep for me to be acquiring it.  He said okay, but do you 
like this flat?  And I said yes I do, then he said okay that is fine and then 
I approached this guy Murphy.  I said Craig I am really interested in this 
apartment.  So we went into the whole nitty-gritty’s of it.  The next thing I 
hear Alvin saying you can get that flat.  Then when you are ready said 
okay you can buy the flat and then we get it to be acquired by the 
10 
company he said, it will not be a problem for us as the company acquire 
the flat and then maybe at some point when you are ready for it we can 
talk.  I said okay that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   So, putting the whole whatever he said in that 
interview in context what seems to have happened? 
MS NGOYE:   Mr, what seems to have happened also here Chairperson is 
that Mr Gansho was the assistant in purchasing that property as well. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   But the Property was purchased in the name of 
Grand Canyon? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair.  He showed interest in the property 
20 
and yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who was the owner of this Grand Tower? 
MS NGOYE:   It does say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we know? 
MS NGOYE:   I do not. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 204 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Mr van der Walt, Mr Chairperson you will see that 
at 21.55. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five - five? 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   21.55, yes, Chairperson 
MS NGOYE:   Grand Tower, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Grand Tower.  Mr van der Walt was the 
representative of Grand Tower. 
MS NGOYE:   Was the representative of - Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, is there something that tells us whether he was a 
director or just acting for them?  Do you know? 
10 
MS NGOYE:   We can check that, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   van der Walt was a director of Grand Tower or whether 
he was just acting as an attorney for them? 
MS NGOYE:   We will check that, Chair.  I cannot seem to remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But the transaction relating to Mr Gansho unless 
its - it connects with PRASA or somebody at PRASA, why would it be 
relevant?  Or does it – does it connect?  Let me ask the witness. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair.  What we deduced from this transaction you 
know the involvement of Mr van der Walt in assisting Mr Gansho in 
obtaining this property and also the fact that this was during that time 
20 
where Siyagena was really involved in the transactions in PRASA and you 
will recall Chairperson as part of the evidence that we gave that Mr van 
der Walt I mean Mr Gansho was the one that was really pushing the 
transactions was for Siyagena to be concluded with PRASA.  So 
connection was then made you know in relation to his participation in the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 205 of 211 
 
Siyagena transaction and in the involvement of Mr van der Walt in this 
respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How much was this last property again?  With respect 
to the price? 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   About three million. 
MS NGOYE:   Three million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About? 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Three million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Three million.  Yes, but I am not sure that I understand 
why it is relevant. 
10 
MS NGOYE:   Well [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it does not connect anybody from PRASA to it or 
PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:   It connects to Siyagena to a person through Mr van der 
Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS NGOYE:   So that is how you know the way we interpreted this 
particular transaction that was a form of gratuity that Mr – Mr – Mr 
...[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Gansho. 
20 
MS NGOYE:   Mr Gansho was receiving in relation to his relationship to 
Siyagena.  So, they assisted him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it not part of, I thought he was part Siyagena? 
MS NGOYE:   No, Mr Gansho is an employee at PRASA, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 206 of 211 
 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then let me, then I must have missed that part clearly. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   You did, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay, okay, because he was the one who was 
asking Mr Montana for approvals of certain, okay no I think I got mixed up 
at some stage. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, no.  So, the theory is he is getting his 
share? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And you will see Chairperson at page 376 that 
where part of the transcript is he talks about a person called Alvin from 
Siyagena. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am at 376. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Yes, about six lines from the top Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   I do not know his surname he is Alvin, he is from 
Siyagena, and then about 4 lines later he says that this Alvin guy said he 
is also interested in the company and he said if you are interested then 
we can get the property. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Well, I see, 
- I see that Mr Gansho was suspended in April 2014. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that after these transactions? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, it was after the transactions, Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 207 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they were discovered. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And ultimately what happened to him? 
MS NGOYE:   Well, he was dismissed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was found guilty for what? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, he was found guilty of in his conduct and in relation to 
[indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:   in relation to his powers in his transactions 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and was his disciplinary hearing checked by an 
10 
outsider? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A lawyer? 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we can get the – see 
MS NGOYE:   And we can get the transcripts.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, shall we just get that? 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Mr Chairperson may I then conclude this with and I 
20 
know I have overstayed my welcome here but 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   I – I as you pointed out Mr Chairperson these are 
the small things that paint a rather clear picture of what probably 
happened at PRASA.  Going a bit back to your supplementary affidavit. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 208 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see Mr Soni, I am not the only one who is poor in 
estimating time.  I see we are at five now. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And twenty minutes has become forty minutes. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   This will 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us round off that is fine.  Let us round off 
properly. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   That is fine.  So, you then make the point which we 
made earlier in paragraph 48 relating to the link between the Siyagena 
and Mr Moodley that Siyagena paid five hundred and fifty million rand to 
10 
Railway Trading which shares is the same address as Royal Security 
when it was directed to Mr Moodley. 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Two other points that I want to make at this stage 
is [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When was that payment made?  Do you know? 
MS NGOYE:   No, I – I do not have the date, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have the year? 
MS NGOYE:   No, I cannot remember the year, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is important because you know when you place some 
20 
of these transactions may be important. 
MS NGOYE:   I will find out, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 209 of 211 
 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Now, you make the point that the all these matters 
including these properties transactions were reported to the police, would 
I be correct? 
MS NGOYE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   And as far as you know no arrests have been made 
and no prosecutions have been started? 
MS NGOYE:   Not yet. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Well the last point that you make is that you have 
grave difficulty here and in the High Court in respect of the review 
application in regard to painting a full picture.  Would you tell the 
10 
Chairperson in essence what the difficulties were? 
MS NGOYE:   Chair, the challenges that we had in finding information at 
PRASA were grave because you keno the information was just not there 
really so we struggled when we took these papers to Court.  What we 
understood had transpired was that a Mr Montana had a special IT 
services an employee who was really looking after his IT related issues, 
Mr Tusi, I will get his surname now.  His name is ...[indistinct] he was one 
of PRASA’s IT specialists, that is paragraph 52, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS NGOYE:   Who it was found that he on the instruction of Mr Montana 
20 
had deleted information at PRASA on PRASA’s service relating to 
anything related to information pertaining Mr Montana and a lot of the 
information that was required for these transactions.  So wilfully what 
happened was that he was then disciplined as well and he was found 
guilty and he was dismissed.  So you know the struggles with the 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 210 of 211 
 
information were there because they were destroyed and I think that 
Chair having reference to Mr – Dr Molofe’s information expresses the 
same you know difficulties as well and frustrations around getting 
information at PRASA.  So, we were also saddled with that problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well then please make available that decision in 
relation to Mr Holele Dinsgwayo. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, because that disciplinary hearing was also conducted 
by an external party so the recordings will be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is important now. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Mr Chairperson that then is the evidence at this 
10 
stage, the first stage and as I indicated earlier today, Chairperson.  The 
next stage we will try and wrap up all the evidence relating to PRASA 
including the loose end from here which is why we thought it may be 
better to ask you if we can then adjourn today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  We will find some time in the next few 
months for a lot to have for to continue with this second session. 
ADV VAS SONI(SC):   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Miss Ngoye do try to go find information as to 
when that five hundred and fifty million rand was paid. 
MS NGOYE:   I will do, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and the of course next time you will still deal with 
the question of what if anything has changed in PRASA. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair.  That is definitely.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Since these times. 
MS NGOYE:   Yes, Chair. 
17 MARCH 2020 – DAY 225 
 
Page 211 of 211 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you very much.  It has been a long day 
MS NGOYE:   It has. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it has been two long days for you and we will 
continue on the days that will be announced so let us leave it at that.  
Then we adjourn the proceedings for the day. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
