ADV HULLEY SC:  We are ready to proceed Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair this morning’s or todays’ 
session is going to concern the evidence of Brigadier 
Ncube.  He has been granted leave to cross-examine Mr 
10 
McBride.  The evidence of General Mabula will also be led 
today and he is being implicated by Mr McBride and 
General Booysen and Mr Chair you have granted leave to – 
for him to cross-examine both of those witnesses.  Mr 
Chair there are quite a few bundles but hopefully we can 
get through all the bundles with quite – quite briefly.  There 
is the bundles in relation to Mr – sorry in relation to 
General Booysen and that is the Z series of bundles.  Then 
there is the bundle of Mr McBride and that is a YA –D 
series and then there is some additional bundles that have 
20 
been created in the – specifically in relation to Brigadier 
Ncube and in relation to General Mabula.  They range from 
Y17 all the way up to Y26.  The – we anticipate that the 
evidence will not be too long but of course one cannot 
always make an accurate assessment at the beginning.  I 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 4 of 233 
 
will commence with leading the evidence of Brigadier 
Ncube.  I will ask that he be called to the stand.

ADV HULLEY SC:  Good morning Brigadier. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Good morning. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Do I understand that you are still 
presently a Brigadier? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I would like to take you if you will to 
Bundle LEA17.  If you turn and look behind you you should 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 5 of 233 
 
see such a bundle.  I understand it is in front of you.  My 
apologies.  The very document – bundle in front of you. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  This one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair it is Bundle LEA17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley will you please tell your team 
to also write bundle. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I will indeed do so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle LEA17. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I trust that by early next week we would 
have sorted out this problem relating to the bundles Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can tell you that on not writing 
bundle you are not the only ones. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think yesterday we had a similar 
situation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now Brigadier if you would be so kind 
as to turn to page LEA17 and if you look at the top left 
hand corner there is a page numbering system it is page 4.  
It is in black.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page 4? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 6 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Page 4.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I am there Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Are you looking at the top left hand 
corner? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see at – you will see one number on 
the top left corner it is in black and then there will be 
another one on the top right hand corner it will be red so 
when Mr Hulley refers you to page numbers he will refer to 
– he will be referring to the black number on the top left 
corner. 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I am following that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and although it says 004 he will 
just say page 4.  He will not mention the zeros.  You got it? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson I am there now in terms 
of the black colour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  The page I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay so keep that open Sir with your 
left hand and then with your right hand if you would not 
20 
mind turning to page 27 of the same document.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson I am on page 27. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the signature that appears below 
the – the heading this – thus done and signed on this … 
day of May 2019 at Rosebank above the name Pharasa 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 7 of 233 
 
Daniel Ncube is that your signature? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And is that the affidavit that you or the 
statement that you have deposed to? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And you confirm that this statement is 
true and correct to the best of your knowledge? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now Brigadier what I am going to do is 
I am going to take you through – through your statement 
10 
but I am going to highlight the pertinent aspects of your 
statement and then I am going to ask you some questions 
in relation to the pertinent aspects.  The – if I understand 
correctly you have been – you have set out in your affidavit 
or in the statement at page 2 what the purpose of this 
application is or the purpose of your application was.  You 
see that?  Under the heading B. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Which page – sorry Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry Chair the side – I have said page 
2 exactly page 5. 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Of the same statement? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Of the same statement. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes Chairperson I am there on page 
5. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You have dealt on page 6 the following 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 8 of 233 
 
page with your educational background. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if you turn – if you proceed to page 
– sorry – to page 15 you will see there you deal with the 
appointment of the investigation team.  Have you got it 
page 15 top left hand corner at the foot of the page you 
see your heading there:  Appointment to the investigation 
team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page 15? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Look right at the bottom of the page. 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page 15? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  On page 15.  You have got the right 
page Sir or at least you had it.  Look at the bottom of the 
page.  You will see the heading Appointment to the 
investigation team. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson and I 
have seen it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the specific issue that you have 
been called here to – to respond to relates to the 
allegations that have been made by Mr McBride who was at 
20 
– who was at IPID the Executive Director of IPID at a point 
in time.  That correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now if I understand correctly and if you 
could turn back to – with me to page 11 of the same 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 9 of 233 
 
document.  Between the years 2008 and 2009 you were the 
Section Commander of the Phokeng Organised Crime Unit. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And between 2009 and 2013 you were 
the Unit Commander of the Klerksdorp Organised Crime 
Unit. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Which page are you? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The following page on page 12. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then on page 13 between 2013 and 
10 
you said to date but I imagine that the date that you 
referring to was the date of the signing of this statement 
you were the – you were the Unit Commander of the 
Tlhabane Organised Crime Unit.  Is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Not to date because it is proceed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Ja it is 2013 to date. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And I imagine that the date is May of 
2018 when you signed this affidavit, is that right? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No Chairperson because when I 
20 
signed it I was not – I was no more the Branch Commander 
but the Provincial Head Commercial Crime North West. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Sorry where is that referred to 
over here?  I am just – what year was that?  When did you 
become the Branch Commander? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 10 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Of Phokeng? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Of Commercial Crime. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Of Phokeng? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  2013 Chairperson I was the Branch 
Commander of Organised Crime Phokeng. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So let us just go back then to that 
heading that you have got.  You have got it in bold face 
2013 to date.  It says Unit Commander Thlabane Organised 
Crime Unit.  Are you saying that that is incorrect? 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson it is incorrect because 
currently I am the Provincial Head Commercial Crime North 
West Province. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Let me just understand that – the 
Thlabane Organised Crime Unit were you ever the Unit 
Commander of that unit? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And what was the time period of that? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson I cannot remember but I 
think it was from 2000 – 2013. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay and when did you become the – 
when did you become the Provincial Head of the – do I 
understand correctly did you say the DPCI? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, no.  I become the Provincial 
Head Commercial Crime Chairperson of the North West 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 11 of 233 
 
detectives. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And when was that? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What year was that? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I think it is 2017 Chairperson.  I am 
not actually sure but I think it is 2017. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Now in 2016 when you 
commenced the investigation or when you were made part 
of the team that was conducting the investigation into the 
security breach at the acting National Commissioner ’s 
10 
residence where were you stationed at that point? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I was stationed at Provincial – as a 
Provincial Head Commercial Crime Chairperson.  That is 
why I said the time when I was appointed the year maybe it 
is before 2017 because when – when we carry out this 
investigation I was already the Provincial Head Commercial 
Crime Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  And at that point in time you 
happened to be stationed in the North West Province, 
correct? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now in – if I understand correctly you 
had been involved in a number of operations together with 
certain other members that were involved in this particular 
team to conduct the investigation into the security breach 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 12 of 233 
 
at the acting National Commissioner ’s residence.  Is that 
correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Perhaps can I just ask to be re – 
your question to be repeated so that I can be able to 
understand it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You had been appointed to a team from 
the North West that was conducting an investigation into a 
security breach that apparently took place at the acting 
National Commissioner ’s residence, is that correct? 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And do you recall the date on which you 
were appointed to that team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson I – I cannot remember 
the date but it was during November 2016. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now prior to that had – and sorry if I 
can just take you to the letter of appointment.  I believe it 
is in – in General Ncube – so sorry General Mabula’s 
statement.  If you will turn with me if you look behind you 
there is a bundle behind you and if you look at LEA26.  
20 
Now if you would turn with me Mr Chair to page 35 of that 
bundle?  Got it? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No not yet. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Top left hand corner. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Okay.  I have got it Chairperson. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 13 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now this is a document that is attached 
to the affidavit or the statement of General Mabula.  It is 
addressed to the Deputy Provincial Commissioner Crime 
Detection South African Police Service North West and the 
heading of the letter is Mandate to conduct investigation 
security threat against the acting National Commissioner 
counter and security intelligence inquiry 2/10/2016.  Do 
you see that document? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I see the document Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now do you – have you seen this 
10 
document previously? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And do you see – did you see it at the 
time that you happened to be appointed to the team that 
was set up to investigate this threat? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Can the question be repeated 
Chairperson? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You were appointed if I understand 
correctly on the 30 November of 2016.  My question is did 
you see it at that point in time when you were appointed to 
20 
the team in other words on the 30 t h November 2016? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson my appointment I was 
contacted maybe before the letter by Major General Mabula 
to inform me that the former Provincial Commissioner of 
the North West Lieutenant General Motswenyane have 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 14 of 233 
 
given him instruction to formulate investigation team and 
he has nominated me to be part of that team. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay so when you say you were 
contacted. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Before the letter? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Was it on the – was it before you saw 
the letter or was it before the 30 November? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No it was before the 30 November 
10 
Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And do you recall the date? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I cannot recall the date Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Was it one or two days, three days, a 
week? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No I think it was the end of the week 
and the next week I think the 30 t h – was the next week. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Right.  Now if you turn to paragraph 2 
of that letter you will see he talks about the appointment 
the 
heading 
is 
Appointment 
of 
team 
to 
conduct 
20 
investigation and it says: 
“I hereby appoint the following members to 
conduct the investigation and to report the 
findings and recommendation to my office.  
And then it is 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 15 of 233 
 
2.1 Major General NJ Mabula 
2.2 Brigadier CM Kgorane  
2.3 Brigadier PD Ncube 
2.4 Colonel SM Reddy 
2.5 Lieutenant Colonel I Dawood.” 
Is it correct that this particular investigation was conducted 
by that team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And on your understanding who was the 
leader of the team? 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  The leader of the team Chairperson 
was General Mabula. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And on your understanding the – the 
investigation that had to be conducted was an investigation 
into a security threat, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct and also a threat on 
the 
life 
of 
the 
former 
acting 
National 
Commissioner 
General Phahlane. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Now what my – to go back to the 
earlier question that I had asked you in relation to this 
20 
team.  Had you conducted investigations previously with 
the other members of this team as part of a team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No Chairperson as a team? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  As a team. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Ja part of that team that I am in that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 16 of 233 
 
team? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No Chairperson. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
And 
had 
you 
conducted 
any 
investigations as part of a team outside of your province 
with any of these members whether they are all the 
members or only some of the members? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson yes.  In terms of 
General Mabula. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Hm. 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I have – there was a team that he 
led actually he did not – I must put it – it was a team that 
investigate Cato Manor cases in KwaZulu Natal I was also 
called to be part of the team. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Any other teams – any other 
investigations? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No the rest of the members on this 
they were not – they were not part of that team.  They were 
not part of the – that Cato Manor team. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  But did you and General Mabula 
20 
or you and any of these other members as part of a team 
conduct any investigations outside of the North West 
Province? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Current? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Not currently before – before this 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 17 of 233 
 
investigation had you ever conducted an investigation as 
part of a team with any of these members whether it is with 
one member, two members or all the members outside of 
the North West Province? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson I only remember the one 
of the Cato Manor. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the Cato Manor investigation that 
was down in KwaZulu Natal, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And do you recall how you got to be 
10 
involved in that team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Could you tell us? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  It was – actually I was called 
because there was an operation that was need to take 
place in terms of effecting arrests. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And pursuant to … 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 And 
I 
was 
also 
part 
of 
the 
investigation doing the investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And pursuant to that investigation you 
20 
happened to arrest General Booysen if I recall correctly? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if my memory serves me right you 
in fact arrested him on two occasions.  Once in 2012 and 
once subsequent to that, is that correct? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 18 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  The second arrest Chairperson I 
cannot remember whether he was warned to appear but I 
know that there was a second incident that I was also 
involved but I – I cannot remember exactly whether it was 
arrest or whether it was a warning for him to appear in 
court.  But I know there was two occasions. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Brigadier if you could just speak 
into the microphone, I am told that your voice – people are 
not picking up your voice. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I will do that. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you.  Now if you would turn – go 
back to Bundle LEA17.  Now you say at the top of that 
page – at page 16 you say at the top of that page that: 
“During December of 2016 I was informed 
by Major General Mabula I was elected to 
form part of the investigation team that was 
to investigate a security breach at the 
residential place [Sable Hills, Waterfront 
Estate] 
of 
former 
acting 
National 
Commissioner 
Lieutenant 
General 
JK 
20 
Phahlane.” 
You see that? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I see it Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now is the date that you have indicated 
there correct because if I understand correctly you say – 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 19 of 233 
 
you testified a moment ago that you had in fact been 
informed that you would be part of this team prior to – prior 
to 30 November 2016? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson not part of the team 
prior.  I was informed before the 30 t h and we commenced 
on the 30 t h up to the… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So did… 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
In 
terms 
of 
during 
December 
Chairperson.  It is incorrect it is supposed to be during 
November. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So this date over here in paragraph 10 
of your statement is incorrect it should in fact be during 
November? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And your understanding was that the 
investigation had – had been mandated by whom? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  It was mandated by the acting 
Divisional Commissioner by then of Crime Intelligence 
Chairperson Major General Mahele [?]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now – and who had authorised the 
20 
appointment of a team from North West to come and 
conduct an investigation in respect of an incident that 
apparently took place in Gauteng? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That was supposed to be approved 
Chairperson by the Provincial Commissioner North West 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 20 of 233 
 
Lieutenant General Motswenyane. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Once the team had been established 
were there any meetings that took place immediately after 
the team had been established?  In other words, a meeting 
between you, the other members of the team and any – any 
additional party? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  The first thing that have happened 
Chairperson Major General Mabula facilitate the meeting 
with Crime Intelligence with the investigation team.  That is 
the briefing meeting.  Crime Intelligence briefing the 
10 
investigation team. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So there was a meeting with Crime 
Intelligence investigation team and that regarded as a 
briefing session? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson.  That is 
the Crime Intelligence team that investigated the threat 
assessment against former acting National Commissioner 
General Phahlane. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Were you present at that meeting? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I was present Chairperson. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And were the other members of your 
team also present? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And who was present from Crime 
Intelligence? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 21 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson when I – my memory 
serve me well it was the acting herself Major General 
Mahele [?], Brigadier Motswenyane.  I cannot remember the 
other members.  I remember the two. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  But you are saying that at least 
those two people were present, Makhele and Motswenyane? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Are you saying that were additional 
people from Crime Intelligence, you just do not remember 
their names or are you saying that you do not remember 
10 
whether there were additional people? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, I think there were additional but I 
cannot remember their names.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes.  And when they gave you a briefing 
– I can imagine that the briefing was given to your team by 
Crime Intelligence? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And who was speaking? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Brigadier Motswenyane.  He was the 
one was briefing the team with regards to the investigation. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And other than to speak was there a 
presentation of any sorts?  Was there either a slide-show or 
was there a pack?  Was there documents that were 
presented? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, Chairperson they present to us

but he provide... he provide also copies of emails that they 
allege it was certain emails that was sent to the former 
Acting National Commissioner. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And at that stage, what did you 
understand to be the concern, other than the threatening 
emails? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, the briefing was to the 
effect that a vehicle, a Ford Kuga, went to Sable Hills where 
the former Acting National Commissioner stayed and it went 
to actually the service entrance, trying to enter the estate 
10 
and it was referred to the main gate. 
 
The occupants were four occupants according to the 
briefing of Crime Intelligence.  There was one white male, 
one white female and two African males who went into the 
estate and looking the estate manager.  And... 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Ja? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  And when they arrived at the estate 
manager, they introduced themselves as members from IPID.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  But remember, we are still talking at this 
stage about the briefing session. 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  This is what was... were you informed 
about this at the briefing session? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, we were informed about this at 
the briefing session and they went also to the same... 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 23 of 233 
 
actually, they give us how it happened in terms of the visit of 
these four people to the estate. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And they get... we know that they gave 
you certain emails that of a threatening nature. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, they give us emails that they 
allege it was threatening emails that they said emails was 
actually sent by one individual Paul O’Sullivan to the Acting 
National Commissioner and the email was part of the 
investigation, the threat investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The emails were part of the threat 
10 
investigations.  That, in other words, the threat investigation 
that you had to conduct, your team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you spoke earlier on about a 
security assessment.  Just explain what you are referring to. 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
I 
said 
they 
were 
briefing 
us 
Chairperson in terms of the security assessment they have 
done on the acting... the Acting National Commissioner. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And when you say they, you are referring 
to Crime Intelligence that conducted such assessment? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if I understand, what was the 
conclusion or the assessment that Crime Intelligence had 
reached? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  They, according to them, they reached 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 24 of 233 
 
that there was a breach of security with related to the former 
Acting National Commissioner’s life. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now what was it... so Crime Intelligence, 
if I understand it correctly, has come to the conclusion which 
they communicated to you, your team in this briefing session 
that there was a threat to the life of Acting National 
Commissioner.  Do I understand that correctly? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And your function in relation to the 
conclusion of the assessment that had been conducted by 
10 
Crime Intelligence was to do what? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Was to conduct investigation in 
relation to a threat imposed to the life of the former Acting 
National Commissioner, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Was it supposed to be a criminal 
investigation 
or 
was 
it 
supposed... 
was 
it 
something 
different? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, we... because we were 
having the emails and the briefing, we did not open a 
criminal docket.  We opened an inquiry docket. 
20 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
Now 
once 
the 
investigation 
was 
conducted, on your understanding and based on what 
transpired at the briefing session, what were you supposed 
to do once you had completed your investigation? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, maybe I must give how it 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 25 of 233 
 
has 
happened 
in 
terms 
of 
this 
investigation? 
 
We 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well... no, no.  Let us step a step back.  
At the briefing session you were informed of the threat 
assessment that... or the security assessment that had been 
conducted by Crime Intelligence.   
 
Crime Intelligence came to the conclusion that there was 
a threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner.  
Your instruction or your mandate was to conduct an 
investigation.   
10 
 
If I understand correctly, it was an investigation into the 
threat of the life of the Acting National Commissioner. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now once you had completed your 
investigation, according to the instruction that you had been 
given at that briefing session, what were you then to do? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is why Chairperson I said let me 
explain how did we approach it from that team in that 
investigation.   
 
The approach... Chairperson, after the briefing of Crime 
20 
Intelligence, General Mabula, the lead... the team leader 
then suggested to us – because during the briefing it was 
indicated that it is believed that the people who entered the 
Sable Hills are members of IPID, according to the briefing. 
 
And General Mabula indicated to us to say, after the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 26 of 233 
 
briefing, let us make an appointment with DPP Pretoria.  He 
said to us, let us go and brief the DPP regarding this 
investigation.  The reason being, there was on public domain 
that IPID is investigating the Acting National Commissioner. 
 
So for us to investigate this threat assessment, let us 
brought the DPP onboard so that our action must not been 
seen as action countering the investigation of IPID. 
 
Then we went and briefed Advocate Mzinyathi.  It was 
myself and Major General Mabula and Colonel Kgorane. 
 
We briefed him in terms of what Crime Intelligence has 
10 
briefed us and also in terms of the email that they allege was 
the threaten email. 
 
And Advocate Mzinyathi indicated to us that to him this 
is a very serious allegation that need to be investigated and 
then he indicated to us to say he will allocate an advocate to 
the team and he divulged the name that time, to say 
Advocate Nemaorane will be assigned to the team.  It is then 
that we commenced with the investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So if I understand correctly what - 
pursuant to the question that I had asked earlier on – there 
20 
was not necessarily an instruction given to you at the 
briefing session about what the investigation should entail.  
That was left to the team.  Do I understand that correctly? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, in terms of the investigation.  
Chairperson, the Crime Intelligence, they do not have the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 27 of 233 
 
skills in terms of crime investigation.  That is why there was 
a team nominated now to investigate in terms of crime 
investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  And at that briefing session, was 
there any instruction given to?  I am not, at this point in 
time, concerned with what happens after the briefing 
session.  I want to know at the briefing was there an 
instruction given to you about what you should do once the 
investigation is complete? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  There was no specific instruction in 
10 
terms of that Chairperson but the... our team leader, General 
Mabula, he was communicating with General Makhele in 
terms of giving the feedback, not in writing but verbal 
feedback in terms of the progress. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the date of the briefing session, do 
you recall what that date was? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  If I remember well Chairperson, I think 
it was the 30t h of November 2016. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the meeting with Advocate Mzinyathi 
in Pretoria, do you recall what date was? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, I cannot recall.  I think 
what happened, we had a meeting with Crime Intelligence 
early in the morning and when, after that meeting, General 
Mabula conducted Advocate Mzinyathi, allowed us to come 
and see him at his office on the same day. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 28 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you travelled to Pretoria to meet with 
Advocate Mzinyathi on the 30 t h of November? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, Chairperson we were already 
there in terms of the briefing of Crime Intelligence. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you say... sorry.  That the briefing 
with Crime Intelligence took place in Pretoria.  So you simple 
travelled to the offices of the DPP? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I see sir.  Now let us just move forward 
now to deal with the actual investigation that was conducted.  
10 
You would have a meeting first with your team leader, 
General Mabula, to discuss the way forward.  Is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  We did not have a meeting with him 
Chairperson because as I said, if... when he contacted me in 
terms of the instruction of the former provincial head, he 
already brief me to say:  “That this is the investigation that 
we are going to conduct but I will convene the meeting with 
Crime Intelligence for the briefing of the team”. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But after the briefing session, did he call 
a meeting before you went to go and meet with general... oh, 
20 
sorry, with Advocate Mzinyathi or did you leave Crime 
Intelligence straight away after the briefing session and 
simple go to meet with Advocate Mzinyathi? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I cannot recall but after the meeting 
yes we had seen him Chairperson after the meeting with 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 29 of 233 
 
Crime Intelligence but I cannot recall that General Mabula 
had called a meeting after we met with Crime Intelligence. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the actual investigation itself, did 
that investigation entail... was there a meeting that was held 
between General Mabula and the rest of the team to explain 
how the investigation was going to unfold and to share the 
responsibility of who is going to do what? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No meeting to that effect but myself, 
Colonel Dawood and Brigadier Kgorane, Chairperson, our 
duties was of investigators.  Colonel Ready, actually he is 
10 
from legal service.  He was just part of the team in terms of 
legal opinions.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  And were there subsequent meetings 
held where you provided feedback to General Mabula of your 
investigations that you have conducted? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, I would not say it is 
meeting but we will, from time to time, when we are... we 
went and obtained statement, we will brief General Mabula 
as a team. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
When 
did 
you 
complete 
your 
20 
investigations? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, what have happened, as 
I have said, we registered inquiry, inquiry docket.  It was not 
a 
criminal 
docket. 
 
After 
we... 
we 
commenced 
with 
investigation.   We went to Sable Hill to interview people that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 30 of 233 
 
Crime Intelligence has indicated they were interviewed.   
 
Their 
statements 
were 
obtained 
and 
after 
their 
statements... 
after 
we 
have 
conducted 
preliminary 
investigation with regard to the inquiry docket, then we met 
with the advocate that Advocate Mzinyathi has allocated or 
assigned to the team.  That is Advocate Nemaorane.   
 
It was not long after we have commenced, after we have 
done the preliminary, then we presented the statement 
before Advocate Nemaorane and in that presentation of 
statements, 
Advocate 
Nemaorane 
came 
with 
Advocate 
10 
Johnson.  T 
 
They perused the statements in our presence and then 
they indicated to us to proceed with the investigation to 
complete it and we must bring back the inquiry docket to 
them.   
 
I 
cannot 
remember 
when 
did 
we 
complete 
the 
investigation but what had happened is, after the completion 
of the inquiry, we submitted again back to them.  Then they 
perused the file and they indicated to us:  “No, we are of the 
opinion there is a case to be answered here”.   
20 
 
And they advised us to register a docket.  Then we went 
to register a criminal docket.  And they said to us:  “After you 
register a criminal docket, bring it to us for us now to 
decide”.   
 
We registered the docket and the docket was submitted 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 31 of 233 
 
before them.  It was with Advocate Nemaorane.  Then 
Advocate Nemaorane, after they perused the docket, they 
phoned General Mabula, the team leader, to say:  “Your 
docket has been allocated to Advocate Mashuga.  The team 
can make appointment to see Advocate Mashuga”.  That is 
how it had unfolded Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So if I understand correctly, you had 
meetings with Advocate Nemaorane after an initial set of 
investigations and then you had subsequent meetings with 
Advocate Johnson.  And what was the other advocate’s 
10 
name? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, the meeting with Advocate 
Johnson... 
as 
Advocate 
Mzinyathi 
indicated 
to 
us 
Chairperson that Advocate Nemaorane is allocated to the 
team.  After we had done the preliminary investigation, we 
met with Advocate Nemaorane but at that meeting, Advocate 
Johnson was part of it when it would prevent now the 
preliminary investigation to Advocate Nemaorane. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Do you recall the date of that meeting 
where the preliminary investigation report was given? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, there was no report given.  When I 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry, when I say report, what you had 
reported to Advocate Nemaorane. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, no.  We presented the statement 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 32 of 233 
 
Chairperson.  We did not... we went... the preliminary 
investigation was conducted in terms of obtaining the 
statement at Sable Hill.  Then we presented that statement 
to them and they indicated to us, we must proceed, complete 
the investigation in terms of the inquiry and we must bring 
the inquiry back to them. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And at what stage did they decide that a 
criminal docket should be opened? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I think it was in January 2017 
Chairperson. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now let me understand.  By January of 
2017 when they advised you to open a criminal docket, by 
that stage, they were of the opinion that there is a case to be 
answered here. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But at the preliminary investigations or 
the preliminary... pardon me.  At the presentation that you 
had given at the preliminary investigation stage, at that 
stage, they were... they felt that you must conduct further 
investigations. 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Did they express a view as to whether 
there was a case to be made at that stage or were, they 
uncertain? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, they did not indicate to us at that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 33 of 233 
 
stage when it was at the stage of the inquiry docket when we 
presented to them at the preliminary stage. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now speaking about reports, did you at 
any stage, either in 2016 or before the criminal docket was 
opened, did you at any stage present – and when I say you, I 
mean you and/or the rest of your team – present a report 
relating to the investigation that you had conducted at any 
point in time? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Can the question be repeated? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I want to know whether a report was 
10 
compiled?  And by report, I mean something that was either 
typed or written up in some form that was presented either to 
the NPA, alternatively, to anybody within the SAPS, whether 
it be Crime Intelligence, whether it be North West or anybody 
else?   
 
Was any written report compiled by you and/or the rest 
of your team relating to the investigation that you had 
conducted up until the end of 2016, the beginning of 2017 
before the criminal docket have been opened? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, I cannot remember when 
20 
was that report drafted but when the Acting National 
Commissioner Mothiba came in, a report was drafted and we 
highlighted.   
 
But I do not know in which stage, whether it was at the 
stage where they inquiry docket was... already was the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 34 of 233 
 
docket 
but 
a 
report, 
when 
the 
new 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner came Chairperson, it was submitted to the 
office of Acting National Commissioner.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  So a report was compiled?  It was a 
written report? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  It was a written report. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the report was compiled by you, you 
or your team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  It was the team Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And that report was presented to whom? 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  It was presented to the Acting 
National Commissioner by then, Mothiba.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  And what year was this? 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
I 
cannot 
remember 
the 
year 
Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Are we talking about 2016, 2017 or 2018? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, I... really, I do not want to commit 
myself.  I cannot remember which year was that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So what I am trying to understand for 
present purposes.  At what stage did you and your team 
20 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
having 
conducted 
the 
investigation there was indeed a security threat to the life of 
the then Acting National Commissioner Phahlane? 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
Chairperson, 
I 
will 
answer 
the 
question by saying.  This investigation, it was prosecutorial 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 35 of 233 
 
handled investigation as I have indicated.   
 
From the early stage of the inquiry, Advocate Nemaorane 
was in place.  When the docket was registered it was booked 
to Advocate Mashuga who were guided by them in terms of 
the statement that we had obtained as a team.   
 
We did not include in ourselves to say there is a threat 
against the National Commissioner.  We put the statement 
before prosecutors who decided. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So if I understand your response 
correctly, you are saying that you did not come to the 
10 
conclusion yourself necessarily that there was or was not a 
threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner at the 
time.   
 
Instead, you had just obtained statements.  You have 
placed those statements before members of the NPA for 
them to make that assessment. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson because 
we were investigating whether there is any crime committed 
our investigation team.  That is why after we obtained the 
statement, then we put the statement before the prosecutors 
20 
for the prosecutors to decide. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now let me understand.  At what stage 
did 
it 
come 
about 
that 
your 
investigation 
had 
been 
broadened to determine whether there was any crime 
committed?   
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 36 of 233 
 
 
Had your mandate or the scope of your investigation 
been broadened to determine whether there was any crime 
committed?  My understanding was that your mandate was to 
determine whether there had been a threat to the life of the 
Acting National Commissioner. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson but I 
indicted to say there was all as it is put to me to say:  “Yes, 
that 
was 
the 
mandate 
to 
investigate”. 
 
But 
as 
the 
investigation team, we did take the statement from the 
witnesses that we identified and we put the statement before 
10 
the prosecutors. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes and I understand that but I want to... 
I am asking a slightly different question.  When you were 
initially appointed, I understood that your mandate was to 
determine whether there was a threat to the life of the Acting 
National Commissioner.  That was your mandate.   
 
So what I am asking you now is, was that mandate 
broadened 
to 
include 
whether 
there 
was 
any 
crime 
committed?  That is my question. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, it was not broadened.  It 
20 
was still within the scope. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you then conducted an investigation 
which you have outlined at page 16 paragraph 11.  And you 
have identified the names there of several witnesses from 
whom statements were obtained.  Is that correct? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 37 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And you continue identifying a number of 
witnesses all the way up to page 19 and you identified them 
as Witnesses 1 to 10.  Is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you say there in paragraph 12 that: 
“After the evidence was collected and presented to 
Advocate Nemaorane of the Offices of the DPP and 
on his instructions a criminal case was registered 
under Kameeldrift CAS 12/01/2017 impersonating an 
10 
IPID official...” 
 
Was that your understanding of the case that was 
opened at that stage? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Can you repeat the page for me? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you turn to page 19. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  19.  I am there Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if you look at paragraph 12. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You say that: 
“After the evidence was collected and presented to 
20 
Advocate Nemaorane of the Offices of the DPP and 
on his instructions a criminal case was registered 
under Kameeldrift CAS 12/01/2017 impersonating an 
IPID official...” 
 
Do you see that? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 38 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then you say that: 
“Advocate 
Mashuga 
was 
thereafter 
assigned 
to 
oversee and guide the investigation.  After the 
evidence was gathered it was perused by Advocate 
Mashuga and a J51 for arrest was authorised in 
respect of Paul O’Sullivan and Sarah Jane Trent...” 
 
Now the first part when you were advised to or 
instructed to register a criminal case, why at that stage... 
sorry.   
10 
 
At that stage, your understanding was that it was 
about... the criminal investigation was in respect of the 
impersonation of an IPID official.  Is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the investigation was against Mr 
Paul O’Sullivan and Ms Sarah Trent.  Is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now at this stage, have you or have you 
not concluded at this stage whether alone as your team or 
together with anybody from the NPA’s office, has there been 
20 
a conclusion reached – and when I say conclusion, I mean in 
your minds that there is a security threat to the life of the 
Acting National Commissioner Phahlane at that stage.   
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
Chairperson, 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
charges, I think when the J50 was drawn up Advocate 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 39 of 233 
 
Mashuga also add the charge of intimidation with regard to 
the former Acting National Commissioner General Phahlane 
in terms of the email that was actually sent threatening.  It 
was 
not 
only 
an 
impersonating(?) 
charge 
only, 
Chairperson.  There were other few charges that Adv 
Mashuga drafted.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  So this warrant of arrest, the 
J50 warrant of arrest, when was that prepared, do you 
recall? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I cannot recall but my supporting 
10 
statements for applying – I think it can be in the bundle, it 
can maybe assist in terms of the date. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  If you will just bear with me.  If 
you would turn – if I recall correctly, you applied for a 
warrant of arrest in February of 2017, is that right? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Ja, I think it is 2017, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Just bear with me?  If you would turn 
with me to bundle LEA18.  If you would turn with me to 
page 14.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Page 14? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is right. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, Chairperson, I am on page 14. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now the – pardon me, actually you 
have got to start at page 13.  This is the statement in 
terms of Section 43 of the CPA, that is the Criminal 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 40 of 233 
 
Procedure Act 51 of 1977 and on page 14 are the 
particulars of the suspects of whom a warrant is sought.  
This is the application or the affidavit or the statement that 
is filed in support of an application for the warrant of 
arrest, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if you would turn to page 21 you, 
the deponent, will find that affidavit, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now the actual warrant of 
10 
arrest, 
if 
I 
understand 
correctly, 
was 
obtained 
subsequently.  If you turn with me to page – bundle LEA17 
at page 29, you have attached a copy of that to your 
affidavit. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Page 29 of bundle LEA17. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, I am on the page, 
Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now that relates to Sarah Jane Trent 
and if you turn to the following page you will see that that 
20 
relates – that is the warrant of arrest in respect of Mr 
O’Sullivan. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And if you look at the date stamp at 
the foot of both documents you will see that it is dated the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 41 of 233 
 
8 February of 2017. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Hulley, I think I am on a wrong 
page.  What was the page?  I think I am on 21. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pages 29, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 29, not 21. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  And page 30, my apologies, Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I thought that was 21.  29? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, if I understand correctly, if you 
go back to bundle LEA18 at page 40(?) in this affidavit, 
was used in support of the obtaining of those warrants of 
arrest, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now we will get back to these 
documents, what I am asking you is before we get to 
February, when you opened the docket, do I understand 
your statement correctly that at that stage you understood 
20 
that the case against whoever it is that was being 
investigated was one of impersonating an IPID official? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Can you repeat the question? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   When you opened the docket, the 
docket was opened prior to the 8 February of 2017, is that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 42 of 233 
 
correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In fact, it was opened at the beginning 
of January of 2017. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now at the time when that docket was 
opened your understanding was that the case against the 
suspects was a case of impersonation of an IPID official.  
That is what you say here in your statement.  I am just 
trying to understand if I, my reading of your statement is 
10 
correct. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  The one that is applying for the J50. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Look at page 19 on bundle LEA17. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page 19. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Have you got LEA17, sir? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Ja.  And then the page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Page 19. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page 19.  Yes, I am on page 19. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Paragraph 12: 
“After evidence was obtained and collected…” 
20 
Sorry: 
“After evidence was collected and presented to 
Advocate Nemaorane of the offices of the DPP and 
on his instructions a criminal case was registered 
under Kameelsdrift as 12/01/2017 impersonating an 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 43 of 233 
 
IPID official.” 
Now, if I understand correctly, this happened at the 
beginning of January of 2017.  All I am trying to 
understand is. at that stage they felt – and when I say 
they, I am talking about Advocate Nemaorane and whoever 
else was assisting him, they felt that the case was one of 
impersonation of an IPID official. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now what …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have reached the short break. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Fine.  We take the short break.  How 
much time do you think you will need with Brigadier 
Ncube? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Chair, I will imagine that it probably be 
another 30 minutes.  I thought it would be less than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But it will probably be another 30 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is fine.  We will take the short 
adjournment and resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 44 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.   Brigadier Ncube 
just to – and specifically having regard to the issues that 
we have got to deal with over years in relation to the 
purpose for which this Commission has been established, I 
want to move on and deal with the issues that are 
specifically relevant to the Commission. 
 
Now if I understand correctly, by January 2017 
there had been investigations that were conducted by you 
and your team, statements or affidavits had been obtained, 
10 
they 
had 
been 
placed 
before 
the 
NPA, 
Advocate 
Nemaorane in particular and the decision was taken that 
this related to the crime of impersonation of an IPID official 
and a docket was opened to that effect.   
 
The docket was opened in Kameeldrift, which is in 
Pretoria, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now your team at that stage had 
conducted its investigation, why was that investigation not 
– having discharged your mandate, a docket has been 
20 
opened, why was that investigation not handed over to the 
police officials at Kameelsdrift police station and you and 
the rest of your team return to the North West Province 
where you are based. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, we proceed with the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 45 of 233 
 
investigation 
and 
we 
placed 
the 
docket 
before 
the 
prosecutors or the advocate at DPP’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying – you are saying the 
process is if you start the investigation you proceed until 
you have completed it.  After that you hand over the docket 
to the NPA to decide whether to prosecute or not to 
prosecute. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson, but this 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you are saying. 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  This was not an ordinary docket like 
a complainant went to police station, register a docket and 
that docket allocated to a detective.  It was investigation 
that was allocated to an investigation team.  We continue 
and we submit it to DPP. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, but if my understanding was 
correct – and perhaps it was wrong but if my understanding 
was correct, the specific mandate that had been given to 
you at the briefing session was that you had to investigate 
a security threat against the life of the then Acting National 
20 
Commissioner Phahlane. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You had reached a point where you 
had taken statements from all the witnesses and – so you 
had taken statements from witnesses, you had presented 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 46 of 233 
 
that to the – so you had given an interim presentation to 
the NPA’s office.  That was followed up with a further 
presentation that took place towards the end of December, 
early January.  That second presentation resulted in a 
criminal charge being laid in Kameelsdrift and a docket 
being opened.  Now at that stage it seems to me that your 
mandate is completed because you have conducted your 
investigation, you have now opened a criminal docket.  
What I want to know is, do you agree with me that at that 
stage 
your 
mandate 
has 
been 
discharged 
or 
do 
I 
10 
misunderstand? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, I cannot agree, Chairperson, this 
investigation, it was started by the team.  As I indicated, it 
is not an ordinary case where a complainant went to police 
station, open a case and thereafter the case is allocated to 
the relevant unit.  We investigated and we submit the 
docket before the DPP. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, if I understand correctly, your 
understanding, you would continue to carry the docket, you 
would continue to conduct the investigations until a 
20 
decision has been taken to prosecute or not to prosecute. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now there is a suggestion and I am not 
sure if I understand the suggestion entirely.  There is a 
suggestion that this was a prosecutor or an NPA driven 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 47 of 233 
 
investigation.  Are you suggesting that. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, I am not suggesting that.  When 
we went and brief Advocate Mzinyathi, Chairperson.  Or 
maybe he allocated an advocate to the investigation.  
When the docket was registered and put to Advocate 
Nemaorane, Advocate Nemaorane booked a docket to 
Advocate Mashuga.  That was the criminal docket now.  So 
that investigation is not my opinion, it was done that way. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, no, I am just trying to understand.  
If – my understanding of what you were saying is that you 
10 
had gone – you and General Mabula, had gone up to meet 
with Advocate Mzinyathi.  So it is in fact from your side 
that you drew him into the investigation in a sense.  That is 
my understanding. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, we went, Advocate, we went to 
the advocate, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now if I understood correctly from your 
earlier 
testimony, 
the 
purpose 
of 
that 
meeting 
with 
Advocate Mzinyathi was to ascertain from him specifically 
whether it was appropriate for your team to conduct the 
20 
investigation 
given 
that 
IPID 
was 
conducting 
and 
investigating against the Acting National Commissioner at 
the time. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  It was for us because we were 
already a team that is going to investigate to bring the DPP 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 48 of 233 
 
on board to say DPP, we are going to investigate this 
matter but we will also – because as I have testified, 
Chairperson, in our mind there were at public domain that 
IPID is investigating General Phahlane.   
So we did not want to be seen as people who are 
now interfering in IPD investigation or countering the 
investigation.  So we want to bring the DPP on board. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But when you say you want to bring 
him on board, are you saying you want to bring him on 
board, so that he remains part of the team that he is 
10 
investigating, either him or somebody that he assigns, he 
is investigating the security threat to the life of General 
Phahlane or are you saying that you wanted to bring him 
on board in terms of the fact that what you want to do as 
the investigation team?  What is the role that is going to be 
played insofar as the NPA is concerned from that point 
onwards according to your understanding? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  My understanding is while the 
investigation – we have commenced with the investigation, 
the NPA will give directives in terms of whether there is 
20 
any prima facie case in the docket or there is no prima 
facie case in the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, in other words, you wanted to be 
able to say there is somebody else other than us put things 
– there is something to be investigated here. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 49 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now after that you continued to 
conduct the investigation, you got the first few statements, 
you then open the docket in the earlier part of January of 
2017.  You then executed or you applied for a warrant of 
arrest.  You then executed the warrant of arrest on the 10 
February 2017, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And in terms of the investigation, just 
10 
take 
me 
through 
now 
the 
Kameelsdrift 
investigation.  
Where did you ultimately land up?  You started with the 
investigation initially into a security threat against the life 
of General Phahlane.  It then resulted in a criminal 
investigation that was about impersonation of an IPID 
official.  Ultimately, what were all the charges that were 
brought against Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, it was impersonating, 
that was actually drafted by Adv Mashuga.  There was also 
extortion, I can get extortion, intimidation and I think also 
20 
fraud.  That was actually drafted by Adv Mashuga, that was 
in the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know what counsel for Brigadier Ncube 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 50 of 233 
 
and yourself discussed with me in chambers but I do want 
to say if at all possible, let us try and see if you cannot 
finish your questioning of this witness by half past twelve. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I know you have got to – you might 
take longer but …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I will certainly endeavour to do so, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because I think I must just say this, it 
is not so clear that whatever fights there may have been 
between different sections of the – between the police and 
10 
IPID.  It is not so clear that it connect properly to the terms 
of reference. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So let us see if by half past twelve we 
have a better picture that it does. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, absolutely.  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Brigadier Ncube, other than Ms Trent 
and Mr O’Sullivan, you also opened a criminal investigation 
against certain members of IPID, is that correct? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   No, I did not open any other docket 
against members of IPID. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Were members of IPID not charged on 
your understanding? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, the question was, I 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 51 of 233 
 
opened the docket against members of IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, he is asking a further question 
now.  He is not challenging your – well, maybe I should not 
say that.  He is asking a different question but which might 
be related to the one he asked earlier on.  Earlier on he 
asked whether you opened a case against IPID members. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said no.  So now he is asking 
whether does that mean that they were not charged? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  They were charged on the same 
10 
matter, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  And do you recall what they 
were charged with and who was charged? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  How it unfolded, Chairperson, after 
Mr Paul O’Sullivan and Sarah Jane Trent were charged and 
appear in court, the advocate who handled the case, Adv 
Mashuga give me directive to go and take warning 
statements of two members of IPID who were together with 
Mr O’Sullivan and Sarah Jane Trent at Sable Hills.  That is 
Mr Mandla Mahlangu, the late, may he so rest in peace, 
20 
and then Mr Damani, both are members of IPID.  I went 
and obtained their warning statement and put the warning 
statement before Adv Mashwai(?).  Then he decided that 
those two members must be charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to say, Mr Hulley, just in case 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 52 of 233 
 
what I said earlier on might be misinterpreted.  I do not 
mean that Brigadier Ncube should not get a chance to deal 
with any allegations that may have been made against him 
that might put him in a bad light out there but I just want 
us not to take too long. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Absolutely so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now when we – insofar as the charges 
against the IPID officials are concerned, did I understand 
correctly that some of the IPID officials were being 
10 
investigated for defeating the ends of justice in relation to 
their investigation against General Phahlane? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, I am not aware of that charges, 
Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   If you would turn with me, sir, to 
bundle LEA18, I would like you to turn to page 3. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page 3. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry, pages 2 and 3. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page 2 and 3? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is right. 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now this particular statement is a 
statement of a certain Elvis – sorry, Alwyn Petrus Du Preez 
and if you turn to page 3, you will see that it is dated the 4 
February of 2017 and you will see that the statement is 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 53 of 233 
 
taken by Mr Dawood.  Now Mr Dawood was – or rather, 
Lieutenant Colonel Dawood was one of the members of 
your team, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Do you know what the purpose of 
taking this particular statement was? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Chairperson, when I looked at this 
statement it seems it was actually a directive from the 
Advocate who handled the case, that additional statement, 
it will be obtained for the witness to clarify certain aspects. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry, it was pursuant to an instruction 
or a …[intervenes] 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Directives.  When I look through the 
statement because I know Adv Mashuga was issuing 
directives in writing whenever he wants us to obtain 
additional statement.  When I look to the formation of this 
statement, it seems additional statement as per query of 
Advocate Mashuga. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the basis for you thinking that it 
is because of a directive?  Is there something you see 
20 
there which gives you that meaning? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Paragraph 2 of the statement: 
“I hereby wish to make an addendum to my 
statement in relation to queries which relate to 
investigation 
of 
intimidation 
towards 
Lieutenant 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 54 of 233 
 
General J K Phahlane.” 
So I am of opinion maybe it is additional statement from 
the directives of the advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, nothing there indicates that 
there was a directive issued.  It may be that there was a 
directive issued, it may be that there was no directive.  He 
decided that there was a loophole or there was some 
aspect that needed clarification and he decided the way to 
sort that out is to get an addendum, is it? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
unless 
you 
say 
from 
your 
experience you know that whenever an addendum is added 
like this it is normally because there is a directive from the 
relevant advocate in the NPA, unless that is this case, but 
otherwise, from what you have read here, you cannot say it 
is because of a directive. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Ja, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Are you aware of the directive outside 
of what you are reading over here? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, Chairperson, I am not aware but 
normally when additional statement need to be obtained 
will always be the directive from maybe DPP or the 
advocate who handled the case. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
And 
were 
you 
aware 
of 
the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 55 of 233 
 
investigation that was taken – or the fact that statements 
were being taken from Mr du Preez? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You were aware of it? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now what was the purpose of 
obtaining a statement from Mr du Preez? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, Mr du Preez is a driver 
of General Phahlane.  Now when the securities – actually, 
when we went to him, we want check in terms of the 
10 
security 
precautions 
and 
measures, 
that 
is 
why 
we 
approach him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr Hulley?  Thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  You knew that 
he was the driver of General Phahlane, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you knew that a statement had 
been obtained from him by IPID, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I think he indicated at one of the 
statements, Chairperson, I was aware, yes, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Why was he approached by members 
of your team on your understanding?  I just want to 
understand that.  Why was he being approached? 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
As 
I 
have 
already 
testified, 
Chairperson, to say we were checking in terms as a driver 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 56 of 233 
 
in terms of the security precautions and measures. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, in other words, if I understand  
correctly you were conducting an investigation at that 
stage into the security measures and one of the people 
that was responsible or one of the people who fell within 
the parameters of the security measures was the driver of 
General Phahlane. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No, Chairperson, would relate to the 
threat levelled against Phahlane. The driver, he move 
around with him. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  So we want to check whether there 
is any other thing that him himself is having or he knows 
of. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay, so he was relevant witness 
because he drove General Phahlane and the person who 
drove General Phahlane would be a person who is relevant 
to questions relating to the security.  That is what I 
understand you to be saying. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   During the course of the investigation 
– I am not sure if you met with Mr du Preez at all.  Did you 
meet with Mr du Preez? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Ja, I think I met with him but in both 
– the statement was obtained by Colonel Dawood.  Yes, I 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 57 of 233 
 
met with him at their office when his first statement was 
obtained. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, you gave a statement on the 8 
December of 2016.  Do I understand correctly that you 
were present when he gave that statement? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  The first statement? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   If I understand correctly, you actually 
took a statement from him relating to the events or relating 
10 
to the IPID investigation and Mr Paul O’Sullivan. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  The statement that we actually were 
– as I have testified to say in terms of the security and the 
precaution, I think the first statement will also indicate to 
him to say we are investigating the threat against General 
Phahlane and we just want to know in terms of that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Will you turn to bundle LEA17, 
to page 337. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   337. 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  300…? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   337. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes, 337. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is right and if you turn to page 
338. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 58 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  3..? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the document at page 337 and 338 
is one document, it is the statement of Mr du Preez.  In 
fact, think it is Captain du Preez, is that correct?  Is this 
his statement, sir?  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Just help me with the page, 33..? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   337.  Have you got bundle LEA17, 
page 337? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson, 337 is an index and 
under it is 338.  I do not know where I am on the 
10 
…[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Are you on bundle LEA17? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  You probably have a wrong bundle.  
Go to bundle LEA17.  Look at the spine of the bundle, 
LEA17.  What have you – is it LEA17?  And on page 337 
you have an index.  Okay, somebody will approach you to 
address this. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Are you looking at the top left-hand 
corner, sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember to look at black numbers. 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Oh no, I was looking the red one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just always remember when page 
numbers are mentioned look at the black numbers. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Okay, I have it, Chairperson, my 
apology. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 59 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I am on 337 now. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you very much, Chair.  Now this 
is the statement that we were referring to earlier on which 
you referred to as the first statement, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now according to this statement he 
says in paragraph 2 that: 
“On 
the 
8 
November 
2016 
at 
10h00 
I 
was 
interviewed by police investigating team which 
10 
consists of two Brigadiers and one Colonel.  As the 
interview was to start I was informed that the 
interview would mainly focus on the safety, security 
and 
threats 
towards 
the 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner J K Phahlane.” 
Do you see that? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   He then talks about in paragraph 3 – 
he talks about whether: 
“I was asked if I know a Mr Paul O’Sullivan and I 
20 
informed the police investigating team that I had an 
encounter with Mr Paul O’Sullivan/IPID not too long 
ago and that I was not happy about what transpired 
in that but I did not do anything about the incident 
as I was told it was a criminal offence to talk about 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 60 of 233 
 
anything related to the said interview/encounter 
with Mr Paul O’Sullivan/IPID.” 
 
Now this team that he is referring to over here 
consisting of two Brigadiers and one Colonel.  Were you 
one of the two Brigadiers who interviewed him? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now he refers to a meeting that took 
place on the 8 t h of November 2016.  I am trying to 
understand 
how 
you 
interviewed 
him 
on 
the 
8 t h 
of 
November of 2016 if you were briefed at the end of 
10 
November or early December of 2016.  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Chairperson our investigation 
commenced on the 30 t h of November 2016.  We did not do 
any investigation I had to do that.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   And I do not know whether if this is 
an incorrect date but me I - in the team I commenced on 
the 30 t h of November 2016.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   So it is possible that he you should be 
referring to the 8 t h of December of 2016? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Yes it can be the 8 t h if the 
statement was on the 8 t h of November, if the statement was 
obtained by our team.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now he says - if you turn to 
page LEA017 at page 338.  He says in paragraph 10 that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 61 of 233 
 
he had done nothing about the intimidation/threat towards 
me as I was not allowed to talk about it and I was reminded 
more than once that it would be a criminal offence to do 
so.   
          I did mention it in my statement to the either about 
the intimidations/threat towards me in the manner in which 
the draft statement that was given to me as put the 
Attorney General Jacob Phahlane in a bad light.  Now he - 
what I want to know is as far as this his issue is 
concerned.  Was the allegation or your understanding of 
10 
what he was asserting over here?   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Can the question be repeated 
Chairperson I did not follow it, correctly so.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   What was your understanding of the 
point that he was making in paragraph 10? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   What my understanding is it seems 
he was threatened and he was informed that he must not 
talk about it.  If he talk about it, it will be an offence 
against him, that is my understanding Chairperson.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, no look at the next part of the 
20 
sentence he says I did mention it in my statement to IPID 
about the intimidations/threats towards me and the manner 
in which the draft statement that was given to me as to put 
the Attorney General Jacob Phahlane in a bad light.  What 
I am asking is what was your understanding about what he 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 62 of 233 
 
was saying in that respect?  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   My understanding maybe is he put it 
in his statement when the statement was taken by IPID but 
nothing was done about that threat of him.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Was this issue pursued – let me 
ask you that, was this issue pursued about the painting 
General Phahlane in a bad light.  Did you continue to 
investigate what that entails? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   No we did not Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Let us go back then to the 
10 
second statement which we referred to a month ago in 
LEA18 at page 2.  Now we spoke about this statement a 
moment ago and were you aware of why this statement was 
taken?   
          I asked you that a month ago you said that it was 
your understanding based upon the content of paragraph 2 
that it would have been pursuant through a directive that 
had been issued within the DPP’s office.  
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
 
That 
is 
correct 
Chairperson 
normally the additional - there is a statement that was 
20 
taken at the first instances and maybe the Prosecutor read 
it through that statement.  He will always say please obtain 
a clarifying certain aspects.    
ADV HULLEY SC:   If you go through the statement, he 
says that on the 25 t h of November 2016 I received a 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 63 of 233 
 
statement from a member of IPID mentioned as Mandla on 
my email relating to the alleged corruption investigation 
against the Attorney General Phahlane.  I went through the 
draft statement and I wish to state that I was not in 
agreement with the following aspects of the statement.   
          He then says at the bottom of that page at 
paragraph 6 the moment which these words were used 
made the draft statement factually incorrect and it is 
therefore my view not true.  Now from what I can gather 
from this statement his complaining about the fact that he 
10 
had been sent a draft statement as part of an IPID 
investigation onto General Phahlane.  Correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   He says that the – he does not agree 
with the content of the statement. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And he says that the statement was 
factually incorrect for various reasons which is outlined in 
paragraph 5. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now what I am wanting to understand 
is why is an investigation now being conducted into the 
investigation that was being conducted by IPID? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Chairperson as I indicated maybe 
the statement the advocate have said that the witness must 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 64 of 233 
 
clarify his point that is why the statement was obtained.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, no that is not my question.  You 
were part of the team and of course if you do not have 
personal knowledge of course say so.  What I am trying to 
ask you is as a member of the team why was an 
investigation 
been 
conducted 
by 
your 
team 
into 
the 
investigation that have been conducted by IPID? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   My answer will be Chair maybe 
there was instruction from the DPP to clarify this because 
we could not went an obtained additional statement from 
10 
our own because we did not know of the statement, the 
draft statement that he received from IPID.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now from your side and I have asked 
you previously about meetings that were held between the 
team.  But from your side the platoon your team meet 
frequently after January of 2017.  In other words, once the 
criminal investigation was underway.  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Ja, I think we meet on several times 
as a team Chairperson.  I cannot remember how many 
times but as a team we will meet, discuss, brief each other.   
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And are these meetings being held on 
an ad hoc basis do you go back to your normal duties and 
meet occasionally and conduct investigations occasionally 
or are you conducting the investigations in relation to 
these, this criminal investigation on a fulltime basis? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 65 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   When we were conducting the 
investigation from 2016, we were doing it on ad hoc 
because most of the work was in Pretoria.  We will come 
maybe we will sleep over after we finish, we will go back, 
when the case appear, we will give the case to court.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now before the criminal – going back 
now 
to 
December 
of 
2016. 
 
Before 
the 
criminal 
investigation was commenced you would have had a 
meeting, if I recall correctly, you would have had a meeting 
with General Phahlane and – wait just bear with me, with 
10 
General Phahlane and Colonel Dawood roundabout the 21 s t 
of December.  Is that correct?   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Yes, it can be correct there because 
I know I was looking for his statement and I was struggling 
because of the commitment as a National Commissioner.  
He schedule were very tight, hectic. When you make an 
appointment with him Chairperson, when you want to take 
the statement, he will be called for something and then you 
need to make another appointment with him, it was very 
hectic.   
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   If you – just turn with me to bundle 
LEA23.  So before we go to this report did you at any stage 
meet with General Phahlane at Sun City or in the Sun City 
region?  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   I cannot remember. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 66 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You cannot recall. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   I cannot remember but I remember I 
do not know which year when he was a national acting 
during the award, I was at Sun City he was there.  I do not 
know which year was that one but it was during the police 
awards.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   So there was awards that were being 
handed out at Sun City? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Yes.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you would have met him at 
10 
that…[intervenes] 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   No, I did not meet him he was there.  
There was no meeting or anything between me and him, I 
was 
attending 
the 
awards, 
him 
as 
the 
National 
Commissioner he was there as the guest speaker or the 
keynote speaker of the event Chairperson.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Very well.  Now ultimately the reason 
this investigation was against Sarah-Jane Trent and Mr 
O’Sullivan what came of the criminal investigation? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Chairperson the case was struck off 
20 
the role when Advocate Mashuga applied for indictment 
and then actually to do the indictment and further to join 
other accused and the magistrate refused and say he strike 
it off the roll in terms of Section 342 whenever we want to 
put it back it must be with the instruction of the NDBP.  
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 67 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at 12:17.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Alerting you.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Chair.  What was General 
Mabula role in respect of these investigations.  Do I 
understand correctly that General Mabula was not himself 
involved in the investigations he was just a team leader?   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you would report – you as the 
members of the team would report to him.   
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   We getting to the arrest of Miss Sarah 
Trent on the 10 t h and I am not really concerned about the 
warrant of arrest for her.  What is the – at this point – what 
is the purpose of seizing her cellphone at that stage? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Chairperson the cellphone was used 
in the commission of crime in the sense that information 
was sent to witnesses by her warning witnesses to attend 
to IPID office as if an investigator himself even providing 
case numbers.   
20 
          To say I confirm the case number as an IPID case 
number.  It even indicates I confirm your status that you 
are not a suspect you are a witness but I warn you to come 
with your attorney regard Sarah-Jane Trent, to the witness 
to come to.  So that message we want to retrieve the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 68 of 233 
 
information that was sent in terms of impersonating the 
IPID officials.    
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now at that stage you did not 
apply for a warrant or for a subpoena in respect of the 
content of the phone or to detain or to seize the phone.  Is 
that correct?   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson but that 
cellphone Chairperson was seized during her arrest in 
terms of Section S it was used in a commission of criminal 
in terms of Section 20 and Section 23 allow a police official 
10 
who can seize the item that is being suspected to be used 
which is in the custody of the person who is being 
arrested.  I applied those two sections to seize that 
cellphone Chairperson.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay so you say in Section 23 let me 
just understand it says that on arrest of any person, the 
person making the arrest - if he is a person say if he is a 
peace officer search the person arrested and seize any 
articles referred to in Section 20 which is found in the 
possession of or in the custody of or under the control of 
20 
the person arrested.  And there such peace officer is not a 
police official he shall forfeit deliver any such article to a 
police official and if he is not a peace officer but you would 
have been a peace officer.  So the second portion does 
apply to you.   
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 69 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Yes.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now if I recall correctly at the 
time that she was arrested when the arrest took place at 
the premises of Mr O’Sullivan’s business.  Is that correct?  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And that took place at approximately 
16:30 on the 10 t h of February of 2017.  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And then you reconvened at the Shell 
garage long Marlboro Drive is that correct? 
10 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And at that stage you realised that she 
did not have a cellphone with her.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   So I am trying to understand once you 
realised that she did not have her cellphone on her how did 
you then get the cellphone and why?  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Chairperson I was part of the 
operation the warrant of arrest of Miss Sarah-Jane Trent 
was executed by Brigadier Kgorane I was present.  What 
20 
had happened is after we execute the warrant Miss Sarah-
Jane Trent asked to phone her lawyer.  Brigadier Kgorane 
her to phone the lawyer and then we were having a lady 
their Captain Mashugu with us and then Miss Sarah-Jane 
Trent want to check something in the house.   
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 70 of 233 
 
          He went with the Captain, the instruction Brigadier 
Kgorane was – after he was spoken with the cellphone you 
hand the cellphone to Captain Mashugu because he had 
already indicated to him when he arrested, we are going to 
seize it.  And what had happened is after we spoke with 
the cellphone he locked the cellphone in the boot of the 
car and then we went out with her.  When we arrived at the 
garage Brigadier Kgorane approached Captain Mashugu for 
the cellphone it is then that we realised that the cellphone 
was put on the boot and we drove back to seize it there.  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay I would like you to go back to 
LEA80 at page 14.  Now this of course is the statement 
that you said that you had placed it in support of the 
warrant of arrest.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Yes Sir, Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Just take us through this any portion of 
the statement where it shows in this statement that she 
had used the cellphone in the commission of the crime of 
impersonating an IPID official.  You have got a number of 
statements there are facts in support of the application.  
20 
You have the statement of Mr Emmanuel Shekuve[?] on 
paragraph 7.    
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   In terms of the supplementary 
statement of supporting statements Chairperson it was not 
mentioned in my statement.   
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 71 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But you say that there was – so there 
is nothing in this statement to show that she had used the 
cellphone for the purpose of committing the crime.  Turn to 
page 19 Sir.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Yes Chairperson I am on page 19.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now there you mention the cellphone 
of Miss Trent, you give the ID number and the cell number 
of the phone that was used.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   My apologies Chairperson which 
paragraph? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is at the bottom of the 23 r d of 
November 2016 one of the witnesses namely Mr Jooste 
received a call from Paul O’Sullivan who requested a 
witness to provide him with a number plate as well as 
photographs of all the vehicles of General Phahlane.   
          The 
witness 
also 
received 
a 
number 
of 
text 
messages via WhatsApp from mobile number 0848491, 
blah, blah.  One of the messages on the same day as the 
call requested that the details of the number plates be 
forwarded to WhatsApp, sorry via WhatsApp.  
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Is that what you referring to?  
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
 
Yes 
and 
it 
continued 
their 
Chairperson that the mobile number is registered in the 
name of Trent, Sarah-Jane with ID number 840214023208. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 72 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What I am trying to understand is in as 
far as impersonation of an IPID official is concerned.  What 
is it in that statement that you have obtained and I 
understand it to be the statement that you have obtained 
from Mr Jooste.  What is it in that statement that suggests 
that this cellphone could be utilised for investigation or 
assist in an investigation of the crime of impersonating of 
an IPID official?  That is the question.       
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   It was requesting information from 
the witness.  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   As is if he is an investigator of IPID, 
Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you did not apply for a warrant for 
the cellphone?   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you did not apply subsequently for 
a warrant for the cellphone after you had already detained 
it? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   No I did not apply for anything after 
20 
the seizure of the cellphone.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   If I understand correctly, well help me 
out I know that you seized it during the course of the arrest 
but was there any other reason why you did not apply for a 
warrant at the time that you applied for a warrant of her 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 73 of 233 
 
arrest?    
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   I have already answered this 
Chairperson that I utilised the two sections of the seizure 
act, Section 20 and Section 23.  I did not see it necessary 
because there are two sections that empower a police 
official who can seize the actions that is being utilised or 
was used for the commission of the crime.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at half past Mr Hulley.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   If I am missing anything you must tell 
10 
me so far the picture I am getting is not one that suggests 
that whatever evidence has been given with regard to 
Brigadier Ncube connects to whatever he may have done to 
any state capture or corruption but if I am missing 
something you must tell me.   
          So it seems that it may have – there may have been 
wrong doing, there might not have been wrong doing but it 
might not be the kind of wrong doing that the Commission 
is really interested in.   
          If that understanding is correct it would seem to me 
20 
that if there is anything that he wants to cover that has not 
been covered just to put his side of the story, then he 
should be allowed to put his side of the story in relation to 
those particular allegations that might not have been 
covered but if I am missing something we can look at it.           
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 74 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  You are obviously 
familiar with some of the allegations that have been made 
against you about your involvement in this team.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now just in relation to the allegations 
that you have heard against you and of course the 
allegations that you were involved not only in this team 
specially in relation to the investigation of IPID into 
General Phahlane but that you have also been involved at 
an earlier stage in the investigation into General Booysen 
10 
in respect of the Cato Manor, those ones.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Yes I was; I have testified to that 
that I was part of that team.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now in relation to the investigation in 
respect of the IPID officials that was conducted by your 
team.  What happened to that investigation?  
BRIGADIER NCUBE:   Chairperson it seems that there is a 
two picture that is being painted.  There was no separate 
investigation of IPID members the same case of Mr 
O’Sullivan 
and 
Miss 
Sarah-Jane 
Trent 
the 
advocate 
20 
decided that we must charge the two IPID members.  This 
case was struck off the roll when it was struck with regard 
to accused. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay so the – so the – all the 
investigations involved the IPID officials and Ms O’Sullivan – 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 75 of 233 
 
sorry Ms Trent and Mr O’Sullivan and that case was struck 
off the role. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you got involved in the investigation 
relating to IPID as well as General Phahlane because you 
were instructed to be part of a team that would do 
investigation, is that right?  You got involved in the 
investigation team because you were instructed to get 
involved in the investigation team. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not your own decision to say? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to get involved? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  yes.  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Now after the – 
after the investigation was at an advanced stage there was 
an investigation that was conducted by IPID as well into the 
investigation or rather into some of the things that had been 
done by the members of your team, is that correct? 
20 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And statements were taken from – from 
you and from other members of – of your team? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the allegations in respect of – or the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 76 of 233 
 
purpose of that investigation as I understand it was to 
investigate 
the 
question 
of 
whether 
the 
investigation 
conducted by your team was designed to undermine the 
investigation by IPID into General Phahlane? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson I need to give how things 
have unfold.   After the arrest of Ms Sarah-Jane Trent we 
went to court.  She applied for bail – actually she – she bring 
an urgent application, bail was granted.  After her release 
Chairperson she went and opened a case against her team. 
1. Kidnapping against us. 
10 
2. Theft of cell phone. 
And then after the arrest of Mr Paul O’Sullivan and after his 
release he went and opened a case against me specific 
when I do arrest of contempt of court.  IPID went and opened 
a case against the team, the former North West Provincial 
Commissioner 
for 
allowing 
us 
to 
come 
and 
do 
the 
investigation of defeating the end of justice.  Those are the 
cases that were investigated against us when we were doing 
the – that investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Now I would like to take the – take 
20 
you to a page - if you would turn with me to LEA23 page 71.   
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  LEA20? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  LEA23 at page 71. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  71.  Yes Chairperson I am there. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now this document says it is Warning 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 77 of 233 
 
Statement for Brigadier Daniel Pharasa Ncube and it is 
signed on page – if you turn to page 74 – it is signed on the 
11 December of 2017.  Is that your signature at the foot of 
the page? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes Chairperson it is my signature. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now in this statement you explain at 
paragraph 3 on page 72 you explained that  
“On the 30 November 2016 I was approached 
by Major General Jan Mabula as my senior 
appointed as a member of the investigating 
10 
team of which he was the lead investigator to 
conduct 
an 
investigation 
into 
a 
security 
breach against the then action – but I 
imagine it was meant to be acting National 
Commissioner of the South African Police 
Service Lieutenant General Phahlane.  You 
say as a result hereof presumably as a result 
of 
being 
approached 
to 
conduct 
that 
investigation I with other members of the 
investigating team led by General Mabula 
20 
received a briefing at Crime Intelligence 
Pretoria and they conducted an investigation 
registered under a Potchefstroom inquiry.  
The investigation showed that there had 
been criminal offences committed by Mr Paul 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 78 of 233 
 
O’Sullivan and Ms Trent and as a result 
thereof 
General 
Mabula 
as 
complainant 
registered a complaint at Kameelsdrift under 
reference 
number 
Kameelsdrift 
CAS 
12/1/2016. 
 
I 
was 
allocated 
to 
do 
the 
investigation in this matter and for purposes 
there 
are 
witness 
statements 
had 
been 
obtained at the Sable Hill Estate when 
General Phahlane was residing.” 
Now in the statement if I understand correctly this particular 
10 
statement 
was 
prepared 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
your 
attorneys, is that correct? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You then – you then go on to say at 
paragraph five  
“The investigation revealed that and you set 
out what the investigation unearthed. 
5.2 The investigation further revealed that 
the security manager was asked by Mr 
O’Sullivan and you set that out.  In 
20 
5.3 You say after the completion of the 
investigation the case docket was placed 
before designated Advocate Mashuga who 
decided that Mr O’Sullivan and Trent be 
charged with intimidation in contravening the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 79 of 233 
 
IPID Act.  You say that a J50 Warrant of 
Arrest was issued against the two namely Mr 
O’Sullivan and Ms Trent both were arrested 
and brought before the court.” 
And you continue.  In the statement you do not talk about a 
meeting that took place on the 30 November 2016 with 
Advocate Mzinyathi.  I just want to understand why that was 
left out. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Chairperson this was a warning 
statement.  Allegation was put before me with the dates and 
10 
a venue.  I was responding to that.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  The allegation against you what did you 
understand at that stage to be the allegation against you? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  It was defeating the end of justice 
Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And what did you understand was being 
alleged that you had done to defeat the ends of justice? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  I cannot specific in terms of what was 
put to me but it was defeating the end of justice specific to 
say what did I defeat I cannot remember now. Chairperson. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well specifically what was being said is 
that this entire investigation was simply a concoction.  It had 
simply been fabricated in order to justify undermining the 
investigation that had been conducted by IPID into General 
Phahlane. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 80 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
Incorrect 
Chairperson. 
 
This 
investigation Chairperson was done through prosecutorial 
guide investigation from the inquiry docket until they advise 
us to open a criminal docket.  Nowhere that we should – we 
were actually fabricating. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No I understand that.  Sorry that is – I 
am not saying that you – you have done that.  What I am 
saying to you at this point in time is that your understanding 
was that IPID was investigating a charge against you of 
defeating the ends of justice.  So I asked you what is that – 
10 
what did you understand was being alleged by IPID that you 
had done to defeat the ends of justice and you said you 
could not understand the specific details so now I am 
providing you with those specific details.  What IPID was 
saying is that you had defeated the ends of justice you and 
your team had defeated the ends of justice by conducting an 
investigation which had been fabricated because there was 
no true basis for the investigation but you had conducted the 
investigation in order to undermine the investigation that had 
been conducted against General Phahlane.  That is what was 
20 
being alleged. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is incorrect Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Oh did – you do not understand that to 
be the allegation.  I am not – I am not asking you if that is – 
if it is true that that was so I am asking if it is true that you 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 81 of 233 
 
understood that to be the charges against you? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  No Chairperson I have answered to 
say it was defeating the ends of justice but specifically I 
cannot now tell Chairperson actually the allegation against 
me in terms of defeating – I have conducted myself in this 
manner. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  So in paragraph 5.6 you say the 
following on the following page at page 74. 
“At no stage during the investigation of this 
matter did I influence any witnesses to give 
10 
any contradicting statement at – to IPID 
investigations 
nor 
interfere 
with 
the 
investigation 
of 
IPID 
conducted 
against 
Lieutenant General Phahlane.” 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So it is clear that your own understanding 
was that the allegation being made against you whether it is 
true or not is a separate issue.  But your understanding was 
that the allegation being made against you was that you had 
somehow 
influenced 
witnesses 
to 
give 
contradictory 
20 
statements to IPID investigators and that you had somehow 
interfered in the investigation of IPID against Lieutenant 
General Phahlane. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson.  That is 
why I responded to it in this paragraph. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 82 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now it would have seemed to me and 
help me in this respect.  But it would have seemed to me 
that one of the very important or crucial aspects of your 
defence that was being prepared over here in the statement 
with the assistance of your attorneys was to say but actually 
we were quite alive to the possibility that it may be alleged 
that we were – to undermine an IPID investigation and for 
that reason right at the beginning on the 30 November we 
actually went to meet with Advocate Mzinyathi. 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson.  It was on 
10 
the 
public 
domain 
that 
IPID 
is 
investigating 
General 
Phahlane.  Now once we get into the investigation of the 
security breach we see it fit to engage the DPP. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And I understand that you saying that.  
What I am asking you is why does that statement – that 
allegation – that very important fact which is part of your 
defence why does it not appear in your statement? 
BRIGADIER 
NCUBE: 
 
No 
I 
think 
Chairperson 
I 
was 
responding to allegation as I have already indicated.  It was 
put to me with the dates that I commit this and I – I 
20 
responded the way I responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Does Mr Joubert intend 
re-examining anything? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 83 of 233 
 
ADV JOUBERT:  Mr Chair I just have – perhaps have one 
aspect to clear up? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV JOUBERT:  Just one aspect I need to clear up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  They have sanitised the 
podium before you go there. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Brigadier Ncube on the last document you 
were referred to Exhibit LE23 page 71 to 74 your warning 
statement.  Now you will remember your – your evidence is 
that from the outset this was a prosecution driven – no 
10 
rather a prosecution overseeing investigation.  You mention 
in paragraph 5.3 in your warning statement that a designated 
advocate, Advocate Mashuge decided that Mr O’Sullivan and 
Ms Trent must be charged.  Now can you just explain is it not 
very extraordinary that already by the February of 2017 we 
know by the 8 February Advocate Mashuge requested 
warrants for their arrest?  Is that not indicative indeed that 
at that very short period of time and Advocate of the High 
Court was already designated to deal with this matter? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV JOUBERT:  Very well.  And just with reference to the 
affidavit where the incorrect date was mentioned by Mr Van 
Zyl you can see that affidavit was deposed to and taken on 8 
December so clearly it must have been a typographical error 
when he said he was seen by members on the 8 November. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 84 of 233 
 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson because 
the team only started on the 30 November 2016. 
ADV JOUBERT:  And at no stage is your – is the warning – 
the summary of your investigation from the outset you simply 
did your job as a police officer.  You gathered evidence on 
instruction under the direction of the DPP in this matter? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Thereafter any decisions of prosecution 
was taken by the DPP and the entire indictment and a 
summary of substantial facts is also before them – this 
10 
commission where it – where it – which contains a summary 
of the events and the decision to charge whoever we 
charged inclusive the members of IPID? 
BRIGADIER NCUBE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Joubert.  Thank you very 
much Brigadier Ncube.  If a need arises you may be asked to 
come back but for today you are excused.  Okay.  We are at 
ten to one.  I guess that we – it is convenient that we take 
the lunch adjournment.  As I indicated to counsel in 
20 
chambers, I will take a longer lunch than normal up to half 
past two to enable me to attend to something important 
relating to the work of the commission. So we are going to 
resume at half past two.  We adjourn. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.

Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Nthebo Jan Mabula.

your conscience? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear the evidence you will be giving, 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the 
20 
truth?  If so, please raise your right hand say, so help me

Page 86 of 233 
 
Hulley.  Yes, okay.  You may continue. 
EXAMINATION BY ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  
It is major general if I understand correctly?  Is that so? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Retired major general. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Retired major general? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Very well.  Now Major General, you have 
been implicated in these proceedings and you have come to 
testify in relation to... on the evidence that has been led 
against you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On a lighter note.  This title would make 
people who are not familiar with these titles is that it is 
major general, it is higher than a general. [laughs] 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not the case, is it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, the Lieutenant General is 
above. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Ja, the general that is 
opposite.  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair, if I may?  I am told that the 
transcribers had difficulty hearing the oath been taken.  If it 
can be administered for a second time? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 87 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us have it done again. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Nthebo Jan Mabula. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, Chairperson. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, Chairperson. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will be 
10 
giving, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand say, so help me 
God. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  So help me God. 
NTHEBO JAN MABULA:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Well, if they still did not hear, 
it can be recorded that he has taken the oath two times.  
[laughs]   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We cannot do better than that. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I have been told that it is customary that 
when referring to a major general or a lieutenant general to 
simple use the title general in a spoken form.  Is that 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct, Chairperson.  
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 88 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So for the balance of this evidence I will 
refer to you as General Mabula.  Is that fine? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  You are welcome Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now in these proceedings you have been 
implicated by a General Booysen and then by a Mr Robert 
McBride.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct so Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And you have given statements dealing 
with both sets of allegations made by these two individuals? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct, Chairperson.  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you will go with me to Bundle LE26? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if you would turn to page 4.  It is 
typed that bundle. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Page 4? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Top left-hand corner.   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  On my statement... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you explained to him about the black 
numbers and the red numbers? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The black... if you look at this top left-
20 
hand corner sir. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  This one? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Anyone.  Can you see the top left-hand 
corner of that document? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, I see.  Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 89 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now there is a number that is in black. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Oh, okay.  I see. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It has got LEA. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Batch 26.  And then it has got a number. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So whenever he refers to a page number, 
he will be referring to that black number.  Number 1, number 
2.  He will not say 0004 for example.  He will just say page 
4. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So for you to follow.  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Thanks, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now if you hold 
that page open and you turn with me to page 34 of the same 
document. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Page 34... 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You will see there on page 34 
...[intervenes]  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Page 34, né? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Ja, page 34.  There is the signature of 
the Commissioner of Oaths and on the preceding page, on 
page 33 is a signature at the top of the page. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Whose signature is that? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 90 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  The one above is mine.  
Above my name, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And is this the statement that you gave in 
relation to the allegations made by Mr McBride. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Probably so. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, let us be certain.  If you would turn 
with me to page 5 of that document. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Page 5. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And if you look at paragraph 1.2. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You need that.  You have got 1.1.1. and 
you say: 
“I am an implicated person having been so implicated 
by Mr Robert John McBride...” 
 
This 
affidavit 
is 
your 
response 
to 
Mr 
McBride’s 
allegations.  Correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you have also given another 
statement and if you would put that bundle aside for just a 
moment and turn with me to page LEA26. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry, you have got to put that bundle 
aside.  Look on the spine, you will see that there is a bundle 
that is marked LEA26.  Sorry, on the spine sir. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, 26. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 91 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Is that 26? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Then turn to page 126.  Have you 
got it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  126...  Yes, I got it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Now if you hold that page and turn 
with me to page 141 of the same document. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  141, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And is that your signature in the top half 
of that page under the words, this done and signed at this 22 
10 
day of May 2019? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It is my signature, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And is this your statement that is made in 
response to the allegations made by General Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And do you confirm that both these 
statements, the one who was made in relation to Mr McBride 
and the one made in relation to General Booysen?  You 
confirm that they are true and correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes.  Yes, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I would like to deal first with the 
allegations that have been in the affidavit that you have filed 
in response to Mr McBride’s statement. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So I want you to go back, in other words, 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 92 of 233 
 
to LEA26 at page 4. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Page 4.  Yes, I am there. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you say... if you will turn with me 
then to page 8 of that document. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I am there. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You have outlined over here your history, 
your career history and you deal with the last items and you 
say 
that 
from 
the 
1s t 
of 
March 
of 
2010 
to 
the 
1s t  of November of 2016, you were the Provincial Head, 
Director for Priority Crime Investigations by the HAWKS in 
10 
the North West.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
And 
then 
between 
the 
1s t  of November of 2016 and the date on which you have 
deposed to this statement, you were the Deputy Provincial 
Commissioner Crime Detection in the North West. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now in relation to the allegations that 
have been made by Mr McBride which relates to a team that 
you were pointed to head-up in respect of a security threat 
20 
at the home of Acting National Commissioner Phahlane. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And that took place during the period that 
you 
were 
the 
Deputy 
Provincial 
Commissioner 
Crime 
Detection.  Is that correct? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 93 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now can you explain to us how your 
appointment to that team came about? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Chairperson, as it has already 
been admitted to the fact that I was the Deputy Provincial 
Commissioner reporting to the Provincial Commissioner of 
the North West. 
 
I actually... I was called by the provincial commissioner 
in the early morning to her office wherein she informed me 
that she had a call from the then Acting Division of 
10 
Commissioner of Crime Intelligence where she might request 
our assistance in terms of an investigation that relates to a 
security threat to the then Acting National Commissioner, 
Lieutenant General Phahlane.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  So when you say you were called in the 
provincial commissioner, who are you referring to now? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Come again? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You said you were called in by the 
provincial commissioner. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  For the North West.  Who were you 
referring to? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I am referring from my office 
in Potchefstroom. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What is the name of the person that you 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 94 of 233 
 
are talking about? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  General Motswenyane. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And you said that she phoned you in the 
early morning. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Ja, when we reported for 
work.  I think it was... I am not quite sure but I think it might 
have been between half-past seven and eight o’clock. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And on what day... what was the date of 
10 
this... was it a telephone call or were you summonsed by 
somebody else? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, obviously, what would 
have happened, my staff officer would have received a call.  
Normally, I would wait to see who instructed me.  Is it an 
official or is it personnel to phone my office to say, “Can you 
summons the general to my office?” 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I see. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  You would not personally 
phoned me.  Then I will be informed by my staff officer or 
20 
whoever.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Try and look this side as you give your 
answers because I am the person that have to ...[intervenes]  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Oh, sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not telling him. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 95 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is asking you the questions. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Okay, sorry.  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I need to be able to see and hear you 
properly. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, it is fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you then had a meeting now on the 
same day with General Motswenyane.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I reported to her office, yes.  
10 
On the same day.  It is the same building.  It does not need 
me really to drive.  It is just for me to walk.  It is maybe a 
minute and I will be in her office. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  And then she explained to you that 
there was a security breach in respect of the Acting National 
Commissioner’s private residence.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  She explained me the alleged 
security breach. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, she said there is this 
20 
allegation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And what did she want you to do now that 
she is informing you of this? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  She informed me because 
apparently, she did receive a request from the Acting 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 96 of 233 
 
Divisional Commissioner to avail myself to assist in terms of 
the allegations. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So the request was specifically from the 
Acting Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence for you 
to avail yourself? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  That is the record that I have 
received from the then Provincial Commissioner, General 
Motswenyane. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So in other words, the Acting Divisional 
Commissioner had specifically request you, General Mabula? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Well, I cannot say she 
specifically because I do not know the conversation.  How it 
came to myself personally.  I think the person who would be 
in the position is the one who informed me. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sure.  But it was your ...[intervenes]  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry.  But it was your understanding that 
you had been requested specifically by the Acting Divisional 
Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Not... I am not going to say, 
20 
specifically me.  This is what I say.  I am the... the Provincial 
Commissioner said he received a request from the Acting 
Divisional 
Commissioner 
to 
avail 
an 
investigator 
to 
investigate the alleged security breach.   
 
So I do not want to bind myself to say specifically it was 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 97 of 233 
 
me.  He never said to me.  He said, specifically you.  So I do 
not know whether he came to his own discretion or what but I 
am not going to. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Then insofar as the team was 
concerned that was to assist you in this task ...[intervenes]  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  ...were you to appoint the team or was 
the Provincial Commissioner, General Motswenyane, did she 
indicate what the team or who the members of the team 
would be? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, she did not indicate.  It 
was upon myself to assemble a team but obviously I would 
then engage with her to say, I would need a team.  Because 
remember, I had other responsibilities in the province.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Very well.  You, obviously... either you 
would have availed you at the time or you obviously required 
as 
to 
where 
the 
residence 
of 
the 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner was at that point in time. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, there was no need for me 
at that time when I informed to require where because the 
20 
only statement and maybe it was, there is this security 
breach at the house of the Acting National Commissioner in 
Pretoria and then the Crime Intelligence is requested and 
wanted to come and assist in terms of the investigations. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now it was only in Pretoria. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 98 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So she had told you that much that it was 
in Pretoria. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Did you acquire why it is that you had 
been appointed to investigate a matter that related to a 
security breach that took place in a different province? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I did not because it was not a 
surprise.  It is a practise. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon?  Say that again. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I was not surprised. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Because in the police, that is 
how it works.  You are not having a boundary to investigate 
because we are a national competency.  So I was not 
surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, Mr Hulley.  I missed your 
question.  I just want to understand his answer in the context 
of the question. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The question Mr Chair was whether he 
20 
had made an enquiry from the Provincial Commissioner as to 
why he who was placed in the North West was being asked 
to go and investigate a security breach that took place in a 
different province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay and the answer was that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 99 of 233 
 
you did not ask? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, I did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you elaborated.  Just tell me your 
elaboration on that. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  My elaboration is, I was not 
surprised.  It seems your question was like you said, like I 
was not... for me, it was not something that is very strange 
for someone who can be approached from one province to do 
investigation in another province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that normal in your experience? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It is a normal experience 
within the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is that so? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay is there either certain types of cases 
where that is, in respect of which, that is normal or it is all 
types of cases?  There is no specific... there are no specific 
categories of cases? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I will not say there is a 
specific case because then otherwise I would be trying to... 
20 
but as far as I know, there is that kind of arrangement within 
the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is such a practise? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  okay. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 100 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And is that in relation to all types of 
investigations or certain types of investigations where that is 
normal practise? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Look, I am not going to bind 
myself to say certain types of investigations because for me 
it lies with the discretion of whoever approaches. 
 
So I am not going to dictate this is the type but what I 
know there is that kind of cross-provincial investigations 
where people are actually requested to do work in other 
provinces. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, what you are on... the only thing you 
are expected to say Major General Mabula is what you know. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do not know that it is according to 
specific categories of cases, obviously, you cannot say it is 
according to specific categories. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you do know that it is according to 
specific categories, that is what you say. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  So this 
particular conversation that you had with the Provincial 
Commissioner, 
do 
you 
recall the 
date 
on 
which that 
conversation took place? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 101 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, I do not recall the date.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the Provincial Commissioner 
requested you to assemble a team and then to go about 
conducting an investigation.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Ja.  What the Provincial 
Commissioner informed me is I must, as you say, assemble a 
team and go to Crime Intelligence to have... because he did 
not have the full facts of what is really going to happen.  So 
obviously, he would send me to Crime Intelligence to go and 
have a hearing. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Now I think the term that was used 
previously was that there would be a briefing session. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the meeting with the Provincial 
Commissioner Motswenyane, after that meeting had been 
completed, in other words, you have finished with the 
meeting and you understand what your instruction is, did you 
on the same day assemble the team and the travel off to 
Crime Intelligence? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Well, I am not sure whether it 
20 
was the same day but I did go to get a team to Crime 
Intelligence. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  How did you select the members of the 
team?  What criteria did you use? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, I looked at people with 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 102 of 233 
 
more experience in terms of people who were previously in 
DPCI, Brigadier Kgorane and Brigadier Mobe(?) and Colonel 
Dawood who did previously DPCI with more experience.  So I 
was looking into that.  But in addition, I also nominated a 
person from Legal Service to be part of the team. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Is that Lieutenant Colonel Makhele? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And why did you select him? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I wanted him because of... 
remember, we are dealing with legal issues and once we 
10 
have someone we feel your investigation team from legal 
experience, you are always... it is always there to assist. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And when you say that you were dealing 
with legal issues, what legal issues are we referring to now? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, the investigations as well. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you then having assembled the team, 
you then travelled up to Pretoria where you meet with the 
Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence.  Is that 
20 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And this is the briefing session that we 
speak of? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, it was. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 103 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What transpires?  What is told you in this 
briefing session? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Basically, it is like we were 
told that there is a security breach in the residence of the 
Former Acting National Commissioner and threat level 
against him.  And then there were also some emails that 
were produced to us that would also amount to the threats. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And what else was told to you. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It was basically that I did 
not... unless I have to elaborate exactly what they said.  
10 
There was this vehicle and so on.  I am not sure whether you 
want me to go as far as that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes, I want to understand what... not 
obviously verbatim but in terms of the substance what was 
conveyed to you at that meeting. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  In terms of the substance, it 
was said they have done a security assessment and then in 
terms of this assessment, the feeling is the life of the Acting 
National Commissioner is in danger and it requires us to do 
further investigation as to verify as to whether there is 
20 
criminality. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
So 
they 
said 
they 
have 
done 
investigations? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the assessment is that there is a 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 104 of 233 
 
threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now who was present in this meeting 
from you and your team’s side and on the side of Crime 
Intelligence? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  From my side it was Brigadier 
Ncube, Brigadier Kgorane, Colonel Ready, and Lieutenant 
Colonel Dawood by that time.  And then from Crime 
Intelligence, if I remember well, there were three people. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  H’m? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It was the Acting Regional 
Commissioner, General Makhele, Brigadier Moyane(?) and 
the other colleague, I only know him as BM and I do not... I 
cannot remember what is his surname but he was full 
general. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So there were three people.  Could there 
have been more people?  I am trying to adduce. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I quickly... I can think quickly 
of the three.  I cannot remember whether there were more 
than that but my memory, if it serves me well, it says three 
20 
people. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So we know that Moyane, it is clear.  We 
know that... is it General Makhele? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 105 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Makhele, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  and then who is the third person, 
colonel? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  General BM.  I think it is a 
nickname.  I do not have the surname. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Do you know how to spell that?  I am 
trying to catch the name. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No, I think it is a nickname 
but ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Oh, BM? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Ja, BM.  Like... 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay so that is... is it his or her initials? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  That is what they call him.  I 
do not know whether it is his initials or what but  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe it is the car that he was driving. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]   
ADV HULLEY SC:  [laughs]  Now you say that they had 
reported that there was a security assessment that had been 
done by them.  Presumable when you say by them it would 
20 
have been done by Crime Intelligence. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the security assessment determined 
that there was a security risk or a threat to the life of the 
Acting National Commissioner.  Is that correct? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 106 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Were there any documents that were 
produced? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  As far as my memory serves 
me well, we only received the emails, a number of emails. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And who was the person... who were the 
persons or people... sorry.  Who was the person or people 
that were speaking on behalf of Crime Intelligence that were 
speaking? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It was Brigadier Moyane.   
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  So all the information that had 
been transmitted to you or that had been conveyed to you at 
that meeting had been conveyed specifically by Moyane, 
Brigadier Moyane? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes.  Well, the Acting 
Divisional Commissioner was acting... or he act then and 
there but the main person who was actually taking us to it 
was Brigadier Moyane. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the date of the meeting, do you 
recall that? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I think the 30t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 30t h of...? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  The 30t h of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  2016. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 107 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now the document or the... or in terms of 
the report that was been conveyed to you about the security 
threats that had been done by the Crime Intelligence, did 
they indicate whether there was a written document to that 
affect or whether he indicated that it was simple a verbal 
assessment that had been given to them? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Well, they did not go as far as 
telling us the written document.  They said they have done 
10 
this assessment and this is what they felt but it was not clear 
as to whether there is a document that they have compiled. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And were you ever presented with a 
document at all? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now in terms of the briefing that have 
been given to you, did they tell you who is it that you had to 
investigate, what the nature of the complaint was or the 
20 
concern was?   
 
Were you able to take down notes to make a summary 
for the full detailed explanation of what it is that you were 
going to investigate? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Look, as far as I recall, they 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 108 of 233 
 
spoke about this vehicle that went to the residence of the 
Acting National Commissioner driving by one white person 
and white lady and two African males and they were posing 
certain questions which might amount to also breach of 
security as well.   
 
That is basically what they were trying to tell us.  And 
then on top of that, they give us also emails that would 
actually suggest that there were certain threatening remarks 
on the emails.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  And did they suggest that the threatening 
10 
emails and that the vehicle that had gone through the 
residence was somehow connected with each other? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, somehow.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Did they identify everybody that you 
needed to investigate? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I think they said they went 
and checked the ownership of the vehicle which came out to 
a certain person called Paul O’Sullivan. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Oh, I see.   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now in terms of the report that had been 
given to you in that briefing session, had they indicated to 
you other than Paul O’Sullivan you mentioned that there 
was a white male, there was a white lady.  Other than the 
two of them, who else was involved?  Do they suggest that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 109 of 233 
 
there was anybody else that you had to investigate? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Well, the only – the other 
two, I know it was only two African males but by then we 
did not have the names, who the people were. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  And this is now on the 30 t h.  
What do you do – you have the briefing session, you 
presumably decide what it is that you are going to do about 
this. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You make that decision together with 
10 
Crime Intelligence or do you and your team go and retire 
elsewhere and decide how you are going to deal with the 
situation? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, after the briefing by 
Crime Intelligence myself and my team we went out and 
decide on the way forward. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And what is it that you decided? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   The first thing that I did 
because obviously even that time it was very much rife or it 
was well-known fact that General Phahlane  was more on 
20 
eNCA.  IPID was like on top of him.  So one would actually 
say but it is public knowledge that IPID, they are busy 
investigating General Phahlane. 
 
Now the question you ask, now you still have to do 
security threats on the very same.  Now it puzzled me.  
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 110 of 233 
 
Then I said to the team I think the first thing that one need 
to do, I will phone the DPP.  I phoned the DPP personally 
because with the current situation now, one goes there, 
you are actually see as – remember, the media, IPID was 
involved more with media so one would need really to look 
at your own integrity.   
 
So I phoned DPP, but DPP, I remember very well, 
was not – I think he was not at work, he was on leave, 
because remember now it was more on festive(?).  He told 
me that I am not at work and then I said no, but there is 
10 
this urgent thing that I want to see you.  Then he agreed.  
He moved to his office and I went with Brigadier Ncube and 
Colonel Dawood.  I briefed him to say Advocate, this is 
what we found from Crime Intelligence.  Now the reason 
why I am coming here, I am looking puzzled because we 
are aware that the same – the residence of General 
Phahlane, there is this investigation that you saw over the 
news.   
 
So I want – let us share ideas, I am not sure 
whether to go or not.  Then he presented what Crime 
20 
Intelligence gave.  Then he said to me no, but General, 
investigation is investigation, you will need to carry on with 
the investigation but because of the level of the issues 
now, you know, what is happening currently, I will assign 
an advocate that will deal with the team and on that very 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 111 of 233 
 
same note he said to me he will give me Advocate 
Nemaorane.  That was the understanding and then after 
then one was relieved to say now at least DPP is giving 
go-ahead because it was an extraordinary situation, this 
one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now just to understand.  Firstly, when 
you talk about the DPP, who are you referring to? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Advocate Mzinyathi. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mzinyathi, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, I think he is based in 
10 
Pretoria. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I see. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Why were you going to see him at all?  
I am not sure if I am following that. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I am saying I decided to go 
and see Advocate Mzinyathi as the DPP. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It was well-known fact that 
IPID they were busy with investigation on the very same 
20 
area where he know – we have this security threat.  Now 
he has two investigations, the other one, it is in favour of 
General Phahlane, the other one is against him.  Now you 
come – you remember, we all observed that IPID has 
mandates to investigate.  Now you cannot be seen when 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 112 of 233 
 
somebody is investigating you come in as well.  It does not 
make sense.   
 
So now – and also, it does not – you know, on an 
interim basis nothing would have stopped me to go there to 
investigate but I will say to avoid whatever might come, let 
me go to the DPP, tell him this is what we see, what does 
it say because the other thing, the DPP would also be 
aware that the Acting National Commissioner at his level is 
being investigated. 
 
Now obviously all these investigations will go to his 
10 
office as DPP.  So that is why I felt - I used that discretion 
to say I must go to him.  
ADV HULLEY SC:     Why I am asking this question 
because I understood that you do not know who – other 
than the two, Paul O’Sullivan and the white lady, you know 
that there were two black gentlemen in the vehicle but you 
do not know who they are.  So I am trying to understand 
how you know that IPID is involved in this matter at all? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Look it is also public 
knowledge, when IPID was investigating General Phahlane 
20 
earlier 
than 
that 
there 
was 
somewhere 
where 
Paul 
O’Sullivan issues were coming in, in that investigation on 
the media.  It was not a secret. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am not following that.  You are saying 
this is in the public domain? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 113 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, I say …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That IPID was investigating the Acting 
National Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes.  But, on top of that, 
while General Phahlane was investigated, the name of Paul 
O’Sullivan was coming into play as well. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In the media? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you are saying that according to 
the 
media 
reports 
that 
you 
were 
familiar 
with 
you 
10 
understood that Paul O’Sullivan had been investigating the 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner 
and 
you 
– 
do 
I 
misunderstand that? 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
No, 
not 
necessarily 
investigating, what I am saying, whatever investigation that 
was relating – in relation to General Phahlane, Paul 
O’Sullivan’s name was also featuring into. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And was that investigation that you 
understood then Paul O’Sullivan’s name was mentioned, 
but you understand that from the media reports to be an 
20 
investigation being conducted by IPID? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   There was that relationship.  
It was clear, there was a relationship between Paul 
O’Sullivan …[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   No …[intervenes] 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 114 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   And IPID by that time. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry, listen to my question.  I am 
trying to understand on what basis you decided to go and 
see the DPP.  Now you say it was because you were 
concerned 
about 
possibly 
interfering 
in 
an 
IPID 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I understood from your earlier 
responses that you did not know other than Paul O’Sullivan 
and the white lady, you did not know who was involved in 
10 
going to the Acting National Commissioner’s residence.   
So pursuant to that I am asking you on what basis did you 
go up to IPID?  And if I understand your response correctly 
you are saying it is because you understood that there was 
a relationship between Paul O’Sullivan and IPID.  Now I am 
asking you is that based upon the media reports that you 
speak of? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It is based on the media 
reports.  It is also based on the briefing that you received 
to say they are seeing Paul O’Sullivan when he went to the 
20 
residence the Acting National Commissioner.  He identify 
himself as a member of IPID.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And then you decided you were going 
to go and first see whether – you are going to first go and 
see the DPP about this issue.  Did you investigate at that 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 115 of 233 
 
stage before you went and go and see the DPP?  Did you 
investigate whether Paul O’Sullivan was indeed a member 
of IPID? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I have not started 
because – I have not started the investigation because my 
investigation obviously when you carry, you can link on the 
very same premises where General Phahlane is.  That is 
why I wanted to clear the air so that tomorrow it must not 
be someone went and tried to do whatever.  So that is why 
for me from investigation perspective I want to clear the air 
10 
so that if the DPP said no, no, I am aware of this 
investigation 
and 
then 
says 
carry 
on 
with 
the 
investigations, at least obviously there must not be a 
commission because like I have said, IPID have a total 
mandate to investigate.  We also have a mandate to 
investigate which causes – for me personally it causes a 
little bit of a confusion. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So when you say that you are going to 
go and see the DPP to see whether they are aware of the 
investigation are you referring to the investigation that was 
20 
being 
conducted 
by 
IPID 
into 
the 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner? 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
No, 
no, 
no, 
the 
investigation that was about to start. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 116 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I wanted to inform the DPP 
to say this is what we received, the complaint, we are 
going to investigate that but on the same breath we are 
aware 
that 
there 
is 
investigation 
in 
the 
very 
same 
premises, again the person who is alleged there are 
security threats against him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now after you went to go and see the 
DPP what was the assessment that was made over there 
about the future conduct of your team’s investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Come again?  Can you just 
10 
rephrase it? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You went to go and see the DPP. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You met with Advocate Mzinyathi. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Mzinyathi, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   After that meeting or in the meeting 
was it decided how you were to proceed with this matter? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   That In that meeting we 
were given a green light by the advocate.  In addition, he 
said he will assign Advocate Nemaorane to be from the 
20 
NPA’s side to supervise this investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now moving forward, you would have 
met with your team afterwards presumably.  You have 
already met with Mzinyathi – sorry, Advocate Mzinyathi, 
you go back presumably either to North West or elsewhere 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 117 of 233 
 
to discuss the way forward and how the different tasks are 
going to be divided between your team members, is that 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And when did that meeting take place? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I would not say a meeting 
because immediately after we go the green light from the 
DPP, Advocate Mzinyathi, then my instruction was now that 
we have consulted the DPP we must as soon as possible – 
because, I mean, if there is a security threat it means we 
10 
need to act, so we must start with the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you consulted with Advocate 
Mzinyathi were you seeking his opinion of the case so that 
you could see whether he thought it was something worth 
investigating 
or 
were 
you 
just 
consulting 
him 
not 
necessarily seeking his opinion or did you need his 
approval before you could embark on the investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Actually, Chairperson, I 
needed his opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  He could say if he said what are 
20 
you investigating here, there is nothing, would that have 
been the end of the investigation that was about to start? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If his opinion was that you should not 
investigate, there are no grounds to investigate?  
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 118 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it something you do not know? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has never happened? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But you – if he said his opinion 
was that you should continue then you would continue 
definitely? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Are the circumstances 
10 
where – or let me ask this question this way.  What types 
of investigations do you need an opinion from somebody 
from the NPA before you can embark on them?  Is it all 
investigations? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, in terms of my 
experience I never had opinion from …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was the first time? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   This was the first time.  
That is why I am saying …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what made you take this unusual 
step of seeking an opinion from somebody from the NPA on 
this occasion? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Because already I was 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 119 of 233 
 
aware that there was an investigation on the very same 
premises by IPID.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   So I then have question 
marks to myself, do you go forward and go back? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Because it is possible that 
if this thing is not properly communicated there might be a 
reason for people to say you are interfering. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Because it is more you are 
on the borderline.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, you were unsure. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether it would be regarded as proper 
to proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you wanted that kind of backing to 
know that somebody in the NPA thinks it is fine to do it. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Right, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now why would Crime Intelligence be 
involved in the security assessment?  Are you aware of 
that? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Why? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 120 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Why had Crime Intelligence conducted 
the security assessment in the first place? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I am not aware why. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Is that typical, is that usual, is it 
appropriate for Crime Intelligence to be involved? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I cannot answer that 
one whether it is appropriate but I do not know who they 
involved. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just back onto the question I asked you.  
10 
At this stage when you consulted Advocate Mzinyathi what 
did you – what information did you place before him for him 
to give you and informed opinion? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I presented the emails to 
him, I also shared with him the information that I received 
not documented in terms of the activities but according to 
Crime Intelligence their view as such as a security threat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And his opinion was it is justified to 
20 
pursue the investigation here. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, even if we are aware 
that IPID they are busy with other investigations the other 
side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 121 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You then decided, that is the members 
of you team, would start with the investigation immediately, 
is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You, as the team leader, what would 
your role be insofar as the investigation and the future of 
the investigation was concerned? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   My role would have been 
10 
statements would be taken, they will be presented to me.  
Where the team needs any resources in terms of the 
investigation, I will make sure that I get the necessary 
resources for the team to work.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   And were you to return to North West 
where you were based or were you going to be moving in 
and out from your base in North West and coming up to 
Gauteng from time to time? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I would move from time to 
time as it requires into North West and Gauteng of the 
20 
province for the sake of the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to you being asked to lead this 
investigation did you know the then Acting National 
Commissioner personally as opposed to simply knowing 
that 
he 
is 
the 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner, 
is 
it 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 122 of 233 
 
somebody you had had any interactions directly with? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, Chairperson, at my 
position as a Deputy Provincial Commissioner, most of the 
time you do account as a province to the National 
Commissioner.  So our interaction would be based on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would that relationship just as a 
professional level? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correctly so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is all that there was? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you – those context where you 
would interact with the Acting National Commissioner 
would it be in formal settings?  In other words, would you 
meet at the residence of the Acting National Commissioner 
or would you meet at an official SAPS site? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Because of the type of work 
I do, I might not have specific places where I would meet 
the National Commissioner, not specific to [indistinct] 
Where the National Commissioner would require me to 
20 
report, I will. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And now take us through the 
investigation that have conducted.  You obviously receiving 
statements from time to time and presumably, as the team 
leader, you are not actually conducting any investigations 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 123 of 233 
 
yourself, your sole purpose is to lead the team and you 
would receive statements or reports in some form either 
verbal reports or written reports, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And all the reports that were being 
sent – were being given to you, would they be verbal 
reports only or would also be written reports, other than 
statements now? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Normally it would be verbal 
reports because if they want to verify certain threats, I am 
10 
also having access to the case docket. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You are also having access to the..? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   The case docket. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   At the early stage, in other words still 
in 2016 now when the investigation starts, the role that you 
played as the team leader is to receive the reports and to 
receive …(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are too far from the mic, Mr Hulley. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me, Mr Chair.  Thank you, Mr 
Chair.  Your role is to receive reports and to receive the 
statements and then you have got to make decisions 
presumably based on what you are reading and the reports 
that are being given to you.  Would that be fair? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 124 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I do receive reports, 
correctly so. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, no, my question is, do you have to 
make decisions based upon what you have read in the 
statements and the verbal communications? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And what decisions do you take as a 
result of the information that has been supplied to you, 
either in the form of the statements or the verbal reports? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No because once I receive 
10 
the reports you can interact with the team to say can you 
go and obtain certain statement despite the fact that 
remember this was a prosecutorial guided investigations 
but you go through the reports and then, for example, 
where you need some forensic reports you intervene.  
Where the team has got – when you go through the reports 
you see there they are lacking, you supply them with the 
necessary resources to complete their investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this particular investigation you 
are obviously the team leader but you yourself had to 
20 
report to somebody else, you fall under somebody else’s 
jurisdiction. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In this case you fall under the 
Provincial Commissioner. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 125 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is [indistinct]  jurisdiction. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Are you reporting to her on this matter 
or are you reporting to somebody else? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I report to the person who 
appoints us. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And who is that? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Which is Acting Divisional 
Commissioner of Crime Intelligence. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay, so this particular investigation 
resides under the Acting Divisional Commissioner, so you 
are reporting to her. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So all the reports that have been given 
to you, you communicate those reports to her. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now at the – by the time you have 
started doing these investigations is there an agreement 
that you would report to her in writing or simply verbally? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I never reported in writing, I 
reported verbally to her. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So in your statement you have 
attached – marked NJN1, it appears at LEA26, that is 
bundle LEA26, at page 35. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 126 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Page… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the right bundle, Major 
General Mabula?  To see whether you have the right 
bundle you must look on the spine of the bundle. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
I 
have 
got 
the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have got the right bundle? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Is it the one we have been using? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It is the one that we are using, Mr 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now this particular document at page 
35, can you tell us what this document is, where did you 
get this document from? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   The mandate to conduct to 
investigation 
security 
threat 
against 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner, counter and security intelligence inquiry.  
So what was the question? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What is this document and where did 
you get it from? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   This document is the one 
that I got from the Acting Divisional Commissioner via the 
office of the Provincial Commissioner. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 127 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the Provincial Commissioner’s 
office gave it to you but you understand that it came from 
the Acting Divisional Commissioner?   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So when you went to this briefing 
session with the Acting Divisional Commissioner did you 
take this document with you or did you receive this 
document afterwards? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Afterwards. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the purpose of this document, if I 
10 
understand correctly, is as the heading indicates that it is 
a mandate. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In other words, this is the document 
that has empowered you to conduct the investigation that 
you were conducting. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It says here under the first item, 
Background, it says that: 
“On the 16 October 2016 the Acting National 
20 
Commissioner’s 
private 
dwelling 
was 
accessed 
unlawfully by as yet unknown individuals who 
allegedly unlawfully accessed documentation and 
other material which is presumed to compromise the 
safety of the Acting National Commissioner and his 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 128 of 233 
 
immediate family.” 
Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now I just want to understand firstly, 
this 
date 
over 
here 
of 
the 
16 
October 
2016, 
what 
investigation has been conducted over here?  What are 
they referring to?  Is this the incident with Mr Paul 
O’Sullivan? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I think this is the incident in 
terms of the vehicle that I spoke to.  
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And this particular vehicle that you 
spoke to, does this vehicle – this incident with the vehicle, 
does that relate to Mr Paul O’Sullivan or are we talking 
about two different incidents? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Ja, I said the vehicle, when 
it was screened, it belonged to Mr Paul O’Sullivan. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes because they gave 
registration number of the vehicle. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the information about the 
20 
screening by which I understand you to mean that you had 
done a check on the registration number? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So when they did – when they gave 
you 
information 
about 
the 
screening 
at 
the 
briefing 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 129 of 233 
 
session, they already knew that that vehicle belonged to 
Mr Paul O’Sullivan, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, they said the vehicle 
belongs – according to the screening, according to the 
registration numbers, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  And then you get this letter 
which is sent to you after the event.  In other words, after 
you have returned from Crime Intelligence where the 
briefing was held. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   H’m. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And in this letter they are saying to 
you that: 
“An incident took place on the 16 October.” 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And they say that: 
“His private residence was accessed unlawfully by 
as yet unknown individuals.” 
Now I am trying to understand whether this incident that 
has been referred to over here is the same incident as the 
one that they gave you a briefing about relating to Mr Paul 
20 
O’Sullivan. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It is the same. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So I am just trying to understand why 
they would say it was unknown individuals when in the 
briefing session they have already told you that the people 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 130 of 233 
 
were Paul O’Sullivan and a white female, two black males, 
why are they saying in this letter that it is unknown 
individuals? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Do you want me to answer 
that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I would like to know, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Well, my opinion – because 
now I have to give my opinion because I cannot answer on 
their behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not know you can say you do 
10 
not know. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I do not know, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at half past three, I do not know 
how, Mr Hulley, you may be pacing yourself in terms of 
important issues, so I want you to just bear that in mind. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that you …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I will keep eye on the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, keep an eye so that we get to the 
important aspects of his evidence. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have a sense of how much time 
you think you need? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Probably another hour, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us see how – where we are in the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 131 of 233 
 
next 30 minutes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But try and look for those important 
features on his evidence. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  So there it says 
in the following line, it says paragraph 2: 
“Appointment of team to conduct investigation.  
Here they appoint the following members to conduct 
the investigations and to report the findings and 
recommendations to my office.” 
10 
Now we know that there was no written report that was 
provided.  Was a verbal report ever given? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Verbal report? 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Okay 
and 
were 
there 
also 
recommendations that were given? 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
No 
there 
was 
no 
recommendations 
because 
the 
investigation 
was 
not 
finalised. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Then paragraph 3, the objective of the 
investigation; 
20 
“the attorneys requested to conduct an investigation 
and 
to 
obtain 
all 
necessary 
statements 
from 
witnesses, collect evidence regarding – sorry and to 
collect evidence regarding threat against the Acting 
National Commissioner.” 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 132 of 233 
 
On the following page; 
“The investigation will commence on 30 November 
2016 and will continue for a period of two months 
with a possibility of further extension”. 
Was a further extension granted after a two-month period? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It was communicated yes, 
but it was not communicated in writing. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   No, no, I’m asking – so there was an 
extension granted? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Who granted the extension? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   As I was giving the reports, 
it was impossible for us to finalise this, so the acting 
Divisional Commissioner whom we were giving feedback to, 
he agreed to say we must – we can extend. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And sorry what did you [indistinct] 
she? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay and you say all resources will be 
provided by the North West Province, in other words your 
20 
Province will be responsible for all the resources that are 
provided to this investigation. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes.   
ADV HULLEY SC: “The investigation team will report all  
progress concerning the investigation to the acting 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 133 of 233 
 
Divisional Commissioner Crime Intelligence and 
meetings will be conducted at the request of the 
team leader”,  
Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, other than verbal reports you say 
that there were no written reports that were ever given and 
there was never a recommendation given. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   To the acting Divisional 
Commissioner? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Was a recommendation given to 
anybody? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   To whom was the recommendation 
given to? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I think just rephrase again? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I asked you, other than the written 
reports – sorry other than the verbal reports was there a 
recommendation that had been given to anybody – sorry to 
the Divisional Commissioner, pardon me, I said was there a 
20 
recommendation that was given and I understood your 
previous answer to be, no there was no recommendation 
given.  Now, you’ve now made a qualification on that, you 
said not to the Divisional Commissioner then my next 
question is, did you give such a recommendation to 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 134 of 233 
 
anybody? 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
There 
were 
no 
recommendations that were sent to anybody but what I can 
say, there were some reports that were forwarded to the – 
because after General Phahlane was put aside there was a 
new acting National Commissioner who came, he requested 
us to submit progress report and understand what kind of 
investigation we’re doing, that was General Mothiba and 
General Sithole, the current sitting National Commissioner, 
when he took office, the same applied as well, we did 
10 
submit that kind of report to him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And were those written reports? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay, now the mandate that had been 
given to you here by the acting Divisional Commissioner, 
was this mandate ever extended or broadened? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, it was never – it 
remained as it is there’s no other mandate that we received 
except this. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, all the investigations that were 
20 
being conducted by you and your team were conducted 
pursuant to this mandate? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What – there were, of course, 
subsequently, I think it was on the 4 t h of January, you 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 135 of 233 
 
opened a case docket through Kameeldrift Police Station, 
is that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And that was on the 4 t h of January of 
2017.  Has there ever been a criminal case that has been 
opened relating to a threat on the life of the acting 
National Commissioner? 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
The 
charges 
that 
was 
opened, it was intimidation, a person impersonating this 
IPID members and fraud, out of the investigation that we 
10 
conducted.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, I take it that your answer to my 
question is, no, there was never any criminal investigation 
or criminal charges that were instituted relating to a threat 
to the life of the acting National Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   What I call intimidation that 
is up to the Chairperson to decide, whether it’s aligned to – 
as part of that threat. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, you say that there was a charge of 
intimidation…[intervenes]. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
 
Against 
the 
acting 
National 
Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Under which case docket was that? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 136 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Against who? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The acting National Commissioner. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
No 
there 
was 
not 
intimidation…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It could not be against the acting 
National Commissioner. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, it won’t be. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The threat against the acting National 
Commissioner, so not the – the charges are not against the 
acting National Commissioner.  Were there any charges 
10 
that 
were 
laid, 
against 
anybody, 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
intimidation against the acting National Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, not against – maybe 
you don’t understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no I think – now I understand.  He is 
saying, you were – you conducted an investigation because 
it was alleged that there had been a threat to the acting 
National Commissioner. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, he’s question is, arising out of that 
20 
investigation was there any charge of intimidation against 
anybody that was preferred? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   There was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now the charges were brought, 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 137 of 233 
 
obviously against Mr Paul O’Sullivan, is that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And there were charges that were 
brought against Ms Trent. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Later on, there were charges that were 
brought against two IPID officials. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, what I’m asking you is, of all 
those charges that were brought against the different 
10 
people, Ms Trent, Mr O’Sullivan and the two IPID officials, 
which charge related to intimidation by any of them of the 
acting National Commissioner, which one of them had 
intimidated the acting National Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Well, I don’t want to get 
much into the merits of the cases…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think what he is saying, what he 
is asking is, when you say there was a charge of 
intimidation was it against one of the persons that we have 
mentioned or was it against more than one, if so, say who 
20 
– who it was. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Ja, now if memory serves 
me well it might be against one of them, it might be two but 
as far as I understand…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you recall. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 138 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It’s one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who was it…[intervenes]. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Paul O’Sullivan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, you’re saying that Mr Paul 
O’Sullivan, one of these charges relates to his intimidation 
of the acting National Commissioner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Ja, if memory serve me 
well, in terms of that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, these other charges that had 
10 
been brought, there were charges of fraud, there were 
charges of impersonation of an IPID official, there were 
subsequently 
charges 
that 
had 
been 
brought 
of 
racketeering, 
charges 
relating 
to 
the 
national 
investigations relating to the National Credit Act, breaches 
of the National Credit Act, all those charges, how did that 
relate to the mandate that you had been given? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Well, I can’t answer that, 
I’m not in a position.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, let’s – let me ask the question in 
20 
this way.  These other charges that Mr Hulley has 
mentioned to you, did they arise from the investigation that 
you conducted? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
did 
you 
conclude, 
in 
your 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 139 of 233 
 
investigation, that such charges should be preferred? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   We, as a team.   
CHAIRPERSON:   We as a team, ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not and you did not make a 
recommendation? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, we didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That such charges should be included. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so I presume you prepared the 
10 
report after the investigation, is that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you just placed facts as you 
understood them? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And left it to whoever had to make a 
decision as to what charge to prefer? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You made no recommendations as to 
what charge should be preferred? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, according to a certain Mr – if you 
will turn with me to Bundle LEA23, if you will turn with me 
to page 42.1. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 140 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   42? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes, that’s right, page 42. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Did you say page 42? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Page 42 Bundle LEA23, if you would 
go to page 42. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now this is a statement – sorry 42, 
now if you will turn to the following page, to page 42.1. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   The following page?   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Pardon me – there must be a page 
10 
42.1 in that Bundle, are you looking at the top left-hand 
corner? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Ja, I’m looking here. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Chair, my junior can just assist.  
Thank you, Mr Chair, my apologies for that, do you have 
the document sir? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, this is a statement of a – that 
was taken from a person named Stefanus Hermanus Heiner 
[spelt into record] and it’s dated the 25 t h of July of 2017 
20 
and I want to read to you what he says, he says that on the 
30 t h of November, starting at the top paragraph, 
“I received a telephonic instruction from Brigadier 
Moyane 
to 
instruct 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Hennie 
Kruger 
and 
Captain 
Coetzee 
to 
investigate 
a 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 141 of 233 
 
security breach at the complex where Lieutenant 
General Phahlane stays. He indicated to me that 
O’Sullivan and others went to the complex where 
Lieutenant 
General 
Phahlane 
stays 
and 
asked 
questions 
relating 
to 
his 
house 
and 
security 
arrangements.  I was informed the same day that it 
was confirmed that it was O’Sullivan together with 
IPID members visited the place and asked various 
questions related to Lieutenant General Phahlane.  
I phoned Brigadier Moyane then the early evening 
10 
on the 30 t h of November 2017 and informed him of 
our finding and forwarded a written report to him on 
1 December 2017.  I do not know about the briefing 
session the investigation team was having at Crime 
Intelligence and was not part of it.  I did not work 
with the team, I did not supply any information to 
them.  I have never attended any meeting at the 
office of Lieutenant General Phahlane regarding 
this investigation and did not report to him on any 
of our findings.  With the investigation, no security 
20 
breach was found and instead it was found that 
O’Sullivan 
was 
with 
IPID 
investigation 
at 
the 
complex 
to 
investigate 
allegations 
against 
Lieutenant General Phahlane”, 
 
Now, assuming this to be correct, when you met 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 142 of 233 
 
with 
Brigadier 
Moyane, 
he 
communicated 
the 
exact 
opposite and said that a finding had been made or an 
assessment had been made that there was a security 
breach, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   He communicated that to 
us, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC: So, if I understand that, you say, 
correctly that – either this statement is incorrect or his 
statement is incorrect. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Well I can’t talk on his 
10 
statement I can talk only on the briefing that I received 
from Brigadier Moyane, this person, I don’t even know him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now subsequently, if you’ll just bear 
with me, there was a statement that was taken from you in 
a criminal investigation that had been – or was being 
conducted by IPID, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you gave a statement in those 
proceedings, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Can I ask, when was it? 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  When was the statement given?  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, when I gave the 
statement, I just want to… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Your statement was given on the 11 t h 
of December of 2017. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 143 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now in the statement, and I’d like you 
to turn with me to Bundle LEA23 and I’d like you to turn to 
page 59. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   59? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That’s correct and will you turn to page 
– hold that page open and turn to page 66. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I’m at 59. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Ja hold the page 59 open with your left 
hand, keep your left hand there and then turn to page 66, 
10 
is that... 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Is that your signature? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay, and if you go back to page 59 it 
says that this is the warning statement of Ntebo Jan 
Mabula. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Is this the statement that you gave to 
IPID? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now this statement was given to IPID 
after you had been – after you had, had an opportunity to 
consult with your attorneys, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 144 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You say, on page 60 at paragraph 5.1. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   60 Neh? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That’s correct. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Let me go to it, 5.1 I don’t 
see it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You see paragraph 5.1 at the bottom of 
the page? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   On page 60? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That’s right. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I don’t see. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Page 60 top left-hand corner. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
Ja, 
here’s 
page 
60…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Bottom of the page. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, 28.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   You’ll see that there’s paragraph 5 and 
then below paragraph 5, there’s a 5.1, you see that? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Hang on, yes.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   I think the bundle next to you is Bundle 
LEA23. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you moved to another Bundle from 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It’s Bundle LEA23. 
CHAIRPERSON:   23? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   23 Mr Chair. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 145 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, isn’t that the one we have been 
having all along? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I thought it was but I think the witness 
has moved it to the side. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I haven’t moved. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Oh, my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but is that the one you have now, 
is it the right one? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  LE23.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   That’s correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, you must always just look 
on the spine to see if it’s the right Bundle, that’s where it’s 
written LEA23, okay, page 60, is that right Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct Mr Chair.  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I’ve got…[intervenes]. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   At the bottom of that page, paragraph 
5.1, you see that? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You say, 
“I became aware thereof since my involvement in 
20 
this matter at the end of November 2016 that Crime 
Intelligence 
conducted 
a 
security 
breach 
investigation around November 2016 on the former 
acting National Commissioner of SAPS, Lieutenant 
General Phahlane”, 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 146 of 233 
 
On the following page, you say, 
“I also became aware thereof since my involvement, 
that as a result of the investigation by Crime 
Intelligence a report was submitted under reference 
CSI Inquiry 2/10/16, in this report it was conveyed 
as follows.  Report: possible security breach acting 
National 
Commissioner 
Lieutenant 
General 
Phahlane, 
paragraph 
4, 
comments 
and 
recommendations, 
sub-paragraph 
4.1, 
the 
Intelligence gathered, clearly indicated that this 
10 
action is spearheaded by Mr Paul O’Sullivan and 
he’s using IPID as background players.  4.2 your 
further instruction in this regard is awaited, and 
then it says, signed Section Commander Counter 
Intelligence, 
Colonel 
S.H. 
Heiner, 
date 
30 
November 2016. Below that, comments, this is a 
serious breach of the security of the acting National 
Commissioner and criminal case to be investigated 
on the matter, this must be conducted ASAP, signed 
acting head, Counter and Security Intelligence, 
20 
Criminal 
Intelligence 
and 
Security 
Intelligence, 
Brigadier T. Moyane, date 30 November 2016”, 
 
Now you put that in inverted commas, I imagine that 
this is a quote that has been taken from somewhere, is that 
right? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 147 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now what is this quote been taken 
from, where did you get this information? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I think, this one, I can’t – I 
don’t know how it came in here, I can’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I can’t remember how this 
one came because my knowledge was saying, I never 
received the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes okay. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And according to this, you’re saying 
that the report that – according to the statement, this 
report which is quoted verbatim, indicates that there was a 
serious threat against the life of the acting National 
Commissioner, correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Oh, well it says, rather, the breach of 
the security of the acting National Commissioner and it’s 
signed by Mr Heiner, you see that, according to this quote? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Ja, according to it but me, I 
20 
can’t remember this one. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you never have provided the 
Commission with this document, in other words the report 
that you’re referring to over here, you never provided it to 
this Commission. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 148 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I’m not sure as well it was 
provided. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What we’re trying to understand is, 
where is this report, everybody is searching for this report 
and I certainly haven’t seen it and I understand that – it 
may not be for your account, but I understand that it can’t 
be located and yet you obviously had it, according to what 
you’ve said in your statement. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I don’t have the report 
with me. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The question is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, did you ever have, in your 
possession, such a report or ever see it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You never saw it?  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I never saw the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, the quotation that Mr Hulley referred 
to, how did you come to have that quotation in your 
statement, if you didn’t see such a report? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Chair, the only – what I can 
20 
remember is, we were briefed as I’ve previously said but 
the report, I can’t remember whether I did see the report 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was this a letter, I see in – what you 
were reading Mr Hulley is, what is at page 62 isn’t it?   
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 149 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   61 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   61? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Page 62 refers to something different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, well page 5 – I mean 5.1 says, 
“I became aware thereof since my involvement in 
this 
matter 
at 
end 
of 
November 
that 
Crime 
Intelligence 
conducted 
a 
security 
breach 
investigation around November 2016 on the former 
acting National Commissioner.  5.2 I also became 
aware thereof since my involvement as a result of 
10 
this investigation by Crime Intelligence.  A report 
was submitted under reference CSI Inquiry, in this 
report it was conveyed as follows”, 
 
And then you quote but you couldn’t – you wouldn’t 
have quoted if you didn’t see that. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, I can’t recall because I 
tried to – before the Commission I tried to read just to 
check how did we – because my understanding was like, it 
was actually presented verbally to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it was presented verbally to you it 
20 
would be strange that you would quote it the way you have, 
isn’t it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I do agree sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, when one looks at the way you 
have quoted it, one would imagine that you had seen the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 150 of 233 
 
report. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say you don’t know whether you 
did see it, you don’t know whether you did not see it.   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I don’t recall that, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would it be correct to say you would 
not quote something that you haven’t seen?  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, not possible you can’t 
quote something…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you can’t quote something you have 
10 
not seen.  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, we – it’s fair to say, you must have 
seen it…[intervenes]. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I might have seen it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it existed. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if it didn’t exist, of course, that 
would be something else. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   That’s something I can’t 
20 
quote on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now, putting that 
issue aside, just temporarily, that Mr Heiner that you’re 
referring to over there seems to be the same person who’s 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 151 of 233 
 
statement I read out to you a moment ago, who, in fact, 
says the opposite. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Are you, now, given what you’ve 
already quoted, are you in a position to assist us as to how 
Mr Heiner is saying something which is the exact opposite 
to what you have, in a previous statement indicated that 
you had a report which said something which is exactly the 
opposite of what Mr Heiner is saying? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I can’t respond to that 
10 
because I’m also – in my mind I’m trying to check, how did 
this thing come into play. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course, Mr McBride gave his 
evidence last year. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would have imagined that after he 
gave evidence and you applied for leave to cross-examine 
him, you would have checked documentation that you have 
and that you might need and obviously this would have 
been in the content report. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, have you tried, over the past year 
or so to find that report, with other people who might have 
known about it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  There was a crime intelligence 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 152 of 233 
 
also there was – we tried to find out whether it was that.  We 
never got. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you have tried to locate it. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  There was this issue of the 
bodies missing.  We heard there was this the ones who were 
doing the investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  As we speak are you in a position to say 
you over the past year since Mr McBride gave evidence you 
know that you have tried everything to try and get it or are 
you saying you have not tried everything? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No I have not tried. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not tried everything? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja why did you not try everything to get it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you not try everything to try and 
find it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Because I could not – I did 
not remember whether the report was in my possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but obviously it is quite an important 
20 
[00:00:56]. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes it is but also… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would keep arguing that you want to 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 153 of 233 
 
challenge Mr McBride’s evidence that you would want to do 
your homework, get whatever documents you may have 
based your investigations on. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes but the – Chair the 
documents according to me it was supposed to be Crime 
Intelligence.  Crime Intelligence said they do not have the 
document – it is misplaced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm yes.  But you say you have not tried 
everything to try and find it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  No from our side because I 
10 
did not receive the – I did not have it in my possession.  I 
from the other side of Crime Intelligence who are actually 
the compiler of the document.  It is where to make some 
enquiries from them they could not give the document to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   But – but you – do you say you never 
had it in your possession because even seeing it maybe 
somebody allowed you to see it but said do not take it away.  
Or are you saying I actually do not know whether it exists? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I – I tried to find out among 
the team members but we could not find out actually how this 
20 
– we could not come with answers.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you sit there are you able to 
positively say such a report did exist or did not exist? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I cannot tell you.  I cannot 
safely say 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 154 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot safely say. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Because I do not have it with 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at five past four maybe we should 
take a short break.  You – I take it you are not far from 
finishing your … 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I still have to deal with the – the issue 
relating to General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But I need to round up some of the 
issues relating to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  When – when – we will take a short 
break. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let – let us try and have some 
agreement first.  We will take a short break now maybe for 
20 
up to twenty past and then we will come back.  What you – 
we were dealing with now may have been important.  You 
say how much more time do you think you need?  You had 
initially indicated I think an hour which would – which should 
expire at half past four.  Where – what do you think how 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 155 of 233 
 
much time do you think you need? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I think the evidence relating to General 
Booysen that would go a lot quicker.  The – this evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of time?  How much time?   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Probably about… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think – I think I would like that… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Between half an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr McBride be cross-examined insofar as 
Counsel for regarding Major General Mabula may need to 
cross-examine him.  So I would like that to be done today if 
10 
possible. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not want us to sit here forever. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No indeed not.  I would like to finalise 
just this section probably only about another ten or fifteen 
minutes relating to this section and then I will get onto 
General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that part would need about how much 
time? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Probably about forty minutes or so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Mr Joubert we normally stop at four 
but we – we are going beyond that.  From your side is that 
fine? 
ADV JOUBERT:  It is in order Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 156 of 233 
 
ADV JOUBERT:  I will not be that long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is in order.  Where is Counsel for Mr 
McBride?  What is your situation and your client’s situation?  
Yes do you have an idea how long – in terms of those 
commitments what is the latest he might wish to leave here?  
Oh okay alright.  Okay alright let us take a ten minutes 
break. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we will come back and resume.  
Mr Joubert what is your estimate of how long you might be 
10 
with Mr McBride? 
ADV JOUBERT:  I do not anticipate to be longer than twenty 
minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay.  Thank you.  We will 
take a short adjournment we will resume at twenty past. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.

Page 157 of 233 
 
 
I 
understand 
from 
the 
discussions 
that 
there 
are 
challenges with proceeding on Monday with the evidence 
that are supposed to be led on Monday. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, there are.  There are problems. The 
affidavits that should have been are not yet complete and 
therefore the witness that was to testify on Monday is unable 
to testify before seeing these affidavits and respond to those 
affidavits. 
 
As I was saying that the matter should not be... should 
we sit on Monday, should be postponed with another date.  
10 
And then Chair, the arrangement we have reached is that the 
two affidavits should be filed within two weeks. 
 
One witness has promised to file the affidavit by end of 
next week.  The other one, we are hoping in two weeks’ time.  
So and that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Why so long? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Well, Chair the one for next week, he 
wanted some extension from which we have received now 
and he said it will not take him more than a week now to 
finalise that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think more attempts should be made to 
have them all of them filed by end of next week if possible 
and only if really it is impossible should we go the week after 
because ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, actually when you look at what 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 158 of 233 
 
they need to consider ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...it should not be... it is not long 
affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   A week should be enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then the legal representatives of the 
witness who was going to testify next week, it will also take 
about a week to respond to those. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then the matter will be then right for 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And also the... remember Chair, it was 
also the hearing of the evidence of a witness and cross-
examination of two witnesses who have testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The legal representatives of also of 
those two witnesses are here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let them place themselves on record but 
finish what you need to do so that I do not have to come 
back to you about what you might have to say. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 159 of 233 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  If there is anything further you want to say 
before they come on record. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, Chair there is nothing else Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright.  Alright.  Let them come 
on record.  Oh, I think they must sanitise before you... they 
must just sanitise the place before you use it.   
MR WILLIS:   Good afternoon, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon. 
MR WILLIS:   [Indistinct]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIS:   My name is Willis.  I appear for Mr Wakeford. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIS:   Who is the witness who would give evidence 
before you and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Last year? 
MR WILLIS:   That was when he last appeared.  So we 
confirmed what Mr Notshe has submitted to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Did 
you want to...[intervenes]  
20 
MR WILLIS:   Mr Wirtz who appears for Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  The 
arrangement about your postponement is agreed? 
MR WILLIS:   It is.  The intention is to secure ...[indistinct] 
or two days in the very near future ...[intervenes]  
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 160 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WILLIS:   ...just as soon as the various other 
administrative aspects can be finalised ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIS:   ...in relation to the other affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am aware about the wish to look at two 
days.  I am not... I have not made up my mind but I am 
aware of the suggestion.  But when the next date is 
determined, I will apply my mind whether it should be two 
days. 
10 
 
I know that Mr Notshe also seems to think that we 
should do that but we will see.  We even have evening 
sessions now.   
MR WILLIS:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we are running against time.  So 
but I will apply mind to that when I set it down again. 
MR WILLIS:   Yes, but it is generally two days we would 
finalise the matter.  One other aspect Mr Chairman is the 
correspondence that we have to address to you.   
 
There are three questions on which we require your 
20 
direction.  We will await those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIS:   But everything else will be sooner.  We can 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am aware.  It is just that I think 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 161 of 233 
 
there are two letters. 
MR WILLIS:   Indeed so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The first one reached me after it had 
reached other people first and then so I was the last one to 
get it.  And then within a few days I got the next one.   
 
One, in terms of the procedure as to whether cross-
examination will start or whether your client will first give 
evidence, I propose to decide that on the first day on the 
day. 
 
Obviously, 
I 
have 
seen 
that 
you 
have 
made 
10 
representations in your letter. 
MR WILLIS:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think what you ought to do is simple 
be ready for either situation, you know. 
MR WILLIS:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it goes your way, then all the better.  But 
just be ready so that we do not have to adjourn because 
maybe ...[intervenes]  
MR WILLIS:   Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR WILLIS:   Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think that was the one.  There was 
the other one I remember about leading your witness. 
MR WILLIS:   There is to lead, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That one I would... if you want to address 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 162 of 233 
 
me on that day, I will let you do that.  But if you what you 
have written, you believe it is enough, I can make... 
announce my decision then as well. 
MR WILLIS:   On that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WILLIS:   Chair, I will be ready to... whichever you 
decide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And then I cannot remember the third 
one. 
MR WILLIS:   The third aspect relates to the... I think the 
10 
answer to that one is the consolidation of the evidence but I 
believe that be of assistance to you in any event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think that probably, it should be 
done so that, if at all possible, maybe there is one common 
bundle. 
MR WILLIS:   Yes, the bundles will be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is what you wanted. 
MR WILLIS:   The bundles will be common. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIS:   The other one is just a matter of consolidating 
20 
his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that will be convenient. 
MR WILLIS:   Instead of working through the various 
affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 163 of 233 
 
MR WILLIS:   Placing one affidavit before we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that will be convenient. 
MR WILLIS:   And that, we believe so too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no.  I think that one would be 
convenient for everybody.  It should be done, ja.  
MR WILLIS:   It will be done.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but thank you very much.  The hearing 
of Ms Wakeford’s evidence and the cross-examination of Mr 
Agrizzi and Mr Vosloo, I think, that was scheduled for 
Monday is postponed to a date that is still to be determined.  
10 
Thank you very much. 
MR WILLIS:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  You are excused. 
MR WILLIS:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Oh, I am sorry.  Counsel for 
Mr Agrizzi.  I got the impression that you had not... you go to 
the podium.  That is why I have not allowed you to say 
anything.   
ADV WIRTZ:   Thank you, Chair.  Advocate Wirtz.  W-i-r-t-z.  
I confirm that I appear on behalf of Mr Agrizzi, as well as Mr 
20 
Le Roux relating to the matter on Monday.  My learned 
friend, Advocate Notshe did phone me and told me there is a 
problem - not from our side or from Mr Wakeford’s side - 
certain documents and affidavits that are outstanding which 
are needed by all the parties. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 164 of 233 
 
 
So we are waiting for those affidavits.  He has 
undertaken, as soon as they are given and as soon as Mr 
Wakeford’s counsel has responded, we will be able to 
respond within a day or two. 
 
So we are not going delay it.  We all area ready.  Mr 
Agrizzi was ready, Mr Le Roux was ready, and/or any others 
that might be needed that we represent.  And we have 
agreed that it can be postponed to a date to be fixed.   
 
In regards to the days and the procedure, I am not sure 
whether you have received the correspondence from my 
10 
instructing attorney  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WIRTZ:   And we have taken a certain stance and we 
will abide by the directives and by your decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WIRTZ:   We are not going to address you any further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WIRTZ:   And we will abide from our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV WIRTZ:   That is our position.  Thank you, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WIRTZ:   And if we can then be freed and also thank 
you to yourself and my learned friends who did indicate 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 165 of 233 
 
ADV WIRTZ:   ... the matter you are busy with and to let us 
impose so that we did not have to wait. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WIRTZ:   So we apologise and we thank them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV WIRTZ:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV WIRTZ:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you, alright.  Mr Hulley, 
we can proceed.  They will sanitise first the podium.  And 
10 
then Major General Mabula can come back.  Mr Hulley, are 
you tempted to give you five instead of ten minutes to 
finalise the questions relating to Mr McBride?  Do you think 
that is too harsh? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It may well be Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Shall be play it by ear?  About to five or 
ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  No, continue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then after you have done that 
then, of course, go straight to the questions that relates to 
Mr Booysen. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 166 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now, according to 
– and we have a report that is in Bundle LEA23 at page 236 
– according to the analyses of the cell phone records.  
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Page 236, LEA23. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  So I just wanted to just 
request to the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Chair, I want to apologise.  
When I came here, I was busy refreshing on my statement 
10 
that I submitted to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  This, actually, came as a 
surprise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Now what I did during the 
break, I tried to go through the whole statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  This warning statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It changed my mind now how 
this ...[indistinct] was.  I really want to apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Because really, I do not even 
think of this. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 167 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Now when I read here and the 
warning statement where I submitted those statements 
because I have submitted lots of warning statements.  So I 
did not know which one it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Now I recall very well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  And I think someone can 
testify on my behalf. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  When we...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  You are going back to the issue of 
the report? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  The one of Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I want to also to be firm to 
say, I have never seen the report when we were initially 
20 
briefed by Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, on the 30t h. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  On the 30t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  But now I remember.  When 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 168 of 233 
 
IPID approached us, we were represented by an advocate 
from Pretoria.  I cannot recall the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You forgot the name? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Is there in submitted that 
statements.  Moyane and General Makhele were supposed to 
be charged as well.  On that day when we were consulting 
with the advocate, this part of their input. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The report was part of ...[intervenes]  
10 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
Was 
part 
of 
Crime 
Intelligence’s input.  It was actually connected to my warning 
statement.  I recall now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I just, when I read through 
these things, I read though and I said but something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  So but, in fact, I did not have 
in my possession but in the beginning, we did not had it 
because it was ...[indistinct] from the report has into my 
20 
warning statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  So I want to apologise 
because I was just thinking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 169 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes.  So I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are in a position to say, you do 
remember that you saw it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, Advocate Joubert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Advocate Joubert.  Not this 
Joubert but the other one in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are able to say such a report did 
exist? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You saw it. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Moyane had it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes.  And then the advocate 
20 
extracted the same information from that then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From that report. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  But I never had it in my 
possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 170 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  It is only afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry, let me just it understand it.  You 
extracted it from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  When he quoted from.  It means he quoted 
from it. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes.  Yes, the advocate 
quoted it from that document.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  But where was the document?  How did 
he come in possession of the document. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Brigadier Moyane – when we 
were called – I think all us, we are supposed to be charged. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Now he brought... we were 
consulting to that advocate in one room.  So as we were 
deliberating, that document was produced there.  It is where 
20 
now it was quoted from here.  That is why then I cannot 
because I never actually possessed it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I see. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  It was read. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 171 of 233 
 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  So because I was just said 
that, how do I say I never saw it but I call it here?  But when 
the Chair adjourned, he gave me an opportunity to go 
through.  Then I find my senses. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So when you consulted with Advocate 
Joubert, not the present Advocate Joubert, you... he would 
have had access to the document. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Because other people were in that 
meeting. 
10 
GENERA MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Also had access.  So who ...[intervenes]  
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes, because ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But you yourself did not see the 
document? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  No.  Obviously, once it is 
quoted here, I would have seen it because I signed the 
document.   
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now that... who were the other people 
that you were within that meeting? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  It was almost the whole team. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 172 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Who? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Brigadier Ncube was there.  
Kgorane was.  Colonel Reddy was there.  Dawood was there.  
General Makhele was there and Brigadier Moyane was there.  
I am not sure of DM, whether he was there.  This other guy 
who was present when did the briefing. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So General Makhele was present in that 
meeting? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And who produced the report? 
10 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Ja, Brigadier Moyane if my 
memory serves me well.  Because I have just made a 
mistake.  A big, big mistake.  Because I could not understand 
how. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, obviously, if the report does exist 
and it is found, it clarifies at least something about the fact 
that it existed.  So do you know whether you can, now that 
you remember, who had it that you have good chances of 
getting a copy of it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  I can talk to this gentleman 
20 
here who I am referring to if he has got a copy with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Very well.  Was General Makhele present 
in that meeting as well? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 173 of 233 
 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes, if I recall very well.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You see, in her statement – if you will 
turn with me to page 65. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Page 65. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry, this is Bundle LEA23, by the way. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  This here? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 56? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Five, six Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five, six.   
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes.  Yes.  Ja. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  She, other than to talk, in terms about 
the fact of the report, are the security breaches assessment 
that have been obtained.  She does not refer to the content 
of that report.  Are you able to comment on that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, what is the question? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry.  If you look at page 56.  Let me 
just try and find it first.  Page 56 to 58 is the statement of 
Major General M Agnes Makhele.  Do you see that? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now if you turn to paragraph P at that 
20 
statement on page 57, she says that: 
“On the 30t h of November 2016, I have received a 
report of a security breach assessment of the Acting 
National Commissioner of SAPS, Lieutenant General 
Phahlane 
conducted 
by 
Counter 
and 
Security 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 174 of 233 
 
Intelligence Crime Intelligence and the investigation 
under reference SCI 2/10/2016.   
It was clear through the security assessment that 
there was a serious security breach that warranted a 
criminal investigation...” 
 
So what I am saying is that in her affidavit or her 
statement she does not refer at all to the report that has 
been received. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And I am asking you, if you are in a 
10 
position to comment on it?  You had never seen that report 
before this meeting, according to your testimony. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Makhele would have received that report.  
Moyane ought to have receive that report and yet neither one 
of them... Makhele does not refer to the report and Moyane 
does not... sorry, does not quote the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the report that she refers to in 
paragraph 3 at page 57 a different report? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It seems to be it is the same report 
20 
because this is the security breach assessment that has 
been 
conducted, 
she 
says, 
by 
Counter 
and 
Security 
Intelligence Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So she is referring to the same report. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 175 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So what is the question? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The point I am making is that there is 
no... the two people that one would expected to produce the 
report and to refer to it, two people who had previously 
apparently had sight of the report, they do not refer to that 
report in their... they do not quote the report in their 
statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but how is Major General Mabula going 
to explain why they choice not to quote it? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, I am asking him if he is able to 
10 
assist us on that because ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not understand.  He quoted the report 
and he now says he does remember that the report did exist 
and he saw it.  The comment to this affidavit, Makhele in 
paragraph 3 talks about the same report.  So she is aware it 
existed.  The fact that she might not quote it ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, taken a stand.  Why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not mean any problems for him.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  But I am trying to understand why it was 
decided specifically for him to quote the report who has 
20 
never seen the report before that day, when the two people 
who had seen the report, their statements ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not understand why that is important.  
He... they were consulting with counsel.  One of them had, 
namely Mr Moyane had the report, counsel quoted it in his 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 176 of 233 
 
statement.  This deponent refers to the report, does not 
quote it, probably because she does not see the need.  I am 
not sure that I understand why that part is important. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, it was part of the decision that was 
taken in the consultation.  I just want to understand from him 
why he is...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, he cannot help you on that.  He cannot 
help you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  With regards to the 
attorney that represented you in this matter, who was the 
10 
attorney who represented you at this stage? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Advocate Joubert. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Ja, I know he is the advocate.  Who is 
the attorney?  Did you have an attorney? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  No.  No, I think fright from the 
state attorneys we were referred to him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Oh, I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also Mr Hulley.  With the limited time 
that you asked for that I gave you, I am not sure who the 
attorney was will really assist us. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In terms of obtaining the statement.  
Sorry, the... that particular report Mr Chair.  That is the only 
thing I am concerned with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think you can get it from Mr Moyane. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  I will try my best Mr

Chairperson. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If we can just move onto an additional 
point relating to your movement on the 27t h of November of 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you moving onto questions relating to 
Major General Booysen? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Not as... I just want to finalise the 
question about his movement on the 27 t h of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, please finalise within two minutes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then let us move to the questions relating 
to General Booysen. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry, Mr Chair I did not catch that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I am saying finalise within two 
minutes so that we can move towards questions relating to 
Major General Booysen. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Yes, if you would 
turn with me to LEA23 at page 236. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Page two...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  236. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is LEA23? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is page two...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  236. 
CHAIRPERSON:  236. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 178 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now this is a report that is compiled 
based on the cell phone records of several people including 
you and General Phahlane amongst others.  What I would 
like to... according to the report which was part of the docket 
in CAS I34/05/2015.   
 
You would have in... you would have on the Sunday the 
27t h of November of 2016, you would have travelled up to 
Pretoria to meet with General Phahlane.  Is that correct? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  I would not know the date.  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, this would have been the day 
10 
before or few days before you had been appointed to 
conduct this investigation. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Chair, I cannot confirm and 
deny.  There were instances like exit.  Sometimes I had to 
meet with the National Commissioner.  So I cannot deny but I 
cannot specifically say yes on that day but if the record says 
that, then I met with him. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now if we could turn to page 238. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  238. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  At the foot of the page you will see there, 
20 
it says on Sunday, the 27t h of November and says as per 
data section of ...[indistinct] of 783169.  Now that data 
relates to your... the movement on your side. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And then on the following page, page 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 179 of 233 
 
239, it itemises ...[intervenes]  
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  239. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  239.  It itemises all the transactions that 
took place on your phone until the following page at page 
240. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  240, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now it shows that you received a call 
12:58 
from 
General 
Phahlane 
and 
it 
shows 
that 
the 
transaction was record through the Goudkop Tower.  Now I 
understand that you live in that area.  Will it be correct? 
10 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  In Goudkop? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Ja, is that correct? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  No, I do not stay in Goudkop. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Where do you stay? 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  I stay in...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, Mr Hulley.  What is the point 
with these cell phone records? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, Mr Chair it shows that the witness 
would have met with General Phahlane a day before the 
actual meeting the... sorry, a few days before he was 
20 
appointed to the team.  So we would like to know what the 
purpose of that meeting was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The day before.  I mean, he occupies a 
certain position within the SAPS. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 180 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Phahlane 
was 
Acting 
National 
Commissioner.  Is there something that we are pursuing in 
here? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, we want to establish whether the... 
he was, in fact, in that meeting, was the purpose of the 
meeting to confirm ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But is there a factual basis for us to think 
that there is something important about him having... the two 
of them having met on the day? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, we want to establish whether he 
10 
was in fact appointed because as the records that show on 
the Sunday, in other words, three days before he was 
appointed to team, did he actually meet with the general and 
was the purpose of that meeting to appoint him to the team. 
That is what we would like to establish.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be the last question.  Please say 
something. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Chair, I will be the provincial 
commissioner responsible for all the investigations in North 
West Province. 
 I am the 
Deputy to that Provincial 
20 
Commissioner.   
 
The National Commissioner, whatever he has access to 
any Deputy Provincial Commissioner if there are official in 
that particular province.   
 
I have met General Phahlane many times even before 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 181 of 233 
 
this investigation.  Then there were issues that allows me or 
he needs me to... but I do not know this one specific why I 
have met with him.  It is not a secret.   
 
Every Regional Commissioner has the right and I cannot 
deny.  If it was a complaint or whatever task he wanted to 
give in terms of the position that I have, I am not to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Now in relation to General 
Booysen.  If we can move onto his ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I will give you twenty minutes rather 
10 
than thirty  minutes.  We are at ten to five so we have got 
to ten past five then let us see whether within twenty  
instead of thirty minutes you cannot make it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now General 
Booysen, 
you 
went 
to 
Kwazulu-Natal 
to 
investigate 
allegations relate – or to conduct an investigation into the 
Cato Manor hit squads, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Who was part of that team that 
accompanied you to conduct that investigation? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yoh, it is a long time ago.  
In the [indistinct] I think he said he was part of it, there 
was Brigadier Dukwana, it was General Mokoena who is 
now the head of the Hawks in Mpumalanga.  There was 
also Gola from Gauteng, there was also I think Ramakhosi, 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 182 of 233 
 
there were a number of them. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What – in the investigations that you 
had conducted and with reference to what you have said in 
your statement and I am going to try not to go through your 
statement, given the time limitations, but what did the 
investigations establish from your perspective, into the 
death squad, that is, in the Cato Manor case? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Maybe let me first do it this 
10 
way so that the Chair can understand.  When I was 
appointed to deal with Cato Manor my mandate was a fact-
finding mission in terms of the newspaper article that was 
printed on the national media.   
Then I assembled – I was appointed and the terms 
of reference that I have said it was exactly like that, we did 
obtain statements from people and then the reports were 
sent to General Dramat and then out of that report I think 
there were certain steps that were taken against those 
members.   
20 
But it does not end up just there, Chairperson.  
Whilst we were busy with that investigation, even in terms 
of 
my 
statement, 
IPID 
was 
also 
busy 
with 
criminal 
investigations against the same Cato Manor led by Mr 
Khubane. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 183 of 233 
 
So it was more of parallel investigations but our 
mandate was not the same but what I did, when I 
[indistinct] in cases and I make sure because General 
Dramat gave us instruction to say when you arrive, you go 
to IPID, you inform IPID that this is what you are busy with 
again.   
But amongst ourselves we had a legal person as 
well who would also assist us.  I think he left the police, 
Colonel Vassan, if I remember very well. 
 
So as we are about to wrap up our fact-finding 
10 
mission there was this interaction between the then head 
of IPID, maybe ICD by that time, Mr Beekman, and General 
Dramat as well as the Acting National Commissioner 
General Mkhwanazi by then.   
In that interaction of them, they then – because by 
then when we did this fact-finding mission I came to realise 
IPID long time ago they were already busy with this 
investigation against Cato Manor but when we give the 
briefing and there was a decision taken, actually it was a 
request from IPID  IPID request – Mr Shoga(?) part of that, 
20 
I see he is here as well.   
They requested – they delivered to General Dramat.  
General Dramat, I see your guys are moving faster on this 
fact-finding mission, would like this team to combine with 
our team to support them.  General Dramat, nè?  Without 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 184 of 233 
 
even my team.  General Dramat, there was that kind of an 
agreement.   
Now we have to leave the fact-finding mission, we 
have to concentrate now on the criminal investigation.  We 
worked together with IPID, that is how – I want to say.  
But I also want to highlight this.  When I was co-
opted with my team into IPID because when they were 
presenting, we were all there but what – there were certain 
witness that I identified.  I emphasised that while they 
were doing these cases, they were dragging too long but 
10 
there 
was 
no 
way 
where 
a 
prosecutorial 
guided 
investigation was on - coming on.   
They were complaining about the reports, the 
reconstruction of the crime scene and immediately when 
we met I spoke to them to say people, we are here to 
assist as we are instructed by the chiefs of us but I want to 
know from you, do you have the dedicated prosecutor who 
deals with this matter?  The answer was no.   
Then I said, I said it myself, I cannot work with you 
whilst we do not have prosecutor guided investigations 
20 
because these were all cases, complicated.   
 
Then I take it upon myself, I said no, I will approach 
the DPP case again.  [indistinct] assigned a dedicated 
prosecutor for the first time into this team where we were 
working together with them.  I took it upon myself, I did not 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 185 of 233 
 
know the DPP cases then but later on I realised Mr 
Mlotshwa was the Acting DPP.   
I phoned Mr Mlotshwa.  Mr Mlotshwa, here I am, I 
explained 
exactly 
what 
I 
have 
explained 
to 
the 
Commission.   But what I see literally here, we do not have 
a prosecutor who is going to assist this investigation.  
Then he did not answer me.   
He said no, General, I am busy in a meeting can we 
meet after four?  Then we agreed.  We never went to his 
office by the way, he then suggested where can we meet?   
10 
Then I did know cases then by then, he said no, I 
think we agreed, we are going to meet at the provincial 
headquarters of KZN, the police [indistinct].  We met 
outside.  
 
Then I presented myself to him.   What he told me, 
he said  General, I hear what  you say, it is a good thing 
that you think but I can only tell you these guys, my 
prosecutors, they are afraid of these Cato Manor people, 
you are not going to get anything out of them, can I advise 
you – this is his words, can I advise you?  I say yes.  He 
20 
said no, you better – because now we are like a national 
investigation you need that deals with together with IPID.  
It is better for you to can maybe make contact with the 
NDPP. 
 
Then also make an undertaking to say but I have 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 186 of 233 
 
informed the NDPP to say this is what you request but do 
me a favour also, make a follow-up the next morning.  He 
gave 
me 
the 
number 
of 
the 
Acting 
DPP 
by 
then.  
Unfortunately, it was, because this is  – it was General 
Jiba who was the Acting DPP. 
 
The 
next 
morning 
I 
phoned 
Advocate 
Jiba.  
Advocate Jiba, this is the situation.  But when I presented 
this to him it was like it was not a surprise.  No, Mr 
Mlotshwa has already informed me.  What I need, you and 
the team of IPID, you must make an appointment with my 
10 
office to come and brief me what resources you need from 
me.  It is what he says. 
 
The next week Mr Angus - because that time, 
immediately after that conversation they decided IPID to 
withdraw Kuba, Mr Kuba(?) , because we were not happy 
with how he led the team.  They replaced him with Mr 
Angus.  I then – because I was told strictly as Advocate 
Jiba said, said you come in. I [indistinct]  your colleague to 
my office. I went with Mr Angus who was actually leading 
the team of IPID. We went there.   
20 
When we arrived in Pretoria, we found Advocate 
[indistinct].  We then briefed them, this is the situation how 
we come into IPID investigation.  I explained that.   
 
After that then she said to me General, I see this is 
a very serious investigation, do you have anyone in mind 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 187 of 233 
 
that you feel you can be compatible working with?  I said 
to him, no, I do not know people in Gauteng, the only 
person that I know is Advocate Maema. 
 Then Advocate Maema - then said to me I will talk 
to Advocate [indistinct]  but I am not sure he will release 
that person because he was a Deputy DPP in North West 
but on then on the same breath he asked me do you know 
Advocate Mathenjwa?  I said no, I do not know him.  He 
says no, Advocate Mathenjwa is this guy who is dealing 
with the case of DPP(?) he is one of the best advocates.   
10 
Then I said [indistinct]  is fine.  But then what 
happened, he nominated six advocates.  Three deputy 
directors, the one is currently in Pretoria …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat the previous 
sentence?  When you say – you said [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] Just tell me that again? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I missed something when you said you 
said you know what happened then you talk about six 
advocates.  I want you to repeat that because I did not 
20 
catch it. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I say what happened, 
he nominated six advocates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is now Advocate Jiba. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   And DPP. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 188 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Advocate Jiba. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   To assist this team.  But on 
the same breath, I do not know why, he said Advocate 
Maema will be the leader of those advocates.  It was – I 
cannot recall the names but I know only there is Adv 
Mlotshwa, I think he is the deputy in Free State.  Maema is 
the deputy in North West.  Mathenjwa is the deputy in 
Gauteng and there are other senior advocates.  They 
came.  They came, then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you asked for one, you got six. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, no, because I – look, I 
think [indistinct].  I asked for an advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they have been very persuasive. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, not necessarily, not 
Chair, maybe they even presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I am saying 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Yes, they were represented, 
he felt maybe this is a big case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   So these people came down 
20 
and then from there then Advocate Mathenjwa arrived, it 
was five of them but he informed us and IPID, we were 
called, to us and IPID to say we are here at the request of 
these two colleagues, Angus and General Mabula to assist 
in this investigation but I made it clear Advocate Maema 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 189 of 233 
 
will be the leading advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Who 
was 
speaking 
now, 
saying 
…[intervenes] 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It was Advocate Mathenjwa 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the – in Durban now? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   In Durban because he came 
down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes and they went through 
10 
all the work.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So ultimately it was five who came, not 
six? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, but later, I think two 
weeks later, Advocate Maema, he knew – I think he was 
busy with some court cases.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   He came down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   That is how I get involved.  
20 
I just wanted to clear this thing to the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no but what you are saying is 
important to this …[intervenes] 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes because it is like, 
Chair, I am one who just raise hands every time, give me 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 190 of 233 
 
this thing, give me these things.   
But I also want to put it on record as well, when I 
was removed from DPC, the same like John Booysen, the 
same like the other people, when [indistinct]  came he 
removed all of us.  We were gone.  That is why we went 
back to the detectives.   
When I was removed, I then said to General 
Ntlemeza I am busy with this case, can I please be 
excused from it because now I have to focus in the 
provincial work.  It was refused.  The current head of the 
10 
Hawks, when he took over, I wrote a letter through the 
Provincial Commissioner, I do not want to go back to KZN 
on these cases, I want to focus on the province, I am no 
longer in DPCI.  They refused.  I wanted to just make this 
statement so that people can understand my involvement 
because it seems as if, you know, I am very much 
[indistinct] what I said. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sure. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The evidence that you have given now 
20 
– sorry, I am just struggling to find it in your statement.  
Where did you put all of that about your – the fact that you 
requested – where in your statement do you deal with the 
fact that you had requested Advocate Mlotshwa who was 
dealing with the Cato Manor case? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 191 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Mlotshwa? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Ja.   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Meama. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Where do you deal with the fact that 
you were the one that had a discussion with him and he 
then suggested to you that you should speak to the 
National 
Director 
of 
Public 
Prosecutions 
because 
everybody in Kwazulu-Natal was afraid?  Where is that in 
your statement? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It is not there, that is why I 
10 
said I want to give the background.  I wanted to give the 
Chairperson – he must have an understanding before you 
start how I come into picture, it is not there.  But people 
who come and testify will tell the same thing. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So when you then met with Advocate 
Jiba in Johannesburg was at that stage …[intervenes] 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   At Pretoria. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry, at Pretoria, who at that stage 
was the Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions, 
correct? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You wanted a dedicated Prosecutor to 
be appointed to deal with the Cato Manor investigation. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Can I rephrase it?  I never 
said I want a dedicated prosecutor from Advocate Jiba, I 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 192 of 233 
 
said I want a dedicated – the first meeting that I had with 
Advocate Mlotshwa I wanted a dedicated prosecutor to 
assist, of which he said he do not think these people would 
be able to because they were afraid of Cato Manor.  That 
is what he said.  What he can do is to arrange – he 
actually suggested that maybe national must provide 
because we were actually doing a sort of a national 
investigation.   
When I went to speak to Advocate Jiba I never said 
to him I want one, but I want what, I presented because I 
10 
was with Mr Angus.  We presented what the current 
situation is in KZN and how far IPID is.  Because 
remember, I was thinking who, they were already there.  
The presentation was more reliant on them.  So then out of 
her own discretion she sent six advocates. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But as I understood your evidence 
earlier, the purpose of your meeting with Advocate Jiba 
was to secure – a prosecutor would be dedicated to the 
Cato Manor investigation. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now when you say you never said you 
want one, I am not sure that I understand that because you 
must have said something and you would not – you would 
either have said we need a prosecutor or we need 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 193 of 233 
 
prosecutors. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I said we want a – we 
presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   After we presented because 
I believe other people were also - there were IC, he 
already briefed him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   To say we are coming we 
need this kind of report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   So after we presented, he 
said, he is General [indistinct] out your presentation I do 
not think one advocate is enough to deal with what you 
present to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying that at that meeting 
you yourself did not say you want one or two? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Advocate Jiba spoke on the basis or 
spoke as if she had been told that you were looking for one 
20 
prosecutor. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you say she said I do not think 
you need one. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, that is why I am saying 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 194 of 233 
 
– I am saying this thing because he wanted to know which 
advocate do you have in mind that can help you to be 
comfortable with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Then I said Advocate 
Maema .  It is then that she said no, but I do not think what 
your presentation that you presented to me, it might not 
need one.  If you want to formalise this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But from what you are now saying 
it seems that even though you might not have said to her 
10 
we want one. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of what you said you were 
looking for one because in fact which and you said Maema 
, you did not say Maema and so and so and so. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I did not, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she said I do not think you 
need one, you need more. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So now based on the presentation that 
you had given – and I take it that it was you, it was Angus 
and it was who else at this presentation? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Not it was only two of us. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 195 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Just you. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   From the NPA’s side it was 
Advocate Mosini(?) and Advocate Jiba. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So it is you and Angus. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And from the – who was from IPID and 
Advocate Jiba and who is the other advocate? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Advocate Mosini. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mosini? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now she asks you, that is Adv 
Jiba now, asks you, who do you have in mind?  Now when 
she asks that question, what is she referring to, have in 
mind to do what? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   To assist – I understand 
who have in mind to assist you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you mention one person. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And she ultimately, she says she 
thinks 
six 
people 
should 
– 
six 
advocates 
should 
…[intervenes] 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I do not remember when 
she said six, whether I am saying he sent six, he says if 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253

maybe because I remember as well he might have said you 
need more than that, not necessarily to say six but when 
people are having cases then it was five, outstanding one, 
which is Advocate Maema.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now as the investigation 
unfolded, you would have been party to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On a light note you must have been 
quite happy with so many. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Because I wanted to finalise 
the case, to go back home.  I did not want to stay in KZN 
10 
because I had a problem with the language area there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You heated that pot, you had six 
advocates. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now the investigation team would have 
started obtaining statements from various witnesses, is 
that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you were overseeing that 
20 
investigation team from the DPCI’s side. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Those statements would then be 
presented to the various advocates for their assessment. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 197 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Would you collect the statements 
yourself?  In other words, go and take statements from 
witnesses and submit them or were you simply overseeing 
the 
statements 
and 
receiving 
them 
 from 
the 
other 
investigators? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I would not have taken the 
statements.  People go out and take statement because 
one, I had the problem, I have got language barrier.  So to 
give 
people 
opportunity 
because 
some 
of 
the 
team 
members they understand the Zulu so for me it was – it had 
10 
no purpose.  The same like Angus, he never went out and 
take statements because he does not – he is not familiar 
with Zulu.  So we are more of managers together with the 
prosecutors. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you would have considered all 
those statements that were submitted is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Not all the statements, 
remember, because it was IPID this side, it is this side but 
it is one team. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I see. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    So between the team they came to the 
conclusion that a criminal case should be instituted against 
various members of the Cato Manor “hit squad” but 
including General Booysen, is that correct? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 198 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   At that stage General 
Booysen was not featured, I do not at what – maybe I do 
not understand you, rather rephrase it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay, at what stage did you say 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could you face this side so I can hear 
you. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Oh, sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   At what stage did you decide and by 
10 
you I mean, you as the team, to institute criminal 
prosecution against General Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Well, I cannot remember at 
what stage but remember also it is not my duty to institute 
criminal 
investigation, 
mine 
is 
to 
ensure 
when 
the 
prosecutors have got a certain query a statement must be 
taken, I must ensure that statement is taken but for me it is 
a little bit too heavy to say at what stage I decide because 
that is not a function.  I think in my statement you have 
seen what in terms of Section 205(3) what are the 
20 
functions of the police but if you are going to suggest to 
say at what stage do, I charge General Booysen, I think 
that is very much unfair.  Do not push me to something that 
I am not privy to. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, were you not part …[intervenes] 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 199 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it might not have intended the 
meaning that you are attaching to it but of course he can 
speak for himself.  He might have used the word charge 
loosely. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  At some stage a 
decision was obviously taken to charge General Booysen. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now the question that I am really 
10 
asking you, is there would have presumably been a 
discussion about that whether we had enough, you would 
have interacted, do we need more information?   
The prosecutors would presumably have requested 
additional information if they were unhappy with the 
information that was already in existence.  They might 
have sent you back to go and get further statements if they 
felt that were certain things that the witnesses had given 
were unclear, is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Okay. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you would have been part of that 
process of deciding – part of the process of either 
receiving instructions to obtain further information or part 
of the process of obtaining the further information. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 200 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And at some stage a decision was 
taken that sufficient information was available in order to 
institute a case against General Booysen. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Now you yourself would not, as a 
police officer or as a member of the DPCI at the time, you 
would not have taken that decision yourself but together 
with the team and specifically the team of prosecutors that 
were available, would you not have sat and conferred with 
them about that decision? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Look, I do not take 
decision, I do not input on NPA’s decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us deal with it this way.  You 
gave evidence earlier on with regard to the investigation. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Relating to the threat or alleged threat 
against General Phahlane. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said you conducted the 
investigation but you make no recommendations as to who 
20 
should be charged and what charge should be preferred 
against them. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember you said that? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 201 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
Cato 
Manor 
investigation did you make any recommendations as to who 
should be charged and with what they must be charged? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You did not …[intervenes] 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   In [indistinct] yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of any discussion where maybe other 
people express such views? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were?  You say you were? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No, I was not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you were part? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Because the good thing 
also, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   You have six advocates. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   When you come in because 
there is too many brains. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, they might value your opinion 
because you have been in the police for a long time.  They 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 202 of 233 
 
might say Major General Mabula, what do you think, is 
there enough evidence and you might say I do not think so 
or you might say yes, I think so, but you are the lawyers, 
you must make up your mind. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   But the Chairperson was 
correct to say I had a luxury, it was for the first time to 
have that kind of luxury to scratch my head. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Because they were there, 
why should I? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you never expressed any view. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or recommendation? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now all the evidence that had been 
gathered, you had obviously received some of the evidence 
or presumably all the evidence, you were the head of the 
20 
investigation team, there was the prosecution that had 
been sent there to assist you.  You must have looked at 
the evidence and assessed it for yourself. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Not all of them because 
remember I said it was a joint team.   Mr Angus was on a 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 203 of 233 
 
equal – I put him – even if we had that cooperation, it did 
not give me a licence really to get deeper into what he is 
because our team also had – we only had – maybe, for 
example, when the prosecutors would address to say we 
need this statement, must be taken, we need these things, 
we have one another in terms of resources because the 
issue was to finalise this matter.  That would suggest that I 
had not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hulley… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are four minutes away from the time 
that you had asked for, it was 30 minutes, so… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now this 
particular investigation, if I understand correctly, you were 
part 
of 
a 
team 
that 
was 
conducting 
specifically 
an 
investigation into the Cato Manor hit squads but I do not 
want to focus on that for time being, I want to focus on 
General Booysen. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Based on what you are saying now, it 
20 
seems to me that between the two of you, that is between 
you and Mr Angus. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   You had – you were not necessarily 
sitting 
together 
and 
taking 
decisions 
jointly. 
 
Do 
I 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 204 of 233 
 
understand that correctly? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I hear what you say.  I am 
not sure whether I understand correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, do you want to say what decisions 
you are talking about? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, decisions in relation to the 
investigation and whether sufficient information has been 
obtained insofar as the investigation is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So whether the investigation had been 
completed? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are asking whether they 
…[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Whether they were taking this jointly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are asking the two of them.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is right.  Were you meeting with 
each other to discuss? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is asking whether you and the leader 
of the IPID’s teams discussed jointly, whether at a certain 
stage the investigation was complete. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:  Obviously because we were 
supporting them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, there was that kind of 
an interaction. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 205 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Like I have said, resources 
wise, what we needed - for example, I have to get people 
from – because reconstruction of the crime scene, I had 
people from forensics to assist.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   So we helping one another. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But in terms of what had to be 
presented obviously between the two of you, you had to 
make sure that everything was covered. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the two of you would have sat 
together to take joint decisions presumably otherwise the 
risk, there is a real risk that one person will not cover a 
particular issue. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
MABULA: 
 
 
That 
was 
the 
understanding, we were working together.  That is why they 
requested our support. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And ultimately would you have taken 
decisions 
jointly 
as 
to 
whether 
the 
investigation 
is 
20 
complete? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he said so.  I understood Major 
General 
Mabula 
to 
say 
with 
regard 
to 
whether 
the 
investigation was finalised, that is something that they 
discussed. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 206 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am going one further step and my 
question is, did they take a joint decision …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is had been finalised? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, how is that different from I said 
that he agrees that he has said that they talked to each 
10 
other to reach agreement that the investigation is now 
complete. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What I am trying to understand is 
whether there is – not whether they spoke about – not 
whether they spoke about it but whether as a fact they 
agreed, that’s my question.  I don’t him to necessarily be 
saying that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you want to see whether they were 
unanimous ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the investigation at a certain point was 
complete. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Major General Mabula? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes we did. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 207 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were agreed? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And after that decision or agreement 
had been reached was there any – anything from the 
Prosecutor ’s side, to suggest – did they suggest to you 
that there was additional evidence that were literally 
gathered? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Look Chairperson those 
advocates on a daily basis they were with us. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   So whatever this would 
have made they were just on the same of whom, but our 
issues was whenever they raised any queries to go on 
statement, we ensured that happens.  If IPID they don’t 
have the transport to go to a point A we would give 
because it was a joint investigation.   It was not a matter of 
we are we or what, because even when these people come 
back 
in 
the 
afternoon 
to 
the 
briefing 
session 
the 
prosecutors are there to say what you are required to do or 
20 
done is one, two, three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  The next two questions will be 
the last ones? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is correct Chair.   Now of course 
you are aware of the fact that the decision to prosecute 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 208 of 233 
 
General Booysen was ultimately reviewed and set aside by 
the High Court. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And according to the findings of that 
Court there was in fact no evidence or – to support the 
charges against him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am listening. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So what I am trying to understand is 
you obviously having become aware of the fact that there 
was a High Court order or a High Court judgment which 
10 
said that there was no evidence, you must have gone back 
to investigate the question of how the Court had come to 
such a conclusion given the fact that you had been 
involved and had taken a decision that there was enough 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he said he never made any decision 
or expressed a view about whether there was enough 
evidence for any charge. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said they conducted an investigation 
20 
and reached a point where they said this investigation is 
now complete and the prosecutors were to take a decision 
whether or not the evidence was sufficient for any charge. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well my understanding is that you were 
in agreement that the investigation was complete, correct? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 209 of 233 
 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now that being the case what I am 
trying to understand once the High Court judgment came 
out 
the 
High 
Court 
judgment 
shows 
that 
there 
was 
insufficient evidence to prosecute. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now from your side once you became 
aware of that judgment did you go back and see what the 
shortcomings in the investigation that you had conducted. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Unless Chair if I had got 
10 
specific interest, I said it in terms of Section 2053 what are 
my functions and I am sure NPA they do have certain 
functions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   So I don’t want to be 
dragged in some other department.  So that is my answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think he has made it clear that he 
did not express any view about whether the evidence was 
sufficient or anybody should be charted or not, he left that 
to the lead prosecutors to decide. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You have done your two questions. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair, I am in your 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 210 of 233 
 
hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   Is there any important feature of 
Major Booysen’s evidence that has not been covered?   Is 
there any particular point? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   His arrest and the circumstances of the 
arrest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I am saying the arrest and the 
circumstances of his arrest, I understood that the – when 
he was arrested there was a specific decision taken that he 
10 
should be taken – that Major General Booysen should be 
paraded past the media. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you – are you suggesting that Major 
General Mabula made that decision? 
ADV HULLEY SC:    Well that’s – that was the information 
by General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Major General Mabula did you get 
involved in a decision about is arrest? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   He has I think General – 
Brigadier Mubi is the one, there were a number of teams 
that arrested him, I was not part of the arrest, when he was 
arrested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, yes. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 211 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  But whether you were part of the team 
did you get instructions about how the arrest should be 
conducted?  That is the question. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I don’t have the reason to 
give 
instructions 
because 
I 
was 
dealing 
with 
very 
experienced investigators who knows what is expected of 
them during the arrest.  So I did not need really to have 
done that, I wouldn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is there any e-examination you 
wish to do Mr Joubert?  Somebody must sanitise the 
podium. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Just three questions please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV JOUBERT SC:    Just three questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   General to come back to the report in 
your warning statement I want to refer you to page 19 of 
Exhibit LE23. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   19? 
ADV JOUBERT SC:  So 19 and 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle? 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   LEA 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and what page? 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 212 of 233 
 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   19, from page 19 to 21 but more 
specifically on page 20 paragraph 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Now General this is an affidavit by 
Brigadier Moyane, LEA 23.  You are in the wrong bundle, 
LEA 23, just check. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   LEA23? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle LEA 23, 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   It is not this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is that one. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Page 19, one nine.   
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   I don’t have 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 19 on the black numbers. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Let me see, maybe I’ve got, 
maybe I didn’t – okay 19,  yes. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   That is a statement by Brigadier 
Moyane. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Now if you turn over the page to page 
20 in paragraph 8, he makes the following statement.  He 
says the investigators came to the conclusion that the 
access to the former Acting National Commissioner ’s 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 213 of 233 
 
dwelling was spearheaded by Mr Paul O’Sullivan as it was 
also indicated that they initially acted as police officials, 
and then he says the following, and I think that goes back 
to your statement, they say I made a recommendation to 
the Acting Divisional Commissioner that the matter needs 
to be investigated further as it was a security breach. 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   So Mr Chair it appears that if this 
witness is called, he will confirm that because if one looks 
at that – that quotation it is a recommendation by Brigadier 
10 
Moyane for further investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, okay, ja. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Then further General will you confirm 
that from the outset of your investigations on the 30 t h of 
November 2016 this – the investigation and what flowed 
there from was at all relevant times directed and controlled 
by the office of the DPP Pretoria? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct so Chairperson. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:  And what in the investigation flowed 
there 
from 
and 
whatever 
charges 
was 
subsequently 
20 
instituted against the suspects was the decision of the DPP 
Pretoria? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct Chairperson. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   And then did you confirm that you 
and your team as police officers simply investigated a 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 214 of 233 
 
docket and placed the relevant information before the 
office of the DPP? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Correct Chairperson. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   There was no reason to push any 
agenda of whatever sort? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Thank you Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   Thank you very much Major 
General Mabula, you are now excused – oh your counsel 
might ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Just on the – did you at any stage 
influence any person and more specific Mr Sibisiso William 
Zongu to change any evidence to implicate General 
Booysen in any matter? 
MAJOR GENERAL MABULA:   Not at all Chairperson. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   That was just the one aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you.   You are excused 
Major General Mabula.   Mr Hulley?   Your mic. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  The next witness 
will be called to be cross-examined, he is Mr Robert 
20 
McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thank you.  Thank you very much.  
Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
MR McBRIDE:   Robert John McBride. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 215 of 233 
 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR McBRIDE:   No Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR McBRIDE:   Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth.   If so please raise your right hand and say so 
help me God. 
10 
MR McBRIDE:   So help me God. 
ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE   [d.s.s.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr McBride.   Thank you.   Mr 
Joubert?  Mr Joubert the cross-examination will be on 
behalf of both Brigadier Ncube and Major General Mabula?  
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   You may go ahead. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Mr McBride I want to be as brief as 
possible.   You confirm that you were suspended for 
various reasons, as IPID head as from 24/25 March 2015 to 
20 
6 September 2016, a period of 18 months, is that correct? 
MR McBRIDE:   Just a correction, until 19 t h of October on 
effect yes. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   19 October. 
MR McBRIDE:   And it wasn’t various reasons, it was

related to an allegation that we had changed a report, the 
recommendation. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Very well, you formed certain views 
about the North West  team that investigated the security 
breach, which they investigated of General Phahlane?  
MR McBRIDE:   Indeed yes. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   So your view is based that they 
pushed some or other agenda to either eliminate IPID in 
their investigation? 
MR McBRIDE:   Well I have heard the Brigadier and 
10 
General’s evidence, and there is one aspect that is not 
covered, which is the aspect relating to the fact that there 
was investigations by IPID against many of the members of 
the team on some serious offences before and it seemed 
out of the ordinary Chair that indeed out of all the 
detectives and investigators that the team that had been 
investigated by IPID the majority of them are the ones that 
are coming to investigate the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The alleged security breach? 
MR McBRIDE:   Yes, so ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, the alleged threat? 
MR McBRIDE:   The alleged security breach and later on 
were 
issuing 
warning 
statements 
to 
one 
of 
the 
investigators who indeed investigated them, so it is on the 
basis of the choice of the team which was of concern for 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 217 of 233 
 
me, the circumstances surrounding – in my view they 
should have in particular General Mabula should have 
recused himself from the process at a certain stage at 
least.   I also think that General ...[indistinct] knowingly 
had a say in who is the team, but I cannot prove that. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Ja, well since their investigation 
commenced in November 2016 the investigation by IPID 
against their unit was revived, because a lot of old cases 
from about 2012/2013 which was really let’s say either – 
did not result in any firm decisions, thus all of the seven 
10 
revised by IPID in 2017, is that correct? 
MR McBRIDE:   No that is not correct sir, let me correct 
you on that.   So there was a case for example a case on – 
that was investigated against several of the members of 
the – well regarded as the North West team and it was over 
a number of areas within the North West.  I think 
Rustenburg was one area and Klerksdorp was another.  A 
number of members appeared in court and there was a 
decision 
to 
prosecute 
Chair 
and 
the 
matter 
was 
provisionally moved for the purpose of centralising the 
20 
case and that is where it stood. 
 
Later a number of enquiries about it did not yield 
any results as to the reason for its non-resumption, so it 
wasn’t that it suddenly received more energy, there were 
investigations that were taking place, and there was some 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 218 of 233 
 
subsequent evidence that was brought to IPID and other 
people came forward, including policemen who made 
certain allegations against the North West team. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Is it fair to state objectively, only 
objectively, that in mid-2017 there was a far more serious 
effort, let’s put it no wider than that, by IPID and more 
specific Mr Rapesho, to re – to give more attention to 
matters of theirs and for decisions to prosecute them, 
because as an objective fact that can be established? 
MR McBRIDE:   I would agree with you except for I don’t 
10 
know what amount of effort went in when it was still ICD 
investigating by so I cannot compare the efforts that were 
put in, but certainly there was effort put in. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Ja, but in comparison let us say with 
the previous efforts all of a sudden in mid-17 there was a 
renewed effort.   Is that a coincidence, because that is 
after they investigated, which culminated in the arrests in 
February of your two IPID members, Mr Mahlanga and 
...[indistinct] and Sarah-Jane Trent and O’Sullivan, Mr 
O’Sullivan. 
20 
MR McBRIDE:   I think I have answered already that I 
cannot compare the effort that was put in, but certainly 
more witnesses Chair came forward, or complainants and 
other additional evidence was received.  Some of the 
evidence was received before I went on suspension and 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 219 of 233 
 
then 
suddenly 
disappeared 
and 
then 
re-emerged 
subsequent to my return. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Ja, would you then also agree that 
the toing and froing in the investigations between IPID and 
the police of each other culminated in the eventual 
application and decision before the Honourable Judge 
Tuchten in the High Court in June 2018, where he 
remarked that you now either side or both sides should not 
investigate matters where they have a personal interest.  
MR McBRIDE:   Indeed, that actually was brought by IPID, 
10 
so just to give a clearer picture, the issue was then that 
IPID provisions, there’s provision made for removal where 
there is a conflict, where investigators conflict and the 
Tuchten judgment said that there was an absence of such a 
provision in the SAPS Act, and that needed to be rectified. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Ja. 
MR McBRIDE:   So it was also a law-making judgment. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Ja, the Judge was very disappointed 
in the conflict between the SAPS and IPID and in 
paragraph 13 he inter alia remarked as follows, and it is a 
20 
short quote, he says: 
“The 
very 
serious 
allegations 
on 
both 
sides 
deserves to be fairly and thoroughly investigated 
and dealt with according to the law.  Until the law 
has spoken nobody is entitled to cry victory.” 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 220 of 233 
 
And that was his finding. 
MR McBRIDE:   Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   There is a lot of disappointment 
against you, Mr McBride, because they say subsequent to 
this judgment you try to elevate it in the press to a much 
higher standard, that there was in actual fact a victory for 
IPID rather than the police.   So – if I may just finish.  So 
my instructions are that you created specifically the 
impression in the press to paint the members of the SAPS 
in this unit in the worst possible light that you could.    
10 
MR McBRIDE:   If I can put it this way, the concerns of 
Judge Tuchten were also shared by me about from a 
national security point of view, and as I testified last year I 
requested the former Director General of State Security to 
call a meeting with all the relevant players and that 
included the NDPP, General Pashlane, General Ntlemeza 
but he didn’t turn up and General Moyane and we had a 
series 
of 
meetings 
to 
discuss 
how 
we 
manage 
the 
differences of the investigations that we have.   
 
So to the extent that I might have expressed prior 
20 
to a newspaper, I don’t recall it, possibly specifically but it 
is possible that I did indicate such in the heat of the 
moment and what I perceived that was going on. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Very well.  Mr McBride are you 
prepared to accept that their investigation, that is from the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 221 of 233 
 
30 t h of November was at all relevant times under the 
prosecutorial 
control 
of 
the 
DPP 
in 
Pretoria, 
more 
specifically Advocate Mashoega who was immediately in 
court after the arrests and before Nemaorane who guided 
them in their prosecutorial guided investigation? 
MR McBRIDE:   When I heard the evidence and I am 
unable to deny Chair I came to relevant people who gave 
direction, 
perhaps 
should 
be 
called, 
without 
being 
prescriptive, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV JOUBERT SC:  Ja, if that is so will you then accept 
10 
for purposes of this inquiry that they were at all relevant 
times monitored and that they did not push their own 
agenda?  
MR McBRIDE:   Well I would not go that far here, I am not 
convinced Chair but I am not in a position to deny their 
positions that they testified to.   
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Who was the complainant in the 
investigation IPID commenced against General Pashlane? 
MR McBRIDE:   It was two-fold, it was POPCRU and it was 
Paul O’Sullivan. 
20 
ADV JOUBERT SC:    Paul O’Sullivan and Paul O’Sullivan, 
if I look at his affidavit, and I may be mistaken, he decided 
as I understand his explanation to this Commission, he 
decided that he want to pay more attention t General 
Pashlane and he commenced to do his own what we call a 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 222 of 233 
 
lifestyle audit. 
MR McBRIDE:   He has been involved in investigations 
previously and he should testify about his motives and 
what he did, but indeed and I can even go further and say 
he assisted IPID with lots of investigations.    
ADV JOUBERT SC:   But in this instance he had a more 
personal interest, he is the complainant. 
MR McBRIDE:   I think it is his modus operandi when he 
deals with someone in high office to provoke them to make 
mistakes and I believe General Pashlane Chair made such 
10 
a mistake because the provocations and incessant emails 
should be normal in a constitutional democracy but it does 
irritate some people and they respond perhaps and there is 
an element of overreach, but that is his way, he seems to 
succeed every time. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:    Ja, there is an old saying which says 
that he who angers you controls you and I think he pushes 
that agenda very effectively because when you anger 
people you control them in his view. 
MR McBRIDE:   I don’t want to comment on ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   That was just a – Mr McBride your 
agreement must have been that as a result of the wide 
tyres IPID investigators have, or they should do their 
investigations and which are very important, primarily 
against police officers who don’t always toe the line, 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 223 of 233 
 
should 
do 
that 
independently, 
transparently 
and 
objectively. 
MR McBRIDE:   Indeed.    
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Ordinarily complainants don’t get 
involved in that investigations, because they should lay 
their complaint, they should make an affidavit under oath, 
a docket or an inquiry docket should be opened and from 
there on it is the duty of your investigators to do their work 
or their job in accordance with the transparent protocol. 
MR 
McBRIDE: 
 
 Indeed, 
complainants 
do 
assist 
in 
10 
investigations sometimes, and perhaps Mr O’Sullivan was 
more helpful than others. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Now in reading all the allegations I 
find it very hard to understand why was it necessary for Mr 
O’Sullivan and Ms Sarah-Jane Trent to accompany the two 
investigators when they decided to visit the house of 
General Pashlane in Stable Hills?   From an objective point 
of view there just appear to be no reasonable and 
acceptable 
explanation 
for 
them 
to 
work 
so 
closely 
together to IPID investigators, because they didn’t need a 
20 
pointing person, they didn’t need to point out a house, all 
that information could have objective obtained by the two 
IPID] investigators. 
MR McBRIDE:   Well if I can just explain I am aware of two 
affidavits with annexures made to this Commission by the 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 224 of 233 
 
two investigators, that explains the circumstances in which 
they arrived there and I think it is only fair that they testify 
on that and the exact circumstances and it wouldn’t be 
correct and as you mentioned the word objective for me to 
comment on more reasons. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Okay, that’s ...[intervenes]  
MR McBRIDE:   I was three times removed from the 
investigation on the ground. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Again, looking at it from an outsider ’s 
point of view there just appears to be no reasonable 
10 
explanation for both Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent to have 
been involved 
so closely and consistently and even 
drafting statements of witnesses.  Ordinarily complainants 
don’t do that Mr McBride. 
MR McBRIDE:   If I can put it this way, perhaps that 
question should be directed to them.  If I testify here today 
a reasonable explanation should be based on what I had 
been told Chair.  I am not – I am not a person who knows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what Mr Joubert maybe doing is to 
seek your comment on a proposition that says when one 
20 
looks at the role that they played in this investigation it 
seems to have been too active – they seem to have been too 
active or more active than they should have been.  They 
should not have allowed to be.  Maybe the investigators 
should have said, well we know that you – you are available 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 225 of 233 
 
to assist us but we are in control of this process.  We will tell 
you if we need anything if you are going to be with us as we 
go to that place just listen to us.  So – so that you do not 
appear like you in charge of this process.  I think that is the 
proposition in which he would like you to hear what you have 
to say about that. 
MR MCBRIDE:  Well there have been instances where I have 
had to intervene and it was an uncomfortable situation 
because they had provided assistance.  But in fairness to the 
investigators and to O’Sullivan and Trent there is an 
10 
explanation which they give in their affidavits as to how they 
came to be together in one car at that specific time.  So I 
think once I acknowledge that there was perhaps too much 
assistance if I can put it that way, they have explained the 
circumstances in which this – in which this happened.  So to 
– I mean from the outside view there has been and some 
people have commented the over involvement and too much 
assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV JOUBERT:  Well… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe just to complete that point 
speaking generally would you accept that their involvement 
seemed to seemed – seems to have been more than normal 
but whether in the particular case it was justified is 
something you leave to the investigators to deal with?  
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 226 of 233 
 
Would it be fair to say that is how look at it generally and in 
– and on the particular circumstances? 
MR MCBRIDE:  Chair I would agree with you except to add 
that in this particular case the police themselves the 
complainants against Mr Phahlane had gone to O’Sullivan 
first.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MCBRIDE:  And had made statements O’Sullivan already 
have statements from police officers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MCBRIDE:  And as early as 2013 long before I arrived at 
IPID he had received statements I think it is – off the top of 
my head I think it is Munsamy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MCBRIDE:  Colonel Munsamy I think he is in East 
London now.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MCBRIDE:  And there was even an article in the 
newspapers in the Sowetan during that period.  So the issue 
was and then O’Sullivan became the complainant and he was 
20 
a complainant with most of the information.  And the 
complaint was laid in my absence and upon my return he 
decided to ask where is the complaint?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MCBRIDE:  And the person who investigated was initially 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 227 of 233 
 
was Mandla Mahlangu and other people I cannot remember 
who it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MCBRIDE:  And so the case was given to Mandla to 
handle.  At that stage one must remember that Mr Sesoko 
was not there.  He was still suspended.  Mr Khuba was not 
there.  And I relied on them a lot for some of this specialist 
investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MCBRIDE:  So yes O’Sullivan and his team assisted a 
10 
lot.  The key reason is not – is more than just specific 
aspects related to this case.  It is an issue of funding.  If you 
want IPID to be independent make independent – make sure 
it has enough funding.  So it is not forced to rely on anybody 
else.  The alternative to other help is actually asking help 
from the police which denudes the idea of independence.  So 
one has to look at those situational problems. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Well the more concerning on just to follow 
20 
on that and complete that point Mr McBride is that their 
involvement from the statements of witnesses be it now 
factually correct or incorrect to interrogate witnesses.  To 
draft statements for them.  On just those two levels it is 
totally unacceptable because a complainant should not get 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 228 of 233 
 
involved on that level especially when they investigate a 
very high-profile member of the police like IPID did.  Do you 
not agree?  It actually boils down to – to a pre-trial or 
investigative irregularity because it is uncalled for and it 
should not be tolerated or done.   
MR MCBRIDE:   Well there is a few things you have put your 
– in one shot so I will try and deal with them one at a time. 
ADV JOUBERT:  But that is a summary ja. 
MR MCBRIDE:  So Chair if it is the – the issue is indeed 
there was a user perception of over reach and over 
10 
involvement.  But the reason they do provide explanations 
and again I say in fairness and in reaching the truth of the 
matter is important to hear them out.  But it is an aspect on 
those allegations it is early in 2017 when these matters 
arose it is when Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko returned from – 
from being out of IPID and Mr Khuba was specifically tasked 
to deal with this issue and in addition to that Chair we 
requested assistance of DPCI so that any element of bias 
from our side is removed from the equation and General – 
and Colonel Roelofse was brought in to assist IPID in this 
20 
investigation and he is still helping with this investigation.  
Indeed, it is the investigation which has actually brought 
General Phahlane to court on charges of corruption and 
O’Sullivan had and his team had nothing to do with that 
investigation whatsoever.  So as we are aware that General 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 229 of 233 
 
Phahlane and I think four other generals are actually on trial 
at the moment. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Yes.  Look Mr McBride there is always in 
the important work the police have to do a right way to do 
things and the wrong way and in between there should not 
be any – any leeway.  Because police and IPID specifically 
are indeed mandated to fulfil very important functions in this 
country.   
MR MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT:  And they gather evidence that evidence 
10 
must go eventually and stand the test of – of constitutional 
admissibility and admissibility in courts.  So that is the 
reason why the institutions are required to do the work 
correctly in the right way and not the wrong way.   
MR MCBRIDE:  Indeed, also the perception of bias must be 
removed. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Correct.  Because and then just the last 
final aspect of – of the inappropriate it appears the 
relationship between IPID and these two complainants when 
one objectively analyse it appears the information that was 
20 
shared between the IPID members and the two investigators 
that the commission can find in Exhibit LE19 from page 255 
to 416 that if you do an analysis again I would submit in all 
fairness you would agree that for these two complainants… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think Mr McBride wants to 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 230 of 233 
 
have a look at the particular page.  If you are going to ask 
him [00:09:13] 
ADV JOUBERT:  There is many – many pages Mr Chair and I 
– let me do – put it as a summary because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT:  If one Mr McBride if one does an analysis 
or an analysis of the information and the type of sensitive 
information that was shared against – or between members 
of IPID and Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent on whatsapp and in 
sms’s then that is indeed also inappropriate.  Do you agree 
10 
and the reason for serious concern? 
MR MCBRIDE:  Well as I explained earlier, they will explain 
but the issue – a lot of the information required is public 
information and it is information that ordinarily we would 
have 
the 
facilities 
ourselves. 
 
Because 
of 
budgetary 
problems we do not have the facility and indeed it is the 
budgetary problems that force us to seek assistance outside.  
So to answer your question in ideal circumstances or more 
improved circumstances that situation would not arise. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Yes.  Most probably it would not have 
20 
ended even there – if Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent did not 
accompany the IPID members to Sable Hills to commence 
their investigation. 
MR MCBRIDE:  Well the issues they were assisting with the 
investigation from what I hear were – I think it is important 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 231 of 233 
 
that you speak to the investigators themselves.  O’Sullivan 
and Trent themselves. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Ja.  So in all fairness will you then concede 
that to paint the members of the police in the worst possible 
light is not fair upon them in this commission because you 
can only cast assertions and make assumptions that or 
appears not to be corroboration.  Well that has to – the 
function of the commission eventually to establish 
MR MCBRIDE:  Well look I am in a position of authority to 
discuss the state of the police services. 
10 
ADV JOUBERT:  Well I do not think that – that it – that is 
the – all the criticisms that maybe or can be validly levelled 
at them is not for purposes of what we are currently here for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure I followed the question.  
Do you want to repeat the question so I can evaluate it but I 
know you are talking about criticism? 
ADV JOUBERT:  Ja. My Lord ag – Mr Chair I do not think it 
is necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV JOUBERT:  I think I have made a point what happened 
20 
in this instance that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT:  That the members investigated the matter.  
The DPPA got involved and they found many irregularities 
and they eventually decide to prosecute people on that.  And 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 232 of 233 
 
it was not on the insistence of the members of the North 
West police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Will you accept that Mr McBride? 
MR MCBRIDE:  I responded to your question Chair.  I mean I 
responded to the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you – thank you 
very much Mr McBride.   
10 
MR MCBRIDE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you for coming to make yourself 
available.  Thank you to everybody for staying until late so 
that we could complete what we can.  I take it that Mr 
Joubert you had no question – you did not seek to pursue 
any cross-examination of Major General Booysen? 
ADV JOUBERT:  Yes Mr Chair I can put in record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV JOUBERT:  We do not have any questions for Major 
Booysen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you very much Mr 
McBride you are excused.  Thank you.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair that then brings us 
to the end of today’s’ proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the end of a long day. 
20 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 253 
 
Page 233 of 233 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   End of a long day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are going to adjourn for the sake 
of those who may be watching or listening and the public we 
will not have a sitting tomorrow and on Monday but I think on 
Tuesday we will have a sitting.  Thank you very much to 
everybody for staying on until this time.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURN S TO 25 AUGUST 2020
