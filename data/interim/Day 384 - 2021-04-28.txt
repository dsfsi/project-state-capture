PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 28 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning Mr President. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning everybody.  Thank you.  
Mr Pretorius are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The President will testify today and 
tomorrow.  I will introduce the bundles in a moment if the 
10 
President could be sworn in please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If the President could be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, no that is fine.  Before that is 
done I just want to say a few things. Mr President we are 
happy that you are here representing the ruling party.  We 
are happy that the President of the party is the one who 
comes to give evidence to the commission but I also want 
to say that your appearance before this commission is not 
a result of a decision taken recently it is a decision that 
20 
was taken in 2018 as you will remember because soon 
after the commission had started its hearings I realised 
that the commission could not properly complete its task 
without the ruling party appearing before the commission 
because the ruling party is the party that was given power 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 4 of 148 
 
by the voters to form the government for – so it was 
important that the ruling party should appear before the 
commission and say what it knew about all sorts of 
allegations that have been heard in this commission when 
it knew it and what it did about those things and also to 
indicate what it is prepared to do to make sure that those 
things never happen again.  
 
I also realise that it would be important that the 
current President should appear because during at least 
part of the time when these allegations – these things were 
10 
alleged to have happened it was a time when he was 
Deputy President of the ANC and Deputy President of the 
country so that he could indicate also what he may have 
known and what he did not know and what was done to 
deal with purely allegations of state capture and the high 
levels of corruption that we have seen. 
 
So towards the end of 2018 I had a meeting with the 
President where I conveyed to him my view that it would be 
important 
that 
the 
ruling 
party 
appears 
before 
the 
commission and that he or the executive should also 
20 
appear to deal with these matters and the President agreed 
that he would appear before the commission and he 
indicated also that the ANC would appear. 
 
So I thought I must just remind everybody how it 
comes about that he appears today.  It is not a recent 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 5 of 148 
 
decision.  But I want to also take this opportunity to 
indicate Mr President that the commission appreciates the 
support for the work of the commission that both you as 
President of the country and the ruling party has shown.  
So that is appreciated.  Thank you.  Mr President you will 
need to take the oath or affirmation depending on what you 
will be taking.  Which one would it be Mr President? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  I will take the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will take the oath.  Okay may you 
please stand.  I do not know whether you would like to take 
10 
off your mask. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Is it safe to do so? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well if – if we can hear you with it 
on clearly you can keep it on but what has happened in the 
past is that usually we cannot hear people clearly.  But … 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  It is okay 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we can hear you and you would like to 
keep it on that would be fine.  Please give your full names 
for the record Mr President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  My name is Matamela Cyril 
20 
Ramaphosa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
No 
I 
do 
not 
have 
any 
objections. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 6 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you swear that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated.  Yes Mr 
Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr President a 
few housekeeping matters.  Before you is a bundle – 
Bundle 1 and in that bundle is Exhibit BBB1 Statement of 
the President together with annexures.  Then there is a 
second bundle Exhibit – containing Exhibit BBB2 which is a 
collation of certain documents that are relevant to the 
evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius I just want to – I do see that 
there is social distancing between many people but I think 
some can do with some more space so we just need to 
20 
make sure.  There is a lot of space available in the room.  
Okay.  Ja I see some are sitting next to each other so – 
well just – we all know what the social distancing is I am 
just reminding everybody if – if there is social distancing 
between people that is fine.  Okay you may proceed Mr 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 7 of 148 
 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  So there are two 
bundles as I have said Bundle 1 and Bundle 2.  Bundle 1 
contains the statement of the President, Bundle 2 contains 
certain additional documentation. 
 
Bundle 2 has only been recently compiled and I will 
explain why in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do I need it immediately – Bundle 2? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No you do not need it immediately 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  May I then ask Mr President if you 
would take the first bundle, do you have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please switch on the mic Mr President 
there.. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Okay permanently? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Pretorius I think it would 
convenient – it would be important before you start to for 
the benefit of the public to explain what will be covered 
and what will not be covered with the President this time. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Oh I had planned to do that next 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine – that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If that is okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 8 of 148 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And I will do that in full. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  At page 79 and we will refer to the 
black numbers in the top left hand corner is a page with 
your – with a signature above your name could you please 
confirm that that is your signature?  Page 79 black 
numbers in the top left hand corner. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes indeed it is my signature. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And if you would go please to the 
same bundle at page 5 and particularly at page 6. 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the beginning of your 
affidavit? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And are you satisfied that the 
contents of that affidavit insofar as you are aware are true 
and correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes they are. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Chair may the affidavit 
and annexures and I see each page has been initialled be 
20 
admitted then as Exhibit BBB1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that BBB? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  BBB we have been through the 
alphabet 3 times in this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of President Matamela Cyril 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 9 of 148 
 
Ramaphosa which starts at page 6 will be admitted as an 
exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BBB1. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And then Mr President I 
believe that you wish to make an opening statement but 
just before we do that if I may place certain matters on 
record Chair. 
 
There is a statement that we have just placed on 
record as an affidavit.  It is attested to in your capacity as 
President of the ANC and former Deputy President of the 
ANC am I correct? 
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes you are correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And there is a further statement 
that will be placed before the commission dealing with 
matters in our capacity as President of the Republic and 
former Deputy President of the Republic but that is yet to 
be obtained.  Is that correct? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes that is so. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We received your statement on the 
22 n d of April 2021 and we proceeded to undertake the 
necessary research that process is not yet complete and 
20 
accordingly we may have to deal with certain issues on 
your return towards the end of May. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Indeed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In these first two days of your 
evidence Mr President we will deal with our terms as ANC 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 10 of 148 
 
Deputy President and President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes indeed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And those facts or facts relevant to 
that are contained in your affidavit just admitted.  I will 
deal with certain matters and then Advocate Freund will 
deal with certain matters tomorrow. 
 
In these second two days towards the end of the 
month we will deal with matters related to your office as 
Head of State and there will be questions from the legal 
team Advocate Seleka, Soni and Myburgh in relation to that 
10 
as well as questions from myself. And that is just the 
background I think that the DCJ wanted placed on record. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you.  I will be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Well Mr Pretorius you have 
said that you will deal with other matters with the President 
towards the end of the month now the public does not know 
towards the end of the month.  They know mid-May. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I was leaving that to you Chair 
it is an announcement from the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me say this about that because 
20 
Mr Pretorius forgot that it is – it was not public yet it – 
there was something that I discussed with him.   
 
Mr President currently you are due to return to the 
commission wearing your cap as President of the country 
in mid-May I cannot remember the exact dates but mid-May 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 11 of 148 
 
but I indicated to Mr Pretorius that we will have to advise 
your office that those dates will need to be moved towards 
later in May because there are still a number of witnesses 
that the commission would like to hear and – so that was 
something that was still to be done but I do not know Mr 
Pretorius may have spoken to your team about it but that 
was – that is something that is in the pipeline.  So you 
might also have been wondering why he was talking about 
towards the end of May but – so those dates will change 
and we will move you towards the end of May.  Yes  Thank 
10 
you.  You are done Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For the moment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the moment obviously.  Okay Mr 
President if you wish to make an opening statement this is 
the opportunity for you to do so. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you Chairperson and 
thank you Mr Pretorius.   
 
I appear before this commission as you have stated 
Chairperson at the request of the commission but I also 
appear to assist the commission in its work and I would 
20 
like make this opening statement on behalf of the African 
National Congress. 
 
When I was confirming that I would be appearing I 
happened to be talking to one of my colleagues who is also 
Head of State; we had to attend to some matter and I said I 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 12 of 148 
 
would be appearing before the commission and his reaction 
was Ah how can you do that as Head of State?  I said this 
is how our democracy works.  It works in such a way that 
when there are important matters that affect the state and 
the government and indeed the governing party we will not 
shy away from appearing before commissions so that we 
may shed light on the matters that the commission is 
dealing with and also be able to assist the commission in 
its mandate. 
 
So I appear here in my capacity as President of the 
10 
African National Congress having been elected to this 
position 
in 
December 
of 
2017 
at 
the 
ANC’s 
54 t h 
Conference. 
 
Yesterday our country celebrated 27 t h anniversary 
of the advent of democracy. On that day we ushered in a 
new era and as a nation we made a decisive break to the 
horrible past of colonialism and apartheid. 
 
The ANC working together with many anti-apartheid 
formations led and facilitated a process of crafting a new 
constitutional dispensation that is today the bedrock of our 
20 
democracy. 
 
This month marks 25 years since the first hearing of 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission into apartheid era 
human rights abuse. 
 
It was a remarkable moment in our history to hold 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 13 of 148 
 
that commission the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
demonstrating our determination as a nation to unearth and 
confront the crimes of our past so that we may make a 
decisive break with those violations of human rights and so 
that we may forge a better future for all our people. 
 
This commission on inquiry into allegations of state 
capture, corruption, fraud in the public sector carries a 
similar responsibility.  This commission is the instrument 
through which we seek as a nation to understand the 
nature and extent of state capture to confront it.  To hold 
10 
those responsible to account and to take the necessary 
measures and steps to ensure that such events do not 
occur ever again in our country. 
 
State capture and corruption have taken a great toll 
on our society and indeed on our economy as well.  They 
have eroded the values of our constitution and undermined 
the rule of law.   
 
If followed or rather if allowed to continue they 
would threaten the achievement, the growth, development 
and transformation of our country.  It is for these reasons 
20 
that the ANC’s 54 t h National Conference in December 2017 
resolved to support the establishment of this commission. 
 
The ANC has consistently expressed its support for 
the objectives and the work of this commission.  The 
National Executive Committee of the ANC has expressed 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 14 of 148 
 
itself in that regard and we continue to do so. 
 
The ANC has taken this position knowing that the 
organisation would itself be placed under great scrutiny 
and that the process of examining these matters would 
very likely be difficult and painful for the ANC. 
 
Nevertheless 
the 
ANC 
maintains 
that 
this 
commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort 
to end all forms of state capture and corruption. 
 
The 
ANC’s 
position 
has 
been 
that 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility of ANC members and indeed all South 
10 
Africans to assist the commission in its work. 
 
Therefore I appear before the commission not to 
make excuses or to defend the indefensible.  The ANC has 
agreed to not only support the work of the commission but 
to assist the commission in every way possible to fulfil its 
mandate. 
 
My submission other submissions made on the 
ANC’S behalf are a number of my comrades and colleagues 
are therefore intended to provide whatever information 
context and explanation the commission may require. 
20 
 
Corruption is not a new phenomenon in South 
Africa. 
 
The 
apartheid 
system 
was 
morally 
and 
systematically corrupt. Not only did its legal provisions 
appropriate to a small minority their assets and the 
resources that rightfully belonged to all South Africa’s 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 15 of 148 
 
people but there was also a prevailing culture of corruption 
within the apartheid state also within its state owned 
enterprises but it also went broader than that into private 
business establishments and the numerous Bantustan 
administrations that had been set up to organise our 
country. 
 
The advent of democracy in South Africa was an 
opportunity to make a decisive break with that past through 
the adoption of a new constitution we established a new 
era of transparency, accountability, ethical conduct and 
10 
respect for the rule of law. 
 
The experience of the past 27 years shows that 
endeavour to have been for the most part successful and 
its success can also be measured by the establishment of 
this commission which is in a very transparent and open 
manner opening up a can of worms of corruption and state 
capture. 
 
Our 
country 
has 
a 
National 
Parliament 
and 
Provincial Legislatures elected by universal suffrage and 
regular and free fair elections.  We are proud to have a 
20 
strong and independent judiciary. 
 
Our democracy is supported by robust institutions 
and we have a free and vibrant media. 
 
An important aspect of the ANC’s approach to 
corruption over the years is a recognition of the extent to 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 16 of 148 
 
which some ANC leaders and members were advertently 
and inadvertently complicit in corrupt actions and this 
recognition was well articulated in our conferences where 
we 
did 
say 
that 
we 
need 
to 
openly 
and 
publicly 
acknowledge that these are the problems that we have to 
deal with. 
 
And 
as 
a 
consequence 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
corruption contributed to practices, patronage, factionalism 
and the manipulation of organisational processes in the 
ANC is a matter of effort. 
10 
 
The recognition of these facts does not mean that 
the ANC is itself corrupt or uniquely affected by corruption.  
There are other institutions in society, various political and 
social formations as well as the private sector companies 
that have to confront corruption within their own ranks.  
Nor is South Africa alone in the world in having to deal 
with pandemic corruption.  
 
Many other countries have to deal with corruption in 
the political, economic and social spheres and it is clearly 
not sufficient for us to recognise the problems. 
20 
 
The task of any organisation like the African 
National Congress especially with its history of principled 
struggle, its values and its mission is to address the 
problem. 
 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
why 
there 
is 
broad 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 17 of 148 
 
consensus within South African society but a process of 
state capture took place over the course of several years.  
It took some time for the term state capture to gain 
currency and for the phenomenon it described to clearly 
recognised as such. 
 
Therefor even though some of the incidents that I 
refer to in my submission may be regarded as instances of 
state capture they were not necessarily recognised or 
described as such at the time. 
 
And even as the term gained currency there were 
10 
individuals in the ANC and in society more broadly who 
contested both the use of the term and the existence of the 
phenomenon. 
 
In my submission I outline how allegations of state 
capture arose within the structures of the ANC and how the 
organisation responded at different moments. 
 
Without going into detail in this opening statement 
it is worth mentioning that one of the earliest claims made 
within ANC structures of the possibility that members of 
the Gupta family may have had an improper role the 
20 
functioning of the Executive was a statement by Minister 
Fikile Mbalula at an ANC meeting in 2011. 
 
To my knowledge the matter was not taken further 
by the NEC or in any structure of the organisation after he 
had mentioned it. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 18 of 148 
 
 
At the time the statement did not prompt any 
specific concerns about the capture of the state.  With the 
passage of time more reports began to surface in the 
public 
domain 
about 
the 
alleged 
capture 
of 
public 
enterprises by a private interest and the undue influence of 
certain individuals notably members of the Gupta family in 
executive decisions and appointments. 
 
As the volume of evidence began to mount in the 
public domain the issue of state capture even if it was not 
described in those terms at the time began increasingly a 
10 
subject 
under 
discussion 
in 
the 
National 
Executive 
Committee of the ANC and ANC structures. 
 
It was also a matter taken up more directly by 
ANC’s alliance partners, South African Communist Party 
and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.  It was 
also ANC veterans and other outside structures of the 
organisation including service society formations including 
religious organisations.  Corruption is by its nature a 
covert activity.  Those who perpetrate corruption and 
related to crimes, generally, seek to keep their actions 
20 
hidden or masked and disguise their intentions without 
direct evidence, without any investigative capability and 
mandate and in the face of the vehement denials. 
 
It is difficult for any structure to confront such 
activities.  In addition, the ability of any organisation but 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 19 of 148 
 
especially a political formation to act on allegations of 
maleficiis relies not only on its formal rules and procedures 
but also on the balance of power within a structure.   
 
The alignment of use within such an organisation 
is further influenced by access to the offices of state where 
the ability to appoint and to dismiss and even to dispense 
patronage is concentrated amongst a few individuals.  For 
the ANC this was compounded by its own subjective 
challenges.   
 
The 
ANC 
took 
time 
at 
its 
54 t h 
National 
10 
Conference to reflect on these subjective challenges and 
recognised the erosion of its organisational integrity as 
processes had been manipulated to advance the material 
interest 
of 
certain 
members 
and 
associated 
by 
that 
companies and individuals. 
 
This 
manifested 
itself 
in 
weak 
and 
pliable 
branches of the ANC.  It also manifested itself with both 
buying and gate keeping, factionalism and open conflict.  
This 
provided 
fertile 
ground 
for 
state 
capture 
and 
corruption.  As I outlined in my submission, Chairperson, 
20 
the ANC has over the course of several years recognised 
the existence of corruption within the state, within its own 
ranks and within other parts of society. 
 
It 
has 
taken 
a 
number 
of 
resolutions 
on 
measures to prevent corruption including on issues relating 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 20 of 148 
 
to state capture.  These are evident in the statements of 
ANC National Executive Committee particularly from 2016 
onwards 
which 
included 
a 
call 
for 
an 
independent 
investigation 
by 
competent 
authorities 
into 
these 
allegations. 
 
The 
question 
that 
arises 
is 
whether 
these 
resolutions 
and 
pronouncement 
were 
followed 
by 
a 
meaningful action to fight corruption and state capture.  In 
answering this question, we must acknowledge that the 
issue of state capture was a matter of great political 
10 
contestation within the ANC.   
 
Differences over whether indeed state capture 
existed, its extent and form and what should be done about 
it, contributed to divisions within the National Executive 
Committee and other ANC structures.  These divisions 
were evident also in government, in Parliament and other 
sections of society and indeed the issue of state capture 
and corruption was prominent in the contestation that took 
place ahead of the ANC’s 54 t h National Conference in 
December 2017.   
20 
 
However, we would argue that over the course of 
time, through political debate and democratic contestation, 
the organisation took active measures to confront state 
capture.  This is evident, for example, in the events that 
unfolded in Parliament from late 2016 and into 2017, where 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 21 of 148 
 
the ANC and other parties initiated a number of inquiries 
into allegations of malfeasance and some state-owned 
enterprises and parts of government.   
 
It is clear from the affidavit submitted to the 
Commission by the former ANC Chief Whip, the late Mr 
Jackson Mthembu but the determination by the ANC in 
Parliament to probe these allegations was both a response 
to the evidence of wrongdoing that was accumulating in the 
public domain and the implementations of the decisions 
taken by the ANC’s constitutional structure especially with 
10 
NEC. 
 
The ANC’s 54 t h National Conference was in many 
ways a watershed moment in the ANC’s effort to confront 
state capture and corruption within its ranks.  Much of the 
discussion at the conference on the issues of state capture 
was framed by a diagnostic organisational report presented 
by the then Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe, on behalf 
of the National Executive Committee.   
 
This report directly addressed the allegations of 
corruption and the involvement of ANC members and 
20 
leaders in the broader context of state capture.  The 
conference consequently resolved to demand that every 
ANC member accused of or reported to be involved in 
corrupt 
practices 
should 
account 
to 
the 
Integrity 
Commission immediately or face disciplinary processes.   
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 22 of 148 
 
 
It also resolved to summarily suspend people 
who 
failed 
to 
give 
an 
acceptable 
explanation 
or 
to 
voluntarily 
step 
down 
while 
they 
face 
disciplinary 
investigative prosecutorial procedures.  Also, resolve to 
publicly exhaust this associate organisation from anyone 
whether business, donor, reporter or member accused of 
corruption or reported to be involved in corruption. 
 
It further resolved to ensure that ANC members 
and structures cooperate with law enforcement agencies, 
to criminally prosecute anyone of corruption and further it 
10 
said it requires the ANC deployees to Cabinet.  That is 
National Cabinet.  Especially the Minister of Finance, the 
Minister of Police of Justice, the Correctional Services to 
strengthen state capacity to successfully investigate and 
prosecute corruption and account for any failure to do so. 
 
Now these resolutions, in more ways than one, 
signalled a clear determination by the membership of the 
African 
National 
Congress 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
organisations failing, to make also a clean break with 
corrupt practises and to initiate an ethical, political, and 
20 
organisational renewal of the ANC. 
 
Now following the 54 t h National Conference and 
in line with its resolution, the ANC embarked upon a 
process of organisational rebuilding and renewal.  This 
included corrective measures both within the ANC and 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 23 of 148 
 
indeed the state by the latter I dealt with more extensively 
in my statement to the Commission in the capacity as the 
Head of State which was presented.   
 
It is important to note that these measures were 
informed and inspired by the mandate of the ANC’s 
National Conference which, as you might be aware, is 
attended by thousands of members of ANC branches 
across South Africa. 
 
In one of the areas in which the ANC has taken 
clear action is to require that members of the ANC who are 
10 
formally charged with corruption, other serious charges 
must immediately step aside from all leadership positions 
in the ANC, legislatures or government structures pending 
the finalisation of their matters. 
 
Such members who do not step aside may be 
summarily suspended.  Furthermore, members of the ANC 
who are reported to be involved in corrupt and other 
criminal 
practises 
must 
go 
to 
the 
ANC’s 
Integrity 
Commission and provide a credible explanation for these 
allegations or reports. 
20 
 
Should members fail to give an acceptable 
explanation, 
they 
may 
be 
suspended 
subjected 
to 
disciplinary processes.  In line with the ANC constitution, 
ANC members who are convicted of corruption or other 
serious crimes must resign from leadership positions and 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 24 of 148 
 
face disciplinary actions. 
 
It 
is 
worth 
mentioning 
that 
some 
of 
these 
requirements, 
especially 
on 
the 
so-called 
step 
aside 
provision, have in the past been the subject of much 
contestation within te organisation.  However, there is now 
broad 
support 
within 
the 
organisation 
or 
its 
implementation. 
 
At its most recent meeting on the 26 t h to the 
29 t h  of March, the NEC directed that all members who have 
been charged with corruption or other serious crimes must 
10 
step aside within 30-days, failure which they should 
suspended 
in 
terms 
of 
Rule 
25.70 
of 
the 
ANC’s 
constitution. 
 
The ANC has embarked on a process of renewal 
to 
build 
a 
movement 
characterised 
by 
integrity, 
accountability 
and 
the 
highest 
standards 
of 
ethical 
behaviour but the process renewal is by itself a process.  It 
is not a one-day event and it is a process that is ongoing. 
 
The rate or progress is determined not only by 
the existence of political will and organisational capacity 
20 
but also by the continued existence of invested interest 
and resistance from those who have much to lose from the 
corrective measures mandated by the ANC’s 54 t h National 
Conference. 
 
I will now turn to some specific issues that the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 25 of 148 
 
Commission has asked me to address.  The first of these 
are the ANC’s approach to pave the development and 
deployment.  This issue has been covered in some detail 
by the ANC National Chairperson, Mr Gwede Mantashe.   
 
His 
testimony 
before 
the 
Commission, 
Mr Mantashe described the evolution and the development 
of the ANC’s policies, the principles that informed this 
approach under structures and processes that the ANC has 
put in place to manage cadre development and deployment. 
 
Since even before the advent of democracy, the 
10 
ANC has said that in transforming the public service to 
reflect the values of our democracy and the demographics, 
or better still, the diversity of our country, we must 
emphasise professionalism and competency.   
 
This 
is 
reflect 
in 
our 
earliest 
policy 
pronouncement which were part of the ready to govern 
document which was release in 1991 as the ANC was 
preparing to enter government knowing that the level of 
support that it had would give it a mandate to do so but it 
was also confirmed at the 54 t h National Conference. 
20 
 
The ANC fully embraces the principle that all 
public servants should undertake their duties in a fair, 
balanced and non-partisan manner.  It should be noted that 
the deployment of cadres to strategic positions is not 
unique to the ANC.  It is practised in various forms and 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 26 of 148 
 
through 
various 
mechanisms 
even 
if 
not 
always 
acknowledged as such by other political parties in our 
country and also in other countries. 
 
In our view, cadre development has acquired 
such prominence in part because of the perspective that 
there should not be political interference in the selection of 
people 
who 
work 
in 
the 
public 
sector. 
 
However, 
international practise suggests a more nuanced approach 
to this matter.   
 
For example, an OECD working paper on public 
10 
governance published in 2007 written by a number of 
scholars including one called Martinsen, said that with 
specific reference to appointments of senior public service 
staff: 
“Political 
involvement 
in 
administration 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
proper 
functioning 
of 
a 
democracy. 
However, 
public 
services 
need 
protection 
against being misused for partisan purposes. 
They need technical capacity which survives 
20 
changes 
of 
government 
and 
they 
need 
protection against being used to impair the 
capacity of future government to govern.” 
 
In identifying suitable candidates for positions in 
public entities, the ANC does not seek to circumvent to 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 27 of 148 
 
establish an often legally mandated processes for the 
appointment of individuals for these positions.  Candidates 
are 
expected 
to 
submit 
their 
applications, 
meet 
the 
necessary requirements and be subjected to the normal 
processes of recruitment, selection, and appointment. 
 
Even with these requirements, there are several 
instances where individuals appointed to positions may not 
have been fit for purpose or may not have had the 
necessary experience or qualifications and this much I am 
prepared to accept. 
10 
 
The ANC’s 54 t h National Conference recognised 
this problem and resolved that the married principal must 
apply in the deployment to senior appointment based on 
legislative prescripts and in line with minimum competency 
standards. 
 
It is the ANC’s view that the practise of cadre 
development should not be inconsistent with the principles 
of fairness, transparency and merit in the appointment of 
individuals to public entities.  Cadre deployment cannot be 
faltered in principle.  It is a common feature of democratic 
20 
practise around the world and I think it properly describe 
and is not diluted to various other intents and forms.   
 
It is a useful process used by governing parties 
around the world to make sure that the mandate that they 
had been given by the populous is carried out but we could 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 28 of 148 
 
concede that there are weaknesses in this practical 
implementation that make the case for greater clarity both 
within the political parties and the state.   
 
Ultimately, political involvement in administration 
of the public service should be and must be circumscribed 
by legislation, by convention as well as by practice and we 
should do so to protect both political and administrative 
positions and to create certainty as to the division within 
political and administrative responsibilities.  There are a 
number of governments around the world who utilise this 
10 
very mechanism as outlined in the OECD.   
 
The Commission also asked that I address the 
funding of political parties.  Any successful multi-party 
democracy requires a diversity of functioning of political 
parties that are capable of articulating and representing 
the needs, the interest and the concerns of the electorate.  
For this, political parties require funding and in the 
absence of sufficient public funds for this purpose need to 
rely on donations from their own members, from supportive 
individuals, and yes indeed, from businesses. 
20 
 
Until adoption of the Political Party Funding Act 
which took effect on the 1 s t of April 2021, there were few, if 
any, specific restrictions on donations to political parties 
and no requirements on the reporting of donations, either 
publicly or to any particular authority.  Like other parties, 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 29 of 148 
 
the ANC relies on several sources of funding.  Many 
Treasurer Generals who run their financial affairs of 
various political parties will testify that the running of 
political parties as the government increasingly costly, 
expensive, and requires a lot of funding. 
 
These includes funds allocated to represented 
political 
parties 
which 
are 
administered 
by 
the 
IEC, 
membership subscriptions as well as levies that are levied 
on members who are deployed by the Parliament of various 
places, fundraising initiatives, like, in the ANC’s case, the 
10 
Progressive Business Forum, funding dinners and other 
events, and donations from individuals and companies. 
 
Despite the absence of any official policy on 
donations, there is an expectation based on the ANC’s 
constitution, its principles and its values that the ANC 
would not knowingly accept monies that are a product of a 
criminal act, are offered in exchange for favours or are 
from a source known in illegal or unethical activities. 
 
The ANC has long recognised the risk presented 
by the lack of regulation with respect for political funding.  
20 
The lack of transparency in donations to political parties 
increases the potential for corruption and the exercise of 
improper influence on political activity and government 
processes.  It wants to address this problem that the ANC 
resolve at its 52 n d National Conference that: 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 30 of 148 
 
“The ANC should champion the introduction of 
a comprehensive system of public funding of 
representative political parties in the different 
spheres of government and serious society 
organisations. 
This 
should 
include 
putting 
in 
place 
an 
effective regulatory architecture for private 
funding of political parties and civil society 
groups 
to 
enhance 
accountability 
and 
transparency to the citizens.” 
10 
 
It was not until the next ANC conference in 
December 2012 that the Political Party Funding Bill was 
introduced into Parliament to achieve this purpose.  We 
believe that the Political Funding Act will have a far-
reaching implication for the integrity and transparency of 
our political system and will help to rebuild public trust in 
the political process. 
 
While the Political Party Funding Act deals with 
donations to political parties, the ANC has also identified 
weaknesses in its approach to the funding of internal party 
20 
contests.  That is leadership contests.  Specifically, it has 
noted that its guidelines on the conduct of internal 
leadership elections are not suited for the conditions of the 
time that we live in and has initiated a process to review 
its policies on this matter. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 31 of 148 
 
 
The issue form part of the discussion documents 
published last year in preparation for the ANC’s upcoming 
National General Council.  I am raising this issue during 
the MEC meeting of 26 July 1990.  I said as President: 
“In the absence of clear, appropriate and 
realistic guidelines, our leadership contest will 
continue 
to 
play 
themselves 
out 
in 
the 
shadows in conditions of secrecy and mistrust, 
encouraging patronage and factionalism.” 
 
In conclusion.  The position of the ANC on 
10 
leaders and members who have been complicit in acts of 
corruption or other crimes is clear.  Their actions had a 
direct violation, not only on the laws of the republic, but 
also of the ANC’s constitution, its values and principles 
and 
the 
resolutions 
and 
decisions 
for 
the 
ANC’s 
constitutional structures.  Such members must face the full 
legal consequences from their action.  They cannot rely on 
the ANC for support or protection, nor may they appeal to 
the principle of collective responsibility. 
 
In accounting for their actions, they must be 
20 
accountable for their actions themselves because the ANC 
did not and could never direct its members or leaders to 
commit acts of corruption.  While the ANC distances itself 
from those within its ranks who have been involved in 
corruption or who are complicit in state capture, the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 32 of 148 
 
organisation must and does acknowledge that it must 
provide 
explanations 
for 
the 
matters 
currently 
under 
investigation by the Commission. 
 
We should do so because state capture took 
place under our watch as the governing party.  It involves 
some members and leaders of our organisation and had 
fertile ground in the divisions and weaknesses and the 
tendencies that have developed in our organisation since 
1994. 
 
I should say, however, that the vast majority of 
10 
ANC 
leaders, 
ANC 
cadres 
and 
ANC 
members 
are 
vehemently opposed to corruption in all its manifestations 
but we all acknowledge that the organisation could and 
should have done more to prevent the abuse of power and 
the misappropriation of resources that defined the era of 
state capture. 
 
Particularly the period under review by this 
Commission, the ANC does admit that it made mistakes as 
we have admitted in our various conferences.  We made 
mistakes as it sought to execute the mandate that it was 
20 
given by the voters.  It had shortcomings and living up to 
the expectations of the people of South Africa in relation to 
enforcing accountability and in generating a culture of 
effective of consequence management.  
 
The leadership of the ANC newly elected at its 54 t h 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 33 of 148 
 
National Conference, we acknowledge these shortcomings 
as an organisation and we did acknowledge that at our 54 t h 
National Conference and we do so now.  For this, we 
acknowledge to the people of South Africa that we did not 
always live up to the values and the principles that have 
defined the glorious movement that we belong to for over 
more of a century of its existence. 
 
We are, however, determined and we undertake to 
work alongside all South Africans to ensure that the era of 
state capture is relegated to history and that the excesses 
10 
that took place may never, never, never ever occur in our 
country.  I thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr President.  We are at 
nine minutes past eleven, we normally take an adjournment 
at 
quarter 
past 
eleven, 
I 
think 
we 
should 
take 
an 
adjournment now so that when we resume then we can 
continue.  We are going to take the adjournment now, we 
will resume at twenty five past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair, Mr President.  
By way of introduction it appears from your statement and 
your opening statement in addition to public statements 
that there are indeed three issues that the Commission 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 34 of 148 
 
should properly investigate. 
 
The first is to understand what happened in the 
period under review and we have three years of evidence 
before the Commission and we have certain statements in 
the opening and in your general statement in that regard. 
 
But the second is perhaps more important for 
present purposes and that is to understand how things 
could have happened and it is that regard that many of the 
questions will be put before you, Mr President.  In other 
words, what were the circumstances and events that 
10 
allowed these things to happen which appears by public 
consensus, as you say, to have conceded to – be to 
conceded to have happened. 
 
And the third element that is also very important, it 
may have to stand over to a large extent to the second 
session of your evidence as how can these things be 
prevented from happening again.  So we will cover all three 
issues but concentrate principally on issues two and three. 
 
Of course we will also ask questions of what you 
knew was happening in terms of the – or in relation to the 
20 
terms of reference and in relation to the third question, we 
will also ask what you, as President, the ANC and the 
executive which you are leading are doing or intend doing 
or think should be done to prevent it happening again and 
many of those elements are already in progress, for 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 35 of 148 
 
example matters in relation to law enforcement agencies, 
the Political Party Funding Act and others but there are 
other questions that will arise out of that and the object 
will be to ask on your part for evidence that will allow the 
Commission and the Chair in particular to understand what 
best are the remedies that it can recommend.  But having 
said that by way of introduction, Mr President, there is a 
unique element to this evidence, this is your Commission, 
this Commission is reporting to you and in that sense it is 
a unique situation but notwithstanding we hope that you 
10 
will help us do our job for you properly.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Of 
course 
it 
is 
a 
Presidential 
Commission in his capacity as President of the country and 
not as President of the ANC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well that is also true, Chair, 
so maybe I should reserve that question for the next 
session. 
 
Mr President, what we have done in response to 
your statement is look at certain paragraphs in the 
statement and to deal with matters arising from those 
20 
paragraphs and in particular your statements in those 
paragraphs but if we leave anything out in the sequence 
please alert us to it so that we can then go back and 
everything can be taken in its proper sequence.  So the 
first issue that we do have to raise is on page 12 of  
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 36 of 148 
 
bundle 1, EXHIBIT BBB1, but if there is anything before 
that you no doubt will alert us to it.  This is the 
introductory portion of your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, you said page 
12? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You explained to the President the black 
numbers and red numbers? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  We will be dealing – there 
are two sets of numbers on each page, we will be dealing 
10 
with the numbers at the top left hand corner and we have 
taken the liberty of using the acronym CR there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   My page 12, Mr Pretorius, starts with: 
“In the course of this Commission’s work…” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the right page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 21 on that page, Mr 
President, you say: 
20 
“In such circumstances political parties do not 
merely represent their members but often act as 
instruments to advance the needs and interests of 
entire sections of society.  This is among the 
reasons that the ANC describes itself as a liberation 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 37 of 148 
 
movement first and foremost that, among things, 
contests elections as a registered political party.” 
I understand from this paragraph as well as parts of your 
opening statement that the party is itself in terms of 
liberation, 
constitutional 
policies 
and 
principles 
the 
development of the South African society in accordance 
with this principles as a leader in society.  There can be no 
doubt about that fact and, as I understand it, that would be 
the justification that the party holds for adopting the stance 
that it is entitled to and does seek to control the leaders of 
10 
power.  Do you have any comment on that?  Is that 
common cause? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   With reference that you make 
to paragraph 21, indeed the ANC characterises itself as a 
liberation movement which we really have been from 
formation and largely because we were set up to achieve 
certain objectives and those objectives remain current, to 
be executed and you could say, in part, some of them have 
been – now have a democratic dispensation but we still 
want to pursue a truly non-racial South Africa.  That has 
20 
not yet been truly achieved.   
 
We are also a liberation movement because we 
seek also to attain a non-sexist South Africa, sexism is still 
rife in our country and it is also compounded by a 
continued violence that is perpetrated against women.  But 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 38 of 148 
 
more importantly, also, to attain a prosperous South Africa, 
that is an overarching objective and that remains what the 
ANC has as its objective, that characterises it as a 
liberation movement.  But in the midst of all this, it still has 
to be a political party that contests elections and in doing 
so, it then is supported by millions and millions of South 
Africans, so when it acts it needs to fulfil the mandate that 
it has set itself out to achieve which is informed by the 
ordinary people who elected because as we craft our 
manifestos, we do not do it just merely for ourselves as a 
10 
party, we go out and gather the views and aspirations of 
ordinary people and therefore, when we are then elected, 
we represent the people of South Africa and it is for this 
reason that we say we hold power not just for ourselves, 
we hold power and execute power – exercise, rather, power 
in the interests of the people of South Africa, the many 
millions who elect us and it is for this reason that we say – 
and it has been conceded that we are leader of society and 
what the ANC does and says quite often determines the 
mood in the country, determines the direction that the 
20 
country should go, so it is the role that is given to the 
African National Congress by the majority of the people of 
this country and they expect the ANC to act in a way where 
it will lead government and it will lead transformation and 
achieve the objectives as set out by itself as a liberation 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 39 of 148 
 
movement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Mr President.  It may 
seem what you have said should be taken for granted but 
perhaps is should not be taken for granted.  There are two 
things that flow from that statement, particularly the latter 
part of your statement that there is an expectation on the 
part of South Africans that the party will lead in dealing 
with policy, problems, solutions and the like and we will 
come back to that point later. 
 
But the second is that the electorate would then be 
10 
entitled to know how and what – how the ANC intends to go 
about its business and business of the country, the people 
and what it is doing in that regard.  Is that a fair 
statement?  Obviously there are exceptions, but… 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I would concede that, yes, 
they are entitled and in other ways we also describe 
ourselves as the ANC as the parliament of the people.  
When the ANC was formed in 1912 we – the leaders of past 
then characterised even that moment as the creation of the 
parliament of the people because the people, as the whole 
20 
of the majority were excluded from the so-called parliament 
that existed there.  So yes, people are entitled to know and 
that is why the ANC for the most point has been one of the 
very few parties in the country that has been willing and 
prepared to open, as it were, its chest, its heart to the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 40 of 148 
 
people of South Africa and admit its own mistakes and also 
set out the ways it seeks to correct much as sometimes, 
because 
it 
is 
a 
political 
movement, 
there 
will 
be 
contestation of some of the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may keep mic on, Mr President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Okay, I will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then, Mr President, after certain 
introductory 
structural 
remarks 
concerning 
the 
ANC’s 
structures and processes you deal with cadre development 
10 
and deployment beginning at page 15 and in paragraph – 
well, perhaps I should presage that with a summary of the 
evidence – a very, very broad and perhaps superficial, but 
if it is superficial you will tell me, summary of the evidence 
in relation to cadre development and “cadre deployment”. 
 
On the one hand there has been evidence that the 
policy goes far beyond mere recommendation and in fact is 
a policy implemented on the instruction and mandate of the 
deployment committee.  That is one view and there is 
certain evidence in regard to that.  Whether that is 
20 
exceptional or the rule, maybe we can deal with in due 
course when we come to detail. 
 
The other view, which is reflected in your statement 
and other statements, Mr President, is that the deployment 
committee goes no further than make recommendations 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 41 of 148 
 
and abides by the formal selection processes that take 
place for example in the public service.   
Those are the two extreme views and whether either 
is correct or not, Chair will have to consider and decide.  
Or it may be that neither is correct as a general rule and 
that there is quite a large grey area between.  What would 
your comment be? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   The deployment committee, 
as I said in my statement-in-chief, should really be seen as 
committee 
that 
recommends, 
the 
recommendation 
10 
committee and having been the Chair of the deployment 
committee as Deputy President, the process that really 
gets underway is as follows, and maybe I am simplifying it.  
The minister concerned, for instance when it comes to say 
state owned enterprises - or state entities, would come 
forward and say I need to appoint the CEO of one of the 
key state owned enterprises and in doing so, they will then 
have that post advertised, as they should in terms of the 
regulations and corporate governance and so forth and a 
message 
will 
then 
be 
forwarded 
to 
yes, 
the 
ANC 
20 
deployment committee, that there is a position that the 
minister will come to the deployment committee with to 
articulate what position they need to fill but then they will 
have triggered the process of – the formal process of filling 
that position.   So the advert then goes out so that 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 42 of 148 
 
whomsoever applies but then internally in the ANC people 
will then be encouraged to apply that there is a position, if 
you qualify, you could be one of those who are either 
shortlisted or whatever.  So the minister will then say we 
have shortlisted a number of people and in the short listing 
these are people who have been shortlisted.  Some of them 
may not even be ANC members, some of them may well be 
ANC 
members 
and 
what 
is 
then 
looked 
at 
by 
the 
deployment committee is to say we really need someone 
with experience.   
10 
For instance, if it is a railway entity of railways and 
who has been well-trained and well-prepared and all that, 
and having done that, the deployment committee could well 
say well, in our view so and so fits the bill.  It could be an 
ANC person, it could be an non-ANC person, completely 
unattached to the ANC, that we believe that this person 
can do the work.  And then it then goes off, it goes off to 
the selection – final selection process, that the minister 
then gets involved in with her colleagues in cabinet 
because an interviewing panel then is put up and if it is, 
20 
for instance, a Director General, it happens in cabinet, if it 
is a state owned enterprise it happens in terms of company 
rules and what have you.  So that then ensues.   
And then at times, Chairperson, the desires of the 
deployment committee are not even fulfilled.  They may 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 43 of 148 
 
well have said we want so and so and it may not happen 
and we say that should be in terms of the prescripts of the 
law, corporate governance and the prescripts of the 
selection process in, for instance, in the public service. 
So having chaired the deployment committee, I 
know that for a fact that in some cases the deployment 
committee wishes may not happen.  So it is for that reason 
that I describe in the main a deployment committee as a 
recommendation committee.  And it takes into account a 
whole number of considerations.  You could ask are some 
10 
of them political?  Yes.  For key positions where we seek 
to advance the mandate of the governing party?  Yes.   
But where, for instance, the requirements and the 
experience of a candidate overrides that.  We then say we 
rely on this person as an South African to execute the task. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Whether it always happens that 
way or not we can explore in due course with some of the 
more detailed evidence that we have been given but I 
understand you to have said that the whole process does 
require some form of statutory or other regulation and we 
20 
can explore that issue as well in due course.  But, for the 
moment, in paragraph 25 on page 15, your statement 
reads: 
“The policy of the ANC is aimed at ensuring that the 
person most fit for purpose is appointed whatever 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 44 of 148 
 
critical position has been identified.” 
And the statement is quite a strong statement, in other 
words the object of the policy is to ensure, not merely to 
suggest, that the person most fit for purpose is appointed 
to a particular position.  You have also now recently said 
that 
the 
deployment 
committee 
goes 
out 
to 
seek 
candidates.  How does one ensure that a person most fit 
for purpose is appointed if it is only a recommendation and  
another body makes the decision? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   The process of selection of -
10 
let me put it deployment of people – has evolved, has been 
evolving and has been a subject of discussion even in our 
past conference and in recent time, the last conference, 
the 
issue 
of 
professionalising 
the 
civil 
service, 
professionalising 
state 
owned 
enterprises 
and 
getting 
people who are fit for purpose has become accepted and 
has become more current.  And as it has evolved, it has 
evolved from a past that did not necessarily subscribe to 
that.   So, as everything evolves, as everything improves 
and gets better, this is now where we are.  And to this 
20 
effect even the Minister of Public Service has now 
embraced this process and it is now in the process of 
being fully implemented in government so we now have a 
new era, a new dispensation that is going to see to it that 
we have people who have fit for purpose.   
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 45 of 148 
 
 
So what the deployment committee will now to be 
doing is to yes, seriously ask itself whether people are fit 
for purpose.  Even as it will recommend certain people who 
could head any state owned enterprise or head any 
department as DG, it has to this as a filter and ask itself is 
that person fit for purpose as it recommends?  So I see – I 
do not see the two things as mutually exclusive, I see this 
process as being seamless. 
 
Chairperson, we do so because we are serious 
about correcting what has gone wrong in the past and this 
10 
is an important plank that we are working on to make sure 
that we build this up as an important pillar of improving 
state capability.  So when I will speak as head of the state 
I will talk about how we are going about improving state 
capability and this is one of the areas that I will address 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr President.  What is the 
importance, Mr President, of this deployment committee 
having the power to recommend as opposed to simply 
identifying potential candidates and encouraging them to 
20 
apply like everybody and be considered and if they are 
considered, the most deserving, they get appointed.  So 
what 
is 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
committee 
having 
to 
recommend as opposed to simply saying we know there is 
this position available, we would like some of our members 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 46 of 148 
 
that we know are qualified and we think are suitable or, as 
you say, people in society that the organisation is aware of 
that it thinks should be encouraged, encourage them to say 
you apply and you compete with – like with everybody.  So 
if you did it that way, the people that the deployment 
committee thinks are appropriate will be the among those 
who will be considered but they will not be coming with the 
recommendation from the deployment committee that the 
minister knows about, they will be coming like everybody 
but the deployment committee and the organisation should 
10 
be covered because it has made sure that people that it 
thinks should take those positions are there with others 
and competing there. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   With respect, Chairperson, I 
hope you do not think that I am pedantic when I say maybe 
the two are not mutually exclusive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And I say so advisedly 
because as previous chair of the deployment committee we 
did 
have 
a 
situation, 
some 
situations 
were 
– 
the 
20 
deployment committee will have identified two or three 
really suitable candidates and would say all of them, their 
names should go forward and in the end the final decision 
is then left to the final selection process in government.  
So what you are saying is that could the deployment 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 47 of 148 
 
committee not just identify instead of recommending, I 
would say the two are not mutually exclusive, it is 
impossible where two or three names have been sent 
forward 
and 
in 
other 
situations 
it 
has 
been 
a 
recommendation of one or so, so – and I take that and it is 
not impossible for the deployment committee to function in 
that way because all that it really seeks to do and should 
seek to do is to get whoever is fit for purpose, particularly 
now in this new, if you like, reformed era of making sure 
we do have people who are really good and fit for purpose 
10 
who would be able to execute the task at hand without 
feeling that they need to pursue – advance certain side 
interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that question arises in my mind 
because it would seem to me that where a minister is the 
appointing authority, for example… 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he or she knows that among the 
candidates 
there 
is 
this 
candidate 
who 
enjoys 
a 
recommendation 
of 
the 
deployment 
committee 
and 
20 
remember, the deployment committee is chaired by the 
Deputy President of the party and the Deputy President of 
the country because that is how it works at the moment. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems to me that it might put some 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 48 of 148 
 
pressure on the minister to take this candidate unless one 
of the other candidates really excels.  So, in other words, 
this candidate seems to come with an advantage that 
nobody else knows about other than the deployment 
committee and the minister.  So the other candidates think 
we are all competing on an equal footing but this one 
already enjoys a recommendation from the deployment 
committee, of course a recommendation that has been 
made by the deployment committee, not knowing the 
strengths and credentials of other possible candidates and 
10 
then the minister is aware, the committee chaired by the 
Deputy President thinks this is the person who should – or 
recommends that this person should be appointed.  Would 
you want to say something about that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I do indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I do want to say something, 
Chairperson, 
and 
I 
will 
paint 
to 
you 
the 
practical 
experience that unfolds at the deployment committee and it 
is good that you actually cite the situation of a minister 
20 
who will come to the deployment committee.  Quite often 
ministers come to the deployment committee, having gone 
through a process, a pre selection process themselves and 
the various other officials or committees embedded in their 
own ministry, where they sift through a number of say 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 49 of 148 
 
possible names.  
 
When 
they 
come, 
they 
seek 
to 
convince 
the 
deployment committee about certain candidates who may 
be short listed.  So in the end, quite often it is not even at 
the instance of the deployment committee.  It is at the 
instance of the minister, who knows and should know the 
skills, the experience that are fit for purpose for the task 
that they manage or they run in the ministry.  
 
So they would know for instance, the CEO of an 
entity what the requirements are and the deployment 
10 
committee does not know in full.  So they come to the 
deployment 
committee 
and 
seek 
to 
convince 
the 
deployment committee and even put up a pitted not fight, 
but argumentation of why the persons that they may want 
to 
see 
appointed 
should 
be 
recommended 
by 
the 
deployment committee.  
 
So that is the practical experience that I have had.  
So the deployment committee, in the end it will tell people 
that apply, there are these positions and but it is the 
deployee in that ministry or in that who manages that state 
20 
owned enterprise, who would know in greater detail, in 
finer detail precisely what is required.  
 
So 
they 
seek 
to 
convince 
the 
deployment 
committee.  So if you like, the deployment committee 
therefore plays a recommendation role, but it also plays 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 50 of 148 
 
more of a reactive type of role.  You could ask is there any 
desirability for the deployment committee and we would 
say yes, there is because it should serve as a filter.   
 
We are a political organisation and what we do in 
government is very political, so you do need that political 
filter but it should also not be a political filter that will go 
ahead and appoint people who are not fit for purpose.  It 
should be a filter that will make sure and if you like, it 
should be a quality type of assurance, that in the larger 
scheme of things we are going to have people in senior 
10 
positions who are going to execute the mandate as set out 
in the manifestoes of the governing party.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the two approaches, you said they 
are not mutually exclusive.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And I agree.  I have already indicated 
what possible criticism can be directed at the approach as 
you have described it.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely that the candidate recommended 
20 
by the deployment committee has this added advantage, 
and I assume that is not known to anybody, other than the 
deployment committee and the appointing authority, the 
minister.  
 
I may be wrong on that.  What criticism would you 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 51 of 148 
 
have with the other approach, which simply says your 
interest as an organisation in making sure that you, that 
certain strategic positions are occupied by people who 
understand your policies and so on and so on.  
 
That would be taken care of if you encourage 
candidates, suitably qualified candidates to apply, but once 
you ... once they have applied, why do you not leave it to 
the 
process 
and 
the 
appointing 
authority 
and 
the 
appointing authority is your own cadre who is supposed to 
understand the policies of the ANC and he or she will then 
10 
look at all of this.  
 
But in that way the candidate does not come with 
some extra added advantage.  Would you have criticism for 
that approach and say it would not be suitable? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  No, I would not except that what often 
happens, it is actually the minister who ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who comes to you. 
MR 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
Who 
comes 
and 
say 
I 
am 
recommending the following and the deployment committee 
then examines that and it is often convinced ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the ministers. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  And I have been in situations where the 
minister would come back maybe two to three times.  
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 52 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  And say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I want this one.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  This is the best one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  And I want to convince you and even 
bring further documentation to prove the case.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  And then I am not suggesting that the 
minister 
brow 
breeds 
the 
deployment 
committee 
into 
10 
submission, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  That is how it often happens.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  But having said that, your point is a 
good one and I would say yes, because I do not really see 
the two being so mutually exclusive, particularly because 
of the role that the minister does play. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  As the minister should because they 
20 
are the executive authority who has been deployed to do 
precisely that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius?   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Perhaps it bears 
mention Mr President, that there are three issues that we 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 53 of 148 
 
will canvass in the time allowed.  The first issue is, as you 
have elaborated in some 
detail, how is the 
system 
designed to work?  How should it work.  
 
The second issue is how, whether in part to the 
greater or lesser degree that may be debatable, how it did 
work in the past.  What problems arose.  You have 
mentioned some problems and we will come to it in a 
moment.  
 
So that one can understand how best the third issue 
can be addressed, and that is the regulation that you 
10 
yourself have proposed in your statement towards the end 
and we will get there.  There is another distinction that is 
quite important to bear in mind, and that is there are 
various categories of quota and quote deployment.  
 
The 
first 
is 
executive 
positions, 
for 
examples 
ministers, deputy ministers and the like.  The second is 
members of public service.  EG’s and employees employed 
in the public service, at whatever level and we will come to 
that as well, and the third is state institutions.  
 
The Captain Nine institutions, other institutions, 
20 
whether at the hands of parliament or the president.  
Perhaps we should be aware of those distinctions when, 
well I certainly will try and be aware of them when I am 
putting questions to you about that.  
 
The deployment policy of the ANC is I presume a 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 54 of 148 
 
developing document.  It is contained in your bundle, at 
page 122.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 182 Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  122.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 122? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, no on page 122. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 122, okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Is this the deployment policy of the 
ANC? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And does it have a date or is it a 
developing document?  Has it grown over time?  I see if 
you look at page 138, there is a reference to 2018 in 
paragraph 67.   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  It is what I would call a living 
document.  Living because as the ANC develops its own 
policies and polishes those policies up, so are these types 
of policies also being panel-beated into better shape.  If I 
can put it in that way.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  That point we can deal with 
20 
perhaps at the end in more detail Mr President, but if one 
could ... if I could ask you please to go to page 105.  This 
is a different document.  This is the ANC constitution.   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page Mr Pretorius?   
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 55 of 148 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  105.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  To paragraph or Clause 25 17.20.  
This is the ANC constitution.  That is how it is identified in 
your statement.   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This, paragraph 25.17 appears on 
the face of it to be a list of active misconduct, which would 
apply to members of the ANC for which disciplinary 
proceedings or in respect of which disciplinary proceedings 
10 
may be instituted.  
 
25.17.20 says: 
 
“In 
the 
case 
of 
a 
public 
representative 
breaching his or her contract of deployment 
concluded with the NEC.” 
 
Does 
that 
creature 
still 
exist? 
 
Contract 
of 
employment with the NEC, or please tell us about it.  
MR 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
Ja, 
this 
presupposes 
a 
public 
representative.  An elected public representative.  Public 
representatives are substantively supposed to have a 
20 
contract with the NEC.  When I was secretary general and I 
think even during the tenure of the subsequent secretary 
general, 
we 
presumed 
the 
situation 
where 
a 
public 
representative would literally accept their deployment as a 
public representative and sign a contract with the NEC.  
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 56 of 148 
 
 
In the end, you know with the secretary general 
where they say I accept my deployment, so that where it 
comes to a point where they have to be either removed, it 
is a termination of contract, because in the past we face a 
situation where some would say I have been elected and I 
am not stepping down or whatever.  
 
I am not agreeing to being removed.  So it deals 
more with publically elected representatives and not so 
much with the appointees who would be governed by other 
provisions, which has to do with the appointment either in 
10 
the civil service or in terms of company laws in the public 
enterprise.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Understood.  Would the contract of 
employment have any substantive provisions setting out 
the duties of the public representatives? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes, substantively it is supposed to 
have that, and I was also involved in the preparation and 
the drafting thereof in the past and I have not really kept 
abreast with the continuity of such, and I would say that if 
it has not continued, it is a very good instrument to have, 
20 
because it helps to regulate the relationship in the end 
between the organisation and the person who is deployed.  
 
This would also apply to a president, where the 
president has a contract with the organisation, because 
even as president or minister or whoever you are, in the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 57 of 148 
 
end deployed by the organisation because we have that 
type of political system.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would it be fair to say or would you 
accept that the electorate which elects the person to public 
office, would be entitled to know by what contractual 
provisions their representative is bound? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Absolutely, I would say yes.  Just as 
right now we have even published as you might well know 
at government level and we can deal with that when I come 
as president of the republic.  Published the contracts I 
10 
have entered into with the minister.  
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, in passing I must just say Mr 
President that the commission has struggled a lot to get 
previous performance contracts of ministers.  We to the 
best of my recollection, we got documents which reflected 
how they were supposed to look like, and I am not sure 
that we ever got the ones that were actually signed, but 
maybe some units of the commission has, because we 
wanted them at a certain stage, starting from 2010 or 
2009. 
20 
 
The information I was given at some stage was it 
looks like nobody knows where those contracts are, but 
maybe they have been found, I am not sure.  But it would 
be good if the ones that have been signed are kept 
properly with the public or a commission like this wants 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 58 of 148 
 
them and they can get them.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Chairperson, I undertake when I come 
before you again, I undertake to bring a box full of 
documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I also hope Mr President, in the box will 
be included performance assessments of ministers during 
that time.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  We are in the course of doing 
performance assessments now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, ja.  
10 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  So you may find a very 
incomplete process.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Including presidents.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Including presidents, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Maybe I will ask the Chairperson to 
assist me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  May I ask you to go back to the 
20 
deployment policy at page 124?   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 9 of the deployment 
policy says: 
 
“Our immediate goal as set out in strategy and 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 59 of 148 
 
tactics, is to deepen the hold of the liberation 
movement over the leaders of state and begin 
to 
impact 
positively 
on 
other 
centres 
of 
authority 
and 
responsibility, 
outside 
the 
immediate realm of state institutions.” 
 
Now can you assist, what are those other centres of 
authority and responsibility/ 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  This put simply is a political speak 
about the ANC exercising its leadership role in society.  
That the more we perform well, in the state that will have a 
10 
cascading impact on a whole number of other institutions, 
be it whatever is your supporting bodies and all that, and 
we will all start working in a harmonious way.  
 
With 
the 
ANC 
imposing 
this 
very 
positive 
developmental approach to how we should develop the 
country going forward.  So that is what is envisaged here.  
It is more political. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It does talk about positive impact. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Precisely. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Rather than direct control.  
20 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Ja, positive impact which is the 
leadership of society.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right, and then in paragraph 10 the 
policy reads: 
 
“The following are the key centres of authority 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 60 of 148 
 
and responsibility within the state and should 
be given priority.” 
 
10.1, cabinet. 
 
10.2, 
the 
entire 
civil 
service 
but 
most 
importantly from director level upwards, and  
 
10.3, premiers and provincial administrations.” 
 
Then over the page it goes on to legislatures, local 
government, 
parastatals, 
education 
institutions, 
independent statutory commissions, agencies, board and 
institutes, ambassadorial appointment and international 
10 
organisations and institutions.  
 
That list from 10.1 to 10.10 does that entire list fall 
within the scope of activity for the deployment committee 
or is that list, should it be interpreted differently? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  For the most part, yes it does.  But I 
say for the most part advisably, because in some instances 
the deployment committee never really get involved or 
concerns itself with this.  If you like the deployment 
committee has set itself its own limit that we will only limit 
ourselves in terms of how we function or recommend 
20 
people to these key positions.  
 
For instance, the deployment committee does not 
get involved in the appointment of ministers to cabinet.  
That is left to the president, but the president does consult 
his immediate colleagues which are the officials of the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 61 of 148 
 
ANC, but in the end in terms of the government system we 
have, it is the decision of the president and the president 
alone.  
 
So the deployment committee does not get involved 
in that.  When it comes to the entire civil service, that has 
to be read to mean the top leadership of the civil service, 
because 
it 
could 
never, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
for 
the 
deployment committee to involve itself in the appointment 
of you know secretaries or you know, directors and so 
forth. 
10 
 
But it does however get involved in the appointment 
of directors general, and to some limited extent to also 
deputy directors general, but for the most part, the civil 
service appointments are done within the civil service itself 
and in the end, even the minister does not also get 
involved in the appointment of directors.  
 
It is the director general who gets involved in that.  
Of course with premiers, yes.  It is the deployment 
committee.  Provincial administrations hardly ever.  The 
positions of DG of the provincial administration is done at 
20 
the provincial level.  
 
The legislatures, there is a process of if you like 
deploying people there are legislatures as well.  The 
national parliament and provincial and local, which really 
does not even, the deployment committee does not really 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 62 of 148 
 
get involved with that, because that is more of a very 
vigorous and robust democratic process that is involved 
there.  
 
Local government and I explained somewhere in my 
affidavit, something quite innovative is now being done, as 
this has evolved in the ANC, where it is no longer only the 
branch committees, it is also the community that gets 
involved in the final selection of people who should go into 
local government.  
 
Parastatals, 
yes. 
 
They 
key 
top 
positions.  
10 
Education 
institutions, 
hardly 
ever. 
 
The 
deployment 
committee like with cabinet, hardly ever get involved.  
Independent institutions, only to the extent of your top key 
one, and for instance you will be interested to know that 
when it comes to the judiciary it is left to that process that 
we have in the law.  
 
Ambassadorial 
appointment. 
 
Those 
will 
be 
recommended and they are always often recommended by 
the minister.  The minister, and in the end because 
ambassadorial appointment are at the instance of the 
20 
president.  
 
It is the president who appoints ambassadors, 
because in terms of our system, they represent the 
president in where ever they are deployed.  So that too is 
a process that he is engaged in, and the president in those 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 63 of 148 
 
cases takes the final decision, but he will also have 
discussed it with some of the colleagues.  
 
So international organisations is even a much more 
complicated one, because we do not appoint people to 
international commission organisations.  All we can do is to 
recommend, and after that, it is left to the board as it were.  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Yes, 
there 
has 
been 
some 
controversy on the latter point in relation to the Bricks 
Bank, but we did not go there at present.  I note the 
judiciary is not mentioned in paragraph 10 as one of the 
10 
institutions falling within the scope of the policy. 
 
But in relation to that scope, I understand you to be 
saying that that scope is, it does not although very broad 
and although would in terms of its policy statement, permit 
the deployment committee to intervene in those areas.  As 
a matter of practice this is not done.  
 
Is that correct? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  It is.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  For example the entire civil service 
is mentioned here.  
20 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  It is not done.  It is just the very top 
key positions as I have said, yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well perhaps a closer integration 
between policy and practice may be looked at.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Absolutely. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 64 of 148 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If I could take you to another 
paragraph, on page 133.  Para 47.  This refers to strategic 
centres of deployment and paragraph 47 reads: 
 
“Deployment within each of the five pillars 
requires its own sets of strategic discussions.  
For example within the state sector, what 
principles should inform the deployment of 
cadres 
to 
institutions 
with 
judicial 
or 
investigative functions and how should cadres 
be deployed to perform such functions, relate 
10 
to the organisation.  
 
There is a second point made later on, but we can 
come back to that.  That seems to indicate that there is at 
least a discussion taking place in terms of the policy about 
judicial and investigative functions, persons deployed to 
those 
functions 
and 
how 
they 
should 
relate 
to 
the 
organisation.  
 
Firstly, are persons deployed at least in the sense 
of 
being 
identified 
and 
encouraged 
to 
stand 
for 
appointment in the judiciary?   
20 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  In the judiciary, no hardly ever.  Hardly 
ever and I think much as it might have been thought of, it 
has never really resulted in that, because the appointment 
of people in judiciary in our country, is so well managed 
through the dispensation we have through the judicial 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 65 of 148 
 
services commission which manages all these matter so 
well and in the end my full understanding is that whenever 
there is a vacancy there is a lot of activity amongst the 
legal organisations and fraternity who encourage one 
another, that why do you not apply, why do you not apply, 
why do you not seek to be chief justice or whatever.  
 
So that is what I believe happens.  So that one has 
if any, has actually been very much likes touch and not at 
all in as far as I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would those members of the judicial 
10 
service commission who may  be members of parliament, 
ANC members of parliament, not be expected to talk to the 
ANC, to say here are candidates for various positions that 
will be interviewed in due course.  
 
Does 
the 
ANC 
have 
preference 
in 
terms 
of 
candidates?  Do you know whether anything like that does 
happen? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Not as far as I am aware.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  We have always relied on what I have 
20 
said now, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And again there appears to be at 
least on the face of it, and you may correct me if I am 
wrong, a disconnect between what the policy reads and the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 66 of 148 
 
practice.  You concede that? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The JSC, the judicial services 
committee, positions on the JSC.  Are they subject to the 
activities of the deployment? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No.  Then a second point is made 
which does not necessarily relate to the first point.  It 
says: 
 
“Within the “economy” the potential for cadres 
10 
to 
accumulate 
capital 
in 
their 
personal 
capacities as manifest, should such capital 
accumulated by deployed cadres be regarded 
as under the command and control of the 
movement and if so, how.” 
 
Is that something that should not stand or what do 
you say about that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   The – I think this is 
impractical, wholly impractical and to the extent that this 
may have been inserted here it could have meant that 
20 
those who may well have been put in certain positions in 
the economy are meant to manage those centres very well, 
because it is improbable that anybody once you have 
accumulated capital for yourself you know acting in the 
economy you would then account to the organisation.   It 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 67 of 148 
 
never happened. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, it says two things, it 
suggests in the first sentence that there is an expectation 
that 
cadres 
and 
deployed 
cadres 
might 
accumulate 
personal wealth, whether that is in Government our outside 
Government it doesn’t say but the second point is that 
there’s a thought, at least expressed here, that the policy 
says that, well we should at least or consider whether that 
money 
should 
come 
to 
the 
movement, 
is 
that 
an 
appropriate clause?  
10 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, it is wholly misplaced 
because as I say it is improbable and could never have 
happened because if people are in business, they do 
…[indistinct] on personal accumulation processes and if 
they so want to donate money and give money to the 
movement then they should be able to do so and not that 
they should inherently be expected they should because 
they never would. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 56.1 on page 135, again 
black number, I’ve just made the mistake of reading red 
20 
numbers myself, 56.1 it says, 
“Cadres should be ready to be deployed where the 
movement deemed it necessary to deploy them”, 
 
That is quite a strong statement and veers towards 
the hard interpretation of the deployment policy, do you 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 68 of 148 
 
have any comment? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, this really should be 
seen in a historical context and this is where the ANC 
acting as a liberation movement when it was banned and in 
exile you were deployed wherever and you could not 
question where you were deployed and if you were – for 
instance Umkhonto we Sizwe you would be told you were 
going to be deployed on the Mozambican front or Lesotho 
front or wherever and you go, no question asked because 
you are the NS soldier and similarly people who were not 
10 
in the armed forces would be deployed anywhere you’d be 
deployed to London, to Moscow wherever and this is a 
remnant from the past but today you actually do engage 
the discussion with a comrade and say, we would like to 
deploy you wherever but when – as President I appoint 
Cabinet, I say this is where I want you to go and quite 
often no question asked in fact no question asked, people 
are deployed as they are informed by their upper leader.  
So, in other situations there are discussions because you 
have to take into account the circumstances of the 
20 
comrade.  You’ve got to take into account their skills 
space, you’ve got to take into account a whole number of 
other things.  So, my answer to this would be, yes and no 
and the no part would represent the considerations that 
you need to have and the yes part, in certain deployment 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 69 of 148 
 
situations you’ve got to agree to go where you are 
deployed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, perhaps, as you’ve pointed 
out, Mr President, in a modern and democratic economy as 
opposed to the history or the historical situation in which 
the party found itself, perhaps it could be qualified 
or…[indistinct – dropped voice]. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Precisely. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 60 on page 136, this is 
perhaps more of a commentary rather than a strict 
10 
expression of policy, but it reads, 
“The 
ANC’s 
range 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
deployment committees ebbed and flowed over time 
as 
the 
movement 
battled 
intra 
organisation 
positioning, 
optimisation 
of 
state 
governance, 
factionalism, 
careerealism 
and 
over 
the 
page 
opportunism, desperation for employment and the 
organisational dilemmas of having to act against 
corrupt comrades”, 
 
Clearly – or perhaps I’m being presumptuous but if I 
20 
am, you will tell me so, Mr President, clearly this is an 
expression of the problems faced in fact, in the history of 
the application of the deployment policy, am I correct in 
that? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, you are correct, I mean, 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 70 of 148 
 
as you correctly say, Chairperson, this is commentary and 
this is apt commentary because truth be told we have had 
to deal with issues like that, the deployment committee and 
as the ANC broadly, careerealism, opportunism and some 
of these deployments have caused internal ructions within 
the ANC because we are a living organisation composed of 
people with interests and people with aspirations and 
ambitions. So, in the end you’ve got to manage all of that, 
very, very delicately and carefully so it is apt commentary. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, how would factionalism 
10 
arise? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Factionalism arises because 
members of the organisation, like it happens in any 
organisation would have different perspectives, different 
interests and some of the perspectives may be ideological 
some may be just organisational and some may even be 
economic where people have economic interest and they 
then cluster around those interests and become, say, a 
grouping within the organisation and become a faction that 
then feed on things that happen in the organisation be they 
20 
say, different deployments or appointments.  So, that then 
involves into distinct groupings that could be pitted against 
each other but then there could also be groupings that 
have a minimum – minimum sort of agenda that pulls them 
together but at the other end both ends there are different 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 71 of 148 
 
ones, ideological, economic, or organisational. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So, is it fair to say that in the 
history of the party in implementing and developing the 
deployment policy it has had to face particular factions 
seeking to further, legitimately, economic interest? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, that does happen and 
as any organisation would attest to, it is something that 
can be faced but it really beholds on the organisation 
whether it recognises that as a challenge and addresses it 
and I can never say that it has not affected the ANC and it 
10 
has and it is this that we’re now involved in, in our renewal 
process that we need to rid the organisation of elements, 
factions that pursue certain divergent interest to our broad 
strategic objective of advancing the interests of the people 
of South Africa. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And, to get to the third large topic, 
how can it be prevented from happening again, these 
experiences, I understand from your evidence inform the 
degree to which regulation is required? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Regulation, Chairperson, is 
20 
required, regulation at a state level but because the ANC is 
so broadly supported, it is the leader of society, it has to 
do things not so much for its own interest but for the 
interest of the people of South Africa.  It, therefore, needs 
to embark on a renewal process so that it corrects all 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 72 of 148 
 
these maladies within the organisation and if you like, 
clean up its own act so that it is much more presentable, 
even electorally to the people of South Africa and I 
comment on this in my document that over time we saw the 
electoral support of the ANC going down largely because of 
the corrosive corruption that our people found abhorrent 
and it is this, even at our 54 t h conference that we sought to 
address.  That we’ve got to arrest this and reverse it and it 
is for that reason that we embarked on a renewal process 
to renew the organisation and organisations do go through 
10 
these ups and downs and that’s what we’ve also gone 
through, renew our organisation but renewal should not 
just be in theory it should be in practice, which is precisely 
where we are now.  We are putting into practice the entire 
renewal process and we – as it were, trying to herd 
everyone, everyone in the same direction and that is why I 
referred to the resolution that we passed at our 54 t h 
conference, were supported by thousands of members of 
the ANC who came from right across the length and the 
breadth of the country. So, what remains now is the full 
20 
implementation as we move. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Moving between categories again, 
not to be confusing, Mr President, appointments to Law 
Enforcement Institutions for example the National Director 
of Public Prosecution the Commissioner of Police, the head 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 73 of 148 
 
of HAWKS, the head of IPID, SIU and others, we know, and 
perhaps it put a – obtained a mention that in the 
appointment of the NDPP most recently, a completely new 
process involving public participation was directed by 
yourself but let’s go back to trying to understand how 
appointments in the past – and I’m now going before your 
reign Mr President, in the past did the deployment 
committee 
involve 
itself 
in 
appointments 
to 
Law 
Enforcement Institutions, for example NDPP, Commissioner 
of Police and the like? 
10 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
 
No, 
not 
under 
my 
Chairpersonship, no it did not.  So, we didn’t do so, I need, 
maybe on further reflection, need to maybe correct the 
impression I may have made when you asked me about 
those 
who 
would 
apply 
to 
the 
Judicial 
Services 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja, because I do recall once 
where vacancies were mentioned and it was just in 
passing, I should say that it was in passing and as it 
20 
should that the deployment committee would look at where 
are vacancies, but it never resulted or descended into 
saying this one would be good that one would not be good 
and so forth and it was just in passing.  So, I thought I 
should correct that. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 74 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   But having said that my – 
under my Chairpersonship there was no involvement with 
Law Enforcement Agencies, like Commissioner of Police, 
NDPP and so forth, that never was the case. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and of course, there has 
also been evidence about the direct power to appoint being 
used for purposes that are, to put it quite plainly, 
illegitimate and these appointment in Law Enforcement 
Agencies and the like are the subject matter of other 
10 
evidence and do not involve evidence concerning the 
deployment committee and will be dealt with separately but 
we should not forget about those in an overview in relation 
to appointments to offices of state but may I raise a further 
question because we’ve spoken about how the deployment 
committee should work, it’s architecture and design, as it 
has developed over time.  We’ve spoken about how it might 
not have worked or did not work in the past in instances 
and the extent of those instances may be debated and 
we’ve spoken about the need in relation to policies and 
20 
legislation as you’ve stated in your statement and have 
spoken about now needs to be looked at it and perhaps 
even rewritten but there is a view that has been expressed 
before the Commission and perhaps your comment on this 
view would be useful by more than one witness and a view 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 75 of 148 
 
that has been expressed publicly that there is no need for 
a deployment committee anymore and if I may just put 
those views to you and then ask for your comment.  In her 
testimony, Barbara Hogan stated, 
“However, the usefulness of such a deployment 
committee these days is debatable, how can, just a 
handful of people possibly have the institutional 
knowledge and resources to pronounce on suitable 
candidates, for every senior position in Government 
and the private sector.  It cannot be that closeness 
10 
to or membership of the ANC or an of its alliance 
structures or to fractions within these structures 
should be the determining factors in the selection of 
candidate for senior positions.  In this day and age 
there are a host of capable black and white 
professionals, women, and men from which to 
choose 
who 
clearly 
understand 
and 
have 
an 
appetite 
for 
making 
the 
economy 
grow.  
Directorships on Boards should never be granted to 
the favoured few as a reward for loyalty to a party 
20 
or a faction of a party or as a retirement benefit for 
the well connected”, 
 
There are several items or views in that passage, 
and you may want to consider it at more length, but do you 
have any comment? 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 76 of 148 
 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, I do, having listened to 
what you have referred to as put forward by former Minister 
Barbara Hogan I would say that, when dealing with these 
types of matters it’s better to be circumspect and not to 
throw the baby out with the bathwater because if there is 
something that causes an irritation it does not mean that 
you just chuck everything out because the deployment 
committee has a number of considerations that it needs to 
keep in mind.  One of those is, just having in mind the 
developmental nature of the state that we are creating that 
10 
we need to focus on this, what we refer to from the OECD 
paper of the political aspect which, in our book, would be 
the developmental side of the equation where we need to 
keep an eye on the mandate that we’ve been given in 
terms of our own manifesto in terms of support because 
you want – let me give you a good example. You want, for 
instance, the CEO or even Directors, say of an Eskom, you 
know right at the beginning we wanted an Eskom to 
electrify the country and make sure that even our people, 
mostly the majority black people who never had electricity 
20 
in their lives to have electricity.  So, that person must have 
a developmental as well as a commercial orientation and if 
you 
just 
have 
someone 
who 
has 
commercial, 
my 
grandmother in Limpopo would never have had electricity 
because that person would just be infused or you know, 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 77 of 148 
 
focusing on just the commercial that she will never be able 
to pay because she’s a pensioner and dah, dah, dah but 
you 
want 
someone 
who 
you 
know 
is 
going 
to 
be 
developmental 
who 
is 
going 
to 
have 
a 
very 
clear 
developmental agenda as well as a commercial one to 
make sure that that happens.  So, in the end it’s not 
necessary that they should be ANC members, no and in 
fact one would discover that.  The other consideration, 
which 
is 
very, 
very 
strong 
in 
our 
case, 
which 
the 
deployment committee oversees is the gender balance in 
10 
all these institutions.  We’ve long gone past where we just 
have 
men 
appointed 
to 
various 
positions 
so 
the 
development, I mean the deployment committee focuses on 
that and says, do we have a clear gender balance, do we 
have sufficiently selected women who can get into key 
positions and it is due to the deployment committee that is 
today in Government, more – over and over now we have 
balanced Boards of Directors, we have balanced even in 
the state we’re seeking to balance – it’s a matter of 
concern, for instance, to the deployment committee that 
20 
the Director General cohort that we have is largely male.  
So, the deployment committee will intervene and say to 
those 
deployed 
in 
Government, 
you’ve 
got 
an 
over 
abundance of men in key positions we need to see a 
balance and – so the deployment committee drives that. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 78 of 148 
 
So, that is why I would say, yes, we shouldn’t just tilt the 
pendulum one way, it should be balanced, and it should 
never be because someone is close to the ANC.  We 
should appoint people who are close to South Africa who 
are South Africans who’ve got the loyalty and patriotism, 
but we are also professional who we assure have a 
developmental type of approach to doing things and who 
would be willing to promote the ideals that the ANC or the 
agenda and the mandate that the ANC was elected. So, 
whilst I hear what Barbara Hogan is saying that, there’s no 
10 
further need I would say, right now there’s even more 
need, however, deployment committee as decided by, even 
our recent conference must focus on ensuring that there 
are people who are fit for purpose, who are professional 
who know their craft who will go and execute their craft 
without fear or favour and who, themselves, will not be 
captured by any interest will just be there to serve the 
people of South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I should have asked this question 
earlier, Mr President, what does the deployment committee 
20 
recommend, does it recommend that a particular person be 
appointed to a particular position, does it recommend that 
a particular person be considered for appointment to a 
particular position? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, it is the latter. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 79 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the latter? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is the latter because in the 
end it has to depend on the sort of final selection 
processes of that given institution or given position, say in 
Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the processes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And the processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   One of the points that Barbara 
Hogan makes in that passage that was quoted that perhaps 
there 
are 
selection 
committees 
with 
expertise 
more 
concentrated and more thorough to deal with selection to, 
for example, particular state owned entity Boards, should it 
not just be left to them, that was the statement? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, as it often 
happens, it is in the end left to a selection panel that the 
Executive Authority that has been deployed in that terrain 
will put together for instance I’ve often seen how, for 
20 
instance, if a Director General has to be appointed the 
Minister will make sure that the selection panel is diverse 
but behind that there is another layer that really goes into 
thorough details and they often rely on external entities 
where external entities go through, in a very expert way, 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 80 of 148 
 
the identification of those people who could be appointed 
and then the selection panel also has a number of, say 
Ministers and Deputy Ministers who are well versed in that 
sort of area but let me also say that, you know, the 
deployment committee is also composed of people who are 
quite knowledgeable.  So, you know the deployment 
committee of the current period is composed of people 
from labour, people from labour are usually very sharp on 
human resource issues, you know, people from political 
type 
of 
organisation, 
people 
from 
community 
based 
10 
organisation, women, and the youth so it’s a collection of 
people who are so diverse in their own experiences that in 
my view, gives rise to a wealth of wisdom in the 
recommendation of people which should be taken forward. 
So, whoever is then taken through a number of filters and 
processes before they are finally appointed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would there be any warrant for the 
regulation 
about 
which 
you 
speak 
later 
on 
in 
your 
statement making special provision for positions which are 
highly 
specialised 
requiring 
specialist 
skills 
and 
20 
experience, is that catered for or would it specifically be 
catered for? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It is something that we need, 
obviously, in accordance with what I’ve put forward that we 
need possibly to regulate that we should consider because 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 81 of 148 
 
when you look at what other countries also do they – some 
of them go through similar processes and when we talk 
about the professionalization of the state with a view to 
increasing or enhancing the capability of the state, this is 
precisely what we now need to do because we do really, 
seriously need to ensure that capture of the state does not 
happen again.  So, we need to do things in a transparent, 
in a convincing way, whilst yes, because we’re a political 
organisation we still keep our eye on the mandate we have 
and ensuring that it is actually executed. So, it’s a 
10 
wonderful balance in as far as I’m concerned, we should 
really give rise to something that’s quite new, innovative, 
and really beautiful for South Africa, as we go forward. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, I see it is one o’clock. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Really? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I thought it was five o’clock 
already. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is only one o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the adjournment and we will 
20 
resume at two o’clock. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we proceed Mr Pretorius I think we 
must have in mind how far we would go this afternoon and I 
do not know whether the arrangement with the President and 
his team is that we would stop at four or five or whether if 
necessary he would be available for us to proceed beyond 
that time and I do not know your own situation and your 
team. 
 
I am mentioning that because  
1. I do not have an evening session this evening.  So if 
10 
the situation was such that we can beyond five o’clock I 
would be available but the President might have other 
plans because he might have worked on the basis that 
we would stop maybe at four or five. But tomorrow we 
do have an evening session. 
So I am mentioning that in case if we do not use some time 
after five – after four today tomorrow might not be enough.  I 
am just giving that information so that while we proceed 
everybody would be ready that when we come to four o’clock 
whether the answer would be we can go up to five or we stop 
20 
at four or whether what the position would be. 
 
 
So you might have canvassed that with the President 
or his team. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair it has been rather 
tentatively 
raised 
with 
the 
President’s 
team 
on 
this 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 83 of 148 
 
understanding that he does have a country to run 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am sure that they will express their 
views. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Either now or when the time comes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well Mr President you will indicate 
what your situation is when either now or later on.  So all I 
10 
was saying is tomorrow we have an evening session so we 
would have to finish by five o’clock but in case tomorrow 
might not be enough we might go beyond four o’clock; 
beyond five o’clock today but only if that suits everybody 
because there might have been other plans if that had not 
been discussed. 
 
But if we have to stop at five that is fine as well.  
Okay alright. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you Chairperson.  We 
had envisaged that we would stop at four. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  But I guess maybe to – to be 
accommodative because there are other issues we have to 
attend to five o’clock should be fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Well we could stop at four 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 84 of 148 
 
strictly speaking the day session goes up to four but we 
normally stretch it a little bit but if from your side you are 
comfortable with going up to five maybe we should do that.  
But it just depends I do not want you to be under pressure 
because four o’clock is generally the normal time. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Ja I would wait for another 
message that will be sent from my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  About that and then we will 
indicate that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Even at four o’clock 
we – I will ask. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the position is 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if we have to stop at four we stop at 
four if we can go up to five then we go up to five. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.  We may proceed 
Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I wanted to move on Mr President to 
a statement made by Mr Enoch Godongwana in an interview 
he gave to a television station on the 15t h of April 2021 I do 
not know if you are aware of it.  But he said the following 
and pointers first one ultimately 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 85 of 148 
 
“The objectives of the time were to change 
the demographics of the Public Service.  
Secondly to ensure that the transformation 
agenda is carried out.” 
 
He is talking about deployment. 
“The question one may pose and the current 
conjecture is have these objectives been 
achieved?  If we look at the demographics of 
the civil servants as we speak they are 
clearly transformed from that perspective 
10 
therefore that objective had been achieved. 
 
If 
we 
look 
at 
the 
second 
transformation orientation I think there is no 
doubt that it diffused into the public service 
as a whole.  So somebody may then say is 
there is a necessity to continue doing so?  
These 
are 
debates 
that 
we 
should 
be 
engaged on as you are aware the moment 
the Minister of Public Service is looking at 
introducing a policy of what is called a 
20 
professional civil service.  The debate which 
is taking place in South Africa at the moment 
will impact on the form and content of the 
deployment policy.” 
 
Simply 
put 
he 
is 
speaking 
about 
the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 86 of 148 
 
professionalization policy which perhaps we can talk about 
later not now in this context.  But he is asking the question 
and I would like to ask you whether this question is being 
asked within the ANC at the moment is whether deployment 
is necessary at all? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you Chairperson.  I did 
become aware of what Mr Enoch Godongwana did say and 
he starts off his assertion on the basis that transformation 
was 
central 
to 
the 
necessity 
to 
have 
a 
Deployment 
Committee and this started off 1994 because you will recall 
10 
when we came into government we found an all-white 
headed civil service and it really cut across from the top to 
near the bottom and the bottom was largely black people and 
the top – the middle and the below middle were all white. 
 
And in the main male as well so it was pale males 
who 
dominated 
the 
civil 
service 
so 
it 
was 
therefore 
necessary to have a Deployment Committee that would 
address that anomaly. 
 
But 
today 
we 
continue 
to 
need 
that 
type 
of 
intervention because what we are seeking to do is to build a 
20 
diverse nation. A nation that is united across the various if 
you like cultures that we have in our country but also gender. 
 
And transformation is not a one day affair; it does not 
happen all at one go it is a process that happens over time.  
And it does need to be guided; it does need a strategic 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 87 of 148 
 
intent and for instance one of the key issues I should have 
alluded to was not only the gender issue but also a 
demographic mix. 
 
Each 
time 
when 
the 
demo 
– 
the 
Deployment 
Committee meets it looks at that.  Are we able to have a 
diverse sort of Deployment of people?  So that we do not 
have an all let us say African components of the civil service 
leaving aside white, coloured and Indian who make up what 
South Africa is all about. 
 
And you therefore need that Deployment Committee 
10 
because that is part of our transformation process.  
 
Now the Deployment Committee asks itself those 
questions and seeks to create that balance because I have 
also seen that even in the government circles sometimes it is 
lost – that focus is lost and we have always believed that it 
can be better inspired and it can better led from political 
party point of view. 
 
And this Chairperson is not unique only to the ANC.  
If you were to look at what has also happened to other 
political parties and I can think of a party that is also in 
20 
government alongside say the ANC like the Democratic 
Alliance.  They do have that as well. They do in the end get 
approval process for the appointment of people from the 
party and sometimes and this occurred when a case had to 
be handled by the Public Protector and Mr Bredell had to say 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 88 of 148 
 
this cannot happen until an arm or a structure of the 
Democratic Alliance had to give its nay or yeah. 
 
So without getting into those processes I am just 
alluding to the fact that the Deployment Committee in other 
organisations is there even if they may not call it that and I 
guess the ANC in its exuberance has gone ahead to say we 
will call it a Deployment Committee and there had been other 
cases it happened as it happens. 
 
I know for instance and I have referred to it in my 
affidavit that even in other countries I know for instance with 
10 
– with the UK particularly under Margaret Thatcher the 
question needs to be asked is that person one of us?  And 
there is even a book written to that effect One of Us. 
 
And what that meant was even in her governance of 
the UK they always sought to find people who were one of 
them and so this is not unique to the ANC and you could 
never say that in Margaret Thatcher’s era they were going 
through a hard core transformation process and maybe it 
was soft, harsh but they still needed to have one of them and 
in our case we are not necessarily saying they must be one 
20 
of us we are saying we would like to see that all these 
requirements are met because they are important for the 
development of our country and nation building and making 
sure that those who are given key positions in our state are 
representative of who we are as South Africans.  Thank you. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 89 of 148 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 32 on page 17 you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you back in his affidavit? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Another issue is raised that maybe 
significant in this discussion Mr President and that is the 
quote you had placed there by Matheson of the OECD that is 
the Organisation for Economic and Community Development 
times and it is an international organisation that has many 
countries as members.  Is South Africa a member?  I know it 
10 
is quoted in the survey? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  No we are not a member we are 
associated – they have always sought to have us as a 
member so – but we are not a member of the OECD. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway the quote here deals with the 
issue of the political loyalties of public servants. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The responsiveness of public 
servants to the policies of the current executive and what 
this says in your statement is the following: 
20 
“Political involvement in administration is 
essential for the proper functioning of a 
democracy. 
 
Without 
this 
an 
incoming 
political 
administration 
would 
find 
itself 
unable to change policy direction.” 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 90 of 148 
 
 
That is the import of that quote there are some 
caveats which follow but they more strongly stated and I see 
that in your opening statement care was taken to deal with 
that issue clearly well prepared.   
 
But in Matheson and it is in Bundle 2 if you need to 
look at it he says the following: 
“In their quest for legitimacy democratic 
regimes find themselves having to balance 
two values that can be in some tension.  Fair 
and political partisan public service delivery 
10 
and subject to the law – importantly subject 
to the law – the responsiveness of public 
servants 
to 
the 
policies 
of 
the 
current 
executive.” 
 
Now 
we 
know 
that 
that 
is 
dealt 
with 
in 
our 
constitution to a degree to which the public service must fair 
and partial and independent and hopefully that will be 
reflected in legislation in time. 
 
He goes on to say: 
“Neutrality in the sense of political non-
20 
partisanship and public administration is of 
course a pre-condition for ensuring that 
regardless 
of 
their 
political 
orientation 
citizens are treated fairly and in an equitable 
manner.  Operationally it is delivered by 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 91 of 148 
 
emphasising 
professionalism, 
merit 
and 
competence amongst public servants.  These 
values are important to the level of justice 
and 
continuity 
and 
public 
administration.  
Arguably a significant determinant of how 
much trust citizens place in their system of 
government. 
 
At 
the 
same 
time 
public 
servants 
must 
be 
accountable 
to 
the 
government for the effective delivery of its 
programs 
and 
responsiveness 
of 
the 
10 
administration to the government of the day 
within the law and its constitutions as key to 
the effective implementation of government 
policy. 
 
And the report goes on to show how 
different 
countries 
have 
developed 
institutional 
arrangements 
which 
balance 
these two concerns to avoid the extremes of 
a 
self-serving 
public 
service 
immune 
to 
political leadership on the one hand or an 
20 
over politicised public service hostage to 
patronage and serving partisan rather than 
national interests on the other.” 
 
Now there is clearly a tension expressed.  It was 
mentioned in your opening statement Mr President. To what 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 92 of 148 
 
extent and leave aside the history are the future plans of the 
party seeking to balance those two considerations and how 
will that be achieved? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Well there needs to be balance 
between what I would say the political involvement of the 
governing party that I spoke about with ensuring that there is 
proficiency – technical proficiency, fairness in terms of 
service delivery and that those who execute such are able to 
be neutral enough and not to be biased in a partisan way. 
 
Now that is quite important and it is what we want to 
10 
engender going forward to ensure that when it comes not 
only to service delivery but also to for instance appointments 
of people be it for public employment projects that public 
servants should be colour blind when it comes to that.   
 
They should not be partisan, they should seek to 
serve the people of South African with neutrality, with 
fairness and they should demonstrate their own technical 
capacity and capability. 
 
That is so necessary for them to do so because the 
people that we serve are not blind when something is done 
20 
on a partisan basis they see it and once it is done that way it 
basically means we are failing the people and we are 
therefore even violating their own basic rights as citizens of 
our country. 
 
So we need to guard against that and we need to 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 93 of 148 
 
inculcate that culture and we will – we will seek even to – to 
have that approach also encoded in regulations also in 
legislation to the extent that we can. 
 
It is so important and that is why I in my statement in 
chief if you like referred to the OECD and Matheson at 
00:19:39 that they put the case so well in that document that 
much as you can have political involvement particularly when 
as a governing party you want to ensure that your mandated 
positions are adhered to.  You do however need to balance 
that with that technical proficiency in non-partisanship as 
10 
you implement because a party like the ANC needs society 
and it cannot be seen to be partisan in favour of certain 
people when it executes .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr President.   
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  It is not my fault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no it is not yours Mr President.  Will 
everybody please switch off their cell phones.  Okay let us 
continue. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  So it is therefore important and 
I would agree with Mr Pretorius that we do need to have that 
20 
balance but I would say that balance needs to be – to have a 
foundation and that foundation is what I spoke.  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Mr President you have spoken 
about 
a 
move 
or 
intention 
to 
introduce 
a 
policy 
of 
professionalization of the civil service what problems would 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 94 of 148 
 
that move seek to address and what is envisaged? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  It would seek to address the 
problems that we have had where and I think Minister – Mr 
Godongwana refers to that in his – in his interview where we 
do have and admittedly so we do have some people in our 
civil service who are ill-qualified, who are not that fit for the 
purpose, who do not have those qualifications that are 
necessary.  Now we want to professionalise the civil service 
and that will happen in a variety of ways and we are not 
talking about chucking people out we are talking about 
10 
capacitating those people, having them properly trained and 
that is why the school of government – the National School 
of Government has moved into top gear now – moved into 
top gear in the sense that it is a really literally come alive in 
terms of its curricular, offerings, in terms of ensuring that 
many cohorts in the civil service do attend certain courses 
and we do want to move to a point where you know nearly 
everyone in the public service from President right down 
does 
attend 
lessons 
and 
courses 
at 
the 
School 
of 
Government on an annual basis where I even as President 
20 
would know that I do need to go and spend a week at a 
School of Government and to address that incapacity that we 
have say for instance the grouping of people who are ill-
qualified to be capacitated, courses should be crafted for 
them and they should acquire the necessary skills so 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 95 of 148 
 
professionalising the civil service that would be part of that 
process.   
But also going forward it would mean that we then 
appoint people who are fit for purpose.  People who are well 
experienced but of course when we get say young people 
into the civil service the issue of experience is not something 
that it is actually something that the young people have said 
please discard that because we want to come in and once we 
are in then you should equip us with all the necessary skills 
and I have agreed with young people that exactly what we 
10 
should do and we should now find a way of encoding that. 
But in the end professionalising the civil service 
means that we want to increase the capacity of the state.  
That is something that I am really if you like obsessed about 
because many of the challenges that we face in terms of 
implementation of our decisions and our policies revolves 
around the incapacity that we have in the state. 
And it is a fairly straightforward matter that we can 
address through this professionalization, through getting 
people who are fit for purpose, who have the experience and 
20 
the expertise and if need be we go out and seek them out 
and head hunt them so that we bolster the capability of the 
state. 
And that way I think we will – we will have achieved a 
great deal in this era of deforming processes that were 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 96 of 148 
 
damaged in them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  In your preparation Mr 
President you have no doubt been forewarned that the 
answer to the Parliamentary question by the Minister of 
Public Service and Administration Mr Mchunu in a reply to a 
question he stated: 
“According to information from Purcell that 
the 
quantum 
system 
for 
government 
employees as at 15 February 2021 there are 
currently a total of 9477 senior managers 
10 
employed in the public service.  Out of this 
total 3301 members do not have the required 
qualifications.  However it needs to be stated 
that many departments do not capture the 
qualification 
information 
on 
Purcell 
and 
therefore the information in the tables below 
are skewed.  This information also excludes 
the 
Department 
Of 
Defence 
And 
State 
Security Agency.” 
 
However the statistics need to be adjusted rather 
20 
there does seem to be a quite serious problem about 
qualifications in the public service and is that problem 
recognised? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  That problem is recognised and 
that is precisely the problem that we will now address 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 97 of 148 
 
through the professionalization for the public service.  
 
Now it is a lot of people 3301 and I would say we are 
not about to chuck those people out.  If anything we as the 
state are to blame for having brought in people who are ill-
qualified.  We therefore need to address the problem but we 
need to address it humanely.  We need to address it taking 
into account the mistakes that we have made and the human 
rights or the rights of those people as per worker/employer 
and what then calls on us to do is to be innovative.  To be 
very creative of how we are going to capacitate all these 
10 
people. 
 
And it is not like you know they are done the heads 
or they do nothing they are doing something and we just 
need to – we channel their capability, their knowledge and 
the ability to do the work.  So it is recognised and that is 
precisely what we are now going to be addressing. 
 
The 
good 
thing 
Chairperson 
is 
that 
we 
have 
recognised 
the 
problem 
and 
often 
when 
you 
address 
problems and try to find solutions you should first know what 
you are dealing with.  You must know your business.  You 
20 
must be able to count what you are dealing with and once 
you have done that then the solutions will come quite more 
easily and then able to execute them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr President thus far in relation to 
the issue of deployment we have dealt with elements of the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 98 of 148 
 
hard definition of employment that it is much more than 
recommendation. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we have dealt with the softer 
definition which is that it is recommendation only and we 
have looked at the exceptions that fill the space between 
and I think there has been a fair statement on your part if I 
may comment that regulation in the form of legislation and 
policy reform is – is underway.  But there is an aspect of 
appointments that may well fall right outside the question of 
10 
deployment and that is what has happened in the period 
under review in the past and we have heard some three 
years 
of 
evidence 
of 
appointments 
which 
may 
have 
something to do with a definition of patronage – you have 
used that word patronage and we will come to that in due 
course in a different context.  But if we look at appointments 
particularly within state owned entities in the past ten years 
and I am going to just recite a few for you and ask for your 
knowledge and comment. 
 
In Transnet Mr Molefe, Gama, Ramasobudi, Peter, 
20 
Singh, Sharma, Makwanazi, Shane, Seleke, Mabaso, Denel 
the entire board including the Chair.  PRASA, Eskom, 
Molefe, Singh, Koko, Matshela, Ngubane, SAA, Dudu Myeni, 
Law Enforcement, Arthur Fraser, Tom Moyane, Bernie(?) 
Ntemensa(?), Shaun Abrahams.  Now, clearly it would be 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 99 of 148 
 
unfair to discuss with you all the evidence related to each 
particular appointment but there is a common thread, 
certainly, in the evidence that goes through all of these 
appointments and the dismissals associated with them that 
have been linked with, certainly, a definition of patronage. 
 
If I could ask you, please, what your knowledge 
was of these, what your comment is?  Let me say, if 
anything to do with the deployment policy, at the existence 
of the deployment policy, have any relationship to these 
appointments and dismissals.  I know that I am making a 
10 
cardinal error in the questioning here but this is a 
Commission not a...   
 
And I am rolling up a whole lot of questions... 
[laughs] ...if I carry on the DCJ will take me to task. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is after lunch, Mr Pretorius.  [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [laughs] 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Maybe I will be excused for that 
reason.  What was going on here?  What was your 
20 
knowledge? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes.  That is quite a broad 
sweep, I must say.  It is a broad sweep because each one 
would need to be looked at it on its own merits and you will 
find that a number of those never even featured in the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 100 of 148 
 
Deployment Committee and I will need to do some recalling 
to see if any of those that you have counted - been 
featured in my recollection or not really. 
 
And let us accept Chairperson that some of 
those deployments were done in a particular era and in a 
particular way and right know as we look at that past slate 
whether able to look at it and say we actually need to do 
things 
differently. 
 
Move 
away 
from 
those 
types 
of 
deployment that happened and that ended up being or 
some of them being deployments that were not fit for 
10 
purpose, as I said in my opening statement. 
 
So I would not know be able to particularise 
each one of them because they happened when they did 
and right now I would say the Deployment Committee would 
not have dealt with a whole lot of those.  And I would say 
that the Deployment Committee today would deal with 
matters in a way that we have outlines with professionalism 
and all that, would be the real focus. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now, perhaps the problem lies with 
the question in that it is too broad and too general and in 
20 
that sense to ask for a particular approach, to put the 
least, that is least optimistic.  But the first point is that 
there has been evidence that there were appointments 
influenced by or made by the former President to fit 
another purpose, an ulterior and illegitimate purpose.  Are 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 101 of 148 
 
you aware of that?  Is that evidence known to you? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I was not – you know, as 
I said in my statement and in my – the bulk of my 
statement or affidavit and as I said, you know, some of 
these state capture issues became only evident in time as 
we moved on.  And that is why I even referred to the 
statement by Minister – or let me call him comrade, 
Comrade Fikile Mbalula for purposes of the type of 
evidence I am giving now here.  It was when he mentioned 
in an NEC meeting how he had come to know about his 
10 
appointment. 
 
Even at that time we were not alive to the fact 
there was state capture and there was something horrible 
wrong going on.  So some of these appointments would 
have happened in that course of time and one with 
hindsight then became aware that there was a common 
thread and if you joined the dots you would find that there 
was something that was amiss that was really happening. 
 
So at the time, and some of them would have 
happened even before I was even Deputy President, the 
20 
process had been ongoing and only became evident what 
actually was happening then. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   One interpretation of Pastor 
Wentz(?), Mr President, is that the Deployment Committee, 
certainly, for a significant period of time during these 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 102 of 148 
 
appointments and you were Chair at the time of that 
Committee, as I understand it, was entirely bypassed in 
these appointments.   
 
In other words, the ideal, as it should have 
worked, procedures that you have outlined today were not 
applied and in fact the Deployment Committee was not 
involved.  Was there not then a duty on the Deployment 
Committee to put its hands up and say to the President:  
But 
these 
appointments 
are 
happening 
without 
our 
knowledge.  What is going on? 
10 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
 
There 
were 
some 
appointments where the Deployment Committee was not 
aware.  I will give you a very good example where I was 
involved recently as President of the Republic where in 
finalising certain appointments, I bypassed the Deployment 
Committee myself and on realising that, I immediately went 
to the Deputy President, David Mabuza, and I said:  I 
finalised these appointments without reference to you as 
the Deployment Committee.   
 
And I think I even called the DSG then, Jessy 
20 
Duarte, and said:  I would like to apologise.  But more than 
that, I am even prepared to come to the Deployment 
Committee and explain myself and I did and I said to my 
comrades that ordinarily I should have watched these or 
brought these to you so that you can either make 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 103 of 148 
 
recommendations.  I did not.  I was in a hurry to have 
these appointments.  And it was mea culpa and it was 
accepted as such. 
 
It has happened.  I mean, when I was Chair of 
the Deployment Committee where some deployments were 
finalised without reference and one will admit that and 
accept that.  And on those occasions, I would personally 
go to the President and say:  President, you have short-
changed me and the Deployment Committee here.  We 
were supposed to be primed and informed about this 
10 
appointment and that appointment and it would be mea 
culpa but the appointment had been made and announced. 
 
Now the approach that I have taken now is that, 
it is important to ensure that our structures are involved 
because they play a key-role in all these processes so that 
those types of mishaps do not happen.  Now I would never 
say that it was intentional.  Like, in my case when I did not 
approach 
the 
Deployment 
Committee, 
it 
was 
not 
intentional.  It was inadvertent.  It was one of those errors 
that one made and unfortunately one must be able to own 
20 
up to it.   
 
So there are those that have been made in the 
past, as you would have heard from the evidence that was 
presented to you without reference but I thought I should 
give you a context of how some of these would have 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 104 of 148 
 
happened and they did happen.  We cannot deny that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Insofar as they did happen 
and insofar as you have stated you took this up with the 
former President.  The response was an acknowledgment 
and mea culpa, as you say? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Fortunately or unfortunately, we do 
not have time to go through each one but the general 
principles are clear.   
CHAIRPERSON:   May I ask this Mr President?  Does the 
10 
Deployment Committee ever go public about people it has 
recommended 
for 
appointments 
in 
terms 
of 
speaking 
publicly. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, no.  It never 
goes public. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   It has never been heard 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ...to go public. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT 
RAMAPHOSA: 
 
 
But 
the 
Deployment 
Committee does express its disquiet and dissatisfaction, 
may I say.  In the case that I was involved in, now as 
President, it was members of the Deployment Committee 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 105 of 148 
 
who raised the concern which prompted me, finally, to go 
and address them and that was accepted but they never, 
not a single one ever goes public. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I raise that because and maybe 
that can be dealt with later but you may or may not know 
much about it because I think you would not have been 
Chairperson of the Deployment Committee at the time.  We 
– I have heard evidence in this Commission relating to, for 
example Mr Siyabonga Gama, who at a certain stage, I 
think 2009/2010, at a certain stage was one of the 
10 
applicants for the position of Group CEO for Transnet who 
was suspended as CEO of TFR, which is a division of 
Transnet. 
 
And in the media there was a lot of talk about 
him and that position and various allegations, but there 
were reports in the newspapers of a number of senior ANC 
leaders who reportedly went public saying that Mr Gama 
should be appointed as Group CEO.  And I wondered 
whether that might be because the Deployment Committee 
had recommended him and that was maybe the reaction of 
20 
some of its members who, if they were – if they thought if 
he was not being appointed. 
 
So I thought you might be able to say whether 
they ever go public when maybe their recommendation 
does not seem to be accepted.  But you say, as far you 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 106 of 148 
 
know, they do not? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, Chairperson as far as I 
know they do not and I guess in Siyabonga Gama’s issue, 
he was then seen as a fairly successful CEO and that 
would have been something that was generally accepted 
and he would have been seen as a type of person whose 
capabilities could have been Head of Transnet.   
 
So there would have been side noises, noises 
from the side but certainly not from the Deployment 
Committee because it has always operated as, if you like, 
10 
a rear dart type of committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, just because we have touched on 
it.  When Mr Mantashe gave evidence we have touched on 
it as well.  But this was a case where, at least at a certain 
point, 
there 
was 
a 
black 
candidate 
who 
had 
been 
recommended by the Board of Transnet who was seen as a 
credible candidate but Mr Siyabonga Gama had not been 
recommended. 
20 
 
And the then Minister, namely, Ms Barbara 
Hogan was supportive of the candidate that had been 
recommended by the board but there were reports of 
criticism of why Mr Siyabonga Gama was not the one who 
was recommended or who was not been appointed.  I think 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 107 of 148 
 
Mr Mantashe told me that he had not been aware of a black 
candidate having been recommended because I think, at 
least from his point of view, he was looking at the issue of 
black managers been given opportunities to lead some of 
these parastatals.   
 
So there was that concern to say, who – if the 
problem was that there should be change in the CEO’s of 
parastatals, what was the problem?  Because here was a 
black candidate ...[intervenes]  
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...who appeared to be credible and 
nobody appeared to have issues with him who was 
recommended by a largely black board that had been 
appointed by the ANC government. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what was sort of the issue?  But as I 
say, one, you might not have personal knowledge and two, 
you might not have been a member of the Deployment 
Committee at the time. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Chairperson, I certainly was 
20 
not a member of the Deployment Committee nor was I an 
official at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   But what I can address to you 
is.  There was and there is still a concerted move to ensure 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 108 of 148 
 
that we do have as many black CEO leaders as possible, 
taking into account the diversity that we need to observe in 
our state-owned enterprises.   
 
So that to me does not come as a surprise.  It is 
very consistent with the approach that we also currently 
have that we need to have good diversity.  That need to 
have diversity is so important and of course there are many 
who feel quite strongly about it to a point where they would 
say:  When we appoint somebody who is not a black 
African, they take umbrage but we then say but the call for 
10 
diversity means that we must accept and embrace the fact 
that yes as much as, and we should, have the majority of 
the leaders of our SOE’s and the DG’s in government as 
being black African. 
 
But we should also ensure that there is a 
balance because this country is not depopulated by 
Africans and our policy approach and thrust is for full 
diversity and we need to accept that that diversity will at 
times bringing in people who are not black Africans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  To return to the 
Gondwana[?] interview Mr President.  In the context of 
deployment, once again, and we have now returned to the 
former deployment policies and your application.  You 
spoke about patronage creeping in under the guides of 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 109 of 148 
 
deployment and to the best of my recollection you have 
used that term in this and other contexts.  What is 
patronage?  How does it work? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Patronage would mean that 
you appoint someone who is not fit for purpose.  Who is 
put in a position to advance certain sectional interests.  
Someone who you know will never really be able to execute 
the task properly or someone who is being appointed in 
return for some other favour or some other process that 
needs to be met.  And that is patronage.   
10 
 
And it goes against the grain of what we want to 
achieve because we want people who are fit for purpose, 
who will be able to execute the task, and who are 
appointed without having some interest in mind which are 
sectional or even factional.  So that is what I would 
characterise as patronage.  I have not looked at the 
dictionary meaning recently but that is how – that is the 
political understanding that I would give to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it include appointing somebody 
who, as you have put not fit for purpose, who is not 
20 
qualified of the job or maybe just basic standards, the 
requirements but the other people who meet and surpass 
those standards but particularly one who does not qualify 
because he or she will feel that she or he has been done a 
favour 
and 
therefore 
owes 
the 
appointing 
authority 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 110 of 148 
 
something, loyalty.  Because otherwise, he or she could 
not get this job and therefore the appointing authority 
thinks there are good chances that such a person will be 
compliant.  Does it include that in your view? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Not only be manoeuvrable but 
be compliant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Be compliant ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I think that is what you said 
complaint. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he would be manoeuvrable. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, manoeuvrable and be 
loyal to use  ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   ...who have appointed them 
20 
or who would enable their appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And manoeuvrable in a sense 
where they will do their bidding and they were always be 
there to guard their interest. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 111 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And that is patronage and 
that is the crude diversion of what we want to see in the 
state. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Of course, there is the further self-
perpetuating element to patronage that a patron receives 
favours or even receive financial gain, becomes more 
10 
powerful and then in a greater and more powerful position 
as a patron. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Has this happened and if it has, 
how is it intended to be dealt with? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Well, as we have said and 
which we have dealt with in the African National Congress.  
We recognise that this is behaviour that has ensued and in 
recognising it we have come to the conclusion that we 
need to rid our organisation of patronage.  And in some 
20 
cases we even say certain members join other members 
rather than the ANC.   
 
Those are practices that we want to get rid off so 
that we free everyone in the ANC to know that they can 
stand in their own name and right and be appointed to 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 112 of 148 
 
positions in their own name and right.  And how we do it is 
to inculpate this morality.  And the renewal that we have 
been talking about is part of that process that there needs 
to be renewed morality in the ANC to enhance the integrity 
of the organisation.  And without doing so, the renewal 
process falls flat on its face.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In fairness to those who have given 
the evidence and in fairness to yourself, Mr President.  I 
need to put to you certain passages from the evidence that 
have 
told 
the 
Chair 
of 
the 
hard 
interpretation 
of 
10 
deployment.  In other words, that it goes much further than 
recommendation.   
 
And then I would like to put to you, certainly of 
your own statement, which quite frankly highlights the 
problems that you face or have faced and do face.  The 
evidence of Lynne Brown in relation to SOE boards, more 
than one, was to the following effect: 
“It must be borne in mind that all appointments 
to the boards of state-owned entities must also 
be approved by the African National Congress 
20 
Deployment Committee where after it gets 
approved by Cabinet...” 
 
That was her clear and unequivocal evidence.  
Do you have any comment? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   [No audible reply]  
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 113 of 148 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And this was in the period 2014 to 
2015, at least. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, that is where the 
interpretation of this recommendation process would come 
in.  And that is why I referred to the role of the minister 
because the minister as the executive or it plays a critical 
role because it is the minister who, in the first instance, 
knows and realises that the board’s tenure has come to an 
end.  I need to replenish the members of the board and 
these are the skills that are needed.  I need or we need 
10 
accounting skills, corporate governance skills, financial 
skills, you name it, environmental and so forth and we 
need to have a gender balance. 
 
So it beholds on the minister and I deal with 
this, you 
know, on an 
ongoing basis 
even 
now as 
President.  It beholds on the minister to then come forward 
and say:  I need to replenish the six members on the 
board.   
 
And what she will often have to do or be 
encountered with is.  Have you sourced, have you worked 
20 
out a list, a list of names that should be preferred?  And 
the minister ’s task is to do precisely that and having done 
that, a wise minister would then say:  I have got like 18 
names and I need six or 12 names.  They would then put 
that forward and say to the Deployment Committee – and 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 114 of 148 
 
then the Deployment Committee would say – and quite 
often a pamphlet is set out or an advert for people to 
apply.   
 
And quite often you get many applications and I 
actually appreciate that because it basically means you are 
opening up quite a number of these positions to South 
Africans who can play a role in enhancing governance in 
some of our state-owned enterprises.  And it is the minister 
who must then summarise all that, bring together a 
summarised list or preferred list or summarise and then put 
10 
it forward as a near or shortlist.   
 
And once that has happened, the Deployment 
Committee would say:  Well, we would recommend the 
following.  And sometimes they need six and there is 18, 
they would recommend:  Why do you not go forward with 12 
and then let us see what the selection in government then 
comes up with.  And that is where I would say maybe Lynne 
Brown then says this got to be approved.   
 
But I will, as the former Chair of the Deployment 
Committee, will be able to say clear emphatically that it is 
20 
that recommendation process.  And as you can hear, it 
goes through a number of processes and this may be 
confusing and this may even create doubt in people’s 
minds but that is the actual process as it unfolds and as it 
happens.  And in the end, Cabinet – even with Cabinet – 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 115 of 148 
 
Cabinet then will then be presented with say maybe a near 
final list.   
 
But 
Cabinet 
then 
finally, 
Chairperson, 
deliberates on each of the names where Cabinet has a role 
in deciding because of legislation for that entity.  It 
deliberates on that and some names fall off at Cabinet 
level and some on those lists are sent back to the minister 
or Cabinet says:  Take this back.  We are not about to 
approve this.   
 
And the ministers pull out their hair and be 
10 
frustrated but that is the rigorous role that is involved in 
the selection of those people.  And may I add deployment 
committee level, I know of ministers who have been there 
three times or more just to get a list recommended.   
So it is not as easy as that where you just have a 
list which is underpinned by nefarious intensions, just 
approved, it is quite vigorous and I have known and I have 
seen ministers coming out of that type of process just 
pulling the sweat off their foreheads because it means they 
have achieved something.  It is not an easy process. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, Mr President, now that we are 
touching on the boards and the role of the deployment 
committee on the appointment of boards of SOEs, when 
one looks at what has happened, as the evidence has 
revealed in his Commission over the past two and half 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 116 of 148 
 
years, what has happened in various SOEs, Eskom, 
Transnet, SAA, PRASA, you name them, over a certain 
period, you are bound to ask the question how is it 
possible that in each one of those, these SOEs, the types 
of boards that were there did not do a, b, c, d.  How could 
all of these things happen while they were there?   
And that raises the question of how were they 
appointed?  What criteria were followed in selecting people 
to be put into those boards?  How could these SOEs be 
where they are now or be where they were a few years ago 
10 
but in some we can say now when they were – they had 
boards?  It is like – it is like there is something common, 
common problem with all of these boards that made it 
possible for the SOEs they were supposed to run to be 
where they are and therefore, as the Commission, one of 
the things we – some of the things we want to look at is 
how do we – what recommendations should be made that 
would try and make sure that in the future if anything like 
this were to happen, it should just be one, not all of them. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes, indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So obviously you go back and say who 
were the people who were making appointments here?  
What was going on?  So I am just highlighting that as you 
share with me what the deployment committee’s role is and 
the ministers, there is that question to say the same thing 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 117 of 148 
 
happened with SAA, the same thing happened with Eskom, 
the same thing happened with Transnet, the same thing 
happened with Denel, same thing happened with PRASA.  
What was really going on?  But there were boards?  So you 
might want to say something, I am just saying that those 
are some of the questions we are asking ourselves. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With a view to saying if we do not want 
to see the same thing happening to SOEs again in the 
future, we have got to identify what caused these problems 
10 
and seek to ensure that we recommend measures that will 
make sure that the same problems do not happen.  But as 
you were saying a few minutes earlier, we have to go to 
identify where the problem is or what the weakness is in 
order to be able to make an appropriate recommendation. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Quite correct, Chairperson, 
and I think the work of your Commission is to investigate 
precisely that.  What I can say is that there was massive 
system failure and some of it could have happened 
advertently where certain people were put in certain 
20 
positions 
to 
advance 
certain 
agendas, 
as 
you 
are 
investigating now about the capture of some of those 
entities and – so what you are saying is germane to 
precisely what your Commission is dealing with and some 
of it was so hidden, so masked that you just could not see 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 118 of 148 
 
that a certain individual was there to advance a particular 
agenda and that is why we rely on your Commission to 
ferret the truth out so that we are able to see – but as 
regards going forward and which is where your Commission 
will make recommendations and we will be able to overlay 
some of the form processes that we are involved in, we will 
want to have a completely new chapter, we must open a 
new page and be able to say when it comes to state owned 
enterprises, we have come from a horrible past that 
converted some of really top performing state owned 
10 
enterprises into a shadow of themselves today, so we now 
need to move forward with greater firmness in as far as 
populating not only the boards but the management with 
people 
who 
are 
capable, 
who 
are 
focused 
and, 
Chairperson, we are already beginning to see that.  That 
future that your Commission will point us forward to is 
already beginning to happen.   
We are starting from a low base but already a 
number 
of 
those 
state 
owned 
enterprises 
are 
being 
reformed, rebuilt, re-birthed, if one can use – reborn, that 
20 
is, and a structure which possibly we will talk about when I 
come back as President of the state, the structure we will 
put in place by the state owned enterprise council is 
looking precisely at that so that the rules and regulations 
that we have put in place should not only be theoretical or 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 119 of 148 
 
in name only, they should now be, for lack of a better word, 
practilasised[sic] and implemented. 
So those are issues that are top of mind to me, 
personally, and they are also top of mind to the ANC 
because it is only when these state owned enterprises 
function properly with proper boards and having identified 
South Africans who are loyal to the constitution and to the 
country that we will be able to reform them. 
So basically I would say we no longer want people 
who will be appointed to advance certain agendas and we 
10 
will 
be 
scrutinising 
everyone 
more 
thoroughly 
and 
completely to make sure that we do have people who are fit 
for purpose and the term fit for purpose is what should be 
operative here.  It is an English term but it is a term that is 
very applicable to correct the wrongs of the past so that is 
how we are going to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I mention this for the session that 
will come later probably end of May, Mr President. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the legal team may or may not have 
20 
included this in the scope but I mention it, that one of the 
things that I want to know is, in regard to various SOEs, is 
what the executive know because this the situation was 
deteriorating from a certain point, one expects that there 
would have been regular reports to the relevant minister 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 120 of 148 
 
and to cabinet, you know, to the President and to the 
cabinet to say this is what is happening in that SOE, this is 
what is happening in that SOE and I would be interested to 
know, apart from the President, what was cabinet saying 
about the situation as it was deteriorating over a certain 
period of time?  So that would be very useful because one 
wants also to see whether the situation could have been 
arrested at a certain stage if certain information was 
known to cabinet and cabinet did not act or what the 
position is but I am just mentioning it, that that would be 
10 
for the next session. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I am happy to give you a liner 
on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Because I think we will deal 
with it at the next session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   What we have had in the past 
– and I will just mention that in short, because we will deal 
with it , is that we had a very silo style of work where, you 
20 
know, almost everybody kept to their name and where 
there was no – a cross-dimensional type of collegiate 
involvement and I will be able to tell you, when I come 
back, that we are ridding ourselves of that so that there is 
more of a sharing of knowledge and experience in the work 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 121 of 148 
 
that we all do so that if an experience is being – something 
is being experienced in one SOE that in a particular 
portfolio it should be talked about to see whether it mirrors 
another experience elsewhere so there could be this cross-
pollination but maybe we will leave that until I come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, I might just add that 
although I have approached it in general terms in the 
context of the questions that are now being asked, they 
will be dealt with to the extent necessary in detail by 
10 
individual evidence leaders at the second session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the second point that I wanted 
to make in relation to the role of the Commission is that in 
August 2020 – and in fairness to you we will put these 
statements before the Chair, you made some very strong 
statements in newsletters and elsewhere about corruption 
and what was happening at the time and if I may say your 
language was quite unequivocal in that regard but what 
you did say was that there is no room anymore for 
20 
outsourcing, that the party must take responsibility for 
acting and acting decisively.  
 
And in relation to that statement of yours, Mr 
President, was that or is that if one looks back, the 
evidence has been quite strong and I think you have all but 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 122 of 148 
 
quite frankly spoken about, is that there were improper or 
improperly motivated appointments and you have quite 
fairly made a number of statements and I will remind the 
Chair of those statements that you have made in that 
regard, 
whether 
these 
went 
through 
the 
deployment 
committee or whatever process was followed, ultimately I 
think is – well, I do not think, ultimately I suggest that the 
party must take account of it and take account for it.  Is 
that not a fair proposition? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, it is fair proposition and 
10 
hence 
we 
said, 
even 
in 
our 
conference, 
the 
54 t h 
conference, we say we acknowledge some of these things 
had happened and we even had the courage to say it is 
when we acknowledge them publicly that we would be able 
to take remedial steps to correct them, which is precisely 
what 
we 
are 
involved 
in 
now 
because 
we 
have 
acknowledged 
and 
if 
you 
[indistinct] 
with 
that 
our 
...[indistinct] people of this country.  So yes, we will 
acknowledge and say things went horribly wrong but we are 
here to work with everyone to correct those things and we 
20 
do so with humility, we do so, you know, in a way also by 
bowing our heads and say because we are, if you like, a 
feature of a superstructure of this country, we cannot run 
away from all these matters, we are here to build a 
democratic society in South Africa and that requires that 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 123 of 148 
 
we must confront corruption, state capture and deal with it 
and which is why I am sitting here and which is why some 
leaders of the organisation have also been here, because 
we want to go to the root of it, so – and as I said in my last 
paragraph, my opening statement, that this never happens 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, talking about the fact that the ANC 
acknowledges that there were certain shortcomings, there 
were certain things that it might not have done properly 
and 
so 
on, 
I 
think 
that 
is 
quite 
important, 
that 
10 
acknowledgement but I would like you, maybe before you 
finish today or even tomorrow, I would like you to identify 
the actual areas where you say, as a party, we have done 
our homework, we think this is where we did not do what 
we were supposed to do properly, this is where we did 
something we should not have done, so we identify exactly 
areas where, as a party, you say here we did not do things 
the way we should have and we acknowledge.   
 
So why that is important is because while an 
acknowledgement is good and it should be given its proper 
20 
weight, it is even better if one knows what you are talking 
about because when one knows what the party is talking 
about and says this is where we accept we went wrong, 
then one can look at what should be put in place for the 
future so that there is no repeats.  So it is something you 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 124 of 148 
 
can deal with either today or tomorrow, it is fine, it is just 
that, as I say, it would be useful so that it does not go – it 
does not get limited to simply acknowledging without being 
specific. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   With your kind permission… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   You know, leading up to the 
point or addressing the point you are making, I would, with 
respect, however, say that maybe I should be able to do 
that when I conclude my appearance before you forever 
10 
because there comes a day when I will appear before you 
and never have to do so again. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   And you will not want to ever 
appear again. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I never would want to.  
So I would say maybe when I end my evidence before you 
as President of the Republic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, no, that is fine. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Because quite a bit of it will 
touch also on what we should have done in the state and 
20 
so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, no, no, that is right, it will give 
you enough time also to look at it properly. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 125 of 148 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  The three 
big headings – you in fact reflected in your August 2020 
newsletter of what happened, how did we get there and 
where to from here.  You will recall those headings.   
They mirror precisely the principle headings of the 
inquiry that has been outsourced.  I know that labour law 
does not have a good connotation, but it is here.   
The middle part of how did this happen, could it 
happen?  There seems to be an acknowledgement that 
those things that should not have happened, corruption, 
10 
fraud, state capture, it happened.   
There may be a question of degree and debate but 
for the purposes of the further questions, I am not sure 
how important that is, whether it is decisive of the answer 
to the question, how did this happen, how could it happen 
and only with an understanding of that will the outsourcee 
have the wherewithal and the ammunition really to make 
proper recommendations. 
 
It seems that with your party hat on, with an 
understanding of what happened, already one has moved 
20 
to the stage of making sure that it does not happen again 
and perhaps we will explore that later but I think in 
fairness to yourself, it is appropriate to put at least three 
or four of your own statements to you that have recognised 
problems and if it is – they all follow the same pattern and 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 126 of 148 
 
if you do not mind, I could read them all them out and you 
can ask me to break it up.  In your January 2020 
newsletter you say: 
“We are committed to end the practice of poorly 
qualified individuals being parachuted into positions 
of authority through political patronage.” 
What were you describing there? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Precisely the issue of us 
talking about that – where we do acknowledge that there 
were and may well have been people who were put in 
10 
certain positions when they were ill-qualified and they were 
certainly not really fit for purpose but they were appointed 
and whether it was clear at the time or not, that they were 
advancing certain agendas, you know, would not even be 
an issue then but the ill-qualification seemed to testify to a 
patronage behind that and that is precisely what one was 
addressing and something that we identified as a party that 
we are concerned about and what we want to vent from the 
party because, you see, in the party circle, ANC circles, it 
just fuels and promotes factionalism because people then 
20 
get to know that so and so is ill-qualified for this position 
but they have been appointed.  Why were they appointed?  
And then people started looking behind the reasons 
why they were appointed and it then becomes evidence 
that they were actually appointed to advance certain 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 127 of 148 
 
agendas and that then mutates into the formation of 
factions and groupings that in the end become pitted 
against each other.   
And that is how patronage manifests itself in a very 
ugly way.  That is why it is important to get rid of it so that 
when you look at someone who is appointed you just look 
at a plain vanilla ice cream and say this person was 
appointed because of their capability, for no other reason, 
no flavourant added and all that.  So that is precisely the 
approach that we need to have. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In your August 2020 newsletter to 
ANC members, Mr President, you said: 
“Then are jobs for pals where politicians and 
officials disregard hiring procedures to employ 
family members, friends or associates. Not only is 
this grossly unfair to other prospective candidates 
but it often means that the people employed are 
simply not up to the task.  Public services are not 
rendered, public institutions are poorly managed 
and public funds go to waste.” 
20 
Then if I may put the next to you, in your March 2021 
newsletter you wrote: 
“All too often people have been hired into and 
promoted to key positions for which they are neither 
suitable nor qualified.  This affects government 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 128 of 148 
 
performance 
but 
also 
contributes 
to 
nepotism, 
political interference in the work departments, lack 
of accountability, mismanagement and corruption.” 
So under the first head the problem is recognised.  How do 
these things happen and in the regulatory process that you 
are undertaking, how would you address them? 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   They happened – they have 
happened and the more we talk about them, the more raise 
everybody’s consciousness and awareness of it.  I was in 
the Free State yesterday and after addressing Freedom 
10 
Day occasion, a number of ANC members wanted me to 
greet them and meet them and one of the issues, I had to 
receive a memorandum from a group of four people who 
were representing what they call as a business forum. 
  This very issue is precisely one of the issues they 
raised, they said we have a problem that are jobs for pals, 
people are overlooked, there is no fair way in which people 
are appointed, and this like at the municipal level, and they 
were raising it in a very fervent manner and you could see 
in the way they were raising it that they were deeply 
20 
concerned about this, as they should be because it evokes 
anger and the feeling of being overlooked by the state and 
it also demonstrates unfairness which people recognise. 
 
And I went to a bigger meeting and precisely the 
same thing was also articulated.   
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 129 of 148 
 
So this thing of patronage, of jobs for pals, is 
something that is abhorrent, that people see and notice 
and what should we do about it is a very relevant question 
and we need to be transparent in what we do.   
In our selection processes there needs to be 
transparency so that people can see that everybody has a 
shot in getting either a position, a job or whatever and it 
should never be something that is done in darkness where 
people do not see because when it is transparent, when 
there is a proper process of either election or application 
10 
then nobody needs to worry because if you are selected 
and you are fit for that position and another person is not, 
then you have no real reason for complaint.   
 
So, Chairperson, I may not have the various 
elements of all this now but it basically comes down to a 
simple process.  There must be fairness, there must be 
equity, there must be transparency and openness and there 
must be a very good process that listen, once we have all 
this then we are well-positioned because then we are 
accountable and people can see – and it must also start off 
20 
with being consultative where you are – where everybody 
buys into the system or the process and sees that it is 
going to be fair and without fairness and equity then we 
will never be able to address this malady that exists. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Mr President.  I was 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 130 of 148 
 
going to refer to other evidence that deal with the hard 
definition, as we have termed it, of deployment, not 
recommendation but compulsion in appointments.   
There is the Amathole Municipality case, of which 
you are presumably aware, there is statements by Barbara 
Hogan and there is statements by Dr Ngubane that have 
been given to the Commission but in the interests of time, 
we have covered it in principle, I am going to move on to a 
different topic. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   I would like to comment on 
10 
the Amathole one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, if you would. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Because I thought that that 
case is so descriptive of how we should bring about 
change, that is the appointment of the Municipal Manager. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Or the mayor, I think, 
PRESIDENT RAMAPHOSA:   No, I thought it was Municipal 
Manager. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe, Mr Pretorius, you could say 
something briefly about it so that when the President 
comments everybody can follow what it is about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is a quote from the judgment, 
if I may.  Pickering J: 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 131 of 148 
 
“Be that as it may, one fact emerges clearly from 
VM23…” 
That is probably a document that was put up. 
“…a fact which is not in any way refuted and that is 
that the Regional Executive Committee of the ANC 
instructed the caucus to appoint the 2 n d respondent 
and the caucus carried out this instruction.  This is 
not an example of democracy in action as was 
submitted 
by 
Mr 
Quinn, 
certainly 
not 
of 
constitutional democracy.  I am not sure whether it 
10 
makes a difference whether it was the major or 
municipal manager.  It was the municipal manager.” 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  That one is Mr Chairperson, is so 
relevant in addressing the issues we are dealing with about 
getting a person fit for purpose.  Where a person who was 
fit for purpose, who even in the interview process, clearly 
demonstrated that they know the job and when the other 
one was interviewed, they recognise this lack of capacity 
but still went ahead and appointed, and then they said we 
recognise it but we believe that this person will really 
20 
improve going forward, without adding other elements.  
 
I would put that in a distinct way to say when we 
bring in young people, young people we are saying we 
need to bring young people in, even without experience 
because we need to prepare them to play a role going 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 132 of 148 
 
forward and then we capacitate them.  
 
So that is separate, but in this case the person who 
was finally selected, this did not have the way with all and 
they disregarded a person who was more qualified.  They 
then were unhappy and took the matter to court and the 
court said that person who had been rejected, should then 
be appointed.  
 
Now this is where we bring in courts, to do what we 
should do ourselves as a political organisation.  We should 
be the ones to say this is the right way of doing things.  
10 
This is, these are the people that we should appoint and I 
highlight it because in many ways it points us to a future 
that we must have.  
 
If we recognise that the other person who was 
appointed wrongly had shortcomings, we need to prepare 
them, help them but still appoint the person who is going to 
advance the interest of the people as a whole, and we do 
not do that and finally we are guided by the [indistinct]. 
 
So I am saying you know, that is the outsourcing 
process. 
 A 
variation 
of 
the 
outsourcing. 
 
We 
are 
20 
outsourcing what we should do and when we should 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes and of course and I am not 
talking about this particular case, sometimes when the 
courts do their job, same people are unhappy to say the 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 133 of 148 
 
courts are telling us what to do, how to run certain 
institutions.  
 
So yes, okay.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, one final point on the issues 
we have been discussing today Mr President.  You know 
the eye of a needle document no doubt.  It is a document 
that was composed within the ANC in 2001.  It reads: 
 
“Because ...” 
 
Or part of it reads: 
 
“Because leadership structures of the ANC 
10 
affords opportunities to assume positions of 
authority in government, some individuals then 
compete for ANC leadership positions in order 
to get into government.  Many such members 
view positions in government as a source of 
material 
riches 
for 
themselves. 
 
Thus, 
resources, 
prestige 
and 
authority 
of 
government positions become the driving force 
in competition for leadership positions in the 
ANC.  Government positions also go hand in 
20 
hand with the possibility to issue contracts to 
commercial 
companies. 
 
Some 
of 
these 
companies identify ANC members, that they 
can 
promote 
in 
ANC 
structures 
and 
into 
government so that they can get contracts by 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 134 of 148 
 
hook or by crook.  Positions in government 
also mean the possibility to appoint individuals 
in all kinds of capacities.  As such, some 
members make promises to friends, that once 
selected in its constant government they would 
return the favour.  Peaks and factions then 
emerge within the movement around personal 
loyalties 
driven 
by 
corrupt 
intentions.  
Members 
become 
voting 
fodder 
to 
serve 
individuals interests.” 
10 
Identifying precisely the issues that you have 
spoken about Mr President, and spoken in quite strong 
terms about.  The question is, this was in 2001 and we are 
now 20 years later and in between the problem has been 
identified as you know by a succession of persons in high 
office.   
The question is the public people would want to 
know what is different now?  Why should the public of 
South Africa hear you and say at last something different is 
happening?  What is different? 
20 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  The eye of the needle is quite an iconic 
document in the life of the ANC.  Much as it was crafted, if 
I can put it that way, in 2001.  It was crafted to deal with 
problems that we already saw emerging as we were in 
government and we were already seeing those various 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 135 of 148 
 
tendencies which even Madiba spoke about in successive 
conferences 
in 
the 
49 t h 
conference 
and 
in 
the 
50 t h 
conference.  
 
Going forward, our conferences have dealt with 
these, and what is different now, is that if you like the eye 
of the needle, much as it identified those problems was 
articulating the theory if you like and the ideology that 
needs to be fostered and ensued in the ANC. 
  
What 
is 
different 
now 
arising 
from 
the 
54 t h 
conference, is that we are moving from theory, what we 
10 
have been talking about now has to be attend to the tyre 
hitting the tar.  Where we now say this must now happen.  
It must be practice.  
 
That is why even when the MEC met, was it in 
August?  They said we are drawing a line in the sand, and 
that is not being said lightly.  It was the NEC that after 
much debate and discussion felt that we needed now to 
draw a line in the sand and say this is what the ANC is 
about.  We are an organisation that should return back to 
its founding values.  
20 
 
Its principles adopted in 1912.  We should be the 
type of organisation that is fit to be the leader of society in 
our country.  So that is what I would like to suggest and 
say is different.  The eye of the needle I would say, I am 
glad you have read it, is the most beautiful document that 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 136 of 148 
 
sets out what are the problems.  
 
It provides an in depth analysis, but then it also 
talks about the ideal situation, and the time has now 
arrived for us to grasp the metal and then restore the 
image of the African National Congress.  I would say 
kenako, this is it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Hopefully we will have time 
tomorrow to deal with your August 2020 newsletter, you 
used much stronger language than tar hitting the road, but 
we will leave that until tomorrow.  
10 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we may then, Chair in the 
meanwhile I have received a very stern note from the right 
hand side of the room, your left hand side of the room.  
The office of the president, saying four o’clock and not five 
o’clock.   
MR RAMAPHOSA:  I am at their disposal.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, the president I guess confirms that 
four o’clock or ...[intervenes]  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes, I am at their mercy because they 
20 
know my program more than I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  They control his diary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it is fine, we will adjourn at four 
o’clock then.  But I do not know Mr Pretorius and your 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 137 of 148 
 
team, you are in a better position to make an assessment 
whether tomorrow there may or may not be a need to go 
beyond four, maybe up to five because if there would be, it 
would be better that we talk about it now, so that the 
president then knows that tomorrow he could give up to 
five.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it may be that your own assessment 
is such that we will not need to, but I would like us to use 
as much time as we are able to, subject to the president’s 
10 
situation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I forgot to add in the bargaining 
process, there is an offer to start at 09H30 tomorrow.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that from the president’s side? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is fine.  We could even 
start at nine if that was suitable.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I think it was George Benatshowi 
who said, he has friendly apologised.  He did not have time 
to write a short letter.  He apologised for the long letter, so 
20 
what I will do tonight is concentrate on trying to do 
precisely that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Well, because the president says 
even nine o’clock would be fine, let us start at nine 
o’clock.  
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 138 of 148 
 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  That is fine, yes I will be up here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius, if the president says nine 
o’clock is fine ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I have no answer Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are from the commission, you cannot 
complain.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I will not, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so that is fine.  We will stop at four 
this afternoon and tomorrow we start at nine.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  If we can move Mr 
10 
President to a new topic and that is party funding.  You 
deal with that at page 25 of the affidavit.  Paragraphs 51 
and 52.  I must just say in closing off the first topic, that 
perhaps it would be apposite to talk in more detail at some 
stage if we get the time, about the solutions, that third 
category that are envisaged.  
 
But in the meanwhile if we can move on to party 
funding.  If I have left anything out, you will draw my 
attention to it if you need to Mr President.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 51 the principle has 
stated: 
 
“Despite the absence of an official policy on 
donations ...” 
 
And that is donations to political parties, including 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 139 of 148 
 
the ANC. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  “There is an exception based on the 
ANC ...” ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Expectation.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Expectation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Not exception.  There is an 
expectation, my apologies: 
 
“Based on the ANC constitution, its principles 
10 
and 
its 
values 
that 
the 
ANC 
would 
not 
knowingly accept monies that are the product 
of a criminal act, are offered in exchange for 
favours or from a source known to engage in 
illegal or unethical activities.” 
 
Paragraph 52 reads: 
 
“I 
have 
heard 
that 
evidence 
has 
been 
presented to the commission that suggests 
that the ANC may have been the recipient of 
donations from individuals and companies that 
20 
receive contracts from the state, including in 
instances 
where 
the 
awarding 
of 
those 
contracts are alleged to be or to have been 
unlawful.” 
 
Before we get to examples, if those examples are 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 140 of 148 
 
necessary 
at 
all, 
the 
principles 
are 
stated 
in 
your 
statement, and the breaches are stated in your statement.  
Is 
that 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
principles 
and 
the 
breaches recognised, first question, and second how is this 
being dealt with or will it be dealt with? 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes, the principle is quite clear.  The 
ANC would not knowingly receive funding from tainted 
hands, either tainted in the form of the donor being 
involved in acts of criminality and all that.  So that is very 
clear.  
10 
 
The breaches themselves would happen in a way 
where maybe it is after effect, for instance businesses do 
donate money to all manner of organisations, including 
political organisations, and sometimes when they do do so, 
you do not know that those donations have come from 
entities that have been involved in unlawful contracts.  
 
That presents us with a problem, because the 
money has already been donated and to a political party it 
is often very difficult to say, because the political parties 
are always strapped for cash, especially the ANC, because 
20 
as money comes in it is used for a variety of activities that 
you would say no, refund is possible.  
 
So the issue of the breach happens after the fact.  
However, what we are saying now, is that through the 
political funding act there would be transparency and that 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 141 of 148 
 
is why we say the coming into effect of the political funding 
act, is actually in many ways revolutionary.  
 
It has brought about a change and should be 
applauded by all in sundry.  Much as in the end it is going 
to depend on the fiscus on whether the fiscus will be able 
to support democracy and make sufficient funds available 
to political parties, so that they are not tempted to go and 
receive the funds where these types of breaches could 
happen.  
 
So I would say looking forward Chairperson, we 
10 
have got a saving sort of dispensation that is going to 
enable us to open a new chapter in regard to advancing 
our democracy and the political funding, funding for 
political parties.  
 
It is something that is new and which we should 
welcome and applaud because it rids us of all these 
processes 
where 
political 
parties 
receive 
funds 
from 
tainted entities.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We can deal with the example of 
BOSASA, Eastern general terms.  It must have been known 
20 
to parties in government, in the administration and in the 
executive that BOSASA was heavily reliant on government 
contracts, 
certainly 
the 
Department 
of 
Correctional 
Services, if not other departments as well.  
 
It must also have been known that the ANC itself 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 142 of 148 
 
benefitted, at least in that elections war room and in a 
certain well publicised events that replace the former 
president’s birthday party for example and there were 
others.  
 
It may have been as you say that evidence about 
bribes, those events took place in dark corners.  But how 
could it happen than that the party continued to receive 
benefits from a company that relied heavily on government 
contracts without a thorough investigation of what was 
happening there.  
10 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Chairperson, it did happen.  It is one of 
the anomalous events that did happen.  What is prominent 
in my mind is to say what do we do to prevent it from 
happening, but having said that, let me say let me put on 
the one hand that the political funding act is going to be 
our saviour.  
 
On the other hand we should also say that if for 
instance a company donates money to a political party, and 
it so happens as well that in some way or fashion it does 
business with government, but that that funding is not 
20 
being given to the political party in return for vetting 
contracts and all that.  
 
I 
would 
say 
when 
it 
happens 
openly 
and 
transparently then there should not be any problem, 
because if you are going to give money and you know that 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 143 of 148 
 
it is going to be transparent, even if you have won a 
contract, the transparency itself will be such that it 
prevents you and it will alert the public that you should not 
be seeking favours.  
 
So I put that in a different category.  So the 
transparency, the openness for me is the biggest saving 
and also the limitation to the amount that should be given, 
because the limitation of the amount that should be given 
is going to stop any entity being able to have an 
overarching control over a political party.  
10 
 
But in this case, it did happen and there is no way 
of running away from it or even hiding it, because it did 
happen 
that 
company 
BOSASA 
had 
contracts 
with 
government and which funded an ANC election room and 
all that.  
 
I would say having happened, unless there is 
something criminal about it, which should be pursued 
following the investigation by the commission, we should 
now say how do we make sure that we move to a new 
situation where they do not have a capture of that sort.  
20 
 
That is what I will say.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course Mr President, when it comes to 
a company such as BOSASA, a question that arises when 
one has regard to the number of years that it was enjoying 
contracts 
with 
government 
departments, 
number 
one 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 144 of 148 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Number two, having regard to the fact 
that allegations of its involvement in irregular and corrupt 
contracts in government departments were all over the 
media over a long period of time, a question arises whether 
the ANC which ought to have been aware of whatever was 
in the media, like everybody whether it turned a blind eye 
because it was receiving donations from BOSASA. 
 
That kind of question arises.  
10 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Certainly Chairperson, it does arise 
and in part it is one of those issues that you want me to 
address.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Which I have said that I would address 
at the end.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Because you are absolutely right.  The 
ANC should have been aware that there are all these 
problems in relation to this company, obtaining contracts 
20 
unlawfully, unfairly and all that.  They should have been 
aware.  
 
So it is one of those issues that I will ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You will address, yes.  Yes, well for what 
it is worth I just mention in passing that when I was 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 145 of 148 
 
hearing evidence relating to parliamentary oversight a few 
weeks ago, maybe not a few weeks ago but at some stage, 
I heard evidence which was to the effect that when the 
Chairperson of the relevant, I think correction services 
portfolio committee was doing his legacy report, that is 
what 
I 
understand 
they 
are 
called, 
which 
portfolio 
committees prepare when their term ends, to enable the 
next committee to see what they were busy with, despite 
the fact that when that committee started in 2009, they 
were given the SIU report in relation to correctional 
10 
services and BOSASA, and they looked at the report and 
the whole committee, almost the whole committee felt that 
it was shocking, what the report had about the allegations 
of corruption.   
 
When the legacy report was prepared by the 
Chairperson, he did not mention anything for the next 
committee to take this issue further.  Mr Freund is here 
who was leading evidence he is familiar with that.  So 
there was that, I mean the whole committee says but this is 
shocking.  
20 
 
But during the term not much seems to be done by 
the committee about this, and then when the legacy report 
is supposed to be prepared so that the next committee can 
see 
what 
issues 
should 
be 
taken 
further, 
this 
very 
important issue is not mentioned in the legacy report.  
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384

So, but you will be able to deal with what you are 
able to deal with next time.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the same principles would 
apply to the activities of the Guptas being known as least 
in the media, and the receipt of donations by the ANC from 
the Guptas.  There is evidence to that effect.  It is in the 
Bundle 2 which you have. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Ja.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And perhaps in the morning you 
could deal with the CR17 issue as well, in fairness to all 
concerned and yourself.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes, I will. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Then I would also need to deal 
tomorrow with the Dirco issue.  I do not know if you are 
aware of that perhaps.  We should try and get to the 
affidavits of Nyameko Koso and Francis Maloyi, who have 
submitted affidavits to the commission, stating that shortly 
after their diplomatic appointment to very senior positions, 
20 
Mr Koso to consult general in Toronto in 2013 and 
ambassador Maloyi to Sudan in 2015.  
 
They were sent debit forms by the ANC for monthly 
contributions to the party.  So if we could deal with that 
...[intervenes]  
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 147 of 148 
 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  As well tomorrow.  There are other 
examples the Free State Asbestos scheme and the like, 
which is a particularly glaring example of how things could 
go wrong in procurement, but perhaps two months before it 
would be unfair to ask for an answer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, that is fine.  I think we will 
stop now.  So Mr President, just to re-affirm this.  The 
dates that you had been given for mid-May you can use.  
Other dates for appearance to the commission, before the 
10 
commission.  
 
Other dates will be given, which will be towards the 
end of May.  So the current dates that have been given for 
you ...[intervenes]  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Okay, I can go to the beach and 
everything? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can go to the beach Mr President.  
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will look at other dates towards 
the end of May. 
20 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Parties, thank you very much.  Mr 
President, we will then adjourn and tomorrow we will 
commence as agreed, at nine o’clock the morning. 
MR RAMAPHOSA:  Thank you, thank you. 
28 APRIL 2021 – DAY 384 
 
Page 148 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.
