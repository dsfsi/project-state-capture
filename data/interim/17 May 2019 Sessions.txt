HEARING RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Sello, good morning everybody.  This is no t 
because of me this time that we are starting a few minutes late it is the 
technicians, technical people who needed to sort something out for 
television. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When it is me I take full responsibility.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I know Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We start today with the evidence of Mr 
Francis Callard.  Mr Callard has prepared three – a statement and 
annexures.  They span three files.  The two big arch lever files we have 
taken the liberty of marking BB4[a], BB4[b] the second file and Chair 
you should have together with those files a black folder marked BB4[c] 
I will talk to that folder in a short while.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Black folder. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair the back is black that is the side I 
am using too.  I had no better way of describing it Chair.  And that 
would be BB4[c]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing Mr Callard’s statement 
will be marked Exhibit BB4[a] and the other lever arch file will be 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 3 of 200 
 
marked Exhibit BB4[b] and  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at this juncture may I address myself to 
the black folder if I may call it that still.  The Chair will notice that that 
is marked supplementary statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is – where is that?  It is certainly not on the 
outside. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Unfortunately not.  At page – at page – the 
index of that bundle the description is supplementary statement of Mr 
Francis Quintin Callard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The folder which has got Mr Callard’s supplementary 
10 
statement will be marked Exhibit BB4[c].  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before I ask for the swearing in of Mr Callard 
I would like to address the Chair on BB4[ c]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry I may have pronounced his surname 
correctly.  Mr Callard I am sorry I think I may have said Culland.  I 
apologise. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  File BB4[c] the supplementa ry it has got a 
statement and about nine annexures.  I would like to point out that 
there are no factual allegations advanced in the supplementary 
statement.  The purpose of the statement is to introduce further 
documents that Mr Callard had omitted in his  main statement.  So we 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 4 of 200 
 
will refer to those extra annexures as and when they arise in the course 
of delivery of his testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Against that background 
may I ask for Mr Callard to be sworn  in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Francis Quentin Callard. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence that you will give will be 
the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise 
your right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR: Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes you may proceed.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard you heard me referring to your 
various files when addressing the Chair.  You should have to your left 
two arch lever files at the spine with your name and the first one is 
marked BB4[a] small a and the second is marked BB4[b] small b.  You 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 5 of 200 
 
should have the little folder I will rephrase that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are afraid to say black? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am refraining from giving it a colour Chair.  
Which as I explained to the Chair is your supplementary statement 
together with annexures that has been marked BB4[c].  Each time I 
want you to refer to a particular document I will do so with reference to 
their file to help – to assist us to locate the document.  Now could you 
please turn to BB4 – have before you BB4[a]? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard do you confirm that you have  
10 
submitted a statement to this commission?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if you could please turn to page 001 of 
BB4[a] is that your statement? If you – it should run up to page 59. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at page 59 do you confirm the signature 
appearing at the end of that document is your signature?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my signature. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Sir.  Now before I ask you – 
apologies.  Before I as k you to confirm this statement you have brought 
20 
to my attention that there are a number of corrections you would like to 
effect to this statement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There are. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can we take this opportunity then to give 
effect to those corrections and we shall be led by you in this regard.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 6 of 200 
 
Please refer to the page, the paragraph – the specific paragraph and 
then address yourself to the nature of correction you would like 
effected. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  And for the corrections 
is we could first turn to page 6 paragraph 26.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That date April 2012 should read 
April 2013.  In paragraph 26.1 there is the phrase additional 119E for 
the sake of clarity and to avoid confusion please delete the work 
additional and just read for 119E locomotives.  Further on in this…  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry that second correction is in which 
paragraph? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  26.1 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The second line. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Second line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh additional is the …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes it gives the wrong impression 
that it is added to but I am  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  But I am referring actually to an 
original. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – but all of these are dealt with in the 
supplementary or not yet?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No Chair they are not dealt with in the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 7 of 200 
 
supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay a supplementary – another supplementary will 
be submitted which will point the corrections out?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And my apologies for the number 
of them.  Also in the same paragraph I in correctly spelt the name 
Mahomedy that should read M-a-h-o-m-m-o-d-y.  I would further like to 
correct paragraph 27.1. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard please excuse me.  In relation to 
the change to Mr Mahomedy’s name. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You would like to change it from Moha – 
mmody to  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Mohommody. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mohommody. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mohammed Mohommody. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  E instead of the …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Instead of o 
CHAIRPERSON:  Second o. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry e apologies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you have Mohommody right now and you 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 8 of 200 
 
would like to change it to Mohommody  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Dy ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes thank you.  Please continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Further to paragraph 27.1 please 
change that 119E to 110 19E.  If I may further go to page 9 please at 
the bottom paragraph 40.6.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And that should read to the 
10 
statement para 90 and not page 90.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To page 100 – to page 15 
paragraph 62 the top line.  It is Natasha McMah on and the McMahon is 
spelt incorrectly.  The correct spelling is McMahon.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may turn to page 20 please.  
The top paragraph the numbering is on the previous page there should 
be a full stop on the third line after 38  146 million.  There is a full stop 
missing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That last one is on page?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  20.  And on paragraph?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The top paragraph it is paragraph 
83. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 9 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But it is just before paragraph 84.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay just repeat the correction again?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is full stop after 38 14.14 – 
38 146 million various amendments were requested.  There is a full 
stop [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 38. That is what you mean?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    38.146 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh the full stop comes after?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  After million. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay thank you.  But ther e is also a dot or point 
after 38? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  There should be or? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It should read 38.146 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Mr Callard you may proceed.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  Page 22 please 
paragraph 102.  For clarity that should read in April 2013 just to avoid 
confusion.  Paragraph 102 reads in April 2013.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Paragraph – page 26 paragraph 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 10 of 200 
 
105.4 first line 18 April please change 2014 to 2013.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that at page 26? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is at page 26. Page 27. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just a second. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair have you located page 26?  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I have decided not to continue.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To stop.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are too many. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My apologies they are. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what we should do is a supplementary 
statement or affidavit must be done as soon as possible and then one 
must just find a way to have something on the main statement that will 
indicate that one must go to the suppl ementary statement to get the 
correction.  So – so if it is – if it is fine with you he can continue and 
finish. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise I think as and when as he proceeds with 
his evidence he can just point. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:  Then he will point out. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Again that in regard to certain paragraphs there is an 
error and then – so that will be on the record as well.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As we get to the point where a correction is 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 11 of 200 
 
required particularly in regard to a date because that is very relevant.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will point it out at that juncture.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  When – on Monday we will bring a full 
supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Listed all the corrections that have been 
effected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will then leave the corrections aside for 
now Mr Callard as you have understood we will affect them as we go 
along should the need arise. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we get into your topic for the day could 
you please give the Chair a sense of your bac kground, your service in 
Transnet, positions you have held and basically in brief what you 
functions have been over the period?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  Well I qualified with a 
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1970 and I joi ned 
Transnet in October 1970 as an assistant engineer.  I had some 
services Transnet for a period of some twenty – forty odd years and I 
retired in April 2012.  I was subsequently contracted back to Transnet 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 12 of 200 
 
for a further period of five years.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And I just wanted to say it looks you know only one 
employer? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Many aspects of that employer but 
one employer.  During my some 45 years with Transnet I had vario us 
portfolios in Freight Rail and I gained significant experience in both 
railway signalling, managing major new works projects, information 
technology, 
railway 
operations, 
railway 
infrastructure 
business, 
10 
restructuring and engineering, business strategy a nd I ended my career 
with the development of business cases for major capital projects 
covering the technical and financial justification and the viability of 
those projects.  These business cases covered in particular the 
requirement and the financial sco pe of capital related to the acquisition 
and maintenance of infrastructure locomotives and wagons.  And that 
was really the – what occupied my last five years with Transnet.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just to complete that what are you – what 
do you currently do?  Are you employed?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am currently – I have been 
20 
contracted by MNS Attorneys and I assist them with specialised railway 
expertise in the course of their investigation into the acquisition of the 
locomotives and this was in terms of the mandate given to them by the 
Transnet board of directors.  And I did other trans – another Transnet 
related investigation at the request of Transnet which will appear later 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 13 of 200 
 
in my evidence. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  At you paragraph 1.1 y ou provide 
the scope of your testimony before the Chair today.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is so yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We know that the investigations into Transnet 
are very wide and broad but your testimony will be limited only to two 
main issues.  Could you identify them for the record?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Certainly and those two issues are 
the acquisition of the 100 21 E locomotives and the acquisition of the 
1064 as we will call it diesel and electric locomotives.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Having covered those aspects 
then Mr Callard that brings us to page 3 of your statement.  And you 
start at paragraph 11 with a background to Transnet Freight Rail.  What 
would you like to bring to the Chair’s attention in respect thereto?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would really just like to bring to 
the attention that Transnet is an operating correction Transnet Freight 
Rail it is an operating division of the Transnet state owned company 
Limited and it is recognised as the national Freight Rail carrier in South 
Africa.  It is a – as a Freight Rail company it is a heavy haul Freight 
Rail company it specialises in transportation of freight with an 
20 
extensive rail network which the details are given there.  And with its 
extent it covers some 80% of Africa’s total rail network.  For context to 
what will follow in 2013/14 and I quote the figures from then we trans – 
Freight Rail transported 208.5 million tonnes which was made up of I 
will round the figures 53 million tonnes of export iron ore through  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 14 of 200 
 
Saldahna.  We will not be addressing that at all.  62 million tonnes of 
coal through what we call the export coal line through Richards Bay but 
of particular importance which will follow will be the 86 tonne – million 
tonnes of general freight and where that moves.  This is quite extensive 
it represents some 14% of South Africa’s rail tonnage.  The details of 
the network below but what I would just like to bring more to the fore is 
that we have – Freight Rail has approximately 2132 locomotives at that 
time and that is relevant to the 1064 process.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have included in your supplementary 
statement some pictures and if I may call for annexure A to the 
10 
supplementary affidavit and if you could explain that in relation to your 
paragraphs 13 and 14 just so we have proper context before we deal 
with your evidence? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  If we could… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair that will be in your BB4[c] at page 5.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  C you said he?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  BB4[c] page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 5.  Ja.  Thank you.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are at page 5. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We are on page 5. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure A. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  I would like to point 
out that this slide depicts the broadly the network as I described it.  On 
the left hand side we will have the iron ore line.  On the right hand side 
we have the coal line.  The orange network is the general freight 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 15 of 200 
 
network and the blue network is the branch line.  What I would 
particularly like to highlight from this because it becomes relevant 
later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Is the concept of axil loading.  The 
iron ore line you will see has an axil loading of 30 tonnes and the 
concept of the axil loading i s the picture on the top left hand corner 
where it relates to the weight of the axil on the rail and the point 
contact.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The rail network, the rail 
infrastructure and supporting infrastructure is designed to support an 
axil loading mass. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And this relates to the weight of 
the locomotives and the weight of the wagons.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And this is a – a one delineation of 
the network.  The coal line as you will see has an axil loading of 26 
tonnes per axil.  The general freight network which is the brown has an 
20 
axil loading of 20 tonnes per network and the branch line – sorry the 
one in the statement has a slightly is between 16 to 18.5  tonnes per 
axil which we will see on the – towards the bottom right hand side.  Of 
critical importance to this is that a locomotive and or wagon may not 
traverse that part of the network with a lower axil loading than it has.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 16 of 200 
 
So for example a 26 tonne locomotive cannot traverse the 20 tonne 
general freight network.  A 20 tonne wagon or locomotive from general 
freight cannot traverse a branch line with an axil loading of 18.5.  The 
converse of course is different because a wagon or locomotive with a 
lesser axil loading cannot of course traverse a network with a higher 
axil loading.  So you can put a 20 tonne wagon on a 26 tonne network 
that is not a problem.  It is the going down that is the problem.  A 
distinction which is not on the slide is that locomoti ves for the general 
freight network are at 22 tonnes per axil.  This is a specific 
dispensation for the locos only it does not hold for the wagons.  The 
10 
importance of this slide is it delineates specific boundaries of 
operations for various categories of r olling stock that boundary 
definition will become more clear and important later.  If I may move to 
the second slide. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The network is also characterised 
by the type of traction across the network.  We ha ve various types of 
locomotives.  The primary distinction between are they diesel or 
electric and the electrics are further sub -divided into categories of are 
they direct current locomotives which are the older type, alternating 
20 
current locomotives are the  newer type and even the new locomotives 
are differentiated into 25 kilovolt alternating current or 50 kilovolt 
alternating current.  Of prime consideration here for the general freight 
network is the earlier locomotives were of one particular voltage.  So  a 
3KV D3 locomotive could only traverse what we would see as the purple 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 17 of 200 
 
line I – purple blue line and it would be limited to that.  A 25KV AC 
locomotive – sorry if we could – could only travel a 25KV network and it 
could not move over to a DC network.  Th e newer locomotives and 
particularly those are the 1064 the electric locomotives were specified 
as dual voltage locomotives enabling them to traverse both the direct 
current and the alternating current networks the DC or the AC network 
giving them far greater operational flexibility.  I think it goes without 
saying that a diesel locomotive can go anywhere subject to its axil 
loading. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I – if I may go back to your Annexure A and 
10 
just so we understand as you go through your testimony if we could go 
back.  Would it be a correct summation of your testimony thus far that 
in order to transport coal you require a 26 tonne axil to transport coal?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes a feature of that is the more 
powerful the locomotive the more heavier it has to be.  That has to do 
with how it – the wheels grips the rail so the more powerful the 
locomotive the more heavier.  Given that the coal line runs 200 wagon 
trains they have an approximate weight o f between 16000 or 16500 
tonnes.  They have more powerful locomotives than those which 
operate on the general freight line at 22 tonnes per axil.  So there is a 
20 
very definite power difference between the types of locomotives over 
the various sectors of the network.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  At page 4 you then provide a very 
brief history of the acquisition of locomotives for – by Transnet in 
particularly for freight.  Could you work – could you take the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 18 of 200 
 
Chairperson through that aspect of your testimony?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly and I will talk to the – 
the paragraphs very briefly.  Around 2008/9 I was tasked by Mr 
Siyabonga Gama then the Freight Rail Chief Executive to develop a 
locomotive fleet plan for Freight Rail.  If I may add that the last time we 
had bought a locomotive for ge neral freight was in 1992.  So there had 
been a significant period before since we had bought locomotives for 
general freight and replacement was becoming quite urgent.  And I 
developed this initial fleet plan with concepts – fleet plan concept with 
various experts from Freight Rail.  In 2010 I handed over responsibility 
10 
for this fleet plan to one Vilva Nair a colleague a senior manager who 
developed a five year plan for locomotives which was matched to 
market requirements.  The reason it is matched to mark et requirements 
the locomotives are expensive assets you only want as few as 
necessary to convey the related tonnage.  One does not want to have 
too many locomotives or too few so market requirements and 
locomotives need to be very closely matched.  In 2011, April 2011 this 
five year plan was presented to the Transnet board and it recommended 
that we procure 776 locomotives and it was predicated that the market 
would then be 155.8 million tonnes over this five year period.  I 
20 
contrast this to the tonnage the General Freight currently conveyed 
then which I mentioned in earlier of 86 million tonnes.  One can see 
there was a significant growth.  The board approved this modernisation 
plan at a cost then of some 23.6 billion subject to submission of a 
holistic funding plan given the significant amount of money.  There was 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 19 of 200 
 
then around that time a change in the strategic thinking within the 
organisation.  Because the railways are a very capital intensive 
industry we had the policy or strategy of responding to market  demand.  
That is if a mine were to open up a new mine for example on the coal 
line one would say okay if you going to open up this mine in five years’ 
time we will increase the capacity of the railways and we will procure 
the rolling stock and the wagons to meet your requirements when the 
mine is – is ready for production.  But we had also lost significant 
traffic to road since 1992 and we were – it was a strategy from the 
Department of Public Enterprise that we return road traffic to rail and 
10 
there was considerable traffic, rail friendly traffic that was running on 
the road.  This led to the change in strategy that instead responding to 
market demand to change the strategy create the infrastructure and 
procure the assets to create capacity to absorb demand  that was out 
there so that we were not seen to be holding up infrastructure or 
industry in conveying traffic but to say we had the capacity to create 
traffic.  It was this creating capacity - as I said – to capture the rail 
friendly traffic that was already conveyed by road and (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Callard.  Just the change of strategy …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The old one where you would respond to market 
demand … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is something that is probably applied across the 
Board or most of the time but I am wondering where you change it.  I 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 20 of 200 
 
mean in terms of the old one as you pointed out if there was somebody 
who wanted to open a coal mine you would respond to that and then 
make sure that there would be a railway line and so on.  So if you 
changed it how would that work at a practical level? You would not 
build a railway line in the hope that somebody would – would open …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, no, not at that (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how would it work?  At practical level how would it 
work? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may then differentiate for – for 
a coal mine for example there, there would be joint long term planning 
10 
because a coal mine also takes five  years or three or four years to 
come to fruition.  One would plan the railway links and the assets over 
a significant period and have them all in place so that when the coal 
mine started production one would have the locomotives available and 
the wagons available to be able to transport the coal for example but 
there was a lot of criticism from industry of the organisation at the 
time.  Industry general – the maize industry, the cement, the container 
industry, the fuel petroleum products alliance which sai d we want to 
move traffic by rail but you do not have sufficient wagons and you keep 
on telling us you do not have enough locomotives.  It is there that the 
20 
strategy came well we need to buy more to create this capacity to 
absorb what the market was asking  us to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that – that is responding to a market demand?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We were slow to respond to the 
market demand if I could put it that way (intervenes).  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 21 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because I am trying to understand the distinctio n 
between the two.  If you – if there are complaints from the market that 
you do not have capacity and they would actually like to make use of 
your – your company and so on and as a result of those complaints you 
want to do something about it to address th e capacity issue you are 
responding to the market demand – as I see it.  So – so I am trying to 
understand how a company such as a State Owned Entity would at a 
practical level not respond to a market demand – market demands but 
kind of create – I do not know whether create it depends. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I wish I could answer your 
10 
question in the – in the detail it requires Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But the market demand strategy to 
create capacity essentially it said we would double our available 
capacity …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In seven years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So where our average tonnage had 
been gradually increasing from 70 around the 70s to the 80 million ton s 
20 
of general freight … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I stress this with the general 
freight traffic.  The market demand strategy said we are now going to 
create capacity to double this tonnage over a period of seven years.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 22 of 200 
 
Now that is a significant increase and that was creating capacity to 
absorb whatever was there in the market.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So was it this that you would look at the current 
situation and the market and then make a projection to say over the 
next 10 years what is likely to be the position.  Is the position likely to 
be that there is going to be a lot of demand and we must then make 
sure that when that demand reaches that level we are ready in terms of 
our capacity? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not in my statement bu t if I 
may give …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Context to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was around this time I have said 
the tonnages – were conveying about 14 percent of South Africa’s 
volumes.  Around this time  various studies were done of what is the 
total transport market in South Africa and that was round that time.  It 
was around 900 million tons.  That market was then further subdivided 
into what is traffic exclusively for road – which rail cannot compete in - 
what market is exclusively rail – which road cannot compete in – and 
20 
then there was two segments in between.  That of the general freight 
which we were doing by rail which we were in competition with road and 
that of the general freight traffic which w as carried by road which we 
said should be done by rail and we could capture that by rail.  This was 
part of that holistic thinking and this increase – predicted growth – from 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 23 of 200 
 
the 80 million tons to this 170 million tons was predicated on capturing 
that rail friendly traffic in the total market that was currently conveyed 
by road within this greater holistic transport market of 900 million tons 
currently in South Africa and in that we included traffic which was 
conveyed by private companies.  For example ma jor retailers have their 
own transport fleet and we could not get into that market but then there 
were road transport operators who were operating for others and we 
wanted to compete and get their slice of the pie – if I may put it that 
way – and that was how the change in the strategy came about.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Hopefully it will be clearer later on.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair it will be clearer.  We will get to – if I 
may point out – page 18 where we briefly touched on this market 
demand strategy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But he deals with it more by way of criticism.  
So hopefully it will crystallise at that point Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you and if you could just complete then 
your – this section … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sure.  Thank you.  Coming back 
20 
then this market demand strategy impacted the locomotive fleet plan 
and in November 2011 I personally learnt that Mr  Gama had presented 
this fleet plan to the Department of Public Enterprises  and the number 
of locomotives had – the locomotive fleet plan was extended from five 
years to seven years - which forms the basis of the 1  064 plan fleet 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 24 of 200 
 
plan – increase from 776 to 1 064 and the tonnages had increased to – 
from the 155 million tons as at paragraph 19.  They had now increased 
to this 176 million tons.  So effectively over a seven year period we 
were predicating a virtual doubling of the growth of general freight.  A 
significant hockey stick effect if you consider the relatively flat line w e 
had been on and this very rapid increase that we were forecasting.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You indicated that your testimony before the 
Chair today covers two specific acquisitions.  The acquisition of 100 
and the acquisition of the 1  064 locomotives? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct, yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  From page 5 you then start with that part of 
your evidence relating to the acquisition of the 100 locomotives and we 
are now at page 5 paragraph 23 and if you could take us through that.  
We understand from your statement that you will deal with this aspect 
of your testimony under four distinctive headings which you set out in 
paragraph 24.  If you could take the Chair through – through these 
issues that you would like to highlight insofar as the acqu isition of the 
100 locomotives is concerned. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja, thank you.  The acquisition of 
the 1 064 locomotives did not proceed as smoothly as we had initially 
20 
hoped and there were some significant delays.  Those delays I will talk 
to later - but if we can accept for the moment that the program was 
delayed – because of this delay in the program and there was an urgent 
need for (indistinct) power it said where can we get locomotives from.  
Now there were locomotives on the coal line that w ere available – could 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 25 of 200 
 
be used on areas of the general freight network but we said to release 
those locomotives we need new locomotives for the coal line.  These 
old locomotives or these locomotives in the coal line that could be 
released were at the end of their economic life and they were going to 
be a temporary stopgap into the general freight network while we 
bought – were awaiting for the delivery of the 1  064.  The aim – there 
was also a need requirement – vision – to standardise the locomotive 
fleet on the coal line - and if I use the coal line phrase please that is 
generally the line from Ermelo Coal Fields through to Richards Bay – to 
standardise that fleet with dual voltage locomotives.  As we saw on the 
10 
network diagram - and perhaps I did not make it clear.  I should have – 
that the DC Network stops at Ermelo.  The alternating current network 
then goes from Ermelo to Richards Bay and we had to change 
locomotives at Ermelo.  This introduced significant deals in the 
operation.  Dual voltage locomotives which could travel right through 
the coal mine through to Richards Bay Terminal and back to the coal 
mine would significantly improve the efficiency of operations.  Hence 
we wanted to standardise the fleet on dual voltage locomotives.  That 
was the genesis and thinking behind 100 locomotives for the coal 
export line and I will show in this one that I prepared a case for these 
20 
100 locomotives.  That it was unilaterally changed by Transnet Group 
Executives and/or Freight Rail’s Supply Chain Services to favo ur CSR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry and for the record CSR is China South 
Rail? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  China South Rail. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 26 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  There was a material – the 
changes and implications were material and I  submit that the 
representation that was made to the BADC Committee in respect of the 
business case I prepared as it had been changed was misleading in 
certain respects.  It is also my considered opinion that the confinement 
to CSR was flawed in concept an d execution and the upfront payments 
to CSR before the first locomotive was delivered were excessive.  That 
is where I wish to go to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then can you provide us the sequence 
10 
of events as you set them out from your paragraph 26?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Certainly, 
thank 
you. 
 
The 
sequence of events – and if I could go there to 26.  I prepared a first 
business case in April 2013 – and please that is 2012 which should 
read 2013 – for additional locomotives for the – for the coal line.  
These were to be dual voltage locomotives and the initial business case 
that I first prepared in April was that they go out on open tender.  There 
were various iterations of this business case.  It went through changes 
from being initially 100, then it was up to 160 with options to 160 and 
down but the key element is of this is that in September/October  2013 I 
20 
was requested to update this business case for 100 19E type equivalent 
electric locomotives and 80 diesel export locomotives for the coal – 
coal export line. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may interject there.  The 100 19E type 
equivalent electric locomotives are those what we call the 100 coal line 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 27 of 200 
 
locomotives? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Those are the 100 coal line 
locomotives yes.  The phrase 19E equ ivalent … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Has particular importance because 
it was the way of specifying that it was both a dual voltage locomotive.  
That it had a particular axle loading as we have seen on the slide of 26 
tons per axle and that it had a particular power requirement given that 
it was to be used for the coal line.  It needed to be a higher power 
locomotive than those we had previously used on general freight.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And why do we use the 19E type?  What do 
we mean by 19E type?  Is it reference to a specific locomotive because 
you are looking for 100 19E type equivalent?  Could you explain that 
phrase? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  The – we had 110 
locomotives on the coal line of a 19E type.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We sought to have equivalency of 
that type with full interoperability with those 110 locomotives.  110 plus 
the 100 would have brought us to 210 locomotives as a coal line fleet 
20 
standardised was the operational vision. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That was the aim of the business plan?  Okay.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So this memorandum was on a – 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 28 of 200 
 
dated 15 October.  It went throu gh virtually everybody in the 
organisation.  It was signed by Mr  Gama, by the Group Supply Chain 
Officer then – Garry Pita – by the General Manager Capital Integration 
– Mohammed Mahomedy and also by then the Group Chief Financial 
Officer – Anoj Singh – and this is referenced in Annexure 1.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If we could then just quickly turn to Annexure 
1 because I think beyond this point you deal with specific items arising 
therefrom.  Annexure 1 Chair would start at your page 70 of BB4A.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I wanted to say something before you started.  
So you will have to repeat what you just said.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will.  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think in the supplementary statement that you will 
prepare just make sure that there is something that g ives the first 
names of the person that the witness gives in paragraph …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  26.1 because it refers to Singh …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just to Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we do not know - he has now said it is Anoj –
Mr Anoj Singh and then three was Mahomedy and I was wondering 
whether it was Mr Mohammed Mahomedy. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which he has now confirmed but I think he is 
mentioning them for the first time.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is important that the supplementary affidavit 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 29 of 200 
 
clarifies who they really are. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will definitely do so Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if then for the record if in relation to 
paragraph 26.1 I may  request Mr Callard to confirm the full names of 
the people referred thereto for purposes of his testimony for the 
remainder of the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You refer in your first line to Gama.  Could 
you please provide his full name?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Certainly. 
 
It 
was 
Mr Siyabonga Gama – Chief Executive Transnet Freight Rail at the 
time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the third line from the bottom of 26.1 you 
refer to Group Supply Chain Officer – Pita.  Could you provide his full 
name? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  Garry Pita – Group 
Supply – Group Chief Supply Chain Officer. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And to Mahomedy where we effected a 
correction could you provide the full name?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mohammed Mohamedy then Group 
General Manager Capital Integration.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And as the Chair pointed out is that the 
person who testified yesterday the current Acting CEO of Transnet?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 30 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And lastly you refer to Singh? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes and that was Anoj Singh then 
Group Chief Financial Officer. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and then you refer to Annexure 1 which 
is where I had requested that we go to and Chair that is at page 70 – 
7-0 – and these people you have named you state all signed this 
memorandum?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if we could turn to …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Or I did. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To page 94 of that Annexure A?  It will appear 
to be a signature page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  You first said let us go to page 70?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  7-0 that is where the document starts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the memorandum, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 94 which is the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The last page of that memorandum is a 
20 
signature page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And these are the signatures of the people 
you mention at 26.1 signed this memorandum?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 31 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the memorandum was then prepared for 
submission to who? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was prepared for submission to 
the Transnet Board and Acquisitions and Disposals Committee which we 
refer to as BADC – B-A-D-C. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  B-A-D-C.  From paragraph 27 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The memorandum starting at page 70 
which is the one we have just been to is it the memorandum referred to 
in paragraph 26.1 of your statement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your name does not appear at the end of - of the 
document and that is what I want to – to clarify because if it was 
prepared by you normally one would expect your name at the end.  You 
prepared it for the people who were going to sign it and then they 
signed it but you – you prepared the memorandum.  That is what you 
mean? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That – that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In – in some cases our name 
appears at the bottom but generally it does not appear on the back 
20 
page.  We prepare it for signature …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  By the relevant officers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  This particular one does it appear at the bottom 
or something?  I just want to … 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 32 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No – no it does not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to – I wanted to be able to – to understand 
because otherwise one looks at it and page 70.  It says a memorandum 
from Mr Brian Molefe and – so okay.  You – you prepared it for – for 
them? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  I was the author of this 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Prime author. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thanks Chair.  If I can then pro bably add 
another question to that.  The process is you prepared the document, 
you submit to the relevant senior people for consideration and if in 
agreement therewith they append their signatures.  Would that be a 
correct (intervenes)? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
Thank 
you 
and 
for 
the 
record 
this 
memorandum is dated 15 October 2013.  So are we to understand that 
the three – the four people who signed – Mr Gama, Mr Pita, 
Mr Mahomedy, Mr Singh – technically were making this prop osal to the 
20 
BADC? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At paragraph 27 of your statement then you – 
you start with the various nitty -gritty of this memorandum.  Can we start 
with 27 and we will cross refer to the relevant pages in the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 33 of 200 
 
memorandum as and when the need arises and take the Chair slowly 
through the issues that you raise here.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly, thank you.  The key 
points from this memorandum were that it now recommended the 
confinement to Mitsui & Co African Railway Solutions – which we also 
refer to commonly as MARS sometimes Mitsui.  Those names are used 
interchangeably in various documentation – MARS and Mitsui – and this 
confinement was predicated on compatibility with the existing 110 19E 
type locomotives that we had on the coal line.  Availability of current …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You read 110 is that because of a correction?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was one of the corrections, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  (Intervenes). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We already had a fleet of 110 and 
we wished to increase the same fleet by 100.  For that or with that 
there were facilities available for immediate production without having 
to establish new facilities.  Because it was a known locomoti ve and 
currently in use and it was relatively new locomotives having been 
procured only a few years previously there was no need to develop a 
20 
specification design and to go through a type testing process before 
approval of the locomotive and prototype testing.  If I may mention 
there that electric locomotives or locomotives for freight rail are not 
bought off the shelf.  Electric locomotives particularly are bespoke 
locomotives.  They are designed specifically for our gauge and to our – 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 34 of 200 
 
to our requirements and they go through an extensive design, design 
review, design sign off phase.  From that they then go through the 
manufacture of the first prototype for a new type.  That first prototype 
is then put through extensive performance tests.  Only then is appro val 
given to proceed with further manufacture of two or three to make sure 
all the bugs are ironed out and only then is full production effectively 
authorised. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This saving in design type testing 
and type of approval talks to that …  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And 
it also 
would give 
us 
confinement to MARS the fastest possible delivery.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can we – just so we understand.  You 
indicated earlier that there were certain trains or locomotives that were 
reaching the end of their economic life …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And which would have to be – had to be 
replaced.  You just now pointed out to the Chairperson that you – you 
already had 110 new locomotives in fleet. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you explain how many you required to be 
retired?  When were these 110 acquired when you prepared this memo?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Two parts to that question and if I 
may … 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 35 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For the moment can you recall when these 
110 were acquired? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The 110 were required - the 
specific dates are there.  It was between 2009 to about 2011.  I think 
the contract was signed in 2008 but pl ease … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is fine. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is subject to absolute 
correction. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just – just so we are clear.  That is not 
the lot that was – that was reaching the end of its economic life?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, no.  The lot that were reaching 
the end of the economic life were what we called the 7E Series – the 
7E1, 7E2 and 7E3 Series – a completely different type of locomotive.  A 
DC only locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You – you deal with a – the nature of 
this 19E type locomotive at page 7 paragraph 27 and the relevance of 
that particular type of locomotive to the coal division …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am sorry.  Page 7 paragraph 29?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paragraph 29. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can we – can you give us an appreciation of 
this 19E type locomotive and its relevance to the coal division?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  By (intervenes) as a 
19E type equivalent locomotive we were in  fact specifying that it would 
be a locomotive of a 26 ton axle loading.  That it would have of the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 36 of 200 
 
order of at least 311 kilonewton tract of effort and those are the two 
main characteristics which I had dealt with on this slide and it would be 
dual voltage. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now you contrast that with reference to – to 
your Annexure 1 - at paragraph 63 of Annexure 1 to another type of 
locomotive.  You call this one a 20E.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you give us an understanding - and your 
paragraph 63 of Annexure 1 where this is dealt with is at page 81.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay.  Just give me those references 
10 
again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I apologise Chair.  Mr  Callard has explained 
to us the 19E and its relevance to the coal division and the fact that it 
has to be a 26 ton locomotive.  In the next paragraph he then contrasts 
it with another type of locomotive which is a 20E.  The detail of that 
comparison is contained in Annexure 1 at paragraph 63.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexure 1 is in the same bundle?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 1 starts at page 70 and the specific 
paragraph where he does this comparison is at page 81 of that 
document and in particular paragraph 63.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you and if you could then explain to us 
the differences between the two and why it is necessary to do this 
comparison. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 37 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Certainly, may I start at the 
bottom of page 80 please. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes, eight zero? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Eight zero, at the bottom of page 
80. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     At the bottom of page 80 under 
58A type we described there essentially what I said earlier that the 
19ER 269 axle and this says why it was not part of the 1064 process, 
because the 1064 process for general freight locomotives are 22 tons 
10 
per axle. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Setting out why it’s a different 
one.  It also sets out delivery.  Then if the argument is accepted that 
one needs the locomotives what business case is required to do will 
say first identify and we agree on the need, we then have to assess the 
various procurement options, which is what point 59 at the bottom of 
page 11 sets out to do, analysis and implications of procurement 
options, and so we reason to four, the first was go out on tender, we 
could do nothing.   
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We could confine or extend the 
contract, we explored the option of extending the current 21E contract 
for 95 CSR locomotives, or we could lease locomotives, those were the 
procurement options which we set out to explore.  Paragraph 60 on 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 38 of 200 
 
page 81 spells out the options of going out on tender, because of the 
time and the urgency which there was and the need to catch up on the 
1064 we argued against going out on tender for this.  The do nothing 
option we come particularly if I may then to 63, paragraph 63 where we 
explore extend the current 20E Contract to 95 CSR  locomotives and 
explain at length, in some length in this paragraph why the 95 CSR 
locomotives were not suitable nor was it appropriate to extend the 
contract or confine their contract to CSR for their 95 locomotives 
because for the prime reason it was no t a 22 ton per axle locomotive, it 
was not a heavy haul locomotive, it was not designed for the coal line, 
10 
it was specified for general freight, in short it was not suitable for the 
coal line, therefore we can’t move in that direction.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So would my understanding then be correct 
that insofar – as much as we had a manufacturer supplying us with 20E 
or having recently supplied us with 20E it’s not 20E we required for 
coal purposes, it’s specifically 19E type.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you.  You may then proceed with the 
argument you made to – let me see the argument advanced in the 
memorandum regarding the basis for confinement which is what you 
20 
selected and in doing so perhaps it might be a good  place to start at 
page 82 where you give a definition of confinement as appears in the 
procurement procedures manual of 2012.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Certainly. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 39 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Because ...(intervention)   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Sorry if I may, before we go there could you 
just briefly state what are the requirements for confinement to be 
involved in acquisition?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  In the business case where we 
were now motivating for confinement  pro-electrical motors this 
confinement has to be in terms of the procurement procedures manual 
of which an extract is set out under 67 on page 82, there are a number 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m just thinking Ms Sello that we have had a few 
10 
witnesses tell us about what the requirements for confinement and 
whether we shouldn’t just go ahead and then he will talk about them 
and we would know.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     We would be happy to because we need to 
go into a bit of detail on the requirement f or confinement, when we deal 
with the business case that was eventually signed off and whether or 
not it complied with confinement, but if that evidence has been led 
before we can perhaps go into the various ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think at least, no less than two Transnet 
witnesses have dealt with it you know.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   That’s more than enough Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so I know exactly what it is and what the 
requirements are. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    We are happy then to go to th e next point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously if there is a specific requirement that 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 40 of 200 
 
needs highlighting because of what he would be saying later on that 
can be highlighted but we don’t need to spend too much time on it.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Thank you Chair.  You give the summary of 
the business case that is advanced in Annexure 1 and you state there 
that the memorandum recommended confinement to Mtzewe for the 
acquisition of the 19 E-type locomotives. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Could you then take the Chair through the 
basis on which you recommended confinement to Mtzewe?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Certainly, I won’t deal with, 
10 
briefly there was (a) the urgency, which is addressed in the 
memorandum, the suppliers, limited number  of suppliers we addressed, 
for reasons to Mtzewe we talked to the reasons at standardisation and 
compatibility with the existing goods and services, considering that we 
already had 110 and we wanted to just expand the current fleet, so we 
argued, the memorandum argues that C was fully met.  D we spoke to 
the point where the goods or services are highly specialised and largely  
identical to those previously executed and it ticked all those boxes.  
One of the things which we argued, it also gets in the 95, i s no 95 loco 
had been delivered, it may have been on order but it had not been 
20 
delivered so it had not been executed, it did not tick that box, but for C 
and D plus the speed with which they could be procured with the 
facilities already being available it had lessened the urgency if that’s 
sufficient summary. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And so the basis for confining to Mtzewe 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 41 of 200 
 
was that listed in paragraph 69 at page 83.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Of the Annexure to say these are the 
grounds on which we believe that in addressing the urgency we are 
able to do so through confining to Mtzewe.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct, and they speak to the 
elements earlier because it was a known locomotive, known type, we 
did not have the design testing and prototyping issues, we had been 
through the teasing phase, the production line was available in point B, 
true end drivers were already trained, there was no need to cross -train 
10 
them for an new type of locomotive and we argued that  confinement 
was the quickest delivery making use of existing facilities.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Do you know – you prepared the 
memorandum, it was signed as you indicated, do you know what 
happened to this memorandum thereafter?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes it was at the BADC meeting 
it was withdrawn by Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what meeting was it withdrawn by him?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Mmm ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Mr Callard, Mr Callard! 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Yes? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     The Chair has got a question for you.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    I was just getting the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are looking for it okay no that’s fine.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    I believe the BADC meeting was 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 42 of 200 
 
on the – yes on the 21 s t of October was the BADC meeting, and 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I think that’s the word I was looking for.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     BADC if I may Chair, if the Chair has regard 
to paragraph 32 I think it’s how employees at Transnet t end to deal with 
– it’s BADC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes BADC yes, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes and they in short call it by that.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    The Board Acquisitions and 
Development Council meeting was held on the 21 s t of October. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    This memorandum having been 
signed beforehand through all these parties was ready for presentation 
to that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was at that meeting ready, 
actually not to talk to this memorandum but to the 1064 Locomotives, 
Mr Gama was not at the meeting, Mr Jiyane was going to come, I was 
on standby. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may just interject you say Mr Jiyane and 
20 
who now is Mr Jiyane? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry, Mr Thamsanqa Jiyane.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And he was? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Chief Procurement Officer, 
Transnet Freight Rail. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 43 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So are you stating that he was to talk to this 
memorandum?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I did not know at the time, I was 
informed of that later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Please proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  I was there when I 
received an sms from Mr Gama while I was in the meeting hall and it 
said that Mr Molefe, Mr Brian Molefe, then Group Ch ief Executive of 
Transnet Limited, had withdrawn the memorandum and I was to politely 
get out of that meeting, that is, SABS was detailed in Annexure 2.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you said you were, as far as you understood you 
were attending the meeting in order t o deal with another memorandum, 
not this one. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the sms from Mr Gama to you while you were 
waiting at the venue was to – was that the memorandum to which you 
were not going to be the one talking, w as going – had been withdrawn 
but he then said you must not attend the meeting anymore, that’s what 
you say he said? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That’s what he said, may I refer to 
20 
page 96, the sms messages?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Page 96.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  96. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 44 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But your Annexure FC2.  We located it 
yesterday. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you, it was a confusing 
morning.  The sms read, and I’m reading from the top of page 96, 
please get out that boardroom, Tami is coming to talk about 1064 
locomotives, the 1064 has been withdrawn so I’m not sure why you are 
there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Correction, you said 164, it’s 160.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The 160 has been withdrawn, 
10 
thank you, so I’m not sure why you are there.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you testified that you were scheduled to 
speak on the 1064? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was on standby. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Standby to do that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I thought I was going there 
believing I was on standby to speak to the 1064.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then  this memorandum on the 100 was 
also to serve before that meeting except Mr Jiyane would as you say 
subsequently unders tood talk to it. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   My ...(intervention)    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You then get a message per page 96 from Mr 
Siyabonga Gama instructing you to leave the meeting and informing you 
that Tami will speak to the 1064 which is the transa ction you were 
going to speak to? 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 45 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You said that your attendance was on the 
basis that you were on standby, is that right?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Does that mean that you were going to 
participate in the meeting if somebody else did not pitch up or what.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was a confusing morning, I didn’t 
know whether I should have been there or should not have been there.  
I was not able to ascertain who was going or who was not going to the 
meeting.  I knew that both of these items were on the agenda, 1064 and 
10 
for this 160E’s it also refers to the 100, the 160 100’s, synonymous for 
a moment, so I said if somebody – let me go and be on standby, even if 
I’m out the door in case somebody calls.  
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say you were on standby you don’t mean 
that somebody had asked you to go there on the basis of being on 
standby, it was your own decision.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My own decision to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just in case. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Just in case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m needed. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for future reference so that we don’t get 
confused that sms you read out states that the 160 has been 
withdrawn, would I be correct in saying that the 100 – the 160 relates 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 46 of 200 
 
to Annexure A which was the business case for 100 electric locomotives 
plus 60 diesel locomotives, bringing the total to 160, and that is in the 
subject line of Annexure A itself.  You received this email and 
presumably you then left the meeting.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I see there’s a ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe the tone of this sms from Mr Siyabonga  
Gama to you maybe must be understood in the context of the fact that 
he might not have asked you to attend the meeting, and you might have 
made your own decision to attend and be helpful if necessary, and I’m 
10 
just thinking when you redid the tone sounds a  little strong, he says he 
doesn’t know why you are there?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I confess I was also surprised but 
this happens in the organisation, as I said it was confusing, I did not 
know who was formally attending attending the meeting, it hap pens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But I think the Chair is asking you a slightly 
different question which if you are not presenting any of the two on 
what authority were you at the Board meeting, at that meeting?  Who 
decided you may attend the meeting and what was your purpose for 
20 
attending that or authorised. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Nobody said go, nobody directed 
me to go to the meeting.  Knowing that the matters were to be 
presented at the Board and that somebody needed to talk to them and I 
could not ascertain who was going to be there and I tried to, I believe I 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 47 of 200 
 
tried to contact all the relevant people beforehand so that somebody 
could talk to me if need be, I said I will go and be available.     
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the norm when there was to be a meeting 
to be attended in terms of who attends.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Normally it would have been Mr 
Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he would indicate who is going to attend?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Either he would or he would 
delegate a representative yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but on this occasion you had not received any but 
10 
you thought in case you were, you could be helpful.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, and if I may say that talks to 
his point Tami reading, Mr Thamsanqa Jiyane, is coming to talk about 
the 1064 locomotive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  I see then at 96 onto page 97 
there’s a series of other sms’s, are they relevant to this conver sation 
and can you unpack that, what transpired after you received this 
20 
message? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Well after I received the message I 
left the meeting, I sms’d Mr Gama, the second sms there “I’m out, was 
called I thought for the 1064, was here in case you wanted me, they 
have moved on from 1064, the 100 is coming up very soon, perhaps ten 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 48 of 200 
 
minutes”, Mr Gama replied and the timing of these emails, he sent me 
the first email at 9.28, I replied at 9.36, I was out the boardroom, at 
9.40 Mr Gama sms’d “Brian has withdrawn the 160, you can come back 
to the office”, and by that time 10.10 I sms’d Mr Gama to say thanks 
Tami is here.  I spoke to Mr Jiyane at the meeting and went back to the 
office. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now there are further sms’s at the bottom of 
page 96 onto 97, can you complete this communication, sms 
communication between yourself and Mr Gama?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sure, so then Mr Gama sms’d me 
10 
and says “so what did you talk to BADC about, I’m here now and I 
really don’t like confusion.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is addressed to you?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is addressed to me. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I responded to Mr Gama and 
said “Morning, what is the ...” and I responded the followi ng day, on the 
22 n d.  “Morning ,what is the way forward with the 100 plus 60 is there 
anything we can do, research or rewrite, are there implications for the 
Board agenda for Wednesday, thanks Francis” because normally these 
20 
– in order of protocol it would  go through the Board and Acquisitions 
Development Council and depending on the level of approval it will then 
go to the Board, so this will have an implication for the Board Agenda, 
for the value. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you’re suggesting there was an upc oming 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 49 of 200 
 
Board meeting on that Wednesday?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what was the response thereto?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The response was, and I read the 
last sms there “I believe it remains withdrawn.  I am now t rying to see 
how we can get leased locomotives from Queensland.  GCE said to me 
if I need anything it must be less than a billion if it’s capital and for a 
confinement it must be within his authority.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that you don’t seem to have respond ed to his 
question about what did you talk to the ADC about.  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do believe that I phoned him on 
that one, it’s not in an sms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And my recollection is that I 
phoned him to say, explained why I was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then on the question of the Chair yes it’s not 
in the sms’s but just for the record besides being present at the 
meeting before you got an instruction to leave the meeting had you 
addressed the meeting at all, had you done anything in that meeting yet 
20 
at that point? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No I did not address the meeting.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, so then you were informed that it 
remains withdrawn the 160 proposal and the thinki ng is perhaps to 
lease this from Queensland, I take it Australia.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 50 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Lease locomotives, alternative 
locomotives from Queensland, Australia yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, and then what happened after you 
received that response from Mr Gama? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well the next significant 
development was that I prepared a updated version of the business 
case or a slightly revised version of the business case which I 
presented for Mr Gama which he signed on the 25 t h of November 2013, 
so this was now a month later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And what led to your revision of that 
10 
business case, what was the cause of the revision?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The instructions and directions on 
what to revise were normally telephonic at the time, so I can’t state 
specifically it was this phone call or – it certainly wasn’t an email, or 
this phone call or sms which said okay so that one’s been withdrawn, 
please prepare another one, get it going again that we can submit it 
again the next time and try our luck again is how I interpreted it.  That 
was my interpretation, prepare it again, ready for resubmission in a 
month’s time, maybe we have better luck.  That was my interpretation 
of it at the time. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   You have attached this submitted, or this 
revised version as Annexure 3?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And that starts at your page 99.  Is there any 
difference between Annexure 1, which is 15 t h of October 2013 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 51 of 200 
 
submission and this revised version,  is there any difference between 
the two documents, that is key that you would like to bring to the 
Chair’s attention, or is it the same document now re -dated? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In essence the documents are the 
same, they are both for 100 Class 19E equivalent dual vantage electric 
locomotives and for 60 class 43 diesel locomotives per the heading, but 
there were minor corrections yes because at the bottom left hand 
corner the first one on page 70 its revised version 11A, and the version 
on page 99 is version 12, so I did some minor changes, I can’t say 
...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they are not material you don’t need to bother to.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not material no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you don’t need to bother to list them.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And now this one is dated the 25 t h of 
November 2013. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, it was signed by Mr Gama on 
the 25 t h of November. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And that is at page 123, I see this document 
we have unlike the first version was s igned only by Mr Gama and not by 
the rest of the people whose names appear there who intended to sign 
20 
it, do you know whether they in fact did sign this version eventually?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It’s my understanding that it was 
not signed further, I have no record of it being signed further.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    So, and do you know then what happened to 
this version that you submitted as an extra three signed by Mr Gama on 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 52 of 200 
 
the 25 t h November 2013? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Not definitively, no I know it went 
to Group, but I believe it went to Group but I cannot say where it got 
stopped in the process, or where it stopped in the process.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    What do you mean Group?  Whose Group?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Group as in Transnet Gr oup Head 
Office which would forward, prepare documents for BADC and for 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether the persons for whom provision 
had been made for them to sign on that memorandum, do you know 
10 
whether the absence of their signatures may have been because they 
didn’t agree or whether the memorandum wasn’t given to them or 
anything, or you just don’t know what happened?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Chair.  So this is now the 25 t h of 
November 2013, insofar as this proposal is concerned do you hear 
anything from anyone thereafter, after that date?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No it was quiet and one proceeded 
with other work till the next event was really the afternoon of Friday the 
20 
18 t h of January. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And what happened on that day?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I then received the following sms 
from Mr Gama, and if I may read it because I think it sets out what had 
happened. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 53 of 200 
 
“Hi Francis and JD, 
Group has asked that we find R50million additional revenue for 
next year.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that one of the corrections, it says R500 here, 
R500million. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry R500million, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R500million okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They also want us to add a 
thousand wagons for CAPEC, to TE, that’s Transnet Engineering, I 
suggested that we need 80, not 60 Class 43 diesels, they’re asking that 
10 
we table a business case for 80 but it needs to be signed off by ten 
o’clock on Monday in order for it to be on BADC pack for next Friday’s 
meeting 24 January.  What miracle can you work for me, Sia.  Well ...  
CHAIRPERSON:  That seemed much more friendlier than the sms’s.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There was no offence given and 
none taken at the time, these things happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the request is to take the same proposal 
except instead of 60 diesel you must make provision for 80 diesel?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And this you must have c ompleted by  the 
following Monday having received the message on?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Friday. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Friday. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 54 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    In preparation for a BADC meeting the 
following Friday. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Did you respond to this sms?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well before I responded 
personally, my first thing was I contacted a colleague that was 
Pragessan Pillay, who was General Manager Logistics Integratio n, of 
this sms ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    May I interject, Pragessan [spelt] Pillay?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    For record purposes, thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  He and I were 
extremely close colleagues and all our locomotive interactions we – 
because he was in charge of the operational aspects of locomotives we 
were working very closely particularly when it came to designing how 
locomotives, and allocating how locomotives would be used and 
operational capabilities and operational deployment, so the business 
case had to tie in with what he wanted.  So I told him about this sms 
and as I said he is responsible for all the operational aspects of the 
locomotive 
fleet 
and 
we 
had 
this 
particularly 
c lose 
working 
20 
collaboration.  JD sent the sms to Gama and copied me “Once I had a 
chat with Francis we will be meeting tomorrow to get the case out.  We 
do have tons, we will be tracking above the budget for next year, they 
are covered by resources but not reliable as we would like to be.  There 
is operational detail here of also Polokwana needs the 34 200’s to be 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 55 of 200 
 
replaced, that’s a diesel locomotive, we plan to hold them together with 
Coppex ...” I’m not sure I need the message, but effectively we were in 
contact, I believe we met on the Saturday to put this together and the 
upshot of this was that on Monday the 24 t h of January I emailed Mr 
Gama a revised business case for 100 locomotives and 80 diesels 
which is – that was revised version 14 dated the 20 t h of January, and I 
sent a word version to Mr Gama’s PA, Mr Singh’s PA and on Tuesday I 
sent a word version to Mr Jiyane of the Supply Chain Officer.  So it was 
distributed fairly widely. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you were able to work the miracle that Mr 
10 
Gama was hoping you would be able to by Monday?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja we got a business case out. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now we are now at sequentially 
version 3 which you have annexed as Annexure 5 and 5A.  If we could 
go to version 2 – annexure 5A and that is at page 129.  The first 
difference with this if compared to our very first being annexure 1 is the 
subject title.  So whereas annexure 1 was making provision for 100 
electric locomotives and 60 diesel this one adjusted the diesel 
requirement up to 80. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May we accept that the body of the document 
and the calculations recognises that change and that change is giving 
effect to in the numbers?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Besides that change did anything else change 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 56 of 200 
 
in FA1 as compared to Annexure A your very first business case?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The logic of the business case, the 
layout of the business case and the essential arguments remained all 
the same. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  It is my recollection that of course 
I adjusted various figures and various tonnages related to the change 
in locomotives but it was an update of previous work fortunately it was 
not a rewrite completely from scratch. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Annexure 5A still argues for confinement 
10 
to Mitsui at this stage?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And 5A still argues for confinement 
to Mitsui on the same basis as we had before.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As we have had along.  You – you indicate 
you distributed this to the people you mention in your paragraph 38 and 
then what happened thereafter?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not in the case there was various 
emails between myself, Mr Singh and Mr Pita where I had ema iled 
versions, previous versions of business cases and corrected some 
finance – some of their financial calculations we found an error in the 
20 
work I had done over the weekend and that was corrected.  But the key 
point was that on the morning of Wednesday the 22 January I received 
this – an email from Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe also from Supply Chain 
Services. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I spell that for the record?  It is L – first 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 57 of 200 
 
name Lindiwe, surname, Mdletshe. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And she requested my assistance 
on the formatting my memorandum the previous Monday the one which I 
had distributed widely on Monday.  When I looked at the memorandum 
she sent me I noticed that the memorandum had bee n changed 
significantly to give the effect to confine an award to CSR for 100 
electric locomotives and the confinement that I had to Mitsui was totally 
removed.   
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you attach these documents as Annexure 
7.  Could we then go to Annexure 7 and Annexure 7A so that you can 
work us through these details?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you saying you prepared or you – ja you 
prepared a memorandum which made out a case for the confinement to 
Mitsui. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mitsui correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were now discovering that it had been 
changed significantly and the memorandum was now making out a case 
20 
for confinement to CSR?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 58 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Your Annexure 7 starts at page 158 and then 
it is thereafter followed by 7A.  At 158 is that the email you referred to 
from Ms Mdletshe? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the email I r eceived from 
Ms Mdletshe.  May I point out that while the email reads:  please see 
slide evaluation methodology that needs to be incorporated into the 
word documents if I could take you through please to the attachments?  
There are two attachments which she sent me.  And this was the 
document I was put it into [indistinct] 180 revised version 15  120 
GPdoc ex that is the memorandum attached as Annexure 7A and then 
10 
there was the slide that I was to add into the document.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you received two documents from Ms 
Mdletshe the slide on the one hand it is one attachment and you 
received the document that you have marked 7A which is a revised 
version of what you had provided – the memorandum you had provided 
to Mr Singh, Mr Gama and Mr Pita?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Two days previously? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You then receive this document and 
20 
what do you do with it?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I put the slide in. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I format it – formatted it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe before dealing with what you did with it.  In 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 59 of 200 
 
terms of the significant changes that you say were there maybe if you 
can identify those first?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may suggest Chair actually Mr Callard has 
done that.  They are fairly significant.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is Annexure 8 which is upcoming.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where he is going to take us to the – the 
changes made to his  original document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So basically what he does he takes his 
original document and he shows where there have been deletions and 
changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And he makes a direct comparison.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That exercise I believe is – is better 
appreciated through Annexure 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is the next slide that we are going to 
20 
deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But should we not have that before we hear wha t he 
did with the document? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  May I say?  The essence – I did 
exactly what Ms Mdletshe asked me.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 60 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I took the document, put it in the 
slide 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLA RD:  Also took the slide put it in the 
document, formatted it correctly, and sent it back to her.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I thought the question was meant to 
[indistinct] as opposed to what you  did. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I may have misunderstood the question.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The sum affect is that they requested being 
please add this slide to the body of  the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And as I understand Mr Callard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you just did it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is exactly what he did. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. No that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is in the course of doing so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I understand you correctly that you realised 
that this is not the same document.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 61 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That I have sent out to inter alia Ms Mdletshe 
herself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no, no that is fine.  So let us – let us go ahead 
then. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then which then leads us to your paragraph 
40 and you talk about a comparison between I will call it your version 
and the version received from Ms Mdletshe and you have attached this 
as Annexure 8? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Annexure 8 Chair will start at your page 
186. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You list a number of changes under paragraph 
40 going onto paragraph 41.  Let us take them a step at  a time and if 
you can refer the Chair to the specific places where these changes 
occur or the key ones at least. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well the key changes were 40.1 
references to 19 E equivalent had been removed throughout the 
document.  If one were to turn to page 187. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  First example of that is Item 1B to 
approve the investment in and procurement of 100 and where we had 
Class 19 E equivalent electric locomotives the Class 19 E equivalent 
has been removed.  That is I believe consistent throughout the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 62 of 200 
 
document.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the effect of that amendment is to render 
1B whereas 1B sought an approval for the procurement of 100 Class 19 
E electric locomotives that effect – the change results in the approval 
sought being for the procurement of 100 locomotives simply?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The – may I add that the 
consequence 
of 
that or 
the implications of 
that 
is 
that 
the 
characteristics of the locomotive, the desired locomotive of the 19 E of 
10 
its 26 tonnes per axil and the power equivalency of a 19 E locomotive 
had been taken out of the business case.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you state that throughout the document 
reference to Class 19 E equivalent is taken out?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The – I cannot recall a place 
where it is left in the document. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes [indistinct] what is the next significant 
change? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  40.2 the motivation to confine to 
Mars had been removed and replaced with confinement to SCR.  That 
20 
appears on page 200. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Would it perhaps Mr Callard if we start at 
page 188 which is the first place where this change occurs.  188.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My apologies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paragraph 5. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 63 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  180 – 180 – yes 188.  First place 
occurs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  188 paragraph 5 and here it 
reads – now reads that the submission proposes an accelerated 
procurement to mitigate General Freight MDS volumes at risk above 
confining 100 electric locomotives to CSR, China South Rail E 
Locomotive Supply and the balance.  That now changes the 
confinement sig- changes the confinement.  We can see th e changes in 
the track changes in the document.  This is now confinement to Mars is 
10 
now consistent through the document.  The motivation for confinement 
to Mitsui has been removed and been replaced by confined motivation 
to confine to China South Rail. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we deal with the next change I would 
like to take you back to 187 which is something you do not highlight in 
your statement and in particular under purpose paragraph 1F, F for 
Freddy 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The original document appeared to have 
proposed that once the contracts are negotiated to inform the board of 
20 
the final price, cost and the then 1G suggested that the GCE be 
delegated the power to sign.  Insofar as F is concerned that 
requirement to inform the board of the final price appears to have been 
taken out? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct that has been taken out 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 64 of 200 
 
and the – it is my interpretation that the addition under what is now was 
G now F the power be delegated to the GCE award includ ing process 
and approval takes us even further, the in – [indistinct] powers. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then if…  
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what is your understanding of including 
process approval is – does that mean that what was intended with this 
amendment was that the GCE would be the one to decide on what 
process should be followed to get approval?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because I did not add those words 
I do not want to …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Impute to the author. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What he exactly meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What I was giving there was my 
interpretation of the words for process approval was that an extended 
process approval could be argued to g o right up to award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Award the business. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is an interpretation of those 
words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay no, no, I just wanted your own 
interpretation because s omebody was quite… 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 65 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But I cannot impute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What the author meant but that is 
my interpretation of the words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  It has been bro ught to my 
attention that it is time for your tea Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the tea adjournment and we will resume 
at half past eleven. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All Rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Callard we are still at 
your page 9 of your statement.  We have dealt with 40.1, 40.2 and – 
and the changes that were effected at page 187 relating to the 
requirement for approval by the Board.  We now move onto your 40.3 
and we deal with the change effected there when you are ready.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  Under 40.3 what had 
also been removed was the benefit of the standardisations of the 
locomotives and for that if we could please refer to page 2-0 – 200 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And 201. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 66 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Starting at 200. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correction.  Let us go to 201 
please. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
On 
standardisation. 
 
201 
paragraph D where we have – what has been taken out was that the 
standardisation has two elements - operational standardisation and 
maintenance standardisation.  We will see that whole section has been 
deleted and it has been replaced with wording to the effect that:  
“CSR has been adjudicated as being the best bidder 
10 
during the 95 electric locomotive process.”  
We recall now that the 95 electric locomotives which were then class 
20E were general freight locomotives .  Both these tenders now include 
Board approved methodology. 
“Transnet has spent a huge – large amount of time 
human 
capital 
money 
in 
the 
recent 
tenders.  
Production of the MARS …”  
And I am reading from Roman numerals II.  
“Production of the current MARS c ontract has been 
completed and was based on previous procurement 
20 
methodology where supplier development is not a 
key focus area and the Mitsui Consortium did not 
fare well in the two most recent tenders issued by 
Transnet.” 
That would be the 1 064 including. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 67 of 200 
 
“Therefore 
a 
continuation 
with 
Mitsui 
via 
confinement would pose unnecessary risk to the 
organisation.” 
Effectively none of this addresses the key point that was made out of 
standardisation and interoperability and that has been replaced with – 
may I put it – extraneous material. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well once whoever it is who made the decision to say 
it should no longer – the memorandum should no longer be talking 
about MARS but CSR once they had made that change would it be true 
that the standardisation that given the contract to MARS would benefit 
10 
that Transnet would gain in terms of standardisation would no longer 
apply once it was CSR? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The benefit of standardisation 
would be negated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be negated, ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that part had to go but of course you still have the 
question of the motivation why they changed from MARS to CSR?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because then they would need to address the 
question of how – what about the benefit that Transnet would have 
gained by giving the contract to – to MARS which is what your original 
memorandum was – was about? 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 68 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And perhaps just to conclude on that point if 
you go a page back at 200 this would have started at the bottom of 
page 199.  It is a quotation from the Procurement Policy regarding 
requirements to be met for confinement to be invoked and at 200 under 
C it states that: 
“For reasons of standardisation or compatibility with 
existing rules and services a case must be made 
that deviation from existing standardised goods or 
10 
services will cost major operational disru ption.  If 
not confinements based on standardisation will not 
be considered.” 
You see that part? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now my question to you is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not see it.  I am trying to follow you.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh, I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On page 200? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 200 at the top in bold …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, where it says for reasons, okay.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where it says for reasons under C.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is a continuation from 199 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 69 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The requirements for confinement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Confinement, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The aspect that Mr Callard has just dealt with.  
Is it your evidence that in seeking to confine the acquisition to MARS 
you argued that coal line or the coal division had – was already owning 
and operating 19E locomotives and that these would be compatible with 
what you already have? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct.  The fleet of 
10 
locomotives on the coal line comprised 7E locomotives and series.  11E 
locomotives AC only and those were quite old and the bulk of the coal 
line fleet the major element was the recently acquired 110 19E 
locomotives.  The confinement to MARS for the additional 100 
locomotives fully met the requirements of C where for reasons of 
standardisation and compatibility with existing goods or services.  That 
box was firmly ticked.  We made the case why we did not wan t to 
deviate from that because of both spares holding and a maintenance 
holding and we also mentioned a driver training plus other factors and 
that. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At that – at that time did the coal division 
have within its fleet any locomotive manuf actured by CSR? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.  At the time that this 
memorandum was changed - this is now in January  2014 – Transnet 
Freight Rail had not taken delivery of a single locomotive from CSR.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 70 of 200 
 
The contract for the 95 locomotives had previously  been awarded to 
CSR.  A locomotive had been delivered into the country manufactured 
from China – if my memory services me correctly.  This was roundabout 
November 2013.  I give or take the exact date.  There was a ceremony 
around that and that locomotive was currently undergoing prototype and 
performance testing on the freight rail network.  It had not been taken 
into service. 
“We had no effectively goods or services …”  
And I am quoting here from point D.  
“We had no goods or services reading locomotives 
10 
previously executed by the supplier in service at 
the time this memorandum was changed.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  So going back to the question I asked when you were 
dealing with the removal or deletion of the standardisation part of your 
memorandum …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And its replacement by what we have looked at in 
terms of CSR - so standardisation apart from – apart from whatever 
benefit Transnet would get by giving the contract to MARS but apart 
from that standardisation would have been  or was one of the grounds 
20 
that would justify confinement.  Is that right?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may use a – perhaps an 
automotive example …  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 71 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And may I mention trade names 
just for – for sake of the argument.  I own a delivery service and I have 
a 100 Toyota trucks – one ton trucks.  I have a maintenance facility set 
up for those one ton trucks.  I keep a stock of spares for those  one ton 
trucks.  I wish now to increase my fleet.  If I were to – I go out on 
tender.  If I were to increase to say now changing from Toyota to Ford - 
for example.  The driver training in an automotive truck is not the big 
issue but I now have a different workshop facility that I have to set up.  
I have a different spares holding that I have to set up and this 
10 
complexity is amplified when one deals with locomotives because of the 
nature of their spares and the long term capital items those spares how 
long they are held for and the – the price of those spares.  So it means 
that – as an example – I now have to hold spares for Toyota.  I have to 
hold spared for Ford but if I just increase my fleet in Toyota - for 
example - I do not have to double up on my spar es holding because 
though doubling my fleet I only need to increase my spares by perhaps 
25 percent whereas I would have to do it completely differently if I 
changed the brand which I was (indistinct) exactly the same type of 
argument and savings hold true  in locomotive spares. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Then if – if we are to 
understand you based on what you have previously said you already 
had 110 19E locomotives?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 72 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if the proposal was upheld you would 
acquire a 19E type equivalent and when you confine that acquisition to 
MARS you would actually acquire a 19E because that is a Mitsui 
locomotive? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And would we be correct to say that the new 
100 to be acquired would be replacing the 7E and the 11E that were 
currently part of the fleet?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would certainly be replacing the 
7E and it would not be replacing the 11E immediately but t he business 
10 
case was also to increase the tonnages conveyed over the coal line.  
So to convey those increased tonnages we need additional locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then with the replacement of 7E and the 
110 already at hand if the proposal had b een upheld to confine to 
MARS the division would have ended up with predominantly 19E 
locomotives to run the coal line?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now you – you pointed us to page 201 under 
standardisation. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and reference is made thereto the 
award of 95 electric locomotives to CSR?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you pointed out that none of these had 
been delivered.  There was a – there was only a prototype that was in 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 73 of 200 
 
testing phase at the time?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Would we be correct to – to assume therefore 
that there was nothing in hand with the co division to standardise with 
anything that CSR would – would supply in terms of this proposal?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may just say we – we use the 
term “coal line”.  It is not a separate division on its line.  It is a network 
separation but there was nothing for the coal line that would  be 
compatible or previously delivered from SCR.  So in fact we had no 
SCR locomotive either in general freight at that time or on the coal line.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if I – I take you a page back to 200 at 
what was item or paragraph 68 your original me morandum listed four 
factors there in seeking to address the question of urgency?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see that all that now – all those have been – 
have been cancelled out. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct they have been. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is the Chair to understand that whereas you 
were arguing if we acquire the MARS locomotives Transnet would not 
have difficulties with going through the teething phase first and 
20 
foremost because they are already running a 19E?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Specifically because the new 
locomotives or the additional 100 would be of the 19E type - maybe 
with a minor updated variation – they have been through all – yes they 
have been through the teething phase and all the bugs have been 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 74 of 200 
 
ironed out.  All the production bugs have been ironed out.  Secondly …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Continue, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Secondly the production line is 
available and it could be started immediately.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have no crew which needs to 
be trained or passed out on locomotives and by drawing an analogy 
similar to an airline train drivers are passed out for a particular class of 
locomotive.  They cannot arbitrarily change from one class to the othe r.  
It is not like I climb into a car brand A tomorrow and I can drive car 
10 
band – brand B the next day.  They have to pass through a particular 
pass out procedure retraining for the characteristics of that locomotive 
which addressed the driver one and perhaps summarising the 
production we – D effectively summarised points B - A and B above that 
confinement would be the quickest delivery with the existing facilities 
already available and previously used for assembly of the 110 that we 
had on the coal line. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now I see then at 68 that what you previously 
had in that paragraph to address the question of urgency has been 
deleted in its entirety?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In its entirety yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it does not – there does not appear to 
have been a substitution there?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Indeed.  What has been put in its 
place or left is the following paragraph which is now 68 was completing 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 75 of 200 
 
the urgency.  We had a paragraph specifically addressing the urgency 
as to why it was urgent …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And then paragraph 68 was 
complimenting the above.  It was not the – it was adding the 
complimentary information.  It was not the prime de facto reasons for 
the urgency.  They have no w – this change has turned the 
complimentary reasons into the prime reasons.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then the actual document does not address 
urgency.  It just kicks off with a phrase complimenting the urgency that 
10 
has not been dealt with?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is a fact of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to make sense of that.  Are you able to 
make sense of that?  How do you compliment urgency when you have 
not addressed urgency when you have not addressed urgency?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am afraid I cannot answer this 
Chairman because in our original document we addressed the urgency 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And then we added factors 
complimenting the urgency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Whoever changed the document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 76 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Talk to that later – the authors of 
the changed document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Would have to answer to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Why they took out the factors of 
urgency … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And put in only complimenting 
urgency. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I can offer that if one left 
addressing the urgency in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The original points of urgency – 
CSR - would not have complied with addressing the urgency …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because they have not been 
through a teething phase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We do not have any on the coal 
line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There is no production line in 
South Africa at the moment for those CSR 95 locomotives.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 77 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have only had one in from 
China – production line still have to be started up.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Crew and drivers and assistance 
still have to be trained for the 95 locomotives.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And confinement will realise the 
quickest delivery as will be shown later because the 95 has to be – the 
whole production line has to be set up for the confinement to 95 
10 
negates the whole teething prototype testing driver training.  It negates 
all of those reasons we had which addressed – which were addressing 
the urgency. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Then when we are on that 
section now that survived dealing with complimenting the urgency.  I 
would like us to have particular regard to paragraph B whi ch reads as 
the original read.  The tail end of that statement has got an additional - 
the original read: 
“The locomotives would be largely identical with 
those already supplied.”  
20 
I will stop there for now and that statement is retained in the reworked 
version of this document.  Would that be a correct statement insofar as 
the CSR …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you jump between different documents?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no Chair.  I am at page 200. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 78 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where I am too. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  The Chair sees where the old 68 were 
addressing urgencies all deleted?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is followed then by the next session headed 
“Complimenting the urgency which …”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is what Mr Callard has just spoken to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Under complimenting urgency you have A, B, 
10 
C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am addressing myself to – to B there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought you were saying E.  So I wa s looking 
for E. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh, sorry.  B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  B.  Oh, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I said E I apologise.  I misspoke.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, B. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I meant to say B Chair and - and one can see 
20 
from the document that the first part of B is the original statement as 
contained in the proposal to confine to Mitsui.  Correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I did point out that it appears to have an 
– to have an addition but for now let us confine ou rselves to the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 79 of 200 
 
original statement which reads: 
“The locomotives would be largely identical with 
those already supplied.”  
If that statement is retained in a proposal arguing for confinement to 
CSR that would be incorrect because CSR has not provided any 
locomotive? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That statement would be false. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It would be false? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Would be false. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would be false in two ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Patently false? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Patently false because …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
They 
have 
not 
supplied 
a 
locomotive in production.  We have a prototype.  It is not in production.  
Equally to that if we read the phras e as it has been expanded in the 
modification the locomotives would be largely identical to those already 
supplied and to be supplied.  “To be supplied” that phrase is in direct 
contradiction with point D at the top of page 200.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At that point D on the page 200 is the fourth 
requirement for confinement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Right and if I may read: 
“With the total services being procured are highly 
specialised and largely identical to those previously 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 80 of 200 
 
executed by that supplier.”  
So the phrase “and to be supplied” cannot be compatible with those 
previously executed by the supplier.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and whoever was making the changes could not 
have negligently left this part in because does it not seem that he or 
she would have read this – this part: 
“The locomotives would be largely identical with 
those already supplied.”  
The moment they read that they would know that factually as far as 
CSR is concerned there were no locomotives that had previously been 
10 
supplied. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
I 
– 
I 
have 
two 
possible 
interpretations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh or maybe the – the – if it was negligence maybe 
they had a different understanding of the - of this part of the document. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was either extreme negligence 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In which case they should not be 
addressing the document …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Or deliberate misrepresentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have no other …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 81 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Conclusion in my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; because the – the whole process did address the 
issue – your memorandum addressed the issue of are we dealing with 
an entity that has previously supplied us these locomotiv es? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in terms of your memorandum when you said that 
was the case that was so because that was factually the case?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  MARS had supplied locomotives?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  MARS had supplied locomotives. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Very recently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and now if somebody was going to say well let us 
talk about CSR and they see a statement that says:  
“The locomotives would be largely identical with 
those already supplied.”  
They have got to ask themselves has CSR previously supplied 
locomotives.  That is in case they think they might not be sure but if 
they know for sure that CSR has never supplied any locomotives 
leaving it – leaving that part of the statement there is quite serious.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would show later that the phrase 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 82 of 200 
 
“largely identical” as it relates to CSR does also not hold because the 
locomotives that were perhaps contemplated the 90 – the locomotives 
that had been supplied - that were on order from CSR not yet supplied 
the 95 locomotives - that class – were not identical - were not largely 
identical to those that were finally supplied.  The phrase “largely 
identical” does not hold true either.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And could it be that somebody could say well 
paragraph B did no say those already supplied needed to be those 
already supplied by CSR if they were going to be largely identical to 
those that Transnet already had even if they were supplied by 
10 
somebody else.  The statement would be okay.  Would – would that kind 
of argument apply? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry Mr Chair could you just - I – 
I did not hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let – ja let me repeat.  You see paragraph B that 
we are talking about? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Says to the reader of this memorandum when you 
read it together with the cha nges that have been effected to your 
memorandum.  Says that: 
20 
“CSR will be supplying – that the locomotives that 
CSR would be supplying would be largely identical 
with those already supplied.”  
Now based on your memorandum when you wrote this you wrote this in 
the context that the locomotives already supplied were locomotives 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 83 of 200 
 
already supplied by the entity that was sought to be given the contract?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is a yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I am now saying is it – is it possible – is it 
plausible interpretation of that paragraph – of paragraph for somebody 
to say already supplied – locomotives already supplied did not have to 
be locomotives already supplied by CSR as long as Trans net had 
locomotives that it already had even if they were supplied by somebody 
else and now CSR was somebody else.  If CSR would supply 
10 
locomotives that were largely identical to locomotives that Transnet 
already had that would – that would mean that this paragraph is not 
false.  In other words the locomotives that were contemplated CSR 
would supply.  Were they going to be largely identical to those that 
MARS had supplied before?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
The 
locomotives 
that 
were 
contemplated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I say let me use the phrase …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes contemplated. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Potentially contemplated …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To be supplied by CSR …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Were not largely identical …  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 84 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To those already supplied by …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  By MARS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We categorise locomotives by 
locomotive types.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You heard us specifically talk of a 
19E locomotive. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  A 19E is a different locomotive to a 
20E locomotive.  It has – and that would generally be – it has a 
different weight.  It has a different power.  It might be – have a 
different traction.  It has different components and also from a different 
supplier because the spares and the operations of the locomotive are 
subtly different.  So the 95 locomotives that we were getting from CSR 
were then – were known in the organisation as type 20E even though 
we had not got one or we only had a prototype.  It was classified 
already as a type 20E.  A type 20E locomotive is not largely identical t o 
20 
the 19E. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So the contemplated delivery of 
the 20E locomotives – the 95 20E locomotives by SCR cannot be 
considered largely identical to the 19E we already had from MARS …  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 85 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Even though it was contemplated 
delivery in the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It cannot be considered identical.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then if I – if I can just perhaps follow up on – 
on the Chair’s questions. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  (Intervenes) sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Again we are – we are still at page 200 and 
10 
we are looking at the various requirements?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Requirement D at page 200 - at the top of the 
page - states as follows: 
“When the goods or services been procured are 
highly specialised and largely identical to those 
previously executed by that supplier.”  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now I will stop there.  Now CSR in this 
context would not be that supplier because it had not previously to 
20 
Transnet? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Indeed, and a critical point, CSR 
is that supplier and it had not delivered anything.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes, so there was nothing to compare and 
therefore to determine whether it is identical.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 86 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Nothing to compare it to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And as the Chair, or as you point out the 
addition to that statement is identical with those to be supplied, you 
see that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Now the requirement that they be identical 
to those supplied would be outside the scope of D, D requires that they 
(indistinct) supplied B in hand in order to be compared and to 
determine whether they are identical, would I be correct in saying so?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Sorry could you just re-state 
10 
that...(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    I’m looking at B and we agreed that B is in 
two parts.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     It says that the locomotives would largely 
be identical with those already supplied and we have answered the 
questions that they have not been supplied and there’s an addition that 
– there that says, end to be supplied.  Now I’m a ddressing myself to be 
supplied even – now the proposition I’m making is even if they were 
identical to those to be supplied that would be beyond the requirement 
20 
of D – or requirement D of confinement because D says that they must 
have been previously supplied, not to be supplied in the future.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is correct and it was the 
point I was making if I may re-state it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 87 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CSR had not supplied any 
locomotives, we had on order, locomotives from CSR, they have not 
been supplied so they are in the “to be supplied” arena, they are to be 
supplied, they cannot therefore comply with the requirement previously 
executed by that supplier and that’s the point, they are to be supplied 
and they’ve not been executed.    
CHAIRPERSON:     Well doesn’t that part that say “end to be supplied” 
compound the problem?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Indeed it did Mr Chairman yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the paragraph says the locomotives would 
10 
be – would be largely identical with those already supplied, that’s what 
it says.  Now there you’re talking about the locomotive – the first 
reference to locomotives has to be a reference to the locomotives to be 
supplied, the first reference that the ones to be su pplied would largely 
–would be largely identical to those that have already been supplied.    
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Already been supplied. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, now that makes sense okay now if you then 
add, end to be supplied it seems to me what  the sentence then says is, 
the locomotives would be largely – the locomotives to be supplied by 
CSR. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: Yes.     
CHAIRPERSON:     Would largely be –would be largely identical with 
those to be supplied with those that have been sup plied and with those 
to be supplied, or am I missing something?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I’m sorry, because CSR had not 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 88 of 200 
 
supplied any locomotives yet, there was nothing to compare them to.  
CHAIRPERSON:     No, no leave that part we have dealt with th at part, 
focus on the “to be supplied” right, those to be supplied, as I 
understand it is locomotives – refers to locomotives to be supplied by 
CSR on this amended version. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     On this one yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay let’s start again just so that we’re on the same 
page.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Yes okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m saying if you leave out the added part which 
10 
says “and to be supplied” if you leave that part out, the sentence 
makes sense, it says in effect, “the locomotives that are to be supplied 
by the supplier that the memo is talking about will largely be identical 
with those already supplied”, and we know from D at the top that Ms 
Sello has referred to that, that means those previously supplied by the 
same supplier okay, that’s fine but now they add that the locomotives to 
be supplied will largely be identical with those and now I skip your part 
– with those to be supplied.  The locomotives to be supplied by CSR 
will largely be identical with those to be suppli es by – that seems to me 
to be what he says. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I’m struggling with that 
enormously if I may say the self referential part of that because if CSR 
is supplying Locos on the 95 contract the locomotives that will be 
supplied under – if this confinement were to go to CSR could not be 
largely identical to those of the 95 they could not be largely identical 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 89 of 200 
 
as I said because the 95 locomotives were for general freight they were 
22 ton axle locomotives they were of a lesser power, if C SR were to 
supply these locomotives as we know they eventually did, they would 
have to be heavier and more powerful so they could not be largely 
identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But the essence of paragraph B as you had it in 
your memo before they were supplied , I mean, that paragraph B is 
linked to paragraph D at the top of page 200.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Because it’s one of the grounds on which you can 
10 
justify confinement you know. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Correct yes.     
CHAIRPERSON:    That we are dealing here with a supplier who has 
previously us with these kinds of goods so it’s justified to confine this 
and not to go to open tender. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So now – but here now it would then say in regard 
to what they’ve added, the locomotives to be supplied by CSR would 
largely be identical to those to be supplied by CSR.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That was my self referential 
20 
problem sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes Chair we – clearly the...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Maybe there is something that we don’t – we don’t 
all understand that somebody, not in this room might...(intervention).  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Perhaps that might shed light but the effect 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 90 of 200 
 
of what the Chair is pointing out is we propose that we supply to CSR 
because – no we propose that we confine to CSR because the 
locomotives to be supplied by CSR are identical to those locomotives to 
still be supplied by CSR that’s the sum effect of it.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And as I said they cannot be 
identical because the locomotives on order to be supplied, on order, 
cannot be identical to the locomotives intended under this confinement, 
they are not the same locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Because the ones that are on order are 20E 
and we are looking for 19E which is a heavier...(intervention).  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     And we are looking for a heavier 
locomotive yes. So what’s on order cannot be identical to what’s 
intended in this confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You see, to compare, you need at least two things.      
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:     You can’t compare if you’ve got one thing, the 
locomotives to be supplied are the, you know, are the same locomotives 
that they are comparing them with, you know.  Ja okay let’s move on.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Maybe the author of the changes will shed 
some light Chair yes.  Then if we move on we move to page 201 of the 
20 
same document under, standardisation, you read – you dealt with item 
(i), at 201 which is where reference to 95 Electric Locos is made.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now under D there at page 201 there are 
two – there are three factors that are advanced to justify a confinement 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 91 of 200 
 
to CSR, we’ve dealt with the first and we cannot make sense of it but 
as yet there’s a second and a third, I’m particularly interested in the 
second, can you express a view on that factor if you are able to?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   May I just pick up where you are, 
are we under D. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     (ii), new two.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  D, new (ii)?    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Is this the one, production of the 
current MARS contract has been completed...(intervention).    
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    And was based on a previous 
procurement methodology where supplier development was not a key 
focus and the Mitsui consortium did not fare well in the two most recent 
tenders issued by Transnet, therefore continuation with Mitsui via 
confinement would pose unnecessary risks to the organisation.  It is my 
interpretation that this refer to the two tenders the one on which, it is 
my understanding, that Mitsui – sorry which was for the 95 locomotives 
which was an open tender process for which both Mitsui and MARS 
tendered which was awarded, amongst others, which was awarded to 
20 
CSR and then the second tender would have been the tender for the 
599 electrics as part of the 1064 where they are saying – the author 
here states that Mitsui did not fare well in those two most recent 
tenders.  If I may add, that would be rather unusual to put this in here 
because this memorandum is dated or it was ultimately dated, various 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 92 of 200 
 
dates, it went to the Board and Acquisi tions Development Council on 
the 24 t h of January and at that point only was the short listing and the 
methodology would have been – of the confinement would have been 
approved by the Board.  So whoever was writing this document was 
doing so with prior know ledge of what was going to go to the Board.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Now you are very familiar with these 
documents, I just want to test my understanding as regards the issue 
raised in (ii) the effect – my interpretation of that is that it’s stated that 
Mitsui did not fare well in two most recent tenders issued by Transnet 
and that is the basis on which we cannot confine to Mitsui, so we are 
10 
punishing Mitsui for having failed in two previous tenders, would I be 
correct? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I think that is a fair reading of 
this paragraph. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And because they had failed – did not fare 
well in previous two tenders that posed a risk to Transnet?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     That is how the author has 
written this paragraph. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Based on your experience at Transnet and 
knowledge what risk could that potentially pose for Transnet, can you 
20 
think of any that perhaps?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I do not wish to go into the 
realm of speculation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  But I believe a totally separate 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 93 of 200 
 
area of discussion and debate would be how this statement came into 
being and the genesis of this statement in the evaluation of the 1064, I 
do not wish to say any further about it at the moment, I think it needs 
to be ...(intervention).    
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but counsel is asking a different question and for 
you to be able to comment if you are able to.  If I understand the 
question she would like you to say what you think of that argum ent they 
put forward saying MARS had performed poorly in two previous, I think 
its tenders or whatever.     
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Tenders Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Whether you have any comments as to the 
soundness of that argument. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:     Yes Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   May I address it in two forms, 
technically the locomotives would have been fine, we have gone 
through various iterations of the business case signed off by various 
people as we went through from October throu gh to November and the 
organisation and certainly Freight Rail was happy with confinement to 
MARS so we’ve addressed the technical issues of the locomotive.  So 
technically there would have been no risk to the organisation.  I cannot 
20 
comment as to what risk the supplier development methodology or lack 
thereof posed to the organisation.  That is a procurement issue and 
that might have a – be related to the image and/or other standing of the 
organisation but it was not an operational issue, if I may leave it at 
that. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 94 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay thank you.  That then takes us to – if 
you’ve got no further comments on your paragraph 40.3 that then takes 
us to a different issue which you deal with at paragraph 40.4.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just so that Mr Callard yo u don’t think that 
you are being prevented from dealing with an issue that you think is 
important you just mentioned what you said you thought the debate 
should be in regard to that, so if you deal with that in your statement at 
some stage you can do so bu t if you don’t, you can deal with it now to 
say what was the origin of that so I leave it to you and Ms Sello 
whether that is dealt with later in the statement or whether it’s 
10 
something you want to deal with now.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     This particular as pect is not dealt with 
further in the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It’s not dealt with further in my 
statement.    
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes if you are able to give evidence about the origin 
then do so.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR D:   This is a personal opinion based 
on my previous – my working – it is not in my statement because it is 
20 
outside of my bounds of personal experience but it relates to 
documents I have access to and read that the evaluation methodology 
as prescribed in the – as originally prescribed through the Department 
of Trade and Industry and National Treasury as reflected into the 
request for proposals as later taken through into the evaluation process 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 95 of 200 
 
and the scoring of the locomotives I am personally uncomfortable .  I 
cannot, at the moment say the – give you the chapter and the verse of 
why I’m uncomfortable but from everything I have read and seen of this 
I am uncomfortable that’s the essence of where I am.   
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     As we go through the statement perhaps 
we’ll have the opportunity to deal with some of those issues that make 
you uncomfortable and perhaps Chair it might answer the issue that the 
Chair raises.  You then take – refer at page 9 of your statement in 
particular paragraph 40.4 to page 22 as one of the key changes that 
10 
you wanted to highlight. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.     
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And your page 22 really refers – 22 typed 
22 Chair that would be page 208 of the record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair, please take us through that.     
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I cannot – my comment there 
was that if we look at page – at the table at the top of page 208 which 
talks to the supplier development category and it h as a – the weighting 
would which would be required for various supplier development 
20 
categories, my only comment on this is that the weightings have been 
removed.  Now these – I’m not the procurement specialist but in all our 
tenders we require that our ten derers – they are evaluated in terms of 
these particular weighting it was both of interest – well let me say it 
was of – it was unusual for me that having changed this confinement 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 96 of 200 
 
that these weightings would have been removed.  I offer the comment 
only in hindsight for the benefit of the hindsight to this – to where we 
know supplier development and local content has gone in terms of all 
our locomotive builds I make this comment that it unusual, I leave it at 
that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     May I enquire then, the table at page 208 
regarding the weightings, what is the – when you put it in the proposal 
where had you sourced that from what is the source of that table and 
the allocated weightings?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In preparing these documents 
10 
obviously I relied on multiple sources of information, both from my 
technical colleagues and in the procurement methodology from my 
colleagues in Supply Chain Service and various others.  I would have 
got the table from them or they would have inserted the table wi th me 
and we might have discussed this but I cannot be categoric as to say 
this was my exact source, except to say it would have generally come 
from Supply Chain Services themselves and often lifted out of existing 
(indistinct) documents.     
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Although you deal with it in a slightly 
different order but because we are already at that page can you deal 
20 
then with your issue at paragraph 40.6, I’m skipping 40.5 we’ll come 
back. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Right. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Simply because we are already on the 
relevant page. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 97 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And looking at the revised 
paragraph 90 sub paragraph D which is, Transnet will request a Quince 
range and that should read price range of between 30.5million and 
32million for the purpose of negotiation with the objective of coming in 
at 34.4million per locomotive, to which was added the comment, “which 
will be used as a guide as is dependent on forex fluctuation”.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay now in – let’s deal with that s tatement 
in two parts, let’s deal with the original statement and its meaning and 
then we will consider the effect and impact of the addition on the 
original statement.  Now your suggestion was a price range of between 
10 
30.5 to 32million coming in post nego tiations at around 34.34million per 
locomotive right.  Now my first question to you is, had your suggested 
price of 34.34million incorporated issued relating to forex escalations 
or forex – let me just – forex at all had it taken into consideration forex 
fluctuations at any point?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    The 34.4million if I may use the 
phrase was an “over the counter” price as at the June 2013 when I first 
did this business case or one of the versions of this business case, that 
was the “over the counter” price of the locomotive, that – ja was the 
“over the counter” price then.  The addition of the phrase which will be 
20 
used as a guide as is dependent on forex fluctuation adds a uncertainty 
and variable to the price which is totally unknown and enable s one to 
say, well it begs the question, how much is this locomotive going to 
cost.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So are we to understand you that if and I use 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 98 of 200 
 
a very loose phrase, Transnet were to go shopping as at the time you 
calculated 34.34million over the co unter put the cash they  would have 
received a locomotive at that price?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And if the locomotive was to be acquired, 
the same locomotive, in the future and particularly over an extended 
period being acquired in foreign currency the 34.34 would change in 
time taking into consideration the forex fluctuations?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The 34.34 is made up of two 
components. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :   The local component and the 
imported component.  To acquire the locomotive in the future the price 
will change, the local component will be escalated by factors CPI, 
consumer price index and similar type factors, hope to address that 
later.  The foreign component will be affected by two factors, primarily 
the rate of exchange either the rand/dollar if it is a dollar based 
locomotive rand/yen if it was Japanese or whatever currency is used for 
this supply and the escalation in the foreign country, in the overseas 
country.  Typically though that is a very small component United States 
20 
escalation was less than 2% so it had a negligible effect on the price of 
the locomotive.  Major factors being the rate of exchange on the foreign 
component and South African – and the CPI escalation on the local 
component. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So would it be a fair conclusion that on the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 99 of 200 
 
reading of this paragraph the proposal accepted the price of 34.34 it 
added that – except that, that 34.34 would be subject to forex – any 
forex fluctuations  going forward, would we be interpreting that phrase 
correctly, so  the only thing – only factor that would change or affect 
the 34.34million would be the forex fluctuation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Sorry if I’m not answering your 
question perhaps directly. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    That’s fine.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The statement in fact is 
incomplete.    
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because we used as a guide 
dependant on forex fluctuation and it’s excluding the loca l escalation it 
does not qualify where it’s coming from it is half an addition it is not a 
total component at this price it just introduces an element of ambiguity 
around this price which I cannot quantify to of what the author was 
thinking of when he put his price in – when he put this statement onto 
this price. This price was given as an “over the counter” price, 
shopping price for locomotive at that particular point in time.  If you 
want to talk to the price variations one has to be complete in one’s 
20 
talking to the price escalations not just a single component, so it 
introduces an element of ambiguity but I can’t talk to...(intervention).    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   But the point I seek to make is that this was 
going to the BADC.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.    
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 100 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Are we correct in our interpretation that 
what’s communicated to the BADC is that it’s 34.34million per 
locomotive subject only to forex fluctuation on its reading.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is – on its base reading 
that’s what’s going to the BADC yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     On its base reading that’s what’s 
going to BADC yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now we have dealt then with your issues 
raised in 40.1 to 40.6 an d overleaf at 10 you have 40.7 – paragraph 
10 
40.7 and for that you want us to refer to the same Annexure at typed 
page 20 and Chair that will be page 206 of the record.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Page 206 ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And you wanted to draw the Chair’s 
attention to something in particular at 206.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Forgive me if that is the correct 
reference I thought page 20 was changed as follows, please bear with 
me a moment while I just pick that one up.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, have you given a wrong reference?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It seems … 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Could – please have regard to page 198. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Right.  It is…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 62 at the bottom. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is page 12 sorry page 198. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  That is 198. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 101 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 198 my apologies  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is a wrong reference.  If I 
may talk to that then my paragraph 40.7.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which talks to the heading Extend 
to current 20 E contract for 95 CSR locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I did not pick that up.  That should 
read referenced to page 12 which is at – which is page 198 at the 
10 
bottom of page 198. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh 198, 198 yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Turning to the bottom of page 198 
when under the procurement options I mentioned previously that we 
identified the need then we explored the procurement options.  This 
procurement option was exploring extend the current 20 E contract for 
95 CSR locomotives.  I mentioned these are the locomotives on order.  
I explain there that the current – the 20 E currently on order is a 22 
tonne axil per GFE locomotive and is not intended for a heavy use on 
the coal export line.  That phrase has been deleted.  We turn over to 
20 
page 199.  I had – we had further written:  The first delivery is awaited 
the locomotive has still to be tested and is at pre sent unproven.  Only 
after extensive type testing will it be possible to say whether and to 
what extent it can replicate the heavy haul capabilities on the 19 E.  
That qualification has been removed importantly.  And that without that 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 102 of 200 
 
qualification may lead a reader unfamiliar with locomotives to say well 
thank you we can just extend to CSR 95.  Would lead that 
understanding to a reader unfamiliar with locomotive characteristics.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And does it not go further Mr Callard in a 
sense that you stated in the original document that the 20 E currently 
on order is a 22 tonne per axil locomotive, right?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is not intended for heavy haul?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct at the bottom of page 198. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 199 it states the first delivery is awaited 
10 
the locomotive has still to be tested and is at present unproven.  When 
you delete the two statements I have read the effect is to conceal from 
the reader that the 22 tonne per ax il locomotive is – has not yet been 
delivered and is yet to be tested and it presently remains unproven, is 
that not the case? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct.  These statements 
were in here specifically because they spoke to the procurement 
confinement conditions which was to say why we could not confine it to 
CSR.  Deleting these statements hides, disguises that fact from the 
reader and might lead a reader to presume that confinement to CSR is 
20 
in order. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Can we move on then to you paragraph 
41 of your statement and following?   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On paragraph 41 I talk that the 
base price of the locomotive was given in Japanese Yen.  This is 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 103 of 200 
 
because Mitsui Mars was a Japanese based company and obviously our 
rate of exchange was given into that locomotion was given in Japanese 
Yen.  With this confinement to CSR all the financial considerations and 
discussions in a memorandum were still left in Japanese Yen.  So it 
was most unusual to me that you are now changi ng the locomotive, you 
changing the country of supply from changing the country of supply one 
would change the foreign exchange rate which would be applicable 
which was now from Yen to Dollar but the memorandum perse was not 
changed at all which implies that I can only say that due thought was 
not given to the process of the memorandum with a full understanding 
10 
of its implications.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now the memorandum you provided when you 
were requested to work miracles you provided on Monday the 21 s t? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The changed memorandum comes back to you 
on Wednesday the 23 r d? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  21 s t, 22 n d, 23 r d correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In between the time you submitted the 
memorandum as requested and receipt of the changed memorandum 
were any consultations had with you – were you engaged in any form 
20 
regarding these changes?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  None whatsoever.  Receipt of this 
memorandum – receipt of the revised memorandum on the Wednes day 
morning was the first I became aware the first time I became aware of 
these changes.  There was no consultation with me or as far as I could 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 104 of 200 
 
establish with any of my technical colleagues who were involved in 
locomotives.  There was no discussion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we may as well find out now who you understood 
to be the one who made the decision that there must be these changes 
to your memorandum?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot talk Mr Chair to who made 
the decision whether it was an individual or a group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There is a trace of emails.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Between myself and various 
parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Including Garry Pita. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That indicate very strongly – 
suggest I think overwhelming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That Garry Pita was the author of 
the revised document. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   If I may refer you on that score? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Please to Annexure – sorry to the 
previous one, the original revised document which is – could we go to 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 105 of 200 
 
one page 161 please?   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are at 161. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Page 161 is the revised document 
that I received on the morning of Wednesday the 22 n d.  If we look at the 
bottom left hand corner of that document, the footer of that is, Vadic 
180 revised version 15 recall that I sent in versio n 14 1020 GPdoc ex.  
And it is a common practice that we have that if we are revising a 
document or we identify a document by initials.  I contend from the 
emails which we had distributed which included Mr Garry Pita with his 
10 
initials here that he was the author of this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The revised document.  I cannot 
say that it was his instruction, his idea.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say but I…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  You cannot say wh ether it was his decision 
or he was giving effect to somebody else’s decision.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying ja.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are saying the letters GP at the bottom of 
that page refer to Mr Garry Pita as far as you are concerned?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Every trail of evidence and logic in 
the emails of who it is being communicated to and the discussions I had 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 106 of 200 
 
had with the individuals highlight t hat it was or point to Garry Pita 
being the author of this document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Of the people with whom you were sharing this 
memoranda was there anyone other than Mr Garry Pita who had the 
initials GP?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was the only one? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  He was the only one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if I may then enquire – rehashing a bit 
10 
what we have dealt with.  And you received the reworked version from 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe as per your annexure FC7, is that correct?  That 
will be at page 158.  So much as it bears the initials of Mr Garry Pita at 
the bottom to identify the file the actual document is received by you 
from Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now could you indicate to the Chair if you do 
know whether Ms Mdleetshe was a subordinate of Mr Pita or what their 
professional relationship was within the organisation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Garry Pita as I understand it 
20 
and recall was at that time the Group Chief Procurement Officer.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Mr Thamsanqa Giani was 
Transnet’s Freight Rails Chief Procurement Officer.  Transnet Freight 
Rail as an operating division o f Transnet.  Each operating division had 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 107 of 200 
 
its own Chief Procurement Officer.  I cannot say explicitly the reporting 
relationships between Mr Giani and Mr Siyabonga Gama as the Group 
Chief Executive obviously there was a hierarchy because they were in 
the operational division.  However Group having a Group Chief 
Procurement Officer had certainly policy and oversight I believe 
account – a role to play in overall procurement it sets standards for 
procurement.  I do not know whether it was a full line or a dotte d line 
relationship it is my understanding that it was a dotted line relationship 
between Mr Garry Pita and Mr Thamsanqa Giani while Mr Thamsanqa 
Giani had a solid line relationship to Mr Siyabonga Gama.  That is in 
10 
[indistinct].  Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe was a  contract manager in Mr Giani’s 
office and she was the key go to person if I could put it for the 1064 
locomotives and in fact all the locomotives that we were dealing with all 
matters relating to locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But based on what you state in your 
paragraph 38 at page 9 as to who you circulated your original version 
to Mr Mdletshe was not one of the addressee’s there?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No she was not. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Would you know how she came to be in 
possession on the doc ument? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I can only – it would be a reasoned 
inference. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You cannot say.  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  That I – because I had sent 
versions of the word document to Mr Anoj Singh who had and I saw 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 108 of 200 
 
emailed – the email trails that my original word document from Mr Anoj 
Singh to Mr Pita.  I sent earlier version from the October versions to Mr 
Singh.  He also sent them onto Mr Pita.  I had sent word versions of my 
document to Mr Thamsanqa Giani and to Mr Siyabon ga Gama’s office.  I 
cannot say I have not traced how Ms Mdletshe got this version of the 
document to send to me. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you did say earlier on that there was a practice 
that your name or initials would appear at the  bottom of a document – 
of the document.  Now I do not know whether you said if you were 
10 
correcting a document or whether just – all the documents maybe the 
one who compiled that is the name that – the initials that would appear 
at the bottom, is that righ t? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  It was a practice which was not 
universally employed Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But it was often employed.  If I got 
a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I amended it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would put my initials at the back 
of the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That the original author would 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 109 of 200 
 
know this is my version amendment to the document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  And that would be at the bottom of a page 
in the same way that we see GP at page 161 on this document, is that 
in the same way or not?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would generally be in the file 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not all – it would not always 
appear in the document it would be in the file name.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I had the practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because I wished to always see 
traceability of the documents of putting the document file name in the 
bottom left hand corner.  That was one of my operating practices.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And so comes out here that we can 
pick up the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you – are you able to say whether Mr Garry 
Pita was also in the habit of putting his initials at the bottom of a 
20 
document that he had put comments on or are you not able to say?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I cannot say whether he was in the 
habit of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot yes ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Cannot say. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 110 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But sometimes he did or you are not sure even 
of that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I – I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot say? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But then the file name would suggest that Mr 
Garry Pita did – effected the amendments just looking at the file path at 
the bottom. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  By inclusion of the initials GP? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  However you did receive this amended version 
from Mr Garry Pita you received it from Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  If then we may proceed again we 
are still at paragraph 44 you – page 10 my apologies.  You have now 
executed the request or the instruction given you by Ms Mdletshe and 
that you have inserted into the document the proposal, the slide that 
she requested you to do at page 158? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second – one second.  By the way did Mr 
Mdletshe say to you in the email whether she had been asked by 
somebody else to ask you to effect the changes?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No if we go back to 7  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 158? 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 111 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 158.  Which was the email 
from Ms Mdletshe.  She just said: 
“Hi Francis, please see the attached slide evaluation 
methodology that needs to be incorporated in the 
word documents under 84.  Please incorpor ate the 
changes you did last night.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There was no discussion about the 
fundamental changes to the document.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the purpose of sharing the document with 
you was for you to insert into the document a slide?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It was not for you to engage with the changes 
effected? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You happened to learn that as you worked 
through the document? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 112 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you confirm that you did insert the slide 
and you say you did – did you align the document I think you mentioned 
something like that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Perhaps just to give context to how 
this arose. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I use a very structured format of 
word to compile a document.  If one is unfamiliar with the intricacies of 
word – of word documents of shortcut cut keys and styles and style 
10 
headings to achieve a consistent look and feel through the document it 
is very difficult for another person to effect those changes neatly in the 
document.  That is why Ms – Ms Mdletshe could not incorporate the 
document without may I say messing up the entire look and feel.  So 
the easiest thing for her to do and this is a very reasoned inference:  
Francis your document – here is a slide please fix it up.  And that is 
why she sent it to me. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay now – and you effected those changes?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I effected those changes yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You say at paragraph 38 now let us retrace a 
20 
bit.  You were requested to work miracles.  You did.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Together with your team and you say at 38 
that you provided a revised version in PDF format to Mr Gama?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 113 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You go further to say you then provided a 
word version to Mr Gama’s PA, Mr Singh’s PA and to Mr Thamsanqa 
Giani? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On Tuesday yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Why did you provide the PDF version in the 
one hand and then you provided the word version to those PA’s on the 
other hand? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is generally common practice.  
Having worked on a docu ment like this over the weekend there were 
going to be inevitably changes that needed to be made.  I could not say 
10 
categorically that I had effected everything or that the document was 
perfect in every way and if somebody needed to correct a spelling, dot 
an I, cross a t, that is what you need the word document for  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I circulated the word document 
as widely as possible to Mr Gama and Mr Singh that would have – that 
was just standard practice because I knew they wanted it.  I cannot 
recall whether it was a request or to send it to Mr Giani.  I am sure it 
was because otherwise I cannot recall why I would have sent it on the 
Tuesday.  I am sure it was a request to send it to him.  But I must admit 
20 
I did not think anything about it because when we are dealing with 
documents like that in a collaborative format one shares the word 
format otherwise you are forcing every change to come back to you as 
an individual and you can be a bottleneck for the changes and a. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Now… 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 114 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja so it is a collaborative effort.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I take it this would not have been your first 
proposal within the organisation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No not at all. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In the past when you finalised a document 
and you sent it out to those must receive it and they make changes are 
these final changes or are they proposed changes? What subsequently 
happens regarding engagement with you on the suggested changes?  
Or is it a case of you forwards it, changes are made and that becomes 
the final document, what is the standard practice?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I answer that it depends.  And 
it depends on the nature of the changes.  There was one document 
which I had and it was signed by Mr Gama said forward, group came 
back and said we have taken out his signature please resend the 
document because they only wanted it signed if I understand correctly 
by Mr Singh and Mr Molefe.  That is fine, thank you.  That is an 
administrative change or there might be a spelling correction or one or 
two things. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If there was a substantive change 
20 
to the meaning of the document or a flaw in the argument or the tables 
or the calculations then it would have come back to me and they would 
have said please fix.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now in the event you do not agree with those 
substantive changes what would happen?  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 115 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This was the first time that this 
happened. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I take it you did not agree with the 
amendments made to your proposal?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I looked at this and I must admit I 
was taken aback by these amendments and I said this will not work.  
When I read this revised  document through all the arguments which we 
have been through here I said this is not right, this is flawed, it is 
flawed in thinking and it is flawed in execution it was my…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your understanding of Ms Mdletshe’s email to 
10 
you in regard to these changes that all that was contemplated was that 
you just effected the changes as opposed to consider them and let us 
hear what you have to say if you have any views on them?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct, correct.  Ms Mdletshe I – 
sent it to me just to execute those changes and send it back to her and 
that was all she contemplated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And that is what you did?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is what I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay now by – at this juncture you have 
20 
applied your mind to the whole document and the changes effected and 
from paragraph 44 at page 9 you state what you then did having learnt 
of these significant changes made to your document?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please tell the Chair. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 116 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  If I may?  As I said I was taken 
back by these unilateral changes that was the Wednesday.  I had 
already said it was prior authorised I was not consulted.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I did not know what to make of 
these changes I deliberated long and hard.  I slept on it.  On Thursday 
afternoon I email Mr Gama and Mr Giani expressing my concern at 
these unilateral changes in this business case memorandum.  In 
respect of the 19 E – that it implied reading of the revised business 
case that this was changing a 19 E type heavy haul locomotive to an 
10 
unspecified general freight locomotive to be awarded to CSR.  And that 
email is in Annexure 9. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if we go then turn to Annexure 9 that will 
be at your page 216. Page 216 Chair.  Thank you.  Yes we there.  We 
found the email. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Would you like me to read it or talk 
to it? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I would like you to talk to it and if there i s 
anything in particular you would like to read into the record you may do 
so. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I may then talk to it because the 
email is in the record. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Obviously I did not know what to 
do and I prefaced this – this is a difficult email to write and I noticed 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 117 of 200 
 
the changes and I highlight that there was a significant risk in these 
changes.  I point out that the changes effected project Shongololo and 
Project Shongololo was a project which M r Pragasen Pillay was the 
name which we had given to this project for the optimisation of the 
operations on the coal line which was dependent on standardising his 
fleet with the 19 E locomotives we had just given – it had this name 
Project Shongololo and it would have improved very – many of the 
operational aspects of the coal line.  I point out the characteristics of 
the 19 E locomotives, the 22 tonnes per axil and their power and how 
they intercommunicate with each other.  If I may stress and just point 
10 
out that the locomotives operate in what we call a consist, many trains.  
You couple a number of locomotives together to get the requisite power 
to haul the train.  For these locomotives to operate in a consist they 
need to talk to each other.  They need to  talk a common language over 
a set of wires which interconnects the locomotive.  These 19 E 
locomotives used a Toshiba T Internet capability but that just talks to 
the language that they spoke in the locomotives.  I highlighted that this 
business case as modified did not explicitly specified the locomotive 
but I used the phrase if a current and delivered design is the criteria 
then it is the 20 E because that was all we had from CSR.  And then I 
20 
highlighted why that locomotive would not meet the requirement s 
because it is a 22 tonne per axil it has less power and it was specified 
as a general freight locomotive for all those reasons.  Furthermore I 
highlighted the locomotives cannot interoperate with the 19 E unless we 
achieve some standard inter operational  capability which would cost 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 118 of 200 
 
some additional amount of money.  I then further went on to say that 
and talk to an aspect of loco design. I said the new locos are a coko 
design and it would have a further implication in the – in the design and 
testing.  I then also spoke to concerns around Transnet Engineering 
and their assembly of locomotives because they had not yet produced a 
20 E locomotive and this would come afterwards essentially I just listed 
a whole range of conditions as to why this was not going to  work. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And these factors you list at your paragraph 
46 at page 11 of your statement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes they are highlighted in 
10 
paragraph 46. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this email is directed to Mr Siyabonga 
Gama and Mr Thams anqa Giani? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: What then transpired after you sent this email?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Later that afternoon I got a phone 
call from Mr Giani to the effect of, why did I send this email?  And I 
said, because these locomotives will not work.  That was the substance 
of the conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have thought that from the email it is clear 
20 
that you were giving them the benefit of your concerns so that they 
know you have certain concerns?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The exact point Mr Chair.  The 
conversation did not address any of the technical or substantive points 
that I had raised now in my email.  It was and please I paraphrase this 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 119 of 200 
 
after many years but it is collectively burnt in my  memory.  Why did you 
send this email?   
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did you tell him?  You should have told him 
it is clear from the email I am expressing my concerns.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What – I said they will not work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that is where the conversation 
effectively ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you receive a response to your email at 
10 
page 216?  A formal response to the issues you had raised?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not from Mr Giani. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you receive a response from Mr Gama?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes I received a response from Mr 
Gama and I address that on  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 11 of your statement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Is it an email you received or a – or what did 
you receive from …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No I received – it comes later.  I 
20 
received a sms from Gama and it is item para 64 on page 13. But the 
implications that I would – perhaps you have some thin gs before that 
before we get there? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But to my question whether you received any 
response by email as you had sent out this email.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 120 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, no. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  From either of the recipients the answer is 
no? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.  No email response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me go 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Formal response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me go back to your last conversation, telephone 
conversation with Mr Giani.  Did you have an understanding as to wha t 
the basis of his complaint was about the fact that you have sent this 
email to him and Mr Gama?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not at the time.  Only later.  When 
one connected the dots. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes as far as you knew then was there anything that 
precluded you from sending anything directly to Mr Gama and Mr Giani 
if you had – you wanted to convey something?  Did you have to go via 
somebody else or anything like that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No not at all.  The nature of my 
working relationship particularly in these business cases and the like I 
had may I say free access to Mr Gama, Mr Singh, Mr Pita, Mr Giana.  I 
had free access virtually to everybody in the organisation except Mr 
20 
Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But for – with all the rest around 
the development of these business cases.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ys. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 121 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I could phone, sms and or email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Directly and my email [indistinct].  
CHAIRPERSON:  And there have never been any problem.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Never any problems with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Objection expressed by Mr Giani?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.  What I did do if I sent perhaps 
a contentious email or one of concern I would keep m y direct reporting 
superiors informed either copying them on the email or saying this is 
what happened but I was fortunate and privileged to have that direct 
10 
access. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you understand Mr Giani’s objection to be about 
the content of your email or to be about anything else?  So if you had 
been communicating with him directly and with Mr Gama directly 
whenever you had something to communicate and there had been no 
problem why was it a problem this time?  Was it about the content as 
you understood it? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the time that I received the 
phone call shortly after – almost very shortly after sending the email I 
did not understand or have context to any reasons to why Mr Giani had 
20 
said why did you send that email, at that time . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Subsequent events both through 
emails with which I was involved in the like I came to understand why 
there was a concern to that email but I did not understand his 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 122 of 200 
 
telephone call to me at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the time of his call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Strange phone call.  What is – 
strange phone call – do not understand why – what is wrong – it is – 
that is the reality, why you complaining about it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Please I am paraphrasing but that 
is really – it was my sentiment at time.  I – what is wrong? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will that be dealt with later?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I was going to say Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It appears – it is drawn to my attention we are 
encroaching on your lunch break so perhaps we will address those 
issues afterward lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If we may break for lunch?  Is that suit you 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the lunch adjournment now and we will 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 123 of 200 
 
resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Ms  Sello. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Before we – we proceed as 
– as a housekeeping matter could I enquire are we going until f our – 
sitting for an extended period today?  
CHAIRPERSON:  If the witness does not have a problem and you do 
10 
not have a problem let us go up to half past four.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Half past four? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Is that fine with you?  Is that fine with you? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair.  That is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it fine?  It would be fine with you Mr  Callard? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would be fine with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now Mr Callard when we broke for lunch we 
20 
were at your page 11 – page 11 of your statement and – and we had 
just finalised the discussion on the email you had sent to Mr  Gama and 
Mr Jiyane expressing your concerns regarding he amended pr oposal? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You intermated to the Chairperson that 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 124 of 200 
 
subsequent to these events certain email communication came to you 
attention regarding these matters?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and that communication highlighted 
certain things to you.  You deal with this from paragraph 48 at page 11?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Could you take us through the documents you 
subsequently became aware of?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you and certainly Chair and 
it was during the preparation of my statement that the Commission 
10 
provided me with three very pertinent emails which an incredible 
bearing on what I had previously said.  I had sent this email  on the 
afternoon of Thursday afternoon that was the 23 r d to Mr Gama and 
Mr Jiyane but the three emails that came to my attention are 
respectively and if I may take you please to – to Annexure 10.  The first 
one from Gama to Singh – from Mr Gama to Mr Singh – apologies for 
that and this late on the evening of the 23 r d.  It was a 22 minutes past 
nine and effectively Mr Gama to Mr Singh says: 
“Hi Mr Singh, I am afraid the submission on the 100 
locomotives is a mess and will need to be 
20 
withdrawn.” 
The rest of that email is a restatement of my problem of what I had 
emailed earlier and effectively and succinctly summarises the concerns 
I had raised.  The bottom line of this email is the last paragraph.  
“That any argument therefore on the 20E ought to 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 125 of 200 
 
have been a GFB argument which means we 
accelerate GFB but we need to go out on tender for 
19E type locomotives.”  
The last point: 
“The 20E locomotive is not a heavy haul locomotive 
and a less powerful locomotive than the 19E.”  
Effectively the upshot of this is that Mr  Singh – Mr Gama realises the 
import of my mail immediately and alerts Mr  Singh to this mail.  The 
second one around this and this is Annexure 11 which is from Mr  Singh 
to Mr Gama and that is on Friday morning 07:02 and let us recall that 
10 
the BADC Meeting is taking place later that morning where this matter 
is to be discussed and – and Mr Singh to Mr Gama.  It says: 
“Let us discuss this in the morning, thanks.”  
Effectively acknowledging and – and acknowledging the import of this 
mail.  If I could then take you to Annexure 12 which also has reference 
to this and this is on – again on Friday morning at 7 o’ clock where 
Mr Singh addresses Mr Molefe and forwards Mr  Gama’s mail to 
Mr Molefe for your information.  So effectively the upshot of this is that 
the top echelon in the organisation were aware of my concerns and 
Mr Gama had effectively internalised and articulated and from his mail 
20 
was in full and complete understanding of my concerns.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before lunch did you – did you deal with the question 
whether Mr Gama responded to you in anyway – responded to that 
email of yours in anyway?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I had no email correspondence 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 126 of 200 
 
from him whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Telephone call? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  I had a SMS message from 
Mr Gama … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And this is covered on – if I may 
just jump to that counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes sir. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR:  In answer to that.  Thank you.  If I 
10 
could take you through to 54 please on page 13 – paragraph 54 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I received an SMS from 
Mr Gama in response to my email of the 23 r d and his email stating: 
“I have just seen your email.  I will explain to you 
the GCEs thinking.” 
And that was it.  This was not followed up.  I took note of the email – 
sorry – of the SMS left it at that but the observation which I make from 
that is his comment – Mr Gama’s comment that he – I have just seen 
your email. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cannot be true? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because on the same day that he received it he – he 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 127 of 200 
 
sent an email to Mr Singh about it? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The exact point of 54.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and in the sequence of events that SMS 
you refer to at paragraph 54 comes on 4  February? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and a lot happened between 23 May 
which is when you generated the email and the SMS received on 
10 
4 February? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In that intervening time on 24  May 
we had the BADC Meeting and the Board Meeting which effectively – no 
which not effectively – but which approved the memorandum and the 
confinement of the locomotives to CSR but I think that you will 
(intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will deal with it right now.  Thank you and 
in fact the BADC Meeting of the 24 t h which if we could – we could 
recollect when Mr Gama asked you to make certain changes to the 
proposal to increase the number of diesel locomotives from 60 to 80 he 
20 
indicated 
in 
that 
email 
that 
presentation 
was 
scheduled 
for 
24 January 2014 before BADC and that is the date you are trying  to 
beat.  Correct? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  His – sorry if I understand your 
question correctly.  His SMS to me on Friday afternoon of the 18 t h was 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 128 of 200 
 
we had to meet the BADC Meeting on Friday the 24h.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, sorry. 18 January.  So we are all trying to 
beat the BADC Meeting of the 24 t h? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you deal with that BADC Meeting at your 
paragraph 49 at page …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  12? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You …  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may proceed please. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The BADC Meeting was held on 
24 January and Annexure 13 and I can record that this – the minutes of 
this were provided to me by the Zondo Commission.  The minutes of the 
BADC Meeting on 24 January Annexure 13 – if we may just turn to that 
please which is page …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  227. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  227.  The minutes themselves are 
on 228. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  From 228 I note from these 
meetings that per 1.4 of 228 that in partial attendance was 
Mr S I Gama, Mr T Jiyane and in full attendance was Mr – under 1.2 – 
Mr Molefe and Mr Singh were in attendance at th at meeting. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 129 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Mr Garry Pita on 1.2 … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Garry Pita was … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  G Pita there is that Mr Garry Pita? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That G – Mr G Pita – yes is 
Mr Garry Pita – Group Supply Chain Officer. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then while we are still then dealing with 
the composition of that committee we understand Mr  Sharma was the 
Chairperson? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As per the minutes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes and the third name listed there 
10 
Mr M E Mkhwanazi is listed as a member.  Do you know who 
Mr M E Mkhwanazi was? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The only Mr M E Mkhwanazi who I 
know of that name who would have been at this meeting was 
Mr Mafika Mkhwanazi who was the Chairman of the Board . 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now you brought us then to – to 
Annexure 13. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The point then beyond this is if 
one then goes to page 232 of those minutes where they discuss the 
acquisition of the 100 class 19E electric and 60 class  43 diesel 
20 
locomotives under paragraph 5.2 of page 232.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes and what in particular would you like to 
draw the Chair’s attention to at 5.2?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well the first thing I would like to 
draw attention to is that despi te the attendance of those three parties 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 130 of 200 
 
who were fully aware now of the concerns which I had expressed those 
concerns were not reflected …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In the minutes of the BADC 
Meeting at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Callard.  I can see 5.1.2 but I think you 
are talking about – you are dealing with 5.2.  What page is that?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  232 Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  232. 
CHAIRPERSON:  232? 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  232. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  Going through the 
paragraphs 5.2.1 is administrative.  They took them through that.  
Paragraph 5.2.2 - at the bottom of that page – is the discussion that 
took place around the procurement.  The point around that discussion 
is that nowhere in that discussion were the concerns that I raised 
20 
brought to the attention of the meeting as a potential risk to this 
transaction by any of the parties present who had full knowledge now of 
those risks which I had raised. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we know where – do we know whether prior to this 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 131 of 200 
 
meeting the documentation that the Board Committee had received in 
relation to this issue included the amended memorandum and whether it 
was a memorandum that contained the same changes that we have 
dealt with or whether there was any further – there were any further 
changes arising out of your concerns?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
The 
memorandum 
that 
was 
presented to the Board Mr  Chair is Annexure 14 page 244 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And if we turn to page 267 which is 
the signatures of that memorandum recommending confinement to CSR 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We will see or note that it is 
signed by Mr Anoj Singh on the 21 s t – sorry – on the 14 t h – correction - 
on 21/01/2014 i.e. that would be 21  January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is signed by Mr Molefe dated 
21 January.  What is interesting about these signatures is 21  January 
was the Monday of the preceding – of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Week before.  That was…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That was before your - your email of your concerns as 
well? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Before the email of my concerns.  
Before the email – before this memorandum had even been finalised.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 132 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It predates the finalisation of that 
email.  The email … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  I am not sure if I understand that.  Your email to 
Mr Gama and Mr Jiyane in which you expressed your concerns about 
amendments to the memorandum you had compiled was…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sent on the 23 r d.  Is it not? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Was sent on the 23 r d yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Which would be a day after Mr  Brian Molefe had 
10 
signed … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This one and two days after Mr  Singh had signed this 
memorandum at page 267?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I take you back Mr  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The revised memorandum – the 
memorandum I prepared on the Monday …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Recommended confinement to 
20 
MARS.  On the 21 s t I recommended confinement to MARS.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Monday being the 21 s t? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Monday the 21 s t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may correct us. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 133 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I apologise Chair.  I think it is Monday  the 
20 t h. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry – the Monday the 20 t h. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Monday the 20 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The Wednesday the 22 n d the 
morning … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of Wednesday the 22 n d I get this 
revised memorandum …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  From Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Where we are still then busy 
revising the memorandum and putting the document in …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I only sent that document to 
20 
her later on – on the Wednesday morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So this document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Could not have been ready …  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 134 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For signature on the 21 s t or the 
22 n d … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because it was still in preparation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Is the point I was making. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now assuming that this document reflects the 
changes that you were asked to make?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It does indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you say it does? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you and maybe to go back to the point which 
was the subject of my original question this document therefore being 
the document that was  placed before the Board Committee in substance 
did it contain the same amendments about which you had expressed 
concern? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It contained …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The substance. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
The 
same 
amendments 
in 
substance confinement to MARS for the same reasons.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, thank you.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair if I may just check with Mr  Callard I am 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 135 of 200 
 
not sure if he understood your question.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair’s question was whether the 
document which is annexed as 14 …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Contained the amendments made to the 
original proposed MARS confinement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let me put it again.  Mr Callard you were sent 
by Ms Mdletshe. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your memorandum that you had prepared but with 
suggested changes …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or changes that you were asked to make and you had 
concerns about the changes that yo u were asked to make. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You sent an email to Mr Gama and Mr Jiyane about 
your concerns? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my question in regards to this was simply whether 
20 
in substance this document that was placed before the Board 
Committee contained the same changes which had caused you the 
concerns which you had articulated to Mr  Gama and Mr Jiyane and my 
understanding is that you say that is so.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Absolutely correct Chair. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 136 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It contains the same changes in 
substance …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To which I raised my concerns …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To Mr Jiyane … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And to Mr Singh … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And without testifying to every dot 
and T but it is essentially the changes that I received from 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe in that mail to which I expres sed my concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair and perhaps because we are 
already on this document it may be appropriate to deal with it at this 
juncture.  Mr Callard if you refer to page 257 of your statement.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  25 …? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Seven and starting at paragraph 69.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Sello.  Earlier on you made the point 
Mr Callard that the – I think it was Mr Brian – no, no Mr Singh.  The 
page on which he signed the document we have just been talking about 
that was placed before the Board Committee.  It appears to have been 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 137 of 200 
 
signed on 21 January 2014 and I think it was in regard to him that you 
were saying the document could not have been signed on the 21 s t 
because on the 21 s t he would not – I assume you say – have received 
the document as amended by – well as given effect to the amendments 
having been given effect to by you that were suggested to you?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, the amended document …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The amended document, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Came later? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the question I wanted to ask was whether it was 
not possible that – it would not have been possible for the – for 
somebody not to wait for – for you to effect the changes but to go 
ahead and make the chances on their own computer.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of course that is – that possibility 
does exist and it is a possibility Mr  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Someone else could have …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Made all those changes without 
20 
waiting for me …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Given them to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Singh and Mr Molefe to sign … 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 138 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On the 21 s t … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which should have meant that the 
mail from Ms Mdletshe to me on the 22 n d … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Was a waste of time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Or just a total miscommunication.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Say that it is not possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if – if that was done then it is possible but – but if 
they waited for your ones then it would not be possible?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And let us take that discussion to its logical 
conclusion Mr Callard if you permit me.  Please refer to page 260 and 
that - that is the signed proposal to BADC?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 87 – just a second. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 87 what is that table and how did it 
get to be part of this document?  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 139 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you not you say we must go to 260?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paragraph 87.  I do apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, not page. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 260. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paragraph 87.  At paragraph 87 there is a 
table? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There is a table yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can – do you know who inserted that table 
into the document? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To the best of my recollection that 
I did that but I would just like to confirm that to the document which I 
received from Ms Mdletshe which I think is Annexure 13 – sorry – 
Annexure …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 5 I think. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 5. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry, sorry.  Let me not confuse you.  We are 
looking for Annexure 7 which starts at 157.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 7. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Annexure 7 itself is a n email from 
20 
Ms Mdletshe. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mdletshe, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Requesting you to find the evaluation 
methodology that needs to be incorporated in the Word document.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Right.  If one could – thank you – 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 140 of 200 
 
if one could – if I could refer you please to pages 177 and 178.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  This is the document received from 
Ms Mdletshe on the Wednesday morning and you will see significant 
gaps on page 177 and 178 where the document obviously needs to be 
formulated and a slide inserted and that is what happened when I 
inserted the evaluation methodology slide into the document.  It was 
fine to (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So by reason of that you are able to say the 
10 
document that Mr Singh and Mr Brian Molefe signed that - which I 
referred to a few minutes ago - you are able to say it is the document 
that came from you after you had been asked to effect changes?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes unless as you – one cannot 
exclude the possibility that there was somebody else with all the 
knowledge … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Printed it on the side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  One cannot exclude that possibility 
20 
but otherwise it is  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say on the probabilities?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On the balance of probabilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I then also just direct one to 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 141 of 200 
 
the final point that if one looks at on page – again on page 260 right at 
the bottom – bottom left it says: 
“BADC 160 final.” 
So even after my document was inserted there were still subsequent 
changes to this because it has now been changed from version 15GP …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which I amended …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To somebody – somebody has still 
worked on it to BADC 160 final. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair and to the question whether 
or not this document reflected the concerns you had raised about 
confinement to CSR the – the document at Annexure 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe if you say reflects the concerns it might 
be ambiguous. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is reflects …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will restate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It reflects the issues that …  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It reflects …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Gave rise to his concerns. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is a completely wrong question I posed.  It 
reflects the changes made to your original doc ument (intervenes)? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In substance yes. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 142 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now in that regard I would like to refer 
you to page 256 … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – I just last my page.  Chair if you – if 
you would bear with me – and with reference to our Annexure 8 page 
256 from paragraph 66. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  25 – from paragraph 60. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Have you located it? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have 256 – 256 paragraph 66. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  From paragraph 66. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On page 256? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A comparison of the – from paragraph 68 – 
confinement of 100 electric locomotives.  With your Annexure 8 – which 
is where you indicated changes were made - and that will be on page 
199 appear to be the same.  Meaning that the latter document seems to 
have incorporated the very CSR changes introduced.  Would I be 
correct? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That would be correct.  If we look 
20 
at paragraph 69 that is at the first reading the same as paragraph 67.  
Paragraph 68 addressing the urgency is missing from the approved 
version.  The version – paragraph 70 – complimenting the urgency is in 
and it is the same in style and  substance as the page 201 which was 
the changed document I received from Ms  Mdletshe.  So confirming in 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 143 of 200 
 
substance it is the same. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At least insofar as confinement to CSR is 
concerned? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Confinement to CSR yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You will recall Mr Callard that we were dealing 
with the actual minute of the – of BADC … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before – before we dealt with these issues 
and we were at page 232 …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  232. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in particular item 5.2.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  232? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2.2 - 5.2.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The annexure of the minutes?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure would be Chair Annexure 13.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you were saying we  were going there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you were saying we were going to the 
minutes? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes the minutes at – it is Annexure 13 starting 
20 
at 277. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the particular page is page 232 and you 
were at paragraph 5.2.2 on page …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 144 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now I am going to try and - and deconstruct 
this and I would like to have your comments.  The first entry there 
states: 
“Management in …” 
And I quote. 
“Management informed the Committee that it was 
decided that a 26 heavy haul line by GE would 
perform better than a Class 19E locomotive by 
Mitsui.” 
Just can you comment on that in particular?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  Consistent …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In regard to GE please – reference to GE. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Consistent 
throughout 
this 
paragraph GE should have read CSR and CSR should read GE 
consistent throughout this approval of the 100 locomotives.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are saying they got mixed up?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They got mixed up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They got swapped around there. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They got mixed up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then if we – we will read GE for 
20 
purposes of this convers ation not CSR for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No we must read as it is ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It says: 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95

“Management informed the committee that it was 
decided that a 26 heavy haul line by …”  
You suggest: 
“…CSR would perform better than a Class 19E 
locomotive by Mitsui.”  
My question to you is do you know who and by whom it was decided 
that that 26 ton heavy haul line by SCR would perform better than the 
19E Mitsui? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot put a name to wh en you 
ask by who. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you say this – where this GE – where it 
says GE in that sentence and in the rest of the paragraph it should be 
saying CSR? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where it says CSR it shou ld say GE?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on that very point before I deal with the 
other issues.  If you go further into the body of that paragraph 
Mr Callard at line 6 – at the end of line 5 – a statement starts: 
20 
“Management requested for a contract extension for 
Class 43E diesel locomotives by CSR.”  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :    Which should read an extension 
or Class 43 diesel locomotives by GE, that’s what it should read.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And you – so the diesel locomotives were to 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 146 of 200 
 
be supplied by GE, and the electric locomotives by CSR.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     But when you – you say when you read that 
paragraph there is an inversion there, there’s a bit of confusion, so 
where see GE we must read CSR and conversely where we see CSR we 
must read GE. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, getting back then to the start of the 
document the second proposition made here is and it’s s tated, “further 
it seemed that CSR, written GE, I’ll read CSR, delivers faster than 
10 
Mitsui”, do you have a comment on that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Yes I have a comment, the 
comment is correct but one questions its relevance because CSR, and 
it was known at the time, is a major supplier of locomotives in China 
and they have the capacity, it was passage talk, that they could 
produce a thousand locomotives a year, that is a considerable number 
of locomotives.  So they have the capacity to produce, the  relevance, 
however, is they are then produced in China and not in South Africa 
and then would not meet any of the local supplier development and/or 
local content prescriptions which would be in place for the import of the 
20 
locomotives.  So to make the stat ement that CSR can produce 
locomotives at that rate, however, in China, when it should be applied 
to South Africa is questionable.  Further at this time the – no 
locomotive from CSR had been produced in South Africa, the production 
line in Transnet Enginee ring was still being set up. We have heard, and 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 147 of 200 
 
I’ve spoken to the one locomotive that was imported from China and 
undergoing prototype testing, the first 10 locomotives of that 95 were 
coming from China, nothing had been delivered here in South Africa.  
So then to posit that we could have a rapid production line here in 
South Africa when it had not even been set up would be – was a false 
statement.  This statement that they could produce a hundred 
locomotives but in China, I contend is designed to confuse and mislead. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Would it make sense what they were saying about – 
in terms of local skills development if the locomotives – if you were not 
doing it in South Africa or it could make sense depending on certain 
10 
things, you said you question – you said it’s questionable and I’m just 
trying to see whether that’s as far as you can take it?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I make an inference and I stress 
that it’s an inference.  The members of the Board generally are not 
familiar with locomotive procurement and locomotive supply and would 
take statements from management at face-value as being these are true 
and correct and give a full and true picture of where we should be, 
taking the organisation and doing it.  If a statement is made in this 
context to a Board which is not informed of the detail or knowledgeable 
of the detail around locomotive supply the first inference that the Board 
20 
will make, well thank you this is kosher unless they knew different.  
There is a fiduciary duty on management to info rm the Board of all 
relevant risks to our transaction in a enterprise such as Transnet.  Two 
points arise from here, one, the Board and/or BADC – sorry BADC in 
this case was not informed of the significant risks to which members 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 148 of 200 
 
now were already alerted so there was a failure – I content a serious 
failure of fiduciary duty at that level, the second, in what was put 
forward here as a rationale for confining to China in the fact that they 
could deliver was misleading in that the Board would not have known or 
been able to realise that this was China and not South Africa.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you Mr Callard, the next issue is still 
at 522 and it states, I read from the third line that would be the third 
sentence on the third line and I quote, “management motivated for the 
confinement in favour of GE we know to read CSR now, this motivated 
10 
by a submission that was previously withdrawn due to reputational risk 
issues that had emanated from an old newspaper article.  My question 
to you is, are you aware of a submission motivating for confinement to 
CSR that was withdrawn?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   I know of no motivation to a – no 
submission that motivated a confinement to CSR that was withdrawn.  
The one which we do know of is the motivation which recommended a 
confinement 
to 
Mitsui 
in 
October 
that 
was 
withdrawn 
and 
...(intervention).   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So if we read that paragraph further then 
20 
skipping a line and going on to the next sentence I read,  
 
“the Chairperson stated  that the previous submission was 
 
withdrawn prior to the commencement of the 27 October 2013 
 
meeting due to concerns that the confinement was proposed 
 
for class 19E locomotives from Mitsui (which had won a 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 149 of 200 
 
 
contract into 006)”.   
 
It’s a point that you make that the one you know that was 
withdrawn was confining to Mitsui.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So the one that was confining to Mitsui 
cannot be the one previously referred to as having been withdrawn that 
would be a second one because that confines to CSR.  The only one 
you know is the one confining to Mitsui?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The only one I know of is the 
one confined to Mitsui yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Then it continues and again I read,  
 
“the company extended the contract of 15E locomotives in 
 
2010 and again confined to the same supplier.  Media raised 
 
concern that the company had approved two confinements 
 
since the 2006 contract award, however, the company had 
 
never confined to CSR therefore there should be no adverse 
 
publicity”,  
 
and I’ll stop there, do you have a comment to that motivation 
for confinement to CSR?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :   My only comment is that it’s an 
20 
unusual reason for confining to a firm on the basis of publicity i f the 
reasons are sound and curtained then one can deal with the publicity, if 
the reasons are not sound and curtained  one cannot deal with the 
publicity is the only comment I can make to that.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you, if we then continue on, it 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 150 of 200 
 
concludes by stating, 
 
“The 
proposed 
confinement 
was 
in 
compliance 
to 
the 
 
provisions of the approved procurement procedure manual”,  
 
I won’t ask for your comment at this juncture, I’d like you to 
comment on a further statement, last line of 232 the statem ent that 
starts, 
 
“assurance was given to the committee that the confinement 
 
process was audited by TIA”, 
 
What is TIA? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Transnet Internal Audit. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Have you had sight of the audit by TIA?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes I have and I believe that is 
Annexure – that is...(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Mr Callard, while you search, let’s look at 
232 and I’ll remind you with reference to another document, it says,  
 
“assurance was given to the comm ittee that the confinement 
 
process was audited by TIA”, 
 
Have you ever seen a report by TIA regarding its audit of the 
confinement process? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    I have no sight of – had no sight 
20 
of, am unaware of any report, I stress the word, r eport, by TIA on the 
confinement process and I use the word process deliberately.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     You said earlier on that whatever CSR appears in 
that paragraph, namely 5.2.2 which should read GE does that ap ply 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 151 of 200 
 
also the sentence towards the end of paragraph 232 that says, however 
the company has never confined to CSR, would – was that one also 
intended to be GE that CSR?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Mr Chairman in my reading of 
this and reading of this par agraph I believe CSR is there used in the 
correct context. 
CHAIRPERSON: In its correct context?     
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In it’ correct context.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.    
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Because the company had not 
10 
previously confined to CSR, the 95 locomotives previously referred to 
had been one on open tender, there had been no confinement to CSR 
so I believe in that instance it is in its correct context.  
CHAIRPERSON: Okay but for the rest incorrect okay.     
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   And the second – the subsequent 
one, if I may on the third line, “CRS had the capacity to produce5 locos 
a day – locomotives a day”,   is also in its correct context of CSR.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And taking that sentence further, that is 
where you say there was a claim that it can continue – produce or here 
20 
it says it can therefore produce a hundred locomotives for the company 
within a short space...(intervention).  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :   Short space of time yes but that is 
in China.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     In China, you say – you indicated that you 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 152 of 200 
 
have never seen this report by Internal Audit auditing the confinement 
process. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.     
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     As dated here, please refer to your 
supplementary Bundle BB4(c) the small Bundle in the folder and in 
particular I’d like to refer you to page two of that paragraph 6.  At 
paragraph 6 of your supplementary statement you seek to introduce a 
further document to your statement.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And this you have marked Annexure 13(a).  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And Chair that document 13(a) is to be 
found at page 8 of the supplementary statement.  Now having regard to 
what you stated paragraph 6.1 of your supplementary affidavit, please 
explain to the Chair what this document that it’s proposed marked 
Annexure 13(a) is? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Annexure 13(a) is an email from 
Andre Botha from Transnet internal audit, I do not know his then 
designation suffice that the email and all the contents leave no doubt 
that he is from Transnet internal audit and it is to Anoj Singh with a 
20 
copy to Gary Pita and it – the substance of this is, 
 
“Hi Anoj, as per discussion and upon review of the memo to 
 
BADC on the procurement, requesting procurement of an 
 
additional hundred electric and 43 diesel locomotives my 
 
comments are as follows”, 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 153 of 200 
 
 
It’s not the comments I wish to necessarily deal with because 
they are quite mundane, the point which I wish to draw attention to is,  
as per by discussion and review of the memo to BADC, that is to say 
this purported – this TIA approval is limited to a reading of the 
memorandum in its own right without reference to any of the 
background context of the changes and/or processes which it followed. 
So it is a review of the memo yet in the minutes it is given – stated as, 
assurance was given to the committee that the confinement process 
was audited by TIA and the review of the memo to an audit of the 
confinement process, I contend are two entirely separate matters.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on page two then of your supplementary 
statement in paragraph 6  you conclude with a statement – this is the 
only document that I could locate relating t o the role played by 
Transnet internal audit in the acquisition of the hundred electric and 
diesel locomotives before the acquisition was approved by BADC, you 
see that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Correct yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     But you will not go so far as to say that 
there is no report of the audit of the – the confinement process itself. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I confirm I have not seen, heard 
20 
nor found a report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    So maybe some other witness might guide us 
to such a point.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Indeed they may do so, indeed 
they may do so. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 154 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you let’s look then, Mr Callard at 
page 233 and I would like to get your comment on the actual 
resolutions of the BADC and that are reflected from paragraph 5.2.4, if 
you could just comment – if you could just consider them and then 
comment if you please. Sorry insofar if I may just add as the 
acquisition of the hundred locomotives is concerned.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Well it is clear that this 
resolution gives effect to this memorandum to proceed with the 
confinement or the procurement of the 100 locomotives through a 
confinement process to CSR and particularly in paragraph – sub 
10 
paragraph G,  
 
“recommended that the Board delegates autho rity to the Group 
 
Chief Executive to sign and conclude all relevant documents to 
 
give effect to the resolution, including the award and process 
 
approval”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And as far as that is concerned the last part 
of G, including the award and process approval we know was 
introduced into your draft by whoever amended your draft, we dealt with 
that earlier.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Yes, yes.     
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     I’m particularly interested in the nature of 
the resolution, if I read B I read that the committee resolved, 
 
“recommended that the Board approves the investment in and 
 
procurement of hundred electric locomotives required for the 
 
coal export line estimated at 3.8billion (excluding borrowing 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 155 of 200 
 
 
costs)”, 
 
Would I be interpreting this correctly if I say, my understanding 
is, what was approved as the procurement of locomotives, the size and 
specification of which is not provided for, prescribe at a cost of 
3.8billion. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: Yes and the phrase one would use 
there it is not in here but the phrase that would commonly be used with 
this, it is used in the memorandum extensively, at a total estimated cost 
and we abbreviate that in many documents to ETC, the importance of 
this – of that phrase is that, that is the tota l cost to the organisation 
10 
over the lifespan of the project, the total estimated cost.  The one 
exception to that is that it excludes the borrowing cost, if we have to 
raise money it excludes the borrowing cost of raising that amount but 
otherwise its inflation, forex, escalation everything to have the product 
in its final entity.     
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And secondly the committee – I’ll rephrase, 
whereas your original memo sought approval for confinement to Mitsui 
for the acquisition of 19E electric type equivalent...(intervention). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     19E type equivalent locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     What the Board approved was purchase of a 
20 
hundred electric – non-specific electric locomotives, so on the basis of 
this resolution one could have bought a 20E or any other series that is 
available, the committee had approved that.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It is not specific in the type of 
locomotive, it could have been any electric locomotive.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 156 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you, that then has taken us, I think, 
to your paragraph 53 at page 113, you have dealt with all those 
matters.  So now we know that as at the 24 t h of January 2014 BADC 
had approved the purchase of the hundred electric locomotives at the 
cost of 3.8billion, did you become aware of that decision of BADC and 
if so when? 
CHAIRPERSON:     Maybe before that do the minutes reflect, in any 
way Mr Callard that the concerns that you had raised with Mr Gama and 
Mr Jiyane about this were conveyed to the Board Committee at that 
meeting in one way or other, in substance?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have no way of knowing whether 
they were conveyed in any form whatsoever if they were it would have 
been unusual but the minutes of the meeting dealing with the 
procurement and approval for the 100 do not reflect the risks and 
concerns I raised or the potential implications of that transaction, they 
are not in item 5.22 and they are not elsewhere in these minutes.    
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes I no, no I was particularly confining you to the 
minutes because the minutes are signed by the Chairperson and the 
secretary at the end and therefore must be taken to be – as far as the 
Board is concerned at least, the Board Committee must be taken to be 
20 
a correct reflection of the matters discussed and the issues discussed 
at the meeting.  So you say, as far as you have gone through the 
minutes you have not picked up anything that suggests that the Board 
Committee was alerted to the concerns that you had raised with or 
without mentioning your name?  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 157 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     That is correct Mr Chair I find 
nothing in these minutes relating to the concerns raised.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you, and correct me if I am wrong Mr 
Callard but the BADC would intend and make reco mmendations to the 
full Board, is that how the system worked?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Depending on the level of the 
delegation of authority and the value of the transaction concerned they 
would make recommendation to the full Board, so yes, this s hould go to 
the – it’s my understanding that this would be – go to the Board as per 
10 
the first sentence in 5.9.7 and further – agreed and further submitted to 
the Board for information purposes, this implies that BADC is taking the 
decision.  It’s my unders tanding that this is outside of BADC’s 
delegated authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you read the minutes what is reflected is 
that the BADC their attitude towards that the main Board would only 
receive these minutes just for information only, not to make a ny 
decisions because they would have made the decision themselves.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     That is my reading of this 
paragraph yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Let’s try and be precise Mr Callard, let’s go 
back to 524, because my reading would be sli ghtly different, at 524 at 
page 233 and I read, it reads, 
 
“resolved that the Committee: B recommended, I guess 
 
recommends that the Board approves the investment”.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 158 of 200 
 
 
So that would imply that Board approval was still required.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   My apologies I was reading the 
total cost of ownership you are correct, I retract it is correct, G is 
correct.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay so all these resolutions would then be 
put to – before the Board for the Board to approve?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLA RD:     Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it – we know that – we know from the email that 
Mr Gama sent to Mr Singh on the 23 r d of January, if I recall correctly.    
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    That after reading your concerns in your email, Mr 
Gama thought that what you had been asked to effect to your memo 
made the whole memo to be a mess.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.     
CHAIRPERSON:     That’s the term he used. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Now if, in substance, the document that was placed 
before the BADC – the Board Committee that dealt with this issue, if 
the memo that was placed before them incorporated, in essence, the 
same issues which had caused you to be concerned in the way you 
20 
indicated Mr Gama to Mr Jiyane then one would be entitled to say, 
using Mr Gama’s own words, “therefore what was put before that 
committee was a mess”. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And one would have thought that he would not have 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 159 of 200 
 
wanted a memo that was a mess to be placed before the Board 
Committee and that it would have been amended appropriately so that 
what was put before the Board Committee would be a proper thing, a 
proper document. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I concur yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because what was placed before the Board 
Committee could influence the committee whether it recommended or 
did not recommend what it was asked to recommend.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     In that sense the information 
which the committee is given or the committee makes its decision on is 
by and large and with rare exception, it is bounded by the information 
contained in the memorandum.  If the information in the memorandum is 
incomplete and/or misleading and the committee has no frame of 
reference with which to challenge that information it can only make its 
decision on the information contained in the memorandum in the belief 
that what is contained in the memorandum is true and correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Chair.  Now that we’ve 
20 
established that the decision or resolutions of the BADC must be 
presented to the Board are you aware of whether or not the Board had 
occasion to deal with these recommendations ?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I have not personally seen and 
followed up on the minutes of that Board meeting, I have to believe that 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 160 of 200 
 
it was given effect to because we know that the necessary 
authorisations and warrants and – went forward to procure the hundred 
locomotives from CSR so I trust, at the moment, that it went through 
the Board but I have not seen the Board minutes dealing with this one I 
have only referenced the BADC minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We – you haven’t had access to anything that may 
have been sent to the full Board in any way after this meeting of this 
committee that you can remember?   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I have seen and have had 
access to the Board agendas, agenda and sometimes the individual 
10 
submissions to the Board but the actual minutes of the Board meeting 
itself that dealt with this item, no I have not seen or had access to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Going back to that paragraph with which we 
dealt quite at some length earlier on in the minutes of that meeting of 
this board committee where you said references to GEE were men – 
should have been to CSR.  I take it that the people who spoke to this 
issue at the – at the – this meeting of the board committee could not 
have spoken like that or it is unlikely they could have spoke n like that 
because they must have known what – what is CSR and what is GE and 
that maybe there might just have been a mistake in the person who 
20 
prepared the minutes.  Would that – would it be fair to say that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I believe that to be the case Mr 
Chairman I am not…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have seen a correction to the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 161 of 200 
 
minutes later and a subsequent one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have seen it?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which did reflect this correction.  I 
have not included it but I…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have seen it?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And firmly believe that that 
10 
correction exists. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So the people who may have been 
confused would not have been the people who spoke to the – to the 
issue at the meeting it would have been the compiler of the minutes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I – yes I believe that to be the 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I firmly believe that to the case 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  We – we move on then to a 
matter we had already touched on before I think the lunch break at your 
paragraph 54 which is your – the first response by Mr Gama to your 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 162 of 200 
 
email of 23 January 2014 and I am – we are now at page 13.  You deal 
with this at paragraph 54.  And you had indicated that tha t is the only 
communication you received in response?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you make the statement this was not 
followed up.  Are you suggesting it was not followed up by your – either 
by your – neither by yourself nor Mr Gama? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Neither.  Received the sms, read 
it, thank you, filed and moved on.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At this point were you aware that Mr Gama 
10 
had communicated your concerns to Mr Singh?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.  I only became aware of these 
emails shortly around the time of preparing my statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The GCE at that time was it Mr Brian Molefe?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Group Chief Executive, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because in his – in his sms to you Mr Gama says 
he would explain to you the GCE’s thinking.  Now that suggests to me 
and I just want to find out whether you also have the same thinking.  
That suggests to me that what he is saying is that these changes that 
you were asked to effect to your memo about w hich you expressed 
20 
concern to him and to Mr Giani in your email of the 23 January the 
person who knows about the thinking what the thinking behind them 
was, was the GCE that is the meaning I attach to this.  Do you attach 
the same meaning? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I attach the same meaning. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 163 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if that interpretation is correct maybe we are 
getting for the first time that the person who may have decided we do 
not whether he decided but th e person who may have decided that 
there should be these changes may have been the GCE.  But certainly 
we are told he knows the thinking behind them.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I interpret – I concur with your 
interpretation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  From the reading of this sms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  We just do not know whether…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He made the decision. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I make the retrospective 
connection of dots. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To the withdrawal of the 
memorandum on the October to Mitsui when it had gone through the full 
process and was withdrawn by the Group Chief Executive.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I just make that connectio n.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But I [indistinct] no more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 164 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on that score have you ever had 
opportunity to discuss with Mr Singh the concerns that you had 
expressed in the email to Mr G ama on 23 January 2014?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No I never followed it up with Mr 
Singh because I did not know of Mr Gama’s email to Mr Singh so I 
presumed, assumed at the time that it had died with Mr Giani and Mr 
Gama. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the time? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the time that was the context 
with [indistinct] operate to discover later that in fact it had gone much 
10 
further. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are now on the 18 February 2014 at your 
paragraph 55 can you take us from that point?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Recalling that my memorandum to 
Mr Singh and Mr Gama was about the incorrect specification of these 
locomotives or their technical incompatibility and that they were not 
suitable that the 95 was not a suitable locomotive.  I g ot to hear 
through emails from my technical colleagues that on the 18 February Mr 
Kuys who was then a Project Director Capital Programme in Freight 
Rail had emailed that the 100 heavy haul coal line locomotives had 
20 
been approved.  Apologies.  And that a sp ecification was required for 
tendering purposes.  The 20 E specification that was the specification 
for the locomotives the 95 locomotives from CSR was to be used which 
was and forgive me a bobo a technical comment to a four axil 
locomotive and various adjustments were detailed.  The specification 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 165 of 200 
 
was required by the evening of the 19 February.  The urgency of this is 
in Annexure 15.  On the 20 February …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry who was – was somebody being asked to 
do the specification? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it you? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No not me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not you but somebody was being asked to do 
it? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Somebody was being asked to 
10 
prepare the specifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because I was close by my 
technical colleagues  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Kept me informed of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have to redo the specification.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may just quickly ask you a question?  I 
20 
have – do you have the actual annexure before you it is at page 269?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 15.  15 which is  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  269. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 269. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now at the second line of that email and the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 166 of 200 
 
second sentence it reads and I quote:  
“It was decided that the 20 E specification be used 
for a bogo locomotive with the following adjustments 
addendums.” 
And I will go to item 3 under that statement. 
“Axil loads be limited to a maximum of 26 tonne per 
axil.” 
Do you know who took the decision to use 20 E – I see that you are 
copied in this mail? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  By Mr Kuys.  Do you know when Mr Kuys s ays 
it was decided that 20 E specification be used, whose decision that 
was? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not know whose decision it 
was per se at an individual level.  At a group level or at a collective 
level it would have been this technical team b ut the decision makes 
sense or I concurred with – concur with this decision because the only 
locomotive we had from CSR was the 95.  So to get a locomotive from 
CSR suitable for the coal line one had two options.  You either now go 
through a total brand new development of a new locomotive or you take 
20 
their existing locomotive and you say well how can we now redesign 
this modify it to make it suitable for what it was intended to be for the 
type that we wanted for the coal line.  And this was then the essence  of 
this email.  What do we have to do to that 95 – those 95 locomotives or 
that type that 20 E type to make it suitable for the coal line?  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 167 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And based on your – I think what you testified 
to earlier 20 E locomotives was it 22 tonne?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It was a 22 tonne per axil yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for coal hauling unit at a 26 tonne?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if one looks below the items 1 to 4 where it 
states and I quote: 
“In effect this will imply that the present 20 E will be 
ballasted for increased tractive effort.”  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay before I offer my understanding let me 
ask for yours.  What does that mean?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  What that means is they were 
going to take the 20 E locomotive which is 22 tonnes per axil and they 
were going to add a lot of steel to it to make it heavier.  That is what 
they were going to do.  They were then going to strengthen the 
couplers, strengthen the suspension because they adding all this steel 
to it.  They were going to take the traction motors and they were going 
to increase the power of the traction motors.  The control system 
effectively the driving system would remain largely unaltered.  They 
20 
would increase the – change the couplers of the locomotives.  The 
couplers of the locomotives is that part at the front and rear of the 
locomotives particularly the rear where it pulls the wagons now needs 
to be strengthened because of the greater power becau se of the longer 
trains.  These are the modifications which would be required for the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 168 of 200 
 
locomotives.  Of which the main one though add this whole lot of steel, 
change the suspension, change the transformer because it now has to 
take in more power from the ov erhead catenary and increase the power 
of the traction power.  So effectively you going through a fairly major 
exercise on this locomotive.  This is what they had to do to the 20 E 
locomotive from CSR now to make it suitable for coal line operation.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that change …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that an attempt to address one the concerns you 
10 
had made in your email?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It addressed – exactly it addressed 
those exact concerns on my email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But – but whether or not it is successfully 
addressed it might be another question but it was intended to address 
one of them? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So now you will end up with a 26 tonne heavy 
haul locomotive? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With these specifications.  And on your 
paragraph 55 you say the email that came to you is dated the 18 t h and 
these specifications an d adjustments had to be effected and be ready 
for the 19 t h February? 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 169 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Last line of your page 55?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Last line page 55. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paragraph 55 apologies. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes specification was required by 
the evening of 19 February correct.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then we go onto the 20 t h on paragraph 
56 what happens next? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Well on the 20 t h Mr Harris another 
technical colleague emailed Mr Giani or sorry emailed the updated 
10 
specifications for coal line locomotives.  When he emailed that and 
copied that to me attached was a letter of interest.  Because attached 
was a letter indicated that on the 19 February at a meeting attende d by 
Mr Giani and Ms Mdletshe and representatives of CSR that technical – 
and the technical personnel of Freight Rail responsible for locomotive 
specifications they discussed these changes that were required to the 
20 E locomotive to make it compatible.  W hat I thought rather strange 
at the time was that here was our technical team with the Chief – with 
the Supply Chain Officer, representatives from the Supply Chain Officer 
and the technical personnel now discussing the technical changes 
20 
required to these locomotives.  The reason for that concern was that 
CSR as I will address in a moment had not yet been formerly invited to 
submit a proposal for the locomotives.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if I may? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 170 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you reference Annexure 16 which appears 
at page 272 and this regard – the concern you have is Mr Kuys and his 
team are requested to consider that 20 E specifications, make the 
necessary changes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To bring it to the level of a 19 E?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is a 26 tonne haulage capacity and to 
provide that by the 19 February?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at your Annexure 16 is a letter address ed 
to Mr Kuys it is dated the 19 February.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The 19 February yes and it is from 
Mr Pavit. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is a letter from Mr Pavit?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now unfortunately although the email can tell 
us when it was received this letter as currently stands does not tell us 
what time on the 19 February this was generated and received?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That I do have that email and it 
20 
was – and it is available.  I must admit I  did not include that one but 
yes it is available. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  The – my question is whether Mr Kuys 
had been successful in providing the specification for this new 
locomotive by the evening of 19 February when or whether when this 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 171 of 200 
 
discussion was had that work was still underway?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes it was because we – there is 
the email from Mr Kuys to Mr Giani with the updated specification.  I 
did not put that one in here but that email exists which shows that the 
specification was revised and sent to Mr Giani on the 20 t h – I believe 
the 20 February.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I see at your Annexure 16 mid-way the 
document and I think you referred to this issue.  It reads:  
“The heading of the document is Requirements and 
Revised Specification for an additional 100 dual 
10 
voltage locomotives.”  
Mid-way that document before the bullet points there is a statement 
quote: 
“The main requirements were discussed with CSR in 
the presence of Mr Thamsanqa Giani and Ms Lindiwe 
Mdletshe.” 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now you mentioned that at least on the 19 
February CSR had not yet been informed that a tender should be issued 
confined to CSR? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on the 19 t h CSR is part of a discussion 
around specification of a tender to be issued?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you know when the actual RFP went out to 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 172 of 200 
 
confine this acquisition to CSR?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes the RFP went out and the 
memorandum signed by Mr Molefe which is not part of this was dated 
the 26 February asking CSR to please submit a proposal for a 100 
electric locomotives essentially around and it quotes the speci – this 
discussion and these changes and it asks fo r that proposal to be 
returned by the either the 20 – it went out on the 26 t h and I believe the 
return date was the 28 February. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So CSR was part of designing the 
specification on which they will tender?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Before they were informed that 
they were to be awarded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Or asked to submit a proposal on a 
confined enquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where you are dealing with a tender that is to be 
confined to one entity does it make any difference that they get to know 
about or get – ja they get to know about the specification before they 
20 
are informed where in the end they are the only ones anyway who will 
be involved in the tender. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Perhaps in the substance Mr Chair 
it makes no difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 173 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Perhaps in the – but in the 
procedural aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  It is my understanding that it does 
make a difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because what this would imply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And what this – my reading of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Is that communications with the 
supplier even on this nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Would take place only when they 
had been officially informed through the appropriate channels which 
would be the letter from whichever deleg ated authority in this case Mr 
Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Given the value of the transaction 
to the supplier to say we are asking you for a proposal.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Please develop a proposal.  The n 
the discussions and engagements around the technical issues would 
take place for the proposal to be returned.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 174 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is not possible for a supplier to 
develop a proposal for 100 locomotives priced proposal beari ng in mind 
that there are many things which go into developing a proposal for a 
3.8 billion transaction.  One does not do that in three days which was 
the date of …  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  That is a different point.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a different point.  You see it certainly would 
be unacceptable if for them to have been included in the – in designing 
the specification if it was going to be an open tender that is for sure.  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just wondering whether where already a decision 
has been taken that a particular entity is the only entity to which the 
tender would be confined.  Whether they know before they – they know 
the specification before they are formally told or whether they know it 
after whether it makes any difference.  I am thinking aloud I am not 
sure.  I am just testing. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is a mood…  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is strange about it. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is a mood point Mr Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As you say in that sense it makes 
– does it matter but the – my understanding 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of the policies and procedures 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 175 of 200 
 
manual is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CA LLARD:  We have approval to confine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And you grant me there is – we 
have that approval to confine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   I cannot discuss with the supplier.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The details of what he is to supply.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because we do not have that letter 
– he does not have that letter – I do not have that letter of authority to 
talk to him yet that comes once he has be en informed, requested for a 
proposal per that signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Till he has that letter, till that 
letter has formally been issued to the supplier.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That letter can be w ithdrawn at 
20 
any time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Procurally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Therefore any discussions which 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 176 of 200 
 
we may have and I may be giving a potential supplier through these 
discussions a false and an in correct impression I may be of a letter to 
come which might not come.  The fact that in this case it was coming.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  But that is the mood point about it 
procedurally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The supplier should have been – I 
contend should have been in possession of the letter requesting the 
quotation or a proposal then one goes through the detail technical 
10 
discussions to the proposal then the supplier submits his quotation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You see maybe the point – maybe the point should be 
that they should not be involved in the designing of the specification at 
all whether it is before or after they have received noti - you know 
official notification.  What do you say?  So I was focussing on the 
question of what is the significance of saying they should not get 
involved in the designing of the specification before they receive the 
formal notification.  As opposed to saying they should not get involved 
at all in the designing of the specificati on.  Whether in other words 
Transnet should not design the specification without them and then 
20 
present the confined tender to them with the specification and see 
whether they are able to come up with something that would meet that 
specification. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would concur the procedurally 
that would be more correct approach.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 177 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I can then just continue on tha t?  Have you 
seen the RFP for this confinement?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes I have. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To your recollection what does the RFP invite 
CSR to do? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It invites CSR to please submit a 
10 
proposal by XYZ date and if I recall correctly it was the 28 t h and it said 
– and it lists the – it says based on the revised specification which was 
developed here – the revised specification which was developed in 
terms of this request to Mr Kuys and it says these essentially shoul d 
incorporate all the modifications currently made to the 19 E that have 
previously been discussed.  But here are the essential components to 
it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if I am to understand the process that I am 
trying to – I am going to try to put it in a simplistic manner as possible 
for my own benefit.  Technically what happened here was the decision 
20 
was to go buy 100 electric locomotives from CSR?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we know from the proposal that we are – 
what we are seeking to acquire CSR does not have?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 178 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We then decide we are going to do this by 
way of confinement. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We then take a decision that we are going  to 
take the CSR 20 E locomotive and we identify adjustments that are 
required on that locomotive. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To bring it on par with 19 E. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In order to do so we go have a discussion 
10 
with CSR as to what they will need to do to bring it up to 19 E.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then we issue a RFP for them to give us a 
proposal on that which we have jointly discussed.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is exactly what happened. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That process. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I guess Chair it would be a matter for 
argument whether that was proper or not.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is true but sometim es it is helpful to get 
20 
the perspectives of people who have been involved on the ground on 
some of these matters.  Let me – let me say this.  If the decision had 
not been taken that the tender would be confined to CSR certainly any 
discussion with them in regard to the specification would – would be 
improper because they could influence the specification to be 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 179 of 200 
 
formulated in such a way as to favour them if and when an open tender 
was made and they put in a bid. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one scenario. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if the decision has already been taken that they 
are the – they are the entity that would be given this confined tender I 
am not sure in what way Transnet would be prejudiced by  a discussion 
with them in regard to the specification because they are the ones who 
have already been chosen and let us assume for argument sake that 
10 
they choosing them was the correct decision because otherwise 
normally if you were running your own compa ny once you had decided 
that that is the company that is going to assist me with this business 
requirement there should – there would be nothing wrong in talking to 
them to say this is what I need, can you deliver?  And then they can 
say to you, yes we can deliver we deliver this all the time.  Or they 
might say, we can deliver A, B, C, D but we cannot deliver E and F and 
then you start talking to them about what the plan – what an alternative 
might be before maybe you formally request them.  You might have  
some discussion with them even if it is informal.  We are now dealing 
20 
with a public entity I am trying to see whether it becomes wrong simply 
because it is a public entity or not.  Where you have already decided 
this is the one that we are going to ask to  – this is the company that we 
will ask to help us.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The mind set… 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 180 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The framework I have in my mind 
Mr Chairman …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  From my years in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Organisation is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And if I may quote the example.  If 
the decision has been taken and the letter to the firm has to be issued 
10 
by yourself as the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Chair to the firm before that letter 
is issued I go and have a discussion with the supplier.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You would be at right to say what 
do you think you are doing.  Who gave you pe rmission and authority to 
go and have those discussions with the supplier before I have formally 
communicated with them?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That would be in terms of my – 
that is – absolutely my understanding of how the policies  and 
procedures …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Worked through the organisation.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 181 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I had your permission to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Engage with them beforehand …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That would be a different story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have not …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Assessed that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is quite possible that if I had 
those discussion with the supplier …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Without your permission …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  You could come and say to me …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Who said you could talk to the 
supplier because maybe … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am going to change my mind …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  About that supplier …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 182 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And now you have compromised 
me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And it is – and it is in that context 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That I offered it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, thank you. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Out of context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in the context of your response to the 
Chair right now we will have to determine whether this meeting of 
19 February taken place with CSR was after the Board had approved 
the confinement to CSR.  That is something we will have to investigate 
for ourselves. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I – I would take it that it was 
because we had the BADC Meeting on the 24 t h.    The Board Meeting 
immediately following.  So this was after the 19 t h. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That – that is not a point.  The 
only point I make is that it had not been formally co mmunicated through 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 183 of 200 
 
the Chair.  So it was a communication prior to the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  To CSR?  To CSR? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To CSR, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You – you disputing regarding specification is 
on 19 February 2014? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you know when CSR submitted its proposal 
on the 100 locomotives?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes on 28 February 2014. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A week later?  A week later about from the …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The 19 t h/the 20 t h. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The meeting is on 19 February.  They submit 
on the 28 t h? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The 28 t h, ja give or take a week 
later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The next date you then deal with in the 
sequence of events is at paragraph 60 on page 14 of your statement.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can we – you deal with the issues that you 
20 
set out there in? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sure.  May I just touch on 59 
because we have not touched on 59 if  I may just refer back to that one 
…? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 184 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To close it? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, yes please (intervenes). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  As a result of these design 
changes to the locomotive a new class  for the 100 locomotives was 
created for CSR that was 21E that clearly differentiates which says it is 
a different design.  It is a different type of locomotive.  It is a different 
(indistinct) and that was the upshot of all the design changes which had 
taken place earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are now at your paragraph 60.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  60, yes.  Nothing much happened 
and – if I may say – life carries on pretty much as before.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  When myself and colleagues 
received a mail from Mr  Yusuf Laher in finance with spreadsheets of the 
final cash flows at 17 March 2014.  These spreadsheets gave the cash 
flows of the four succes sful bidders in the 1 064 project plus the CSR 
100 locomotives plus GE the 60 diesel locomotives.  What I notice 
particularly about this email was that the advance payments to CSR for 
20 
the 100 locomotives was a 30 percent down payment on the design 
review and may I please take you here to Annexure 17.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 276. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 276. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at 276 you say that is a spreadsheet 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 185 of 200 
 
received – received from Mr Yusuf Laher as per page 275? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And this is part of the spreadsheet 
showing the (indistinct) percentages.  It is not the complete 
spreadsheet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
It 
is 
an 
extract 
from 
the 
spreadsheet and if one looks at the top right hand corner we will see 
there APG 30 percent.  That is advanced payment guarantee.  Design 
10 
review 30 percent acceptance 37 percent.  The implications of this is 
that before a single locomotive is receiv ed one is paid 60 percent of 
the amount of the locomotive.  This is – I am not quite sure which 
phrase to use – unusual, way out of line with anything we have done 
before that one pays 60 percent of a locomotive before one receives 
the first locomotive and  that meant that we – the upfront payment was 
R1.32 billion for these locomotives – the upfront payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I ask you at this stage seeing that you had been 
at Transnet for some decades?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you been involved in other acquisitions of 
locomotives before? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if – about how many kind of transactions over the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 186 of 200 
 
period for example two, three, four?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was involved specifically in the 
acquisition of the 15E locomotives for the all line which also was a 
confinement on Mitsui and the upfront payments for that.  43 
locomotives from General Electric…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you can mention the years if you r emember 
when each one was. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The nine – the 15E was around 
2010.  Please I am …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Do not hold me too closely to the 
years but it was about …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because the (indistinct) was 
running. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The class 43 was roundabout the 
same time – 2010/2011. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Then we had the specification for 
the class 95 which was an open tender one and I was party to that 
business case as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 187 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was 2013- also about 2011 of 
that order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had been involved in about – what – four or so 
transactions? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  (Intervenes) three of them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Three of them and of all of them you say this was the 
biggest or highest upfront payment in terms of percentage of the whole 
price? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There is one other – let us leave 
that for a special reason – but yes this was way out of line to anything 
which we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  (Indistinct) before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Just by context and we will – if I 
may – for reference point and we will come to that in the 1  064. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The standard normal upfront 
20 
payment that we deposited was  a 3 million deposit to enable the 
supplier to set up his production, run a factory and then we would pay 
perhaps 90 percent on the acceptance of the locomotive and there 
would then be 5 percent to retention and another 5 percent warrantee 
payable at the end.  So …  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 188 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The 1 064 business case for the – 
106 for the 599 – for the diesels and the electrics both deposited an 
upfront deposit of only 300 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and those points you make at 
paragraph 61 where you conduct this comparison to previous 
purchases? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, yes and MARS we had paid – 
the upfront payment was approximately 7.8 percent.  The advance 
10 
payment to CSR for the 95 20E was  10 percent.  The upfront payment 
for the 1 064 business case was a setup fee of 300 million deposited in 
the tender. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if – where you state the MARS upfront 
payment for 110 19E locomotives was approximately 7.8 percent do you 
recall what the timelines were for the payment of the balance of the 
purchase price? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would have been on delivery of 
the locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on that principle as well when CSR in 
20 
respect of the 95 20E received 10 perc ent the remained excluding 
retention and warrantees - of course – would be own delivery? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my – I would like to confirm 
that one but it is my recollection that that is so that we paid 10 percent 
of the balance on delivery.  I would just like to confirm that point.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 189 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in respect of the 100 locomotives we are 
dealing with now 60 percent was paid before a single locomotive was 
delivered? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have at your Annexure 17 a figure of 4.4 
billion.  Can you explain what that figure is relative to the approved 
acquisition cost of 3.87 billion - if memory serves me well?  Do you 
know (intervenes)? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry, I am on 62 – sorry – 
paragraph 62. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no I am at your Annexure 17. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 17. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 276. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just past the midway point at the top of that 
document is a Rand value  of 4.4 billion. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I would like you to talk that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Oh, apologies.  That 4.4 billion 
was then the – what was seen as the – what was the total estimated 
20 
cost of that project for the acquisition of the 100 locomotives.  That 
was an increase from the 3.8 billion that was positive in the original 
business case memorandum.  Here the cash flow goes up to 4.4 million 
which was later increased when the submission for this was tabled.  I 
went up to 4.8 billion but that was the cash flow at the time for the 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 190 of 200 
 
delivery 4.4 billion which excluded some variations.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So according to page 276 1.32 billion 
was paid on 1 April 2014? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct or on or before 1 April. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On or before.  As at this date do you know 
whether the – the new specification – the new design for this 
locomotive had been approved?  No, not approved had been completed.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, it had not been.  The design 
review for the – and it is not in my statement – the design review for 
this 100 locomotive was completed around July the – towards the end 
10 
of July 2014 because that triggered the second payment also of 1.32 
billion which was paid on 1 October 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Making a total of 3. …?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Two billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  3.2. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry, 1. …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, 2.6 billion. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2.6 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paid over a period of six months. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Overleaf at page 15 starting from 
your paragraph 62 you deal with these payments and – and issues 
around that.  Would you like – briefly like to talk to that?  From 
paragraph 62 at page 15.  Is there anything we omitted at page 14?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, page 14 is fine. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 191 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 62 just illustrates the 
sentiment between my colleagues in finance and myself at that time 
around the locomotive tenders.  The reason this email came or this 
SMS came to me from my colleagues in finance is because I was 
putting into the capital budget the cash flows that were required to 
finance all these locomotive transactions not only in the capital 
acquisition but together with their maintenance and also for the 
wagons.  So I was compiling the seven year budget spread for that and 
I had to ensure that the - these figures appeared correctly in the 
10 
budget but this was the interesting one from my colleague – a 
Ms Natasha McMahon – who on 27 February 2014 – bear in mind this is 
now in the middle of the tender negotiation period on the 1  064 and we 
are also at the same time now as we are starting to deal with the 100  
and her email reads and this is from Natasha:  
“Mr C, working 4 billion, yes 4 billion deposit in the 
current financial year in all scenarios.”  
This is now on 27 February and this is 4 billion deposit which we now 
have to pay before the end of the 2014 – sorry – in the current financial 
year for all scenarios.  I replied to that:  
20 
“Yes, 4 billion.  My giddy hat what will the auditors 
say.” 
I must confess this – I was – she said: 
“We have asked for an opinion.  These guys are 
cowboys.” 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 192 of 200 
 
This is Natasha.  I res ponded that time: 
“I just completed the FX Survey.”  
I did not know what else to say.  We had a laugh.  We just said wow.  
This is going to cause us grieve but yes that was the sentiment at the 
time around these significant and upfront deposits that we were  going 
to be in line to pay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at paragraph 63 you speak of total 
upfront costs of 7.37 billion …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Payable before 1 April 2014. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Yes. 
 
The 
upfront 
deposit 
payments for the 1 064 locomotives – again I will address - address 
those – plus for the 100 21E locomotives from CSR plus the 60 diesels 
required that from the time of signing those contracts on 17  March to 
1 April we had to find and pay 7.37 billion in  upfront costs and I just put 
that this was an – put an incredible strain on the organisation.  The 
capital that had to be raised in this short period of time.  One does not 
raise this capital overnight. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And how this 7.7 billion is spread across the 
different transaction you capture that at your Annexure 17?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 277.  17 starts at 274 but if you could 
have regard to page 277. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My apologies.  I am no t sure that 
Annexure 17 is correctly referenced.  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 193 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please have regard to page 277. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  277 – 277, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  That is part of Annexure 17.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 277 is again a further extract 
of that same file that I received on 17 March which was the day that the 
locomotive transactions were all finalised and in the top left hand 
corner you will see it is a copy of the cash flow final 17  March.  Total 
cash flow across all the locomotives.  It also gives the total prices to 
10 
be paid but the key figure is total cash flows 1  064 locomotives, 100 
locomotives.  The first line – 31 March 2014.  If one moves there to  the 
first yellow column on the right hand side it is R7.37 billion and that is 
what we had to pay between 17  March and 31 March. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that 7.3 billion is made up with the 
following. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is made up of 4.8 billion for 
across the four OEMs for the 1  064 locomotives.  1.32 billion - the 
upfront payment for CSR.  That was their first 30 percent upfront 
payment. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And these – these are current transactions we 
are dealing with? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is the current transactions we 
are dealing with. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 194 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And there was a 1.2 billion for 60 
locomotives for General Electric. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was there a reason given to you or did you 
become aware of one on why such a significant upfront payment should 
be made in respect of these transactions?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Not in respect of the 100.  There 
was a – I would like to deal with the 1  064 when we actually deal with 
the 1 064 locomotives because it is more relevant there.  There was a 
reason given for the – this very large upfront payment to – for the 60 
locomotives to General Electric because that was annexed and I 
10 
understand – and please I have not seen any official documentation to 
this - but it was the talk from those who were involved that it was 
because a production line was running this was to achieve an extremely 
favourable price for those locomotives and it was to buy the material 
for the 60 locomotives upfront and get it in so th at the line was just 
kept running without having to close down the line at all or stop or start 
the line and it be able then – those locomotives to be delivered very 
quickly with no break in production.  That is my understanding of the 
high upfront payment there to General Electric. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You state at your paragraph 63 at page 15 in 
20 
regard to this upfront costs payment of 7.37 billion that and I quote 
from your statement: 
“Transnet had to pay upfront costs of 7.37 billion 
before 1 April 2014 so that the payments would be 
reflected in the 2013/2014 financial year.”  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 195 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in this regard you refer to Annexure 17 
which is the document we have just worked through.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What was so important in effecting these 
payments in the 2013/2014 year?  Why could not some payments roll 
over to the next financial year?  Why was it necessary to effect that 7.3 
in that particular financial year?  Are you awa re? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I can reverse engineer the answer 
at the moment but let me not say.  I was not giving the …  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would rather not go definitively 
down that route. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But it was – it would – it would had 
to do with the cash flow across the organisation how it is presented in 
the (indistinct) year because if this had moved to the next year with the 
other upfront payments it would have been a really significant spike in 
the payments of that year which would have affected the – the 
borrowings of that year as I will show later but – may I say that is – I 
20 
reversely engineered that solution.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, yes.  Chair – you – you – before I 
address you Chair.  Mr  Callard you conclude by – by saying that the 
significant payment put an incredible strain on the organisation as this 
capital had to be raised in an extremely short period of time?  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 196 of 200 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was it actually raised in that time?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well yes because the payments 
were made. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  At 64 you deal – you start your – the 
part of your testimony that deals with the increase in the estimated 
total cost of acquisition of the 100 locomotives from 3.8 billion to 4.8 
billion.  You see that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair if I may at this juncture address you?  
10 
That is a fairly involved – that is fairly involved testimony.  We will not 
finish it today if Mr  Callard is to work through it all if we were to go to 
half past four.  I – I do not know where – it is 15:53.  I do not know how 
the Chair – we could start.  We would have to stop it midway which 
means when we reconvene we ha ve to go back in order for – to be 
properly contextualised and I know Chair I had commented to half past 
four and you had – thankfully – asked me whether I am fine with it.  I 
had said yes.  I will not accept that as a deliberate attempt to mislead 
the Chair but to say perhaps I was over enthusiastic in my response.  I 
do know about Mr Callard.  I see – I hear him making certain errors and 
20 
I do not know if he is becoming tired but I speak for myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let – let - I will – I will hear whether Mr Callard 
feels that he can still deal with it.  My – I would imagine that what you 
mean when you say if we start with it and we have to stop without 
finishing …  
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 197 of 200 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That chapter or thing – when you say we would have 
to come back to it on Monday I assume that you do not mean that we 
will have to start all over again but that all you mean is we might need 
to spend maybe another five minutes to refresh our memory before we 
continue.  Is that what you mean or …?  
ADV MAH LAPE SELLO:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – do you mean that we would have to start all of 
over again? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If the Chair were to have regard to paragraph 
10 
starting at 64. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Starting at paragraph 64 a t page 15… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Working through to 72 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is one continuous narrative that is best told 
through reference to tables and calculations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if we start at … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It would be best to complete it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Otherwise when we try to pick it up again – 
you know - we … 
17 MAY 2019 – DAY 95 
 
Page 198 of 200 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be problematic. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To cover the 10 minutes before four now I 
would be in a position to start at 9 o’ clock if there is a concern about 
losing time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assuming we were not going to start at 9 o’ clock 
anyway. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then I am in a position to start at half past 
eight Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Callard how are you feeling?   Are you feeling still 
fine to proceed? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Good to go for another half hour 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Good to go for another half hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is good to go for another half hour.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sello you heard.  You are tired?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am tired Chair and it is because as Chair is 
20 
aware it has been quite a few days working with Mr  Callard to prepare 
him for today.  It is not like I am coming in (laughing).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.
