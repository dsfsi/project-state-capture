PROCEEDINGS ON 24 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are we ready this morning? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I propose just before we commence with 
the first witness to just give a sense of where we are in the aviation 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because we have been running for about a 
week and we have got about a week and a bit left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There have been some changes in some of the 
logistics so I thought it useful just to take a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And take stock.  In relation to the four 
investigation areas what evidence we have heard and what is still to 
come.  So Chair with your leave I will commence of the first of those 
areas.  The first area of investigation dealt with the 15 billion capital 
20 
raising exercise that SAA embarked upon the 2015/2016.  We have 
heard the evidence of three witnesses so far in relation to that aspect 
of investigation.  They were Ms Stimpel, Mr Van Der Merwe and Ms 
Nhantsi.  We still have the evidence to receive from Mr Mahlangu, 
arrangements have been made and his evidence will be received later 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 3 of 228 
 
this week.  That will conclude for this phase of the evidence session 
the witnesses in relation to that aspect.  As I indicated at the opening 
of the aviation evidence there is an intention to have a second 
evidence session later in the year where the final strands of that 
investigation will be picked up.  Chair the second area of investigation 
is the North West ground handling transactions that we have been 
looking at over the last few days.  We have received the evidence of 
four witnesses in relation to those transactions between the North West 
Department of Transport, South African Express and then Koreneke 
amongst other management companies.  The evidence has come from 
10 
Mr Ngwenya, Mr Phiri, Ms Phatudi and Ms Tlatsana.  Chair there are 
two remaining witnesses in relation to that area of the investigation.  
The first of those is Mr Viljoen who will be giving evidence today and 
the second is from another company who received payments of some of 
the proceeds of those monies that came out of the North West 
Government through South African Express and into Koreneke.  And 
that will be completed by the end of this week.  The third area of 
investigation Chair is an area that looks at jet fuel procurement 
between SAA, SA Express on the one hand and an entity called EML 
Energy.  Chair that evidence will commence today.  It will commence 
20 
after Ms Viljoen has concluded her evidence with the evidence of Ms 
Loock who is the airport’s coordinator for South African Express and 
that will be followed by the evidence of Mr Vaughan who is the head of 
fuel management at South African Airways.  Chair just a practical 
matter on our estimation for today’s proceedings it is unlikely that we 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 4 of 228 
 
will get to Mr Vaughan’s evidence.  We envisage that the day will be 
occupied by the evidence of Ms Viljoen and Ms Loock.  Mr Vaughan is 
here, he was summoned, he is in attendance.  In the light of the high 
unlikelihood that we will get to him today I wondered if we may request 
that he be excused to return first thing tomorrow for his evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be fine.  What is your anticipation of what 
time we might be done with the other witnesses Ms Viljoen and Ms 
Loock. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will be able to give you a better 
sense. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the lunch break if you do not mind.  It really 
does depend how long Ms Viljoen takes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms September will be presenting the evidence 
of Ms Loock.  She has indicated to me previously that she thinks she 
will need about three to four hours.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it does depend on how swiftly we finish Ms 
Viljoen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the hope would be to finish Ms Loock 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whatever. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 5 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And – but we will give you sense if we may at 
lunch time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About how much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If at all past four we think we might need to sit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  If need be we can sit beyond 
four o’clock. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair we are indebted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Again so that we try and finalise their evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Excellent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr Vaughan can be excused until tomorrow 
if he may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Vaughan – where is he?  Okay you are 
excused from attendance today please come back tomorrow and be 
here at nine o’clock so that in case we decide to start at nine you are 
available. 
MR MARK VAUGHAN:  Thank you Chair I will do that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair just to complete that 
third area of investigation Mr Vaughan will give us after Ms Loock’s 
evidence the overview of the jet procurement space – jet fuel 
procurement space and that will become an important lead into the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 6 of 228 
 
aspect of the evidence that deals with the IDC.  I had highlighted in the 
opening that there is an aspect of this procurement that involves the 
IDC because it was off the back of contracts that were obtained or were 
anticipated to be obtained from SAA and SA Express that a funding 
application was made to the IDC. So there will also be further evidence 
in that regard.  And then finally Chair the fourth area of investigation 
dealt with broad themes of governance and that investigation has 
focussed and the evidence will show the extent of board interference in 
procurement matters at South African Airways over a period of time 
which involved according to the evidence that will be heard numerous 
10 
demands made for the allocations of contracts to certain entities and 
also evidence from witnesses who endeavour to stand up to what they 
regarded as unlawful demands and then were summarily suspended. 
Chair that evidence will commence on Wednesday and it will run until 
Monday of next week with an interlude on Thursday to go back to some 
of the remaining witnesses.  But that Chair with your leave is our plan 
for the remainder of the aviation evidence.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  No that is in order. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair then without further ado if we could 
swear Ms Viljoen in? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Kalandra Viljoen. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 7 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so 
please raise your right hand and say, so help me God. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we have – Chair we 
already entered… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen’s bundle into the record as Exhibit 
DD9 we did that in the course of the evidence of Ms Tlatsana on the 
weekend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So there will not be a need to so again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Viljoen just to orientate you in front of 
20 
you you have a sort of soft cover file which is – comprises your various 
affidavits and statements.  It will be referred to in the course of today 
as Exhibit DD9 that is necessary just for the purposes of the record.  
And then you also have next to you a legislation bundle.  Chair we have 
prepared a legislation bundle that may become relevant in the course of 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 8 of 228 
 
today’s evidence. If I may beg leave to hand one up to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen already has her copy there.  And 
then there is just also next to Ms Viljoen the bundle of Mr Ngwenya’s 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There may be a point at which it is relevant to 
go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is Exhibit DD5. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen if I may then just commence with 
some assistance in navigating your bundle because there are a number 
of affidavits that are to be found in the bundle that has been put 
together for your evidence and I would like to just get clarity in relation 
to some of them when they were deposed to and also to ask you 
whether are any corrections you would like to make in advance of your 
evidence to any of them?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us start with the first that appears at 
20 
page 1.  That is an affidavit as I have it that you provided to the 
commission and if you go to the end of the affidavit you will see at 
page 16 it was deposed to on the 23 May 2019, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And are there any corrections you want to make 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 9 of 228 
 
to that affidavit? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The second affidavit which is actually an 
annexure to that affidavit which you provided to the commission is an 
affidavit that you did to the then FSB.  If you go to page 40, 40 of the 
bundle in front of you you will find – it is entitled ‘Response to 
summons issued under case number 2018/02/6680’ but it is an affidavit 
as I have it that you deposed to before a commission of oaths on the 26 
February 2018.  You will pick that up at page 46, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And are there any corrections you would like to 
make in that affidavit? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then the final affidavit I am 
calling it an affidavit with hesitation because the document which is the 
affidavit does not appear to have been deposed to before a 
commissioner albeit that it was signed you will find that at page 91, 91 
of that bundle, do you have that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will see there it is an affidavit related 
20 
to the Mafikeng case number 4908/2017 and if we go in that – I am 
going to call it an affidavit to page 93, can you confirm that that is your 
signature on that page? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the date at the bottom is given but without 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 10 of 228 
 
a year it is 14 December, from my reading of this affidavit and placing it 
in context I take it to have been signed on the 14 December 2017, is 
that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And again are there any corrections you would 
like to make to that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  You have confirmed the contents of 
this affidavit therefore under oath albeit that this was not commissioned 
at the time so just for the ease of reference in the course of the 
10 
proceedings I will refer to it also as an affidavit. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I think you asked her if she confirms? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she – I saw she nodded. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not sure that she confirmed it.  So you will 
have to please just articulate your confirmation so that the microphone 
can … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I will do that Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just for the record’s purposes you confirm 
that the contents of the affidavit that appears at page 91 of the bundle 
contains statements that are true and correct to the best of your 
knowledge? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Can I add details to this because I did not 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 11 of 228 
 
write this affidavit or this statement? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly.  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Someone wrote it for me, Mr Jan Judeel 
wrote that he asked me to sign it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Let us get a few of those details 
because they may well be important. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Okay sorry my bundle has now fallen apart. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe let us – let us do this.  Let us do it this 
way.  The affidavit as it stands I think you have confirmed that it is 
correct, is that right? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what you have just said suggest that you feel that 
there may be other facts that need to be added. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Which is covered in my second. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which are not – which are not – which are not there. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine then. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I am indebted to you.  So 
there may be more background you would like to give and we will find 
that in the other affidavits but its contents are correct? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair I do note that Ms Viljoen is 
struggling with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The manner in which the file has been put 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 12 of 228 
 
together.  I have asked my learned friend Ms Buthelezi if she would not 
maybe just take a spare copy of that file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That we have and place it in a file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which then might not create the difficulty of 
pages coming apart. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I have got 14 pages to fix. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My worry is that it might occur again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it might occur again. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it may simply be easier to put it in a lever 
arch file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no let us do it that way yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair while that is being done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen you do not need to trouble yourself 
with those papers you will get a replacement file now that will be easier 
to… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Done. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To turn over. 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I am done.  It is going in, it is going in and 
then I am done and it is fixed and I will make sure it does not come 
undone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No she is very – she is very passionate about wanting 
that one. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 13 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us leave it like that. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It looks pretty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She promises it will not come apart again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It will not come apart again well we will have 
on standby just in case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that promise is under oath so… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will hold you to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen you were about however to give us 
10 
some background to the genesis of that last affidavit.  You mentioned 
Mr Judeel.  Can you tell us the circumstances in which it came to be 
produced, this affidavit at page 91? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Mr Judeel called me and asked for a 
meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When was that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It would have been more or less around this 
time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  December 2017? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And tell us before you proceed who he was or he is? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  He presented himself as a private 
investigator. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 14 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did he say to you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  In all honesty I forgot about this until you 
sent me this statement.  But it was a quick meeting at a Mugg and Bean 
and he asked me about the transactions.  I went and I looked at this 
transactions. He took notes.  He wrote the affidavit, he emailed it to me 
and then I just signed it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How did he obtain the documents that are 
attached to it? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I sent it to him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let me just get clear. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I – sorry I might have given it to him but ja I 
gave it to him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that was at a face to face meeting in 
December 2017? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  If memory serves me right yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you were contacted, did he make reference 
to a criminal case? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I will have to lie if I answered that I cannot 
remember.  It was December we had family coming over from overseas 
so I have to – it was a brief meeting and I cannot remember if he made 
20 
reference to it or not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when you signed the affidavit did you look 
at the first page which says Mafikeng CAS 4908.2017? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did see it yes but that does not really 
mean anything to me. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 15 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right but you considered the contents and you 
were satisfied with their correctness and so you signed it, is that right? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at some point either prior to that meeting 
or thereafter you gave Mr Judeel the documents which are then 
attached to that statement because those documents originate from 
you, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you meet with him and a Ms Captain 
Mogotse? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you aware in the evidence over the 
weekend that Ms Tlatsana indicated that Mr Judeel had said to her that 
he attended with Captain Mogotse when he met with you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I saw it and no he was not with Captain 
Mogotse 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why – why did you agree to meet with him 
and depose to an affidavit then? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  He asked very nicely? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that answer? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  He asked very nicely.  Can you please meet 
me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you were under no compulsion to do so – 
you did not have a sense that it had anything to do with a criminal 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 16 of 228 
 
investigation. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or any such thing. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will return to that in due course in the 
evidence thank you.  Ms Viljoen I would like to begin at page 1 then of 
your affidavit to the commission and in paragraph 3 on that page you 
start to explain to us about an entity called Asset Movement Financial 
Services CC.  Chair we have previously in the evidence been referring 
to this entity as AMFS we may do that in the course of the evidence but 
10 
that will then be a reference to this CC which I understand you 
established to run the business of… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And tell us what exactly that business was and 
for that purpose I would like us to go to the company profile that you 
have provided in various of these affidavits.  There are a number of 
copies Chair in the papers.  The best copy I could find at page 48 so if 
we go to page 48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see a 25 February 2015 company 
20 
profile, can you confirm that that is your profile of the company Ms 
Viljoen? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes it is Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go over to page 50, 50 you 
usefully give a description of your business there in the top paragraph.  
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 17 of 228 
 
For the purposes of today’s evidence can you just explain to us what 
that business was? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was a cash in transit business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what does that mean? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It means that if a business would need 
money we would deliver the funds for them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and can you just give us a sense… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you would take funds from a business to 
deliver the – or cash from a business. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We will pick up the funds from a bank and 
10 
then deliver it to clients that might need funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and vice versa? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Like a G4S.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And vice versa?  So you would also take from a 
business to go and bank for them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We did not – we did not really do 
collections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not do the collection from the business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You only did one way? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we just have that again.  You said you did 
not really do collections.  Did you ever do collections? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Not to my recollection. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 18 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. And then just in terms of the 
industry in which your business was operating how big is the market?  
Did you have lots of competitors? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would say it is big.  G4S, Fidelity, Coin, 
SBV it is a big industry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did they all operate a similar business 
model to yours? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I cannot comment if their business model 
was the same as mine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But your sense is it is a big market and there 
10 
are a number of competitors in it? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You know at least of one business that 
operated a similar business model do you not?  That was your previous 
employer, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is the name of that employer? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Rustic Stone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We will come back to just a few 
more details about Rustic Stone in a moment but I would like to 
20 
continue on page 50 because on that page you set out some further 
details about your business and its services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said page 50 is better than I guess another page? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 19 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes it is hard to believe I know because 50 is 
not clear at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What we may seek to do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is just get a better copy from Ms Viljoen in due 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In due course we can – we can do what we can with 
this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make do with it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With this indeed and given that it is her 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where it is relevant for us to know precisely 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is said on the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will ask for Ms Viljoen’s assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we may proceed on that basis.  And Ms 
Viljoen that takes me to the next question which is mid-way down the 
page there is a heading there which I read to be company 
ownership/legal entity, is that a correct understanding of what is… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 20 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you say under that as I have it AMFS 
is registered as a CC and then it says all required certifications will be 
acquired and maintained at all times.  And then all legal compliance to 
legislation is and will continue to be maintained.  Is that an accurate 
reading of what is reflected there? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would say so Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us just pause on that question of legal 
compliance.  I assume it was important for the operation of your 
business that you ensured that you complied with the applicable 
legislation, is that right? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you can give an answer.  Thank you.  The 
record has to have your answer verbally.  Then I would like to just 
explore a bit what that legislation was.  Were you compliant with the 
Private Security Industry Regulation Act? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I was yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you just give us a sense of what that 
legislation regulates? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I will have to check I cannot remember. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  But we had to be part of PSIRA register the 
company under PSIRA and register all the people that was working 
under PSIRA and we were. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And then legislation that is colloquially 
called FICA the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, were you compliant 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 21 of 228 
 
with that? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I FICA’d all my clients yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well what does that mean? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would obtain copies of their ID’s, their 
income tax numbers, all the details required by FICA I would get that 
from the clients? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you regard yourself as obligated under 
FICA to do so? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay that is certainly consistent with what you 
10 
say at page 5 of your affidavit.  If we go to page 5 Chair and Ms Viljoen 
you will see at the top paragraph on that page under 5.1.1 towards the 
end you say:  I will deal with the on-boarding process of each, these 
are the types of clients you are going to describe in turn and the steps 
that I took to ensure compliance with AMFS’s FICA obligations, you see 
that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as part of the statues that you needed to 
comply with in order to conduct your business was FICA, is that 
correct? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like for this purpose just to go to FICA 
for a moment because one of the chapters that is particularly pertinent 
to today’s proceedings is the chapter dealing with control measures for 
money laundering.  Chair you will find it in the legislation bundle and 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 22 of 228 
 
Ms Viljoen and the Financial Intelligence Centre Act which we will refer 
to as FICA is under Tab 5 and it commences at page 110.  And if you go 
to page 121 in that bundle you will see Chapter 3 two thirds of the way 
down the page which is headed ‘Control measures for money laundering 
and financing of terrorists and related activities.’  Chair we will return 
to the pertinent provisions in due course in Ms Viljoen’s evidence but I 
would like to just be clear on Ms Viljoen is were you concerned to 
ensure that all the necessary regulatory and legislative requirements 
were met by your company? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Sorry can you just say that? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you concerned to ensure that you 
complied with all the requirements of FICA in the operation of your 
company? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes I tried my best Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I assume that that would have included the 
measures that are put in place under FICA to guard against businesses 
being used for money laundering, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then in terms of your role or status under 
FICA which of the accountable institutions under FICA did you 
20 
recognise your business as? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  A money remitter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.  And what is your understanding of 
money remitter? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  A cash in transit business. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 23 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why is that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Because we remit money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you seek legal advice on that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Amongst the governing documents in relation to 
FICA are also a series of guidance notes that the Financial Intelligence 
Centre issues from time to time, did you ensure that you kept up to 
date with those? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did not Chair no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know that you are legally obliged as an 
10 
accountable institution under FICA to do so? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do now.  Thank you Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to just take us to one of those 
guidance notes which we have put in the bundle.  Chair you will find it 
and Ms Viljoen at page 159.1.  It is a guidance note issued on the 14 
March 2008.  Ms Viljoen have you seen this before? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No I have not.  Sorry which page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies 159. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  151 oh 9. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  159.1.  And it is dated the 14 March 2008 and 
20 
you will see on that page in terms of its title it is Guidance Note 4 on 
Suspicious Transaction Reporting.  Have you seen this document 
before? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I have not, no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will go to it at the appropriate time in the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 24 of 228 
 
evidence.  But as I have it so far you accept that you are an 
accountable institution under FICA because you identify your company 
as a money remitter, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you have not kept track of amongst other 
things Guidance Note 4 in relation to suspicious transactions that 
require reporting? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to just move over 
to page 2 of your affidavit if we may?   Because there at paragraph 3.4 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you say you going back to her 
affidavit? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To the affidavit indeed Chair at page 2 we will 
pick it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And on page 2 we are at paragraph 3.4 
because Ms Viljoen as I read paragraph 3.4 you explain in that 
paragraph why at a point in time you had to hand over the books and 
records of your CC, is that correct? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you tell us about those circumstances and 
what happened? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was a case with Small and Medium 
Business Bank Namibia and they opened up an inquiry and they … 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 25 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A liquidation inquiry? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes they did and they then asked for us to 
hand over our documentation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Just before we proceed we 
know what business your entity was involved in.  From where did you 
operate? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  From Springs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Springs? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your clients would be around Springs only or you 
worked … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Beyond?  What was the scope? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The whole of Gauteng? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Gauteng – yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just the size of your operation.  About how many 
20 
employees did you have for example? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We were a small team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  There were four – four drivers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 26 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So it was a small team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  But we were busy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  No, I just wanted to – so that we know 
exactly from … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you operated and what was the area in which 
your business was active. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I do plan to go into that in more detail … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In due course … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But that is useful background for the purposes 
of understanding your handing over of your records.  So you were 
explaining Ms Viljoen that there was a liquidation inquiry into the Small 
and Medium Enterprise Bank Namibia.  Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in the course of that you were asked to 
hand over certain books and records.  Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just get clear on what books and records 
you handed over? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I handed over all books and all records. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of your entire business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 27 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Even though the entire business would not 
have related to the Small and Medium Enterprises Bank Namibia? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They have asked for it and I handed it all 
over. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How precisely did they ask for it and I am 
asking that Ms Viljoen in fairness to you because the powers of the 
Master under a liquidation inquiry is to demand by subpoena documents 
that may be relevant to the company in liquidation but the powers do 
not extend beyond that.  So are you quite sure that you did not get a 
request for the documents and books related to the company in 
10 
liquidation? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do not recall getting a summons.  We were 
at the Commission of Inquiry and they asked for it and we handed it 
over. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Every single …? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Related beyond the Small and Medium 
Enterprise Bank …? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you take steps to recover all the documents 
20 
of your business thereafter? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Not yet no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did they say thanks for these 37 files but we 
are only interested in two? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No they did not. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 28 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And to whom were they handed? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  To the liquidators.  They came and they 
collected it from my lawyer’s office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would then like to just be clear about 
precisely what documents were given to them if we may … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will find at page 17 of your bundle the 
letter that you have provided to us which I understand is the covering 
letter when you handed over these documents and you will see under 
two you say: 
10 
“Kindly find 34 lever arch files and one plastic 
folder containing to the best of our client’s 
knowledge the full books and records of account for 
Asset Movement & Financial Services CC.” 
Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That suggests to me that it was accounting 
records that you were handing over (intervenes). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Records of account? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But can – can I just – can we pause on the 
description there.  The full books and records of account you are 
saying that is not confined to accounting records? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It has got the accounting records as well. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 29 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Including others? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us just go through what those others 
would have been.  What else was handed over? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Well it is all just the accounting records. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So it would have been the bank statements. 
It would have been receipts.  It would have been – it would have been 
everything.  Invoicing – it would have been everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just go through a list that I have 
10 
compiled and you can tell me if that is what was handed over.  
Invoices? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your monthly reconciliations … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of which there are some examples in the 
papers.  Delivery slips? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So every single delivery slip of your business 
was handed over to the liquidators? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It - it should have been in the files.  Yes  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just let us pause there.  Should have been – 
did you satisfy yourself as to what was in the files when you handed 
them over? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I – I literally just took the files.  Actually it 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 30 of 228 
 
was with my bookkeepers in their – in their storage units.  So I went 
and I just took everything that was with my bookkeepers and I dropped 
it off at my lawyers and then they collected it.  So everything should 
have been in those files. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your – did you keep management accounts? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that would have gone as well? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That would have been in there yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And financial statements? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No that would not have been in there no. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I had a separate file for financials Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And anything else other than those that I have 
listed that you can recall? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No I cannot remember but it would have 
been everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Documents that you had compiled for the 
purposes of vetting your clients.  Would that have gone as well? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It might have been.  I – I cannot confirm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It seems to me Ms Viljoen - and I am asking 
20 
this in fairness to you so we can get clarity on it – the focus was - as I 
have suggested – the accounting records, the evidence of the 
deliveries etcetera.  It may not have extended though to documents that 
you compiled in the course of vetting clients and establishing who they 
were.  Is that right? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 31 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It – it could have been.  I – I cannot 
remember what was in that clear folder.  I cannot recall what was in 
there.  So I – I cannot remember but I gave everything over. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did so under subpoena.  Did you not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Again you have asked me and I do not think 
I was subpoenaed to hand over the documents. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The language you use in your affidavit is that 
you were ordered to do so.  What – what did you mean when you said 
ordered at page 2 paragraph 3.4? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Well I was not ordered.  I was asked. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You were asked? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So it may not have been pursuant 
to an order from the Master? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  who asked you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  The liquidators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The liquidators? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they speak to you directly or they spoke to your 
attorney and your attorney told you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They spoke to both of us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And they asked us for the files … 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 32 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And then afterwards they would have 
spoken to my attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so your attorney was present when they spoke to 
you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just to be clear they asked you for all the 
files of your entire business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would have to lie to answer if they asked 
10 
me that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You are not sure? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You are not sure if they asked for that but you 
are sure that you gave everything? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I gave everything yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Do you have a recollection of what your 
impression was of what they asked for?  Is it that – is - at least your 
understanding is it - is that they wanted everything? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It might have come across like that Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I am – I am not sure but I do not want to 
say it came across like that and then it did not and so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no I understand that but at least you – I 
think you – you gave everything because you probably that they wanted 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 33 of 228 
 
everything. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They can have everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your understanding.  They – they might or 
might not have said so but you would have given them everything … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I just gave everything for in case they might 
wanted to come back and ask for more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So I gave them everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you keep copies of what you gave over? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did not know Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not have electronic versions of those? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  For somethings I did have electronic thing – 
copies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But not others? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No not – not for everything – not nearly 
everything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know that under FICA as an 
accountable institution you have to keep all the records of your 
20 
business for a minimum of five years? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  By then the company was liquidated and … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you answer the first question?  Do you 
know that you have to by law keep the records of the …? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did not know. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 34 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether your attorney kept a record of 
what was handed over to the liquidators? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  My – my attorney? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do you know whether your attorney kept a list of 
what was given to the liquidators or not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I am – I am sure he might have.  I cannot 
answer.  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no you can answer because you either know or 
10 
you do not know. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But just so I have your evidence correct.  You 
were not aware that under FICA you are required to keep all the 
records for a minimum of five years. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Can I – can I answer that in a two point? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So when the business is liquidated 
liquidators that liquidate the business then take all the files over and 
20 
then they are legally apparently not my files anymore.  That is how it 
was explained to me.  So the business was liquidated and then the files 
were to go to the people who liquidated the business but then just after 
that the liquidators of SME asked for those documents. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  We are dealing with a few liquidators 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 35 of 228 
 
here.  Let us deal first … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With your business. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes.  So as it was explained to me that 
when you liquidate your business then the liquidators of that business 
takes possession of all your files. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Huh-uh. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is how it was explained to me and then 
afterwards SME liquidators requested for the files and so we handed 
the files over to them. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you had to get them back from the 
liquidators? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We still had to take them to the liquidators.  
They were still with my bookkeepers and we still had to take them to 
the liquidators. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your liquidators? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us just get that chronology right if we 
may.  When was your business liquidated? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was in the start of 2018. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So who at that point had all your records? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  My bookkeeper still had all my records. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when did you give them to the liquidators? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I think it was end of 2018. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So after you gave all of them to the liquidators 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 36 of 228 
 
of the Small and Medium Enterprises Bank? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Can you repeat that - sorry? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You gave all the records to the liquidators of 
the SME Bank Namibia … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In October 2018? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I cannot confirm if it was in October but it 
was end of … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was in October because that is when the 
letter that you have put up … 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Okay, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Went to the lawyers. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is when we did it, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I just want to understand did your 
liquidators have them then? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No they were still with the bookkeepers for 
some reason.  I do not know why but they were still with the 
bookkeepers for some reason. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But if they went from the bookkeepers to the 
liquidators of SME Bank Namibia then they have never gone to your 
20 
liquidators. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They should have apparently gone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To your knowledge? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  To my knowledge yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Have they gone to the liquidators of AMFS? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 37 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, not to my knowledge. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is not why you do not – you did not 
retain the documents and records for five years.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you give instructions that the – those books be 
given to the liquidators of your close corporation at any stage? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do not recall giving instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is just that you – as I understand your 
10 
evidence you say before the liquidators of the SME … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Namibian – indeed Namibian Bank we can 
maybe refer to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the liquidators of the Namibian Bank 
approached you for those books or documents you say those books or 
documents should have gone to your liquidators. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did I understand you correctly? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you say they should have gone? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who – how – how is it that they should have gone 
there if you do – you had not given instructions that they be taken 
there?  You were the owner of the business as I understand. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I – I cannot recall if my bookkeeper had to 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 38 of 228 
 
finish things or why it never went.  I – I cannot recall and I do not want 
to say now that it is for this reason … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Or for that reason but I cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had they been asked for already?  Had the – had 
your liquidators asked for …? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They had not asked for it Chair no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay but what is it that makes you say they 
should have gone there already? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is how they explained it to me that all 
10 
my books will then have to go to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your liquidators? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That was my bookkeepers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your bookkeeper told you so? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is how they explained it to me yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but it is not the – your liquidators who said that to 
you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no they did not say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you say to your bookkeepers okay in that 
event you must take the books to the liquidators? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do not recall saying that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well – okay.  English is not my first language.  I 
do not know if it is yours Ms Viljoen but it may be that the problem is 
the use of the word “should”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It well be Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 39 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For our purposes the most important aspect … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to get clarity on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is first - and you will correct if my summary 
is incorrect Ms Viljoen.  You were not aware of your obligation as an 
accountable institution to keep your records for five years? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not know of that obligation under 
10 
FICA? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When I probed with you why it was as a matter 
of fact irrespective of the legal obligation that you did not retain your 
records for five years I understood your answer to in some way relate 
to the liquidation of your business.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But as a matter of fact you do not know 
whether the records of your close corporation ever ended up with the 
liquidators of that close corporation.  Correct? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct Chair.  It ended up with the SME 
liquidators. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But not yours? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 40 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We will return to those provisions 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just – just so that we clarify whether they ever 
reached your liquidators is that something you know or is that 
something you do not know? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I – I know it did not reach it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it did not go to them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will return to those provisions in 
relation to the records because in due course I – I am going to ask for 
Ms Viljoen’s comment on the extent of the obligation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Under that section albeit that she has told us 
already she was not aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will ask for her comment on it when we look at 
the section. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No it is fine. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then Ms Viljoen if we can go back to the 
series of questions that the Chair began asking you about the formation 
of your business.  I would like to get some detail background there and 
I have it commencing in your affidavit at page 2 under the heading “4. 
Background”.  Now you begin as I read your affidavit explaining your 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 41 of 228 
 
prior employment at a business called Rustic Stone. 
You will pick that up in paragraph 4.2.  Can you tell us about 
that employment and its duration? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They were a cash in transit business and I 
– I started with them around 2012 and I finished up – I want to say it 
was October 2014 I left to start AMFS. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Viljoen I had it from your evidence 
previously that they operated a similar business model to AMFS.  Can 
we take it that what they were doing at Rustic Stone you then 
replicated in AMFS in terms of the business approach? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will explore that in quite a bit more detail in 
due course but I just wanted to be clear Rustic Stone operated in the 
same way as AMFS when you set it up.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then tell us about how from Rustic Stone 
your close corporation came to be formed? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  One of the clients from Rustic Stone 
approached me and suggested that I start my own entity. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who was he? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who was the client? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Andries. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Andries who? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Greyvenstein. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 42 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And he – he then said he will help with the 
funding and yes that is how AMFS was started. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I pick that up at page 3 of your affidavit from 
paragraph 4.6.  That is where you reference being approached by 
Mr Greyvenstein who I understand was an existing client of Rustic 
Stone.  I understand there that he provided initial funding to establish 
the business.  Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And any other role that he played in the 
10 
business?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No role. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he was not a member of the CC? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  He was a member of the CC until I paid 
back the initial loan and then he – he went off as a member of the CC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just tell us that timeline.  When was the 
CC established and when did Mr Greyvenstein leave as a member? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It – it was established around 2015 – 
January 2015 – and he either left the CC at the end of 2015 or the start 
of 2016. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And from that point if I pick it up at paragraph 
4.8 who were the members in the business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Just myself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you had 100 percent member’s interest? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 43 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You go on in that paragraph 4.8 to say that: 
“At no time was Andries …” 
I take that to be a reference to Mr Greyvenstein. 
“…involved in the running of the business.” 
Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where did your business operate from? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  From his premises at the back. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did it always operate from his premises at the 
back? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no, no.  Eventually I started working 
from home. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when – when did that change occur? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  More or less the same time that the 
business was handed over. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just get that correct then.  The 
business starts end of 2014 I have it in your affidavit that you 
purchased this shelf CC.  So we could maybe take it from end of 2014 
to end of 2015 you operated from his premises.  Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then he sold out of the close corporation … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In early 2016 and do I have your evidence to be 
from that date onwards you no longer operated at his premises? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was still registered there and the vehicles 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 44 of 228 
 
would sometimes be parked there but I no longer had my little office 
there.  If that makes sense. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No it does but I would just like to get clarity.  
Did the vehicles of the business continue to be parked there throughout 
the AMFS existence? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Right to the end.  Sometimes the vehicles 
would be parked there yes.  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
So 
what 
was 
the 
arrangement 
with 
Mr Greyvenstein that allowed you to continue to part your vehicles 
there? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  He had premises right next door and he was 
not using it and he said we can use that to – if we needed to use it we 
can use it for the parking of the vehicles. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he did continue to have some involvement in 
the business but it is confined I understand your evidence to allowing 
your vehicles to park on his premises? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There was no other role that he played in the 
business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we move down to paragraph 4.9 on 
that page you talk about the profitability of the business.  Can you 
please assist us with information about how much money was moving 
through the business at its peak? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  About 500 million. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 45 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Over what period? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Per month. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at its peak half a billion Rand was moving 
through the business.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When did the peak start and when did it end? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Oh no I cannot recall that Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us just go through – just an order of 
magnitude.  As I have it your business operated from early 2015 till 
March 2018.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Until I sold the business in October 2017 
and the final handover was done in November 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh, right the liquidation happened in March … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And then … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2018? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And then yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So let us just get the timeline right 
beginning 2015 to let us call it October 2017.  Are you comfortable with 
that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is fine, ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is about two years and 10 months? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Three years, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  I am just trying to get a sense – of those 
two years and 10 months how much of it could be described as the 
peak? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 46 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  2016 was a good year and – and so was 
2017 as well.  2015 because we had the robbery aand we had to 
outsource it was profitable but not as much as maybe August 2016 
going into 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So would it be fair to say that there was 
about half a billion Rand moving through your business for at least a 
year of its existence? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We can say that yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Viljoen I would next like to 
move to the process you used to vet clients and we can pick that up at 
10 
page 4 of your affidavit under a heading “Client Vetting and the 
Delivery Process”.  Before we get into its details though I would just 
like to get a sense from you about the importance you placed on client 
vetting. 
Did – did you regard it as an important aspect of your 
business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And were you aware of the ways in which 
accountable institutions under FICA are required to vet their clients? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did know yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We can go to those provisions in due course.  I 
also just want to know we looked at Chapter 3 which is a series of 
control measures under FICA to try and prevent the use of businesses 
for money laundering.  Do you know what money laundering is? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 47 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I take it that it would be part of the 
reason for vetting clients that you equip yourself as a business to 
guard against money laundering.  Is that fair? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can I also just for preparatory purposes 
get an understanding that whether you agree that there can be a link 
between money laundering and corrupt activities.  Do you accept that 
there is a link between those two? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just to explore that a bit further.  It seems 
10 
to me that the link lies in the fact that corruption is about paying people 
off for favours that they give you.  Do you accept that very basis 
explanation? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And one of the ways that that can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your – your – your lose definition is too loose. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To loose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am happy to employ the – the legislative … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am … 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Definition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am allowed to pay my daughter for her to do a 
favour for me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Easy Chair.  I should have added a favour that 
it is not legally permissible to be made.  Indeed Chair.  I am indebted 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 48 of 228 
 
to you.  We can actually pick it up in the Prevention of Organised Crime 
Act and also PRECCA has a useful definition of corruption but maybe 
for present purposes I think the refinement was critical.  It – it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is paying a benefit to receive a benefit 
yourself to which you are not legally entitled.  Are you comfortable with 
that definition? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I understand and I am comfortable with that 
yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then just in terms of the link between 
10 
money laundering and corruption money laundering – and correct me if 
you have a different interpretation – is about disguising or concealing 
the true nature, source, location or movement of unlawful proceeds.  Do 
you accept that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the one way in which corruption can be 
facilitated is if you render money in a way that it is true source is not 
clear in order for those who must be repaid for the illicit favour you 
have received then getting money.  Do you accept that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Let us go then to your process for 
vetting clients because it begins at page 4 of your affidavit but it really 
gets into its detail over the page at page 5.  Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we commence at paragraph 5.1.1 because 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 49 of 228 
 
as I read that paragraph you draw a distinction between new and 
existing clients.  Can you explain that difference to us? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  New clients would be people who I did not 
have prior workings with at Rustic Stone where existing clients were 
clients who came from Rustic Stone to Asset Movement & Financial 
Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just to tie one loose end.  What – what is the 
position that you held at Rustic Stone? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It started off where I was doing the 
administration and then eventually it involved where I was ordering the 
10 
funds and I was much more involved in the day to day running and not 
just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I saw that is what you say in the affidavit but 
I want the job title.  Were you a manager something?  Were you 
consultant or something? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They never gave me a job title. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just so I can get clear about your 
difference in approach on vetting between new and existing clients.  I 
understand from what happens later in your affidavit that relates to 
20 
whether they were required to sign standard terms and conditions.  Is 
that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the only difference? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That would have been the only difference. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 50 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So even if it was an existing client that you 
knew at Rustic Stone you would still go through a vetting process.  Is 
that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And tell us what that vetting process comprised 
please? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would get their ID number, income tax 
number, address.  I would go visit the address and make sure that they 
are who they are.  I normally like to visit the address as well to see if it 
was a security risk for my – my men to go and do the deliveries.  I 
10 
would get their telephone numbers and that is it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go on page 5 to paragraph 5.1.2.3 
that is where you move from the description you have just given of the 
various documents you sought and inquiries that you made and you go 
on and you say: 
 
“Once I’d received the above completed with copies of all 
 
supporting 
documents, 
I 
would 
conduct 
various 
trade 
 
enquiries, and if all added up, and I was confident that the 
 
request came from a legitimate business, I would conduct a 
 
site visit to confirm he address provided and also to consider 
20 
 
same from a security point of view”, 
 
I’d like to just unpack that a little bit, what various trade 
enquiries would you make? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would ask them, what do they do, so I 
didn’t find different sources to verify it but I did sit with them and find 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 51 of 228 
 
out from them if it was a good business, what they do…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And did you keep records of that information? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I never took notes no I was just – it was 
just a discussion. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you weren’t aware under, FICA, that you 
were required to keep a record of that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No I wasn’t Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then you go on and you say, 
 
“And if all added up and you were confident that a request 
 
came from a legitimate business”, 
10 
 
Just help us there, what would equip you to know if it added 
up? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    If they seemed like a real business, if they 
seemed – that feeling you get inside of you, that everything’s okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And let me just be clear about this, would you 
meet them always at their businesses, when you had this discussion 
with them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes because I wanted to do the site visits 
and see if it was safe. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So you always met them at the business?  
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I would say yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And you had a bit of a discussion and then 
you got a feeling about whether it was a legitimate business and on 
that basis you’d continue to conduct business with them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s right Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 52 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      And are you aware, under FICA, of your 
obligations to establish the source of funds of any business that you 
enter into a business transaction with? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Not aware of that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       I take it – your affidavit description talks 
about this one initial engagement where, if you’re satisfied then you 
regard it as acceptable to continue in business with that entity or 
individual, is that correct? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:      That’s correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Did you do any follow-ups in relation to the 
businesses? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       I take it then you aren’t aware that under 
FICA you were required to regular due diligences of the business with 
which you transacted? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    What due diligence would that be Chair? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       To continue to check the source of funds of 
the businesses with which you transacted. 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       So you would satisfy yourself at the 
commencement of the business relationship that…(intervention). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Everything was in order.   
CHAIRPERSON:       That they were legitimate – they were a legitimate 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 53 of 228 
 
business and everything seemed to be in order and thereafter as long 
as you continued to have that feeling that they were fine you would 
then not do any further check. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Then let’s move to the terms and conditions, I 
understand your evidence to be, sometimes they were signed 
sometimes they weren’t, can you just take us through how that 
happened? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Where are we now? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You talk about – at the bottom of page 5 
paragraph 5.1.3, you say there, 
 
“Insofar as existing clients were concerned AMFS would follow 
 
all of the above steps but as there was no obligation on it to 
 
have written terms and conditions in place with it’s clients, as I 
 
knew the client already and they were familiar with our terms 
 
and conditions of business I would not insist that our terms 
 
and conditions be signed”,  
 
 
Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    So in this case, with this specific client I 
20 
did send them the terms and conditions but they never sent it back to 
me signed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       No indeed, we’ll get to the specific client 
that’s relevant to these proceedings, at this stage I’m just talking 
generally in terms of your business.  I understand you to be saying 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 54 of 228 
 
here, that you wouldn’t require terms and conditions to be signed with 
existing clients, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       How then would you be satisfied as to your 
legal rights and obligations in relation to those customers? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I was just satisfied, I was happy, I was 
satisfied, they understood the process, I understood the process, I was 
satisfied Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And in relation to new clients. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    They signed the terms and conditions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m sorry were your terms and conditions the same 
as those of your previous employer?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so in other words…(intervention). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    So let me maybe explain this, the terms 
and conditions were the same but the contract was not the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay, alright.   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   Just to clarify.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     So the written text differed, is that right?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But the upshot of what you were doing – well 
the business of Rustic Stone and what it’s clients could assume would 
happen in the business, what your obligations were and what their 
obligations were was the same when you moved into AMFS, is that 
correct? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 55 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    The gist of it was the same correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       The I would like – so we’ve done the 
processes you had developed it for vetting, if you go over the page to 
page 6 you then tell us how the cash delivery process would work from 
AMFS and I’d like us to please go through that.  You set it out in some 
detail there and the detail is important, so if you could take us through 
each of the steps, for how you would process a delivery of cash. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Okay, my client would contact me saying 
they need a certain amount of funds…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Can we just stop there, how would they 
10 
contact you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    With a phone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I would then compile all of that and send it 
to the service provider and then they would pack the funds into clear 
bags and made sure that it’s been counted and then my drivers would 
go and pick it up and do the deliveries afterwards. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Okay, if I may, I’d like to unpack that a little 
bit further. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So it starts with a telephone call from a 
client. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       What does the client say to you on the call? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    We need a certain amount of funds. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 56 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right, then what would happen. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Do you want it now…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       In detail. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    In detail, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So let’s go through a day in the life of 
AMFS right because I understand these transactions happened within a 
day, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes it’s fast. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Right, so you get a call, I assume in the 
morning. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Lt’s use a hypothetical example. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:     It is in the morning. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You get a call, your client says I need 
5million rand in cash today, what is the next event that happens? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I wait for the funds to come 
in…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     To come in, so sorry. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   Into the bank account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So they deposit, if I take your language at 
20 
paragraph 5.1.4.1, they deposit 5million rand into the AMFS bank 
account, is that correct?    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       What happens then…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    And who is they now? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 57 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    The client. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I thought you said earlier on, they would say they 
need so much. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes so they would say to me – they would 
call and say they need 5million and then they would transfer the 
5million into the account – into my bank account. 
CHAIRPERSON:       When they needed like 5million, did that mean 
they needed you to transfer 5million for them what did that mean? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No, no I’m going to explain the whole 
situation…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I want to understand the need first, you were 
asked, what they would say to you…(intervention).      
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    They would like to have 5million, they are 
ordering 5million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Now when they said that were they asking you to 
give them 5million rand. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       What did that mean? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    It means that they ordering 5million. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Ordering from whom? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   From me.  
CHAIRPERSON:       You would have money and you would give it to 
them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair, I would then go on and order it 
from the service provider. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 58 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    In your name? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The service provider being a bank?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    It’s SBV and the four banks own SBV. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay would the service provider always be SBV?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay, now I think you just said that – or something 
that I understood to be the client would provide money to you or did I 
misunderstand you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes so they would order the funds from me 
10 
and then they would transfer the funds into my account and then I 
would transfer it into SBV’s account and then they would pack it and 
make sure that it is the right quantities as we need it. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The “they” is your client, initially…(intervention). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They phone you, is that your client.    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They say they need money.      
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That’s your client still.    
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And then they, being your client, transfer money into 
your account. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     That’s the part I don’t understand. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 59 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed Chair, if I may be of assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     When they say they need 5million, am I 
correct in understanding they are saying they need 5million in cash?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   Oh that’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Right so they have 5million in their account 
because otherwise this transaction is not going to take place. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes it can’t SBV...(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Your client phones you in the morning they’ve 
got 5million in their account, they say we want this 5million in cash 
10 
today, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    They then transfer the 5million into your bank 
account, AMFS’s bank account.    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Because they want, within the day, that 
5million rand that comes to you in a EFT to be converted to cash to be 
delivered to them, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct yes.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Right, let’s just go…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay now I think that’s helpful, so they’ve got 
5million but not in the form of cash. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they want you to take whatever steps you need to 
take to provide them on that same day with cash to the value of 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 60 of 228 
 
5million.  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, now I understand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right so we’re at the point at which – because 
the sequence is very important, that’s why I’m wanting to break it down, 
you get your call, your client says 5million rand is going to come into 
your account today, I need that cash you – what then happens?    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   So if the funds come into the bank account 
I 
will 
call 
the 
client 
and 
confirm 
that 
it’s 
their 
funds 
and 
then…(intervention). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Okay just, if we can stop there just for a 
moment, so you got a call in the morning, now are you watching your 
bank account?    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do and I’ve got -  I had the text message 
alert that comes through as well but I am watching my bank account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And how many calls are you getting on an 
average morning? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    So by then end of 2017 I would get up to a 
hundred phone calls a day, my phone never stopped. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Okay, let’s just get it right, you’re 
20 
getting…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Business was good. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    This was 2017 yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       In your peak of half a billion rand a month. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   It was busy. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 61 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Right so you get a call in the morning from 
about a hundred people who say – this is on average – they need cash 
in various amounts, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Then you watch your bank account for when 
those funds come in, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Now if there are a hundred that are coming 
in, in the course of a morning, how do you work out which of those 
payments relate to which client? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Some of the reference numbers I would 
recognise but the ones I didn’t I would call the clients and say, money 
has been deposited in my account, can you confirm the reference and 
then…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Can I just – sorry, just there, so it wasn’t a 
requirement of your terms and conditions with your clients that they use 
a particular reference number? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So sometimes you’d be lucky enough to 
recognise a reference number that would relate to a particular client. 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Would you then regard that as satisfactory 
indication to you that the cash should be delivered to them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     But sometimes you’d get other references, 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 62 of 228 
 
correct?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Like BK. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then what would you do when you saw 
BK come in with 5million rand for example? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    So the client that would have called 
saying that they want 5million, I would call them and then confirm 
whether it’s their funds, what’s the reference they used…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja just finish.   
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Was – were the requests always telephonic and 
not in writing or sometimes in writing? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair some of them were in writing 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       By way of email? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Give us a sense of the order of magnitude, 
how many were telephonic and how many were email, just in a 
20 
proportion. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   I cannot answer that, I would say most of 
them were probably on phone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Well that’s certainly consistent with what you 
say at paragraph 5.1.4 because there you only speak about being 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 63 of 228 
 
contacted telephonically by a representative.  So the majority of these 
requests are coming in on phone correct?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV 
KATE 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
 
 
 
Okay 
so 
now 
we’re 
at 
the 
point…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – I’m sorry again, so would some of the requests 
be by way of SMS’s or WhatsApp, just for the sake of completeness? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   I can’t recall if people SMS’ed it was 
majority phone calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, no that’s fine. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So effectively when you were delivering cash to a 
client, to the value that the client had specified in their request in the 
morning, you were basically giving them …(intervention). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   Their own money back. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Their own money back. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes in cash form. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja and you retained what they had in effect, they 
20 
didn’t have cash but they did have 5million, they transferred that to you 
and you secure cash and give them the cash form of that amount. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair I see we are at the usual time for the tea 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 64 of 228 
 
break, if it’s convenient to adjourn now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let’s take the short adjournment for tea, we’ll 
resume at half past eleven, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Viljoen we had concluded 
your evidence at the bottom of page of the affidavit just before the 
break that is where you were telling us that where you were not sure of 
the reference you would make telephonic contact back with the client 
10 
and check with them whether the money you had received was from 
them, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go over the page to page 7 you 
say at paragraph 5.1.4.5. 
“If the amount and the reference given added up to 
the amount that was deposited and the reference 
shown in my bank statement I would certain that the 
funds belonged to that client and would then be in a 
position to deliver the funds to the client.” 
20 
Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just want to explore your statement there that 
you could be certain of the origin of the funds having adopted this 
method.  Okay.  How could you be certain as to the origin of the funds 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 65 of 228 
 
by using this method? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  A strange person that did not do the 
payment would not know the amount nor the reference. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you had asked for no evidence of the bank 
account from which the funds were paid? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No I did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I was satisfied that once they confirmed 
verbally that the funds were indeed theirs. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then your system allowed a situation to 
10 
develop as we will see it did in some occasions. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where your client would phone and say, I need 
R5 million in cash but would then not be the person or entity that in 
fact deposited money in your account, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  This came to light afterwards so yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when you say you could be certain that the 
funds belonged to the client that is not correct, is it? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  At that point it was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us explore that.  If the client simply 
20 
said to you telephonically I need R5 million in cash and then 
subsequently a payment came in in that amount other than phoning the 
client back for their verbal confirmation you had no other way of 
checking that this was not proceeds from some other entity, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 66 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you could not be certain that it was that 
client’s money, could you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Now looking at the bigger picture yes I was 
not certain but at that point when the client confirmed the name and the 
amount I was certain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You thought you were certain? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I thought I was certain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what happens next in the sequence?  
You can pick that up at 5.1.4.6. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes I would subtract my fee and I would 
then consolidate the whole cash order and send it to my service 
provider and of course I would pay the funds over to them and they 
would do the packing and the counting and then my drivers would go 
pick it up once it has been ready – once it is ready. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us just spend a bit of time on the service 
provider.  Who was the service provider? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  SBV. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is SBV? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Again as I explained to the Chair SBV is 
20 
owned by the four banks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is it? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They do distribution of funds for the banks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So are they like a cash warehouse? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They are – they are a cash in transit 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 67 of 228 
 
business and they are what I can yes assume is a cash warehouse.  But 
they do cash in transit as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you are on your understanding of your 
business a cash in transit business and you receive funds through a 
deposit into your business’ bank account, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes.  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You then take a fee off that amount, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that fee as I have it from your affidavit was 
in general .3%, is that correct? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then you would pay over the nett proceeds to 
another cash in transit business, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then that business would pack the funds, 
the money. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your drivers would go and collect it, is that 
correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what would happen to the funds? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN: They would be delivered to the various 
clients. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And – apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please explain to me why any client would feel 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 68 of 228 
 
that they needed your services because I take it that is if SBV was… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Our vehicles were unmarked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  If SBV was an entity 
owned by the four banks, big banks I guess you mean and they were 
there to deliver cash to clients I assume why did the clients not who 
needed your service – or felt they – who contacted you why did they not 
contact SBV or the banks directly and say, you know I have got money, 
I have got an account with, I have got money, I need cash and then the 
banks would contact SBV and SBV would deliver? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is a good question.  SBV has got 
10 
marked vehicles and most of the clients do not like when a big truck 
with lots of money stops in front of their premises and people can then 
see that they are receiving funds.  So our vehicles were unmarked and 
then at that point we offered a same day delivery where some of the 
cash in transit business did not offer same day delivery.  For – as for 
the clients not going to the bank physically sometimes it is not safe for 
them to go to the bank to collect funds from a bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I was not suggesting that they should collect 
the money themselves but I was – I was talking about why they would 
not… 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We had the unmarked… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get rid of you or not make use of your services go 
direct to the banks and if the banks say use SBV because that is the 
entity we have created, they phone SBV and say can you confirm with 
my bank it is one of the four – the big four, I have got the money but I 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 69 of 228 
 
need cash.  And then SBV can liaise with the bank, get whatever 
confirmation if they need to but then take the money and deliver it to 
the client.  You have said that some of the clients maybe all the clients 
that came to you did not want a marked vehicle from SBV coming to 
their premises because then … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It becomes a security… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Criminals would know that they were bringing money. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why would SBV provide unmarked vehicles? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no the unmarked vehicles were our 
10 
vehicles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – from what you have explained to me the need 
to use your services arose from the fact that SBV’s vehicles were 
marked? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And clients did not want to have SBV vehicles seen 
arriving in their premises because then criminals would see that money 
was brought there. So – and I would imagine SBV and the banks which 
20 
created SBV knew about that concern and I wondering why SBV did not 
decide to provide unmarked vehicles because then… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I cannot answer for SBV. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because then there would be no need for their 
client – for the bank’s clients to spend money to pay to you or services 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 70 of 228 
 
like yours. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes, no I hear what you saying but I cannot 
answer for SBV why they do not have unmarked vehicles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen do you as a fact that SBV has no 
unmarked vehicles? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No I do not know that as a fact. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Let us just get clear.  So you 
charged a fee of .3%. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to follow up on the Chair’s questions.  If 
this was a transaction just between the client and the bank do you know 
whether the bank would charge a .3%? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  The bank would charge a full percent if they 
had to go to a branch and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry they would charge how much? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  A full percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A full percent? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For a cash withdrawal. 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And then if they went with SBV because I 
originally got a quote from SBV before they became a service provider 
they would have charged a little bit more than what I charged. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 71 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it seems that there are two reasons.  You 
were charging less and you had unmarked vehicles but to your 
knowledge you do not know whether SBV did not have unmarked 
vehicles? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  And also we offered same day delivery. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know whether that could be arranged 
with the banks? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I am sure it could.  I do not want to confirm 
10 
or deny but I am sure maybe it could. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I – as I have it your driver would go 
and collect from SBV and then would deliver to the client? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where would they deliver to the client? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  At their premises. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And which premises would those be? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Their place of business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And would that be the premises that you had 
vetted in your site visit originally? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that always the case? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you always have the – in your records the 
addressed of each client – the address of each client where cash was 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 72 of 228 
 
to be delivered? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Given that the questions come up Chair maybe 
we can just go to the check list that Ms Viljoen used to complete.  I 
have that at page 29 of the papers.  This is in Exhibit DD9.  Ms Viljoen 
is this the check list you would complete with your clients in the vetting 
process? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you see there you have got the name of 
10 
this particular client.  You have got an ID number, you have an income 
tax number, this is what you went through with us in your previous 
evidence.  And then you have an address there as well, do you see 
that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is that the address that you vetted for the 
purposes of this client? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I think you say that later in your affidavit.  So 
this is your record associated with this client insofar as your vetting 
20 
was concerned, is that right? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If your – I am sorry if your client was a legal entity 
like a company or a CC I see here your client was a person. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 73 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I vetted the person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you vetted the person you considered to be in 
charge of the entity? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Only or also the entity? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No just the person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just the person? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  We will return to that a little 
10 
bit later when we get into the details of that particular client.  But let us 
just understand.  Now in the sequence we have got your unmarked 
armed vehicles going to deliver to the address which is reflected on 
your check list for any client, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what would happen when they 
reached the premises? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So the client would – some clients would 
check to make sure everything was in order because it was packed in 
clear bags and then they would sign a delivery slip and my drivers 
20 
would be their way again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just ask above that I forgot.  At 5.1.4.8 
you say: 
“The cash would be packed by SBV in clear sealed 
plastic bags and same could be counted without 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 74 of 228 
 
having to open the bag.” 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How was that possible? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So you can count it 10, 20, 30 you can 
count it.  Sometimes there were money missing like a R1 000,00 but 
then I would just contact SBV with the seal number and I will say to 
them there is money missing can you maybe just check what happened 
there?   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you would be able through the bag at least 
to see the… 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    More or less 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The packs? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it would be more or less… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because of course if there was an error in 
putting together one pack you would not know that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would your drivers do a general check? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes they would 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the amounts that were being delivered. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes they would. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the funds are handed over as I have 
the evidence and there is some delivery slip that is signed. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 75 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What happens to those slips? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Those slips would come back to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  The client would keep a slip and then the 
carbon copy would then come back to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And let us just look at one of those slips if we 
may?  You have it at page – it is – you will find it at 24 in Exhibit DD9. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that your standard delivery slip? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is this the same one you used throughout the 
business of AMFS? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Throughout that is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us just look at the bottom one.  That is a 
delivery slip dated the 12 April 2016, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And how much in cash was delivered to that 
client on that day? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  R15 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  R15 million in cash and the client is – what is 
20 
the client there?  Or who is the client? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  G Markides. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what is that notation under company 
stamp? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would use codes for the clients so if a slip 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 76 of 228 
 
either went missing or they lost a slip it does not have the actual 
company details on there where people might then know there is – 
there is cash on the premises.  So we use codes for our clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are you referring to the code – to the 
number below company stamp? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that number that you would write there would 
represent what? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That would represent a certain client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A certain client? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would use the same code throughout? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  For the same client that is correct yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you would put in that if there was no stamp? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Excuse me Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would put the code if there was no company 
stamp or you would put the code even if there was? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No we would the code down all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the time? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say the purpose for the code was what? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  If this slip had to go missing and someone 
picked it up and a company stamp was there or the company details 
were there they would see that there is funds going to those premises 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 77 of 228 
 
and it might become a security risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am not sure if I understand that.  If you put the 
number – the code if there was no company stamp then I would 
understand that to mean that you want to know which client this slip 
belongs to.  But you say even if there was a company stamp you would 
put the code? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Always the code. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say the code represented a client? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  A certain client yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The code was for your own purposes only? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  For my purposes and the drivers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would the client know the code? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Some of the clients would know their codes 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you said it represented that there was 
money given to them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It just represents their code. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You created the code, your closed corporation not the 
client? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you used the code whether you – the name 
of the company was there in the document or was not there? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We always used the codes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But somebody from outside who did not know 
what the code represented would not be able to make use of it? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 78 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They would not know where to go and look 
for the company yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay maybe it is not important. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair it actually it.  With respect so if I may 
just follow up there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand you to say that you needed to use 
a code because of concerns about security related to where the monies 
were being delivered, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it could not be the identity of the 
client because the client’s identity is here. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  The client signs. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I mean anyone who picks this up knows that 
R5 million has been delivered to Mr G Markides, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So as I understand from your affidavit the code 
is to anonymise the delivery address? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct?  And can I be clear… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Can I just add in also when you are talking 
on a radio we would give the code out again so that people do not 
know. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 79 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There would be speaking over the radio? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No names. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the actual location? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And address where it was going? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us just move into the world of cash in 
transit.  You have your people in the armoured vehicles and you say the 
10 
R15 million it has to go to 1010 and then they would know what that 
means? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go to your check list which is at page 
29 can I assume 1010 is associated with the address that you take 
down. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With the check list which is 23 Whitakers Way. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So your drivers would know this is a 1010 
20 
delivery and they would know to take it to 23 Whitakers Way because it 
is a delivery for Mr G Markides. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that a fair summary? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 80 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think that might be helpful.  But why did you I 
mean a code is meant to conceal something from somebody.  Now the 
purpose of the code was to identify the client and the address where 
cash had to be delivered? 
 MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if anybody who had – I would have thought that 
where you have the heard – a document that has the code should not 
also have the name of the client and the address, the two should not be 
found together and that what should happen is that … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Can I… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your – your… 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Can I maybe explain… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do that. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  The delivery slip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just listen.  No just listen.  I would have thought that 
your drivers would have a document that gives them the names of 
clients and the addresses separate from the code and that either they – 
if they did not know the code to which address or client it related to 
they would have a document somewhere where they could go and check 
so from your point of you you just say I need you to make a delivery to 
20 
1010. Then if they know what 1010 represented or which client it 
represented and the address then they do not have to check.  They say 
okay we will pick the cash and we deliver it to 1010.  If they did not 
know then they have a document where they could go and check that, 
that is what I would expect but I see here you have got the address, the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 81 of 228 
 
name of the client and the address of the client – is the address there 
or no you do not have the address but you have got the name of the 
client, you have got the cell number of the client and then you have got 
the code and of course you have got the amounts.  Yes you can now 
explain? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So on my delivery slips my drivers write this 
out and I will let them know they need to take a certain amount to 1010 
and so they would write the slip out before hand and then when they 
get to the client the client just signs for it.  So yes some clients might 
write their names out like this one and some might just like sign for it.  
10 
But this code was written by our drivers so that they can identify when 
they do the delivery that is going to that certain client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So ja I did not write out this slips this was 
written out by my drivers and that is how they would write it out to know 
what to do with – with the funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen there are some other delivery slips 
that you provided as an annexure to your affidavit to the FSB you will 
find those commencing at page 54, 54.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened to Ms Viljoen’s bundle has happened 
to mine.  So but for now I can – I can continue.  Maybe during the lunch 
break. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 82 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will give you those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can swop ja. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I have to say Chair mine is holding on tight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair we will give you a lever arch 
which may be preferable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – ja – it should be a lever arch file ja.  Okay 
alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we just go to page 54 those as I have it from 
your FSB affidavit are some other delivery slips related to the particular 
10 
investigation that they were conducting, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The copies here Chair at page 54 are very bad.  
You can barely make out what is said there.  So we contacted Ms 
Viljoen about it and she has kindly made available to us the originals of 
those delivery slips which I have in my hand at the moment.  I do 
appreciate that being provided to us.  What I just note here is these 
slips are slightly different to the previous ones.  In fairness to you 
there is a whole was so I am just going to suggest that we hand a few 
to Ms Viljoen and a few to yourself Chair so we can all be looking at a 
20 
similar type.  It is just about how these delivery slips change over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is just about how these delivery slips change 
over time if I may.  We will then make copies of these for the purposes 
of the record Chair so that they – we can have the better copies in the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 83 of 228 
 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The only point of distinction it seems to me Ms 
Viljoen and I would be interested in your comment on it is if we go back 
to the ones at page 24 just for comparison purposes you will see under 
delivery there you seem to have a stamped number under the line Dell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then under the section for company stamp 
is written in hand 1010 on both of the delivery slips that appear on 
page 24.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you look at the originals that we have 
circulated there is nothing under company stamp, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But under Dell is written 1010? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is there any significance to attach to that 
change? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No you will have contact Minute Man and 
ask them why they changed it.  Because these books were ordered from 
20 
Minute Man and if you look on the originals there is a stamped number 
right next to seal number in red.  So I can assume maybe they changed 
the way that they printed the books. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand thank you.  That is helpful.  And 
can I just ask these delivery slips which you still have the originals of 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 84 of 228 
 
these did not form part of what went to the liquidators, did they? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They do have copies of this but my lawyer 
kept the originals ja.  But they do have copies of these. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you made copies of some of the documents 
you handed to the liquidators and retained the originals but in other 
cases you did not retain the originals. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What guided that choice? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Because they were busy investigating this 
my lawyer kept this on file for us in case we needed the originals. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you were happy to hand over all the rest in 
their original form? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Your microphone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we return then to this process which we are 
about to complete it is back at page 8 of your affidavit.  You will see if 
you pick it up at paragraph 5.1.4.11 you talk about what happens after 
the delivery slip has been signed, can you take us through that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes it will be returned to me and then I will 
20 
make sure that everything was delivered and I would then normally file 
it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then in the last paragraph under that 
section of the affidavit you talk about how you would reconcile all of 
this at the end of the month, how would that work? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 85 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would – I had a book where I wrote all the 
deliveries in.  I would take the bank statements and I would take the 
slips then I would do a reconciliation for every client so that they can 
get a transaction sheet and an invoice at the end of the month. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go to page 26 I understand that to 
one example of the type of reconciliation you would do. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what we see there is at various dates over 
the month of May 2015, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You would have an amount deposited, an 
amount delivered, a service fee, excluding and including, what does 
that mean? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Excluding VAT, including VAT. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what does that last column read? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Including and for some reason I do not 
know why I put the column in there but I never used it but it is there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what you took out of the proceeds is 
reflected as amounts including and excluding VAT in the third and 
fourth columns, is that correct? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you would that on a monthly basis as I 
understand your affidavits? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just before we get into the detail of the three 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 86 of 228 
 
transactions that are pertinent for the investigation that the commission 
has embarked upon can I just check in relation to the delivery slips to 
Mr Markides that are the subject matter I understand your evidence to 
be you did not – you do not have those delivery slips, why was that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We just had a robbery or attempted robbery 
– I should say.  One of my men was killed.  The other one was in 
hospital.  He had seven ricocheted bullets in his leg and our vehicle - 
the one vehicle was written off and I can only speculate that the books 
were in that vehicle when it went in for recovery.  That is the only thing 
I can think of why we would not have had these slips. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right but you still managed to do a 
reconciliation I assume? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did you rely on then? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  My bank statement and again the book that 
I wrote in. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to move at page 8 
of the affidavit to the section beginning paragraph 6 because this is 
where you start to deal with your business relationship with 
Mr Markides … 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we can pick it up at paragraph 6.2 you 
say: 
“All of the inquiries …” 
What are those inquiries? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 87 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We had the inquiry with the FSB.  Then the 
SME liquidators and then of course this inquiry with the Hawks. 
Everything we have – we have been dealing with. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you say: 
“All of the inquiries have related to transactions 
carried out for one person namely George Markides 
who was an existing client and who was a sole 
proprietor trading under one of two business names 
being Dedrego or ITH.” 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just get clarity?  Who was your client – 
Dedrego or …? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  George was my client. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  George the - the person? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  George the person was your client and when 
you say there that it traded under one of two business … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is Mr – Is it Markides? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Markides that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the correct pronunciation? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the client was Markides.  Let me say in 
fairness to you that is consistent with the checklist because it is 
George Markides who is the client.  It is his ID number.  It is his income 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 88 of 228 
 
tax number and it is the address that you vetted for him.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you say: 
“He was a sole proprietor trading under one of two 
business names being Dedrego or ITH.” 
Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just would like to go to your FSB affidavit - if 
we may - at page 44. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  44.  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we look at paragraph 5.20.2 on that page you 
state there: 
“In each of the transactions in question I was 
contacted telephonically by an individual by the 
name of George Markides whose business is known 
to me only as ITH and which to the best of my 
knowledge is a sole proprietorship conducted by 
him.” 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is ITH the only trading name that you are aware 
20 
of or is it both Dedrego and ITH? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So what happened was they were known as 
Dedrego.  It was Rustic Stone and then when they moved over they 
stayed Dedrego and then eventually I saw in their signature they would 
refer to themselves as ITH. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 89 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What signature was that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So if Lisa emailed me then in her signature 
it would be and if I phoned they would answer ITH.  So it – in my mind I 
thought maybe a name change or what not but … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But then it is not correct to say at paragraph 
5.20.2 that the business is known to you only as ITH. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So when the FSB did this I went to think 
about it afterwards and I started putting more things together and: 
“They are known to me…” 
That is why statement to you says: 
10 
“They are known to me as Dedrego and ITH.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at the time that you did the FSB affidavit 
they were known to you only as ITH.  Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Well again they were known as Dedrego but 
I eventually called them ITH. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is not correct to say that they were only 
known to you as ITH? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It is not correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you; but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – I am sorry.    Once you knew about ITH did 
20 
you think that was a replacement – replacement of the other name, a 
change of name or did you understand that both names referred to the 
same business? 
MS KALANDRAVILJOEN:  Both names referred to the same business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 90 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did - did you make inquiries to confirm that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No I did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you might have now been dealing with a 
different business.  Might you not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Same person – might have been different 
business yes.  I did however ask who I can invoice and they said to me 
I must invoice Dedrego. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you must continue to invoice Dedrego? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Despite the fact that you notice a name change 
10 
or some other different business that you dealing with? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you were satisfied to continue to invoice in 
the old name albeit that that is not what is appearing on the 
communications? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was just like I say the email address.  So 
it might have been her personal email address I do not know but they 
got to know or I got to know them also as ITH and not just Dedrego. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  but you made no inquiries as to the nature … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of that business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No.  The person stayed the same. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is why I have your evidence to be the 
client was Mr Markides.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 91 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we then go over to page 9 of the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is her affidavit before the Commission? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Commission – indeed Chair.  Apologies we 
– there are three.  So it is useful to be a bit more specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the affidavit to the Commission which you 
will find in EXHIBIT DD9 at page 9.  You begin at paragraph 6.3 there 
talking about your interactions with Mr Markides and the processes you 
followed for taking him on as a client and vetting him.  That we do need 
10 
to spend a bit of time on because it is Mr Markides’ transactions or 
purported transactions in the amount of R9 million that this Commission 
is concerned with.  So if I may you start at paragraph 6.3.1 and you 
say: 
“When Markides – Mr Markides – indicated that he 
wished for his business which I was led to believe 
was a trading house buying goods in South Africa 
and exporting them to the rest of the Africa to be 
moved from AFMS to Rustic Stone our checklist was 
completed and I requested that he forwards a copy 
20 
of his ID to us.” 
Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does it mean when you say there I was 
lead to believe that his business was a trading house?

MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Well with all the inquiries we have had so 
far clearly that is not the case. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No certainly but who led you to believe that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They did.  George did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is that when you were making inquiries as to 
his business …? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes I asked him what do you guys do as a 
business and I was then led to believe that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was his business relevant if he was client? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I was just asking general questions.  What 
do you guys do?  Oh, how long have you been doing it?  Normal 
conversation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you were not then vetting the business?  
You were vetting Mr Markides.  Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this was just part of the conversation? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does he do in the week and … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is right. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He told you he had a trading house buying 
goods in South Africa and exporting them but it was not of concern to 
you to vet that business.  Was it? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Can I ask a question?  How would I vet 
that? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 93 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Unfortunately … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Sorry but how would I vet that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you must answer the questions not ask the 
questions. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you know you know if you do not know you do know.  
Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the answer? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think the answer is no. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes, no is the answer and yes to Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did not vet the business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go down you say I also confirm this is 
at 6.3.2 that: 
“I sent AMFS’ standard terms and conditions to 
him.” 
Ms Viljoen you mention that earlier in your testimony.  In fairness just 
explain to us what happened in relation to Mr Markides and those terms 
20 
and conditions? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We never received it back. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you continued to engage in business with 
him? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 94 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at 6.3.3 you say that: 
“As I had never been to Markides’ premises during 
my time at Rustic Stone I conducted a site visit to 
23 Whittakers Way Bedfordview and confirm that 
the business was conducted there.” 
Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the only premises that you visited in 
relation to Mr Markides? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is the only premises yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what business did you see been conducted 
there? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Well it was offices.  So they had the 
reception desk and it was a normal office, boardroom. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you sure about that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes I am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At that address? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  At 23 – yes I am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know that your deliveries were not to 23 
Whittakers Way according to your delivery – your invoices? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  They had two addresses.  I do know that.  
They had two premises but I went to Whittaker.  I vetted Whittaker and 
that is where we did the deliveries. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But your invoices indicate that the deliveries 
were to another address? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 95 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  As per their request.  They … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So – so let me just get clear here.  You – you 
know that they have two premises … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you only vet one of them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Because the delivery would have only gone 
to the one premises. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But none of your invoices reflect the 23 
Whittaker’s Way address as the delivery? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then I do not understand why your invoice 
would reflect a delivery address which is not the address to which the 
deliveries were made? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  As – as I said they have the two addresses 
and they were working out of Whittaker.  It was their offices where they 
would always be present for they delivery and that is where we went.  
That is where George was and that is where we went. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but the – the point that is being made is the 
invoices reflect a different address not the Whittaker address. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That was the address that they asked me to 
20 
put on the invoicing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you did not vet that address? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It was also the same address that came 
from Rustic Stone.  So it all stayed the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  The question is did you vet that address? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 96 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did not go to that address no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Because as I said my deliveries were to go 
to Bedfordview as per their request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said earlier on that when your driver had 
delivered the cash they would come back and give you – I think – a 
note? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which would be proof that delivery of the cash had 
taken place.  Is that right? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that note – whatever you call it – would have the 
address at which the delivery took place? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So Dedrego’s deliveries always went to 
Whittaker because that is where George – that is where he sat every 
day.  That is where his offices were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you are saying – are you saying that there 
were no deliveries made by your drivers to Mr Markides at any address 
other than the Whittaker address? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It would have been the Whittaker address 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you were not doing the deliveries yourself.  
Were you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So therefore you cannot know that for sure – for sure.  
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 97 of 228 
 
Can you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no.  It would have gone to where 
George is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  If you went – if you did not do the deliveries 
or you were not there when the deliveries were effected at the address 
you cannot know that.  You would have to depend on reports on 
somebody.  Is it not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No I would tell them where to go so they 
would go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but they could decide not to listen to you. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no, no.  No, no they went where they 
were supposed to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no you do not know for sure whether they 
went there if you were not there when they delivered. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes therefore you cannot know.  All you can say is my 
drivers told me that they went to the address to which I said they 
should go and I trusted that they were telling the truth. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But whether or not in fact they were telling the truth I 
20 
do not know. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  We can say it like that yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has to be like that. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 98 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to your invoices for this client. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Page. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will find one of them at page 25.  This is an 
invoice arising from your business relationship with Mr Markides.  Is 
that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Am I correct in saying that this page makes no 
reference to Mr Markides anyone? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It refers to what seems to be an entity called 
10 
Dedrego.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not that a business that you ever vetted? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct but George is Dedrego 
though. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but Ms Viljoen I spent some time being very 
clear about who your client was … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who you were concerned to vet … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Alright, ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is Mr Markides as I have your 
evidence. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  His income tax number, his cellphone, his 
address? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 99 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and this invoice indicates that you are 
delivering for Dedrego to 56 Watt Street.  Correct?  There is no 
reference to this on 23 Whittaker’s Way.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would you allow invoices to be prepared 
for a customer who incorrectly reflected who the customer was and 
where the proceeds in millions of Rands were being delivered? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  As I said Dedrego is at Watt but also they 
have got premises in Whittaker and Mr Markides was always at 
10 
Whittaker. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So why do the invoices for Mr Markides 
who was your client not reflect that as the delivery? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Because as I think that Dedrego is actually 
registered at this address. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen the difficult that invoices that reflect 
the wrong facts create is that in a situation where you are an 
accountable institution under FICA precisely what you do to vet your 
clients is extremely important.  Do you accept that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And particular because businesses that move 
half a billion Rand a month need to be on the lookout for amongst other 
things whether they are involved in facilitating money laundering.  
Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 100 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you then accept that in a business where 
the relationship is with a natural person and an address of that natural 
person has been vetted but invoices are prepared in relation to the 
trading name through which he is conducting business and another 
delivery address you are creating a false impression of the nature of 
the business relationship. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I can see how it can – how it can look like 
that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – I am sorry.  When your driver came back from 
10 
making a delivery they would give you a document which showed or 
which was supposed to show where the delivery took place and who the 
client was.  Is that right? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you call that document? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Delivery notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Delivery note, ja.  Okay, alright.  I just wanted to 
make sure we are on the same page.  Would you look – would you 
examine each delivery note when each driver came back to see whether  
what was written there was in accordance with your expectation in 
20 
terms of whether the money was delivered to the right client and at the 
right address? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  As we said earlier the address is not on the 
delivery slip for security purposes Chair.  So I would – I would check 
the amounts and I would then of course confirm that the client received 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 101 of 228 
 
the funds but the actual address is not on the delivery note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but was there anything or how did you ascertain 
where the deliver took place?  In other words whether it took place at 
the correct address.  How did you ascertain that?  How did you find out 
that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Well if it was not at the address then the 
client would not have signed for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  If – if it was not – if it was not the right 
address then the client would not have signed for it and we only went 
10 
to where the client said this is our address.  This is where you please 
must deliver the funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the client could have had – could have given you 
the Whittaker address but could have arranged – could he not – that 
the delivery be effected at a different address? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It would have been their address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  (Intervenes) own place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their address … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But a different address from the one recorded in your 
books. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So it could have gone to – to Watt Street. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Is that what you are saying Chair? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 102 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  I am saying in terms of the address of - for 
example - Mr Markides your records reflected that his address - as I 
understand the position – was the one for Whittaker Way.  Is that right? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the only address that you have in your – you 
had in your records for him or was there another address? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I – I have two addresses for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had two addresses? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now your instruction to the drivers was it … 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they should deliver at anyone of the two 
addresses or was your instruction that they should deliver at a 
particular address namely the Whittaker address? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I – I have to say I could have told them to 
go to both addresses but my memory of maybe our later deliveries was 
definitely we always went to Whittaker but yes in the earlier days they 
might have gone there but as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I said my memory with our later 2017/2016 
20 
is we normally went to Whittaker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was there any particular importance as far as 
you were concerned of the address to which the cash was delivered … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Just where the person would be to sign for 
it. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 103 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words if – if cash was delivered into an 
address other than the one that you wanted them to deliver cash to 
would that have been something quite important to you or was the 
position that as long as the cash was given to the client it did not 
matter in which address it was delivered? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It – how to explain?  As long as the client 
was there at the address that they supplied us with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if the client was at an address that had not been 
supplied to you were your drivers permitted to deliver? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no, no.  They had to go to the offices. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Viljoen when you went to 
Whittaker’s Way were they operating from a house? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes.  It looked like a house which they 
converted into offices. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because Whittaker’s Way is a residential 
street? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes, yes.  They converted it 
all into offices. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But at that stage your client was Mr Markides.  
20 
Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was relevant to vet the address he gave 
you.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 104 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I have your evidence previously you 
made no inquiries whatever about the source of the funds that 
Mr Markides was depositing into your account? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will go to … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I said I - I vetted him.  I FICA’d him and of 
course I confirmed with his PA that it is their funds. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well Ms Viljoen I FICA’d him is something that I 
am going to have some difficulty with.  What – what does that mean? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I got all the necessary documents from him.  
10 
Sorry my bundle unravelled again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Hofmeyr did tell you she thought it would 
happen again and … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there is a promise I think that it would 
not but I certainly will not hold that against Ms Viljoen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She – she warned you about that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it more convenient to change now … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Let us twist this now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To give her the – the lever arch file now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think we should possibly do that Chair just for 
convenience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us do that ja.  Let us do that.  No let us do 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 105 of 228 
 
that.  Forget about that one Ms Viljoen.  You will be given another one.  
So we will not have this again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen just to be clear we have used 
another file we had on hand.  Please do not look at the spine because 
it relates to another witness but it is just for convenience purposes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That we will give it to you in this form. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I have now – I have now twisted it into little 
swirlies.  So I am thinking maybe it might hold. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us put the other one there in case. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I – I said I wanted to pick up on your statement 
that you FICA’d the client because we will go to the section shortly but 
amongst the legal obligations you had as an accountable institution was 
to establish the source of funds of any of your clients and I have your 
evidence to be you did not do so. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Except for calling them and confirm with 
them. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen calling them and confirming with 
them that a payment has been made is different to establishing from 
them where they sourced the funds that they are going to transact with 
you on.  Do you see that difference? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I see yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 106 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you made no inquiries as to the source of 
the millions of Rands that Mr Markides was asking you to deliver in 
cash (intervenes) business relationship? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  So my understanding was it comes from 
them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who is them? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Mr Markides - his entities.  It comes from 
him – his company.  It – it comes from them.  How do I explain this? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, you have explained it Ms Viljoen but there 
is a difficulty with that answer because your onerous obligations under 
10 
FICA require you to know where funds are coming from when you 
transact with a business as an accountable institution.  Do you accept 
that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Sorry.  I was under the impression or my 
impression was that if it is an electric transfer that it is the bank’s 
responsibility to source where the funds come from where if it was cash 
then it was my responsibility to see where the funds were coming from 
but if I am wrong in my understanding then I do apologise but that was 
my understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will come to the legal obligations in due 
20 
course.  For present purposes you did not check funds.  You 
understand Mr Markides was your client and you did not vet his 
businesses.  Correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in terms of the amounts associated with 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 107 of 228 
 
Mr Markides you indicate in your affidavit that they compromise less 
than one percent of the business of AMFS.  Is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But that is still millions of Rands.  Is it not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I did a quick tally of the delivery slips that were 
relevant to the FSB affidavit.  It seemed to be in the order of an excess 
of 20 million.  Is that a fair computation on my part? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I – I think it was a bit more. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Possibly 30. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I am not sure but it was a bit more yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at least nine million in relation to the 
transactions that we are interested in? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remember to … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh yes.  The answer there was yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give an answer rather than nodding. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no, no I said correct.  Maybe I did not 
say it loud enough. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think you just nodded. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us then please move to your interactions 
with the Hawks and you will find those in the affidavit to the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 108 of 228 
 
Commission in EXHIBIT DD9 at page 11. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  DD9? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the file that you are in. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Ja, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is at page 11.  You begin at paragraph 
6.4.3.1 there and as I read it you state: 
“In March 2018 I was contacted by a certain 
Captain Mogosi who stated that she was from the 
Hawks and wished to interview me as a witness 
relating to a case involving a company called 
10 
Koreneka.” 
Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  (No audible reply). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Please say yes. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes – sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the next paragraph you say: 
“As I did not know this company I asked her to 
explain and it became clear to me that this had 
once again to do with Markides – Mr Markides.” 
Is that correct? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen you did know though in March 2018 
about Koreneka.  Did you not? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  As I said earlier I completely forgot about 
Mr Judeel when I met him in the December.  I – I remembered when you 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 109 of 228 
 
sent me this statement a week ago. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Well 
when 
Mr Judeel 
engaged 
you 
in 
December 2018 had the other issues around Mr Markides arisen yet? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No not yet. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you had an interaction with a private 
investigator for whom you prepared an affidavit detailing and providing 
all your records of your delivery slips with Mr Markides and its 
association with Koreneka but when you were contacted in March 2018 
10 
you had forgotten the reference to Koreneka.  Is that your evidence? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then you go on in that – on that 
page to explain the extent of your interactions with the Hawks and 
steps that you took in relation to the particular transactions that they 
were interested in.  Can you tell us what those were? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  What steps I took? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  In … 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I just gave them all the details, we met at 
a restaurant and we weren’t there long, I opened my water and I don’t 
20 
even think I finished my water and I just explained the business, I gave 
them all the invoices, I think, and some slips and they said they’ll 
contact us because I might need to be a witness but it wasn’t a very 
long interaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Ms Viljoen, as I understand your evidence 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 110 of 228 
 
there’s something that you do between the call from captain Mogosi? 
and then meeting up with her and her colleague at the restaurant at 
Bedfordview and that involves an interaction with Ms Lisa Zogby is that 
correct?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Who is Lisa Zogby? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    She is George Markides’ PA – personal 
assistant. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So what did you do in relation to her? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    When I couldn’t find our delivery receipts I 
10 
contacted her and asked her maybe for her copy and then she sent me 
a brown envelope, she said it’s fine she’ll send proof that the funds 
were delivered and she sent me a brown envelope with receipts in 
there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Okay let’s just go back in the evidence, I 
understand you didn’t have copies of the delivery slips yourself 
because of that heist. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Is that your evidence? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then when you got contacted by 
Captain Mogosi, you then took steps to try and get the client’s counter 
copy of the other copy, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then you made contact with Ms Zogby 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 111 of 228 
 
for that purpose. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And just tell us precisely what happened 
then? 
MS 
KALANDRA 
VILJOEN: 
 
 
 
She 
sent 
me 
a 
brown 
envelope…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      Did she send it or did you collect it? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Um ja, my old driver went to collect it from 
her premises and he dropped it off. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then what happened with those slips? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I gave it over to the Hawks. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       At that meeting? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    At that meeting yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Okay I just want to go to the question of 
your retention of the deliver notes and for that purposed I’d like to go 
to your affidavit of December 2017 which you find commencing at page 
91 of the Exhibit DD9 and if you go down at page 92, it’s the second 
page of that affidavit to paragraph 7 you say there, 
 
“According to my delivery notes, the funds were delivered as 
 
follows”, 
20 
 
And then you detail what happened on the 8 t h of May and what 
happened on the 16 t h of September, I’m just not sure I understand what 
delivery notes you were looking at there? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    As I said earlier, I didn’t write this and I 
did not have delivery notes so I think what it should say is maybe my 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 112 of 228 
 
transaction sheets because I did not have any slips. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Viljoen you did give evidence that you 
didn’t write it but you did give evidence that you read it before you 
signed it, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So this is an error in it’s recordal? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You didn’t have delivery notes? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I did not have delivery notes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So you engage Ms Zogby because you want to 
10 
see if she has copies.    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes maybe she might have copies and I 
just didn’t get it or – I can’t understand why I didn’t have the copies, 
that’s why I said maybe we did not write anything out but ja I contacted 
her to see maybe if she’s got receipts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And did you satisfy yourself as to the 
delivery notes and their authenticity before you handed them over to 
the Hawks? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No and when we had this discussion I 
went and I thought about it, my driver delivered them and I went to put 
20 
them in my car and then I went to pick up my daughter and I never 
checked them up until when the Hawks opened up the brown envelope 
and it had my name on it and when they opened it that was the first 
time I saw it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       What period of time lapse between you 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 113 of 228 
 
collecting them and you meeting with the…(intervention). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    It’s probably a day or two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And can we go to those documents that you 
say were in the brown envelope. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You’ll find them at page 64 are those – and 
they comprise three pages as I have your evidence, it’s 64, 65 and 66 
correct. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Are these accurate copies of what you saw 
10 
in the brown envelope? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And are these your delivery notes? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    They are not, no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Do you have any other knowledge about 
these documents? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Just when I gave them to the Hawks I said 
to them, these are not my delivery slips. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You say in your affidavit that you 
think…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr, let me just get this, when you 
spoke to Mr Markides’ PA, to ask for their copies of delivery notes, is 
the position that what you were asking for, was copies of what your 
drivers would have brought back to you, after they had delivered cash 
to them. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 114 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes that’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But what they gave you – what she gave you was 
delivery notes or was something different. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     As I have your evidence, Ms Viljoen you 
speculate at paragraph- if we return in your affidavit to page 12 you say 
at paragraph 4. – sorry 6.4.3.13 on that page, 
 
“I confirm having now considered these slips and once again 
 
reiterate that the slips are not my documents and I’m unable to 
10 
 
comment on same, further than to state that I believe that they 
 
may well be evidence of the on-delivery of funds once AMFS 
 
had delivered same”, 
 
 
Do you see that?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       What is the basis for your comment there? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Can you elaborate please? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       I’m asking why you said what you said in 
this paragraph, why do you surmise that they have to do with on-
delivery? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Well that is clearly what has been 
happening with Mr Markides’ cases, if I just look at the SME case so I 
can make that assumption that the funds actually never went for his 
business and it went on to someone else. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Were those facts that were established in 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 115 of 228 
 
the SME bank of Namibia case? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes that’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So he transacted with you but then he made 
those funds available to a third party? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So it’s on that basis that you regard these 
as evidence of the onward movement of the cash. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       If we then move over to page 13 we are 
finally, Chair, going to arrive at the transactions that are relevant to the 
10 
investigation, the background, I submit has been important though to 
understand the manner in which the business was operating.  As I have 
it Ms Viljoen there were three transactions related to matters involving 
Koroneka a close company, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      I’d like to suggest that we just go to the 
bank statements to pick up where those payments were received by 
AMFS, the first of those you’ll find at page 70, is this your CC’s bank 
statement?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes it is Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And you were banking at that point with 
Nedbank correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If you go to the fourth line on that page, you’ll 
see a date 08/05/2015 and then you’ll see a next column that is 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 116 of 228 
 
headed, description or narrative, do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       What is reflected as the description or 
narrative for that…(intervention). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Koroneka and the date. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Koroneka…(intervention). 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Koroneka and the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Ms Viljoen just wait until she has finished the 
question and then answer, okay. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Okay Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      Under description or narrative, please read 
out to us what is reflected there. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Koroneka and the date. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Just to get that 06/05/2015 correct. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And if we move across to credits, what is 
the amount that comes into your bank account? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    The 2million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Okay so let’s stop there.  You’ve told us a 
lot about how you would check payments that came in to verify who was 
20 
sending you the amounts, so when Koroneka and a date two days prior 
to this date came into your account, that didn’t cause you concern, that 
it might have been from a source other than Mr Markides? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Why not? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 117 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   Like I said I confirmed with them that it is 
their funds and my assumption is they using Koroneka for their own 
referencing purposes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Right and then the second one on that 
page, you’ll find…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry that last answer, why would they use a 
reference that would mean nothing to you when they deposit amounts 
into your account.  Isn’t the purpose of a reference so that when you 
see the amounts, you know what it’s for and where it’s coming from? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Chair I had this discussion with Ms 
10 
Hofmeyr when we met the first time and you’ll see on my second bank 
statement there’s clients using AMFS as their reference and so I had to 
call clients and confirm that, that was their money so the reference 
means nothing to me but it is important for the client of course.  So I 
did not find that to be funny. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but I would have thought that a reference was 
important to you. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No, no the referencing is not important to 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Let me tell you why I would think it was important 
20 
because then you wouldn’t have to phone the client each time there 
was money put into the account, if you had a reference with a client to 
say in your dealings with me, your reference, when you deposit any 
money will have to be this, and if you saw that there was money under 
that reference then you wouldn’t have to phone the client, do you 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 118 of 228 
 
agree? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do agree yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You didn’t have that arrangement with your clients? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I did not have that arrangement though no. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you did tell us that in a morning you could get 
up to a hundred requests? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Near the end yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And the fact that you didn’t have that arrangement 
must have meant you had to make many calls. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No when it was later in the business, when I 
10 
got all those phone calls, they did start using references identifying 
themselves better but when it all started, I did not have that agreement 
or anything like that with the client. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      If we look on that page 70 for the second 
relevant transaction for our purposes, Ms Viljoen and Chair you’ll find it 
just beyond midway down that page there’s another entry on the 11 t h of 
May 2015 that reads Koroneka, do you see that Ms Viljoen?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And what was the amount deposited on the 
20 
11 t h of May?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    2million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then if we go over to page 74 – 
apologies not 74, 84 you’ll see again, just below halfway down that 
page there’s an entry for the date 16 September and the description is 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 119 of 228 
 
BK, do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Do you confirm – well what is the amount of 
that…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry let me just try and see if I can find it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Apologies, it’s very difficult to find it Chair 
if you…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Will I find the reference to BK on the second 
column…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Yes in the description column, Chair if you 
10 
track the description column down just below halfway you’ll see a BK. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja I see it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And the amount there Ms Viljoen?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    It’s 5million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       5million and these three amounts reflecting 
Koroneka on the 8 t h of May, Koroneka on the 11 t h of May and BK on the 
16 t h of September, have you satisfied yourself, all relate to payments 
from Koroneka? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And not from Mr Markides? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And it’s September 2015, 2016? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       All 2015 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    All 2015, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Chair we’re going to look, in a moment in 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 120 of 228 
 
Ms Viljoen’s evidence at the flow of funds diagram because those dates 
become relevant when we look back at the evidence that’s been given 
previously about when precisely funds came in to Koroneka and when 
this total of 9million came out but we’ll get to that at an appropriate 
point, with your leave, and Ms Viljoen I’d then like to take you, if we 
may, to page 14, the next page of your affidavit. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And pick it up at 3.- sorry at 7.3.7 because 
here you pick up the point about yourself not being in possession of the 
delivery slips, page 14 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry what page…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      Page 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And we are at paragraph 7.3.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You say there, 
 
“Although I’m not in possession of the delivery slips relating to 
 
the three deliveries, I confirm that the funds were delivered to 
 
Markides at his place of business and Lisa Zogby confirmed 
 
this by sending their version of the receipts”, 
20 
 
Do you see that Ms Viljoen?    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       When you say at his place of business 
there, what place do you mean? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Whittaker. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 121 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You know that for certain? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    We did most deliveries to – actually no I 
don’t ever recall us doing deliveries to their Springs address so I want 
to say yes, we did the deliveries all to Whittaker. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       But following on from the Chair’s line of 
questioning earlier you don’t know that as a fact do you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I don’t know it as a fact but my instructions 
to my drivers were Whittaker. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      Despite what was reflected on the invoices?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      Ms Viljoen I then want to move to paragraph 
7.3.9 and 7.3.10 on that page because you make some – what I want to 
suggest are concluding remarks there after your affidavit has  detailed 
the facts of your engagemnts with Mr Markides and your processes.  At 
paragraph 7.3.9 you state, 
 
 
“I wish to record that I took all steps necessary to establish 
 
Markides’ identity and confirmed same by obtaining a copy of 
 
his identity document, I obtained his income tax number and 
 
personally inspected his business premises, and then the next 
 
paragraph, I never received any cash at all from Markides and 
20 
 
I further confirm that the transactions in question were run of 
 
the mill for cash in transit business and did not seem 
 
suspicious at all”, 
 
Do you stand by those statements? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 122 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       I then – I kept promising in the course of 
your evidence that we would finally go to FICA and look at the various 
obligations that you had as an accountable institution.  Chair with your 
leave I’d like to go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes let’s do that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You’ll find the relevant provisions in the 
legislation bundle under tab 5 which contains the Financial Intelligence 
Centre Act 38 of 2001 and where I’d like to suggest we start, is at page 
122 of – within that Act.  Ms Viljoen, we’ve already established in your 
evidence the importance placed on…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr did you say page 122? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       122 in the top right pagination, do you have 
that Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     We’ve already covered in your evidence the 
responsibility that accountable institutions have to take steps to guard 
against money laundering, you accept that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And you had taken legal advice that you were 
an accountable institution under FICA in the form of a money remitter, 
20 
correct?    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So we start with what the FICA 
requirements are on that page at section 21, you have to among other 
things – I’m going to summarise, just for the purposes of the efficiency 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 123 of 228 
 
of the evidence, what section 21 is concerned with is your need to 
establish and verify the identity of the client, that’s under 21 (1) A, do 
you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then if you go down to 21A you’re also 
required to understand and obtain information on the business 
relationship, do you see that, and what you have there is the following, 
 
“When an accountable institution engages with a prospective 
 
client to establish a business relationship as contemplated in 
 
Section 21, the institution must, in addition to the steps 
10 
 
required 
under 
21, 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
it’s 
risk 
 
management compliance programme, obtain information to 
 
reasonably enable the accountable institution to determine 
 
whether future transactions that will be performed in the 
 
course of the business relationship concerned,  are consistent 
 
with the institutions knowledge of that prospective client 
 
including information describing a) the nature of the business 
 
relationship concerned, b) the intended purpose of the 
 
business relationship concerned, c) the course of the funds 
 
which the prospective client expects to use in concluding 
20 
 
transactions in the course of the business relationship 
 
concerned”, 
 
Do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And I have it as your prior evidence that 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 124 of 228 
 
you did not at any point, establish the source of funds as you were 
required to do under section 21A (C) is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    To me, establishing where the funds came 
from was to contact and confirm with the client that it is their funds. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      The source of funds that the prospective 
client expects to use in concluding the transaction, let’s break it down 
in fairness. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Your client is transacting with you, is it not 
by depositing an amount in your account. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:     Yes that’s correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So what this section – if we read that 
section in plain terms it’s saying you must establish where the source 
of funds for that transaction with you is coming from, do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Again I would read it as, they are the 
source and I confirmed they are the source from them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Did you receive legal advice to that effect? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Not that I can recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Would you have read this yourself, the actual Act 
yourself? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I can’t remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     In other words, where would you have gained 
information from? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:     I did ask my attorney…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:       Hang on Ms Viljoen just learn to wait until the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 125 of 228 
 
question is completed, okay. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Where would you have got the information from as 
to what your obligations were under FICA? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    My attorney sent it to me and I probably 
would have read it on all the information sent to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    He would have – did he send to you the whole Act, 
did he send to you relevant sections of the Act, did he send to you a 
memo or a note or a letter explaining what the obligations were?    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I cannot remember in which format it was 
10 
sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes.   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I can’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay but do you have a recollection that you did 
read the Act or you don’t have that recollection, the Act – when I say 
the Act not necessarily that you read the whole Act but at least you 
read what you considered was necessary to establish your obligations.   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do remember reading some yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Okay and you did understand that the Act required 
you to establish the source of the funds or what was your 
20 
understanding? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    My understanding was I can confirm with 
the client that it is their funds and that would of course then be the 
source of the funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:       That was your understanding? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 126 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Not that you had to ask the client, where did you 
get the funds from? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay, alright.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Just to go back to the language of 21 A (C) 
you’ll see that it says that what you need to establish is the source of 
the funds which that prospective client expects to use in concluding 
transactions in the course of the business relationship.  So source of 
funds are where they got, what they are going to use in transacting with 
10 
you, do you see that reading? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that now yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You didn’t see that reading at any point 
previously? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   I don’t recall doing that no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       If we go over the page to page 123 the next 
relevant obligation is at 21 (C) right at the bottom of the page, it’s a 
requirement to do ongoing due diligence, were you aware of that 
obligation? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And you’ll see, we’ve had this reference 
before, there’s a constant reference in this section to a risk 
management and compliance programme that each accountable 
institution has to develop, had you developed one of those?    
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Can you repeat that please? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 127 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       If you look at section 21 (C) it begins, 
 
“An accountable institution must, in accordance with it’s risk 
 
management and compliance programme”, 
 
And then it goes on to talk about the various steps you take to 
do a due diligence.  What I’m interested in, we’ve had that reference to 
the risk management and compliance programme in the previous 
section we were looking at, and I’m just asking, did you develop a risk 
management and compliance programme in your business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I did not no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Are you aware that, that’s another 
10 
requirement of accountable institutions under FICA? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Please give the answer now? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you, if we speak at the same time, 
the record can’t pick it up. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      And then 21 (E) is fairly important for the 
conducting of your business Ms Viljoen because what 21 (E) provides is 
that if an accountable institution is unable to do certain things, and I’ll 
20 
go into it in detail, it may not establish a business relationship with any 
client and let’s look at what you have to have in terms of this section 
before you can conduct business.  You have to establish and verify the 
identity of the client or other relevant person, that’s a) under b) you 
have to obtain the information contemplated in 21 (A) you’ll recall that’s 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 128 of 228 
 
the section dealing with source of funds and you have to conduct an 
ongoing due diligence as contemplated in 21 (C) which we’ve just been 
looking at and if you fail to do any of those three things under (i) you 
may not establish a business relationship or conclude a single 
transaction with a client, do you see that?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Ms Viljoen your evidence has been that you 
did not take those steps, correct?   
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So this section means you were prohibited 
10 
from 
establishing 
any 
business relationship 
or concluding any 
transaction with any of the clients in respect of whom you did not take 
those steps, do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you, if we go over the page to 
section 125, those are the sections there dealing with the duty to keep 
records.  I indicated to you earlier in the evidence that we’d go back to 
those sections.  In summary form, and I’m happy to go to the actual 
text if you want to, but what sections 22 and 22 (A) indicate is that you 
must keep records of the due diligences that are done and you must 
20 
also keep transaction records, were you aware of that obligation? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No I was not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then at section 23 it makes clear that 
those records have to be kept for a period of at least five years under 
sub (a), do you see that? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 129 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       I take it you were not aware of that 
obligation either? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    As I said earlier no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then Ms Viljoen if we go over to page 
129 – Chair I see we are at 1 o’clock there are one or two aspects just 
to complete on FICA, with your leave I suggest we do that and then 
take the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes let’s do that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     So at page 129 there’s a section dealing with 
10 
suspicious and unusual transactions, that’s section 29, do you see 
that?   
MS KIALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Chair this section is one of the sections of 
FICA that actually is not confined to accountable institutions, most of 
the sections of the Act place obligations on accountable institutions 
and that’s why we’ve been engaging with Ms Viljoen because she 
understood herself to be an accountable institution.  Section 29 is 
actually much broader, it applies to any person who carries on a 
business or is in charge of or manages a business or who is employed 
20 
by a business and who knows or ought reasonably to have known or 
suspected certain things.  I only preface the question   with that so that 
we understand this is an obligation that accountable institutions and 
others have under FICA and what you’re required to do , Ms Viljoen  as 
any person who carries on a business is to make a report to the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 130 of 228 
 
Financial Intelligence Centre if in the course of your business you come 
across what are called suspicious and unusual transactions,  were you 
aware of this provision of the Act and the obligations it placed on you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I was yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       But I had your evidence earlier that you 
didn’t look at the guidance notes ever that were published by FICA is 
that right? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s right yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Did you ever make a suspicious or unusual 
transaction report to the FIC in the course of your business 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      But you were aware of the obligation to do 
so?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       You’ll see that one of the examples of a 
suspicious or unusual transaction which you’re required to report on, 
under (B) is a transactional series of transactions to which the 
business is a party (i) facilitated or is likely to facilitate the transfer of 
the proceeds of unlawful activities or property which is connected to an 
offence relating to the financing of terrorist or related activities and (b) 
20 
it’s a transaction that has no apparent business or lawful purpose, do 
you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see it yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then under (c) there one of the other 
suspicious or unusual transactions are transactions where the business 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 131 of 228 
 
has been used or is about to be used for money laundering purposes, 
do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So if you had been alerted to the fact that 
your business was being used for any of these purposes, you did know 
that you had an obligation to report it, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    That’s correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Chair just to conclude this point the 
guidance note which is of relevance is the one that appears at 159.1 of 
this bundle and the relevant page you’ll find at 159.14 and you’ll see on 
10 
that page, Ms Viljoen there’s a heading, Unusual Business, do you see 
that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    I see that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:      Just to give you the benefit of this part of 
the notice, what the FIC is doing in this guidance note it, it’s trying to 
provide financial – well accountable institutions and others with 
guidance as to what they should be on the lookout for, for suspicious 
and unusual transactions and you’ll see under that heading, Unusual 
Business, there’s a  list bulleted of the types of unusual businesses 
that you should be on the lookout for and it’s the first one that I’m 
20 
interested in,  deposits of funds with the request for the immediate 
transfer elsewhere. Ms Viljoen that’s a description of your business, 
isn’t it?  
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you, Chair there will be a few 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 132 of 228 
 
questions to follow up on after the break I don’t imagine that they will 
take long, but if it’s convenient we can take the lunch break now. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay we’ll take the lunch break an we’ll resume at 
five past two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we took the liberty 
over the break of replacing your and Ms Viljoen’s soft cover files into a 
lever arch file which should make. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you for that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The remainder of the afternoon’s proceedings a 
little bit easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I want to pick up if I may with that point 
about unusual business practices that we ended before the break with 
Ms Viljoen but before doing that Ms Viljoen in fairness to you the 
transactions that this commission is concerned about took place in 
2015, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Those were the two in May and the one in 
September, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have been through a number of provisions 
of FICA as we calling it colloquially and in fairness to you I must place 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 133 of 228 
 
on record that some of those obligations arose pursuant to an 
amendment in the Act in 2017 which was after the transactions that are 
relevant to the work of the commission.  I do want to state that.  What 
is clear though is that the ones that operated at the time required 
adequate steps to be taken to identify and verify the identity of your 
clients and I take it to be your evidence that you are now satisfied that 
the steps you took were not adequate, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I would still say I think they were adequate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you had no way of knowing that another 
entity was in fact transacting with you, right? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So you did not know that it was not Mr 
Markides depositing R2 million into your account on the 6 May 2015, 
correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The obligations to keep the records was 
present at the time and I understand you to say you did not know of 
that obligation at the time? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I was informed that we are getting the 
records back. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well that may be relevant to the commission’s 
further investigation but we will be in touch with you in due course.  I 
would then like to pick up this point that we ended on where we were 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 134 of 228 
 
looking at the guidelines of the financial intelligence centre about 
suspicious and unusual transactions and we looked at page 159.14 of 
the legislation bundle and the question I asked just before the break 
was the first unusual business that is described by FICA as requiring 
the possible reporting obligation under Section 29 to arise is deposits 
of funds with a request for their immediate transfer elsewhere, you will 
recall that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just for absolute clarity that Section 29 
obligation to report suspicious and unusual transactions operated in 
10 
2015 and you were aware of it as I have your evidence? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we said is that not a description of your 
business and after a little bit of a pause I had your evidence to be yes 
it was. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to probe that just a bit further 
because I want to suggest to you that despite your description of your 
business as a cash in transit service it may well not have been that and 
let me do so in the following way and I would like your comment on how 
20 
I am describing a run of the mill cash in transit business.  Okay so it 
seems to me cash in transit works when for example retailers who have 
a need for cash in order to conduct their businesses need to deposit 
cash at the end of the day with their banks and so they need somebody 
to transport all of that cash that they have on site to the bank so that 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 135 of 228 
 
their funds – those funds can be credited to their account, does that 
sound like part of what cash in transit businesses traditionally do? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  It sounds like part of it yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So end of a day of retail they take the money 
from the retailer to its bank so that its bank account can be credited, 
correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It seems to me those retailers may also need 
funds maybe at the start of a week or a day because they need so many 
R5 coins and so many R10 notes and so they engage with their bank 
10 
and they to the bank I need this much to be withdrawn from the account 
in these denominations and then the bank procures somebody to bring 
it to them, does that sound accurate to you? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that the Financial Intelligence 
Centres Guidance Notes on money remitters only identify banks and 
entities engaged in foreign exchange as potential money remitters 
under the Act? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see cash in transit businesses do not enter 
20 
into transactions the traditional ones.  Do you accept that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  With you saying it yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the description I have given there is no 
transaction that it is involved in because all it does is literally move 
money from the retailer to the bank where it is going to be credited 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 136 of 228 
 
against its account or from the bank where it has been withdrawn to the 
retailer, do you understand that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The reason why this is important is because 
any entities that receive deposits of money from the general public and 
then have an agreement to repay those funds over time to the clients 
from whom they receive them are actually operating the business of a 
bank, are you aware of that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Okay let us just go in fairness to those 
10 
sections of the Banks Act because what they tell us is what the 
business of a bank and what a deposit means and you will find that 
under the last tab of the legislation bundle.  And it commences Chair at 
page 221.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the relevant section I would like to look at 
first is at page 234.  And that is where we find the definition of a 
business of a bank and under A it means the acceptance of deposits 
from the general public including persons in the employ of the person 
so accepting deposits as a regular feature of the business in question.  
20 
Ms Viljoen is that not a description of your business? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Would deposits be EFT deposits or cash 
deposits? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Let us look at the definition of deposit.  You 
will find that at page 227.   
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 137 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  227.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see – apologies. You will see midway 
down that page a definition of deposit.  It says there:  
“When used as a noun it means any amount of money paid 
by one person to another person subject to an agreement 
in terms of which  
a.  An equal amount or part thereof will be conditionally 
or unconditionally repaid either by the person to 
whom the money has been so paid or by any other 
person with or without a premium on demand or at 
10 
specified or unspecified dates or in circumstances 
agreed to by or on behalf of the person making the 
payment and the person receiving it.” 
And then b. tells that it is irrelevant whether interest is or is not 
payable on that deposit.  So in layman’s terms as I read that section a 
deposit is when you receive an amount of money – an amount of money 
is paid from person A to person B and there is an agreement between 
those two people that it will be repaid on any terms., 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  On any terms yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ja.  Do you see that? 
20 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that what your business was doing? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Um… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I must just raise a question. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 138 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I thought of when I was trying to understand 
what the need was for her business.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ordinarily when you talk about the deposit of money 
you talking about depositing cash but sometimes you may be depositing 
a cheque. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And with – with technology there may be all kinds of 
ways. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when I was asking her questions about what they 
do at some stage I also wanted to say well she was saying a client will 
request cash of a certain amount on the particular day but she will not 
make arrangements for the delivery of that cash to the client until the 
client has transferred money… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Into her account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when you transfer electronically that might 
20 
depend on if there is a definition of transfer and of money somewhere I 
guess it is not cash that moves.  It is information is moved. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the bank will understand that from now on this 
money which belonged to A now belongs to B. So that the question 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 139 of 228 
 
would be whether when they – there is a transfer like that one can talk 
of about – of a deposit of money or not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I have not looked at various definitions so 
– but I am just raising it because it may arise in regard to this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also because I had wondered at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought well maybe it might not arise.  It might 
be my ignorance of technology. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly not Chair with respect.  If I may just 
respond in the following way.  What is peculiar about the traditional 
cash in transit business that I was debating with Ms Viljoen is that 
there is no deposit into an account of the cash in transit business.  It 
goes and it literally moves money between a client and its bank.  The 
bank… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes physically. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Physically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja this is… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It takes that – those hard notes and coins if 
20 
they are ever interested in coins and it takes it from location A to 
location B or the reverse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is like SBV. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is like SBV indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 140 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  And Chair with respect that is an 
important analogy because the arrangement of Ms VIljoen’s business 
that we have been discussing today puts her in no different position to 
the four big banks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because the banks can receive deposits by 
EFT and they can give cash to their client using SBV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand AMFS’s business model it sits 
in exactly the same position. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It receives deposits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which enables it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Electronically in the main as I understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To receive the money. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it gets the cash from SBV but uses its 
own vehicles to then deliver those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is not I want to submit and have your 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 141 of 228 
 
comment Ms Viljoen in the position of the traditional cash in transit 
business with whom no deposits are being made and no transactions 
are being entered to, do you accept that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just to complete what my query on your 
understanding.  When there is a transfer from one account to another. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of different. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  People – entities no actual transfer of cash happens 
as such? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No not necessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just – it is just.. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is credits and debits against accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is credits ja credits and debits. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is all. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for all intents and purposes it is considered that 
20 
money has moved from one account into another. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  And Chair if I may in that respect 
there are transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But what I must be clear on is they would not 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 142 of 228 
 
constitute deposits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the sense that the Banks Act is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Unless… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The relationship is as and I will describe it now 
in simplified terms if I may?  Entity A or person A only engages in a 
deposit with Entity B.  If there is a transfer of funds and there is an 
agreement between those two entities that that amount will be repaid 
10 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To person A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Pursuant to certain aspects of the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Arrangements. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Maybe interest, maybe not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Maybe over time but just transactions of EFT 
nature between businesses are not deposits. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They are deposits when you are acting like a 
bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You are holding the money of someone. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 143 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And pursuant to arrangements you make giving 
that back to them as when they require it. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is that feature of AMFS that I have 
suggested to Ms Viljoen constitutes the business of a bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but within the context of the definition of deposit 
must I approach this definition on the basis that in the context of Ms 
Viljoen’s business deposit includes transfer by her clients of money into 
her account? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would you know whether that is based on the act 
or just on the practice and reality and everyone – everyone’s 
understanding who understands technology? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair certainly deposit as we read it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Means an amount of money paid by one person 
to another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Act does not specify the method of 
20 
payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Historically it may have been cheques, earlier 
than that cash or even earlier than that some other matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But resistive. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 144 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But – indeed – indeed, but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The essence of the arrangement I would submit 
is that one person pays to another person through whatever means an 
amount of money that is going to be repaid back to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On certain conditions and terms.  Ms Viljoen 
the consequence of that is that if indeed AMFS was conducting the 
business of the bank it would have to be registered as a bank, are you 
aware of that? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay well the Banks Act we do not need to go 
into the provisions but it requires any entity doing that receiving 
deposits and ensuring that they are repaid subject to whatever terms 
are agreed between the entities have to be registered.  But I take it you 
were not aware of that until now? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Until three seconds ago. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And the Act goes further and makes it 
clear that conducting the business of a bank without registration is a 
criminal offence.  It also provides that conducting the business of a 
20 
bank without registration may result in all of the proceeds that were 
obtained in the course of that business being required to be repaid, 
were you aware of those provisions? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen I would then like to move just to 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 145 of 228 
 
what we can make of your evidence in relation to the monies from 
Koreneke.  As I have it and I am putting this to you for your comment if 
there is any part of my summary that you disagree with.  Your evidence 
as I have it is that you were misled by Ms Markides that an amount of 
R9 million that was paid to you came from him, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you have subsequently established that 
they did not come from him, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And they came from a business called 
10 
Koreneke Trading and Project CC, is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I would just like to go at this point to the 
diagram that I mentioned earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen this is not a diagram that you have 
prepared it has been prepared by the commission and it simply is a flow 
of funds to represent graphically how the money arrived in Koreneke 
and ended up in you and if there is any aspect of it that you disagree 
with you must please let us know.  You will find it in your bundle right 
20 
at the end at page 105 and it will also be reflected on the screens for 
everyone’s benefit.  I reiterate again this is not information of which 
you have personal knowledge it is our ability just to track this story 
together so that it makes sense in the context of the previous that has 
been received. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 146 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said the diagram is at what page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At 105. 
CHAIRPERSON:  105. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of DD9.  Ms Viljoen you will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will identify AMFS beneath Koreneke. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  In the middle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the middle right?  That is the only part of 
this that you could speak to and I will take you to in a moment.  But 
Chair this is just a further extension of the diagram we looked on on 
10 
Saturday because on Saturday we got up to AMFS in the evidence of 
Ms Tlatsana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so what we have done is we have added a 
few further lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As the evidence is progressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We felt it appropriate only to stop at the point 
of Ms Tlatsana’s evidence on Saturday. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And now having the benefit of Ms Viljoen’s 
evidence we continue with those lines further down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just to orientate you Ms Viljoen you have 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 147 of 228 
 
got a diagram on the top left representing the North West Government.  
And you have got represented by red lines on that page the monies that 
come out of the North West Government, do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I see it yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will see that sometimes the money out 
of the North West goes to South African Express which is in the top 
right hand corner. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Corner got it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And from South African Express it goes into 
Koreneke, you see that amount of R31 million. 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:   I do yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or it goes directly from the North West 
Government into Koreneke and that is the line representing 2.606335 
million, do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I see that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is all evidence that we have received 
previously in the commission.  At then sits in Koreneke about 51 million 
in total and from Koreneke it is distributed to various entities.  If I work 
from the left of the page there is a payment to an entity called Elskakol 
then a payment for what is described as management consulting.  Then 
20 
a payment to an individual referred as Mr Papitas and then we have the 
payment of R9 million to AMFS, do you see that? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I see that yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your evidence has confirmed that those 
funds were received by Koreneke. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 148 of 228 
 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then this is the part that you can speak to 
is the line in green going down from that.  That is a payment on 9 
million as you understood it being made to Mr Markides, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well to be absolutely accurate it is an amount 
slightly less than 9 million because you took off a fee. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes I would have taken off my fee yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is a small bit less than that and then the 
question is where does it go from there and all that you have been able 
10 
to offer in that regard are those delivery slips that you receive from Ms 
Zogby is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We will continue Chair with the 
Neosolutions lines after the evidence on Thursday.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But that just assists to graphically track the 
flow of funds in this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if that diagram correctly and accurately reflects 
the flow it looks like somebody at SA Express would cause SA Express 
20 
to well would cause money to go from SA Express to Koreneke various 
stops on the way and then he ultimately meets it somewhere later. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 149 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he causes it to ultimately go to his account but it 
is a long round about … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Route but ultimately it ends with him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair that is the force of some of the questions 
I put to Ms Viljoen at the commencement of today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because rendering unlawfully obtained 
proceeds into cash really does stop the trail often because then you do 
not have transactions in bank accounts that can be tracked.  And it is 
10 
why I suggested to Ms Viljoen that any businesses involved in cash 
should be on high alert for their possible involvement in the facilitation 
of money laundering.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because you change – you engage in a series 
of transactions to hide in a sense the origination of the funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and how they… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And their ultimate end point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Viljoen just to return to you we established 
from your evidence that you have subsequently learnt that those funds 
were deposited to you by an entity called Koreneke, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Correct yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 150 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your evidence also is that you never vetted 
Koreneke as a client, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the consequence of that is that there was a 
business transaction between AMFS and Koreneke without any vetting 
been done of that client, correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Also without my knowledge but yes correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your evidence is that you did nonetheless 
deliver R9 million in cash less your fee to what you understood to be Mr 
Markides’ appointed premises, correct? 
10 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you also – the only knowledge you have 
after that point are the delivery slips provided by Ms Zogby is that 
correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Viljoen those are the essence 
of the submissions that – at least the questions that I wanted to ask of 
you today.  Chair there are or two concluding submissions I propose to 
make just to in relation to the upshot of Ms Viljoen’s evidence and it is 
a look down the line to the possible types of recommendations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That the commission may consider making. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if I may just take a moment on that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja do that. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 151 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Viljoen of course if there is any aspect 
of what I say that you want to offer comment on afterwards you will be 
given an opportunity to do that.  Chair the concern arising I submit from 
the nature of the AMFS business is that it really was acting as a bank 
in the pursuit of its work.  But a bank that was not regulated by the 
Banks Act at the time and if there are others operating in a similar way 
it will be our recommendation in due course that one of the 
recommendations that this commission considers making is that the 
entities responsible for regulation of the Banks Act that being the 
Reserve Bank and the Registrar of banks or indeed the FICA Act, the 
10 
Financial Intelligence Centre be mandated to investigate these type of 
businesses in closer detail. Because what we have established through 
this evidence is that there was an operation carrying at its peak more 
than half a billion rands of funds.  And if this commission is to have 
some chance of establishing where some of the public funds that we 
know were unlawfully obtained ended up it may well be that these types 
of entities need to be investigated further.  If there is a way to check 
where public funds pursuant to state capture corruption and fraud went 
it may well be it will be our recommendation that these oversight bodies 
need to look into these types of entities. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair it was for that reason that we asked Ms 
Viljoen at the outset whether she knew of other businesses that were 
engaged in a similar type of business model. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 152 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Her answer in fairness to her was she knows 
that the industry of cash in transit is quite big but through the 
questions today it is my submission that we have established that the 
business was not a traditional cash in transit business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But at least Rustin Stone we have as her 
evidence operated in a similar manner.  Ms Viljoen are you aware 
whether Rustic Stone continues to operate? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No they closed down. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And are you aware of any others in the industry 
10 
that operate on the same business model as matters stand currently? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  The person that bought the business from 
me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and you sold that out at the end of 2017, 
is that correct? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that business actually does continue to 
operate does it? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  I do not know if it operates the same way I 
did. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was a sale of business transaction so we 
could investigate that further? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if the business they run or the businesses that 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 153 of 228 
 
they conduct fall within the definition of the business of a bank. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would mean the Banks Act applies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if the Banks Act applies I guess would mean that 
the regulatory bodies could – could move in and investigate? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed they have extensive powers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because the whole point about bank regulation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that it is done pursuant to extremely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Rigorous processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You cannot operate the business of a bank 
lawfully in this country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Without being registered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  With the Reserve Bank. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we know as a matter of fact that there are 
very few entities who are in fact registered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Chair I will not take you through all the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 154 of 228 
 
provisions now but the Banks Act has detailed investigative procedures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For inspectors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Whenever there is a suspicion that a business 
is operating as a bank without being registered as such they can do the 
investigation, they can take further steps including requiring refunds to 
those who have deposited with the institutions and then in the 
background of all of that there are the criminal processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Associated with that conduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am concerned that it may be that such regulatory 
bodies should consider looking into such businesses without having to 
wait for the… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Commission to finish its work because it may well be 
that there could be serious transactions that are illegal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where the – the money you know might not be traced 
after some time and – and the tax payer and other persons get 
20 
prejudiced. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By businesses who conduct the business of a bank 
without being registered. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 155 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a bank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In that regard my submission is that there have 
been ongoing engagements between this commission and both the 
Reserve Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the Financial Intelligence… 
MEETING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  The money you know might not be traced after some 
time and – and the tax payer and other persons get prejudiced. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By businesses who conduct the business of a bank 
without being registered. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a bank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In that regard my submission is that there have 
been ongoing engagements between this commission and both the 
Reserve Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the Financial Intelligence Centre. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They have certainly always been available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the course of the investigations to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 156 of 228 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As they must. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As organs of state the regulations require them 
to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that may be a profitable route. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  to raise with them even in the interim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is as you point out Chair with respect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Firmly within their mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja yes, yes.  No, no that is what I think that it will be 
necessary to alert them so that – because if there are regulatory bodies 
they entitled indeed they are under a duty if they become aware of 
information that suggest that somebody may be in breach or in 
contravention of the Banks Act to take the necessary steps. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Viljoen were there any 
20 
comments you wanted to make in response? 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  No thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much Ms Viljoen. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN: Thank you Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 157 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We leave it at that for now.  Should the need arise to 
ask you to come back you will be contacted but thank you very much 
and you are excused. 
MS KALANDRA VILJOEN:  Thank you for your time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may suggest we have a new witness 
and there is a bit of a change over that needs to take place would it be 
appropriate to take a five minute break for that purpose? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will take a five minutes break and we will 
resume at quarter to three.  
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon Ms September. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us proceed. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I may begin the evidence 
that is to be led through this witness deals with a different focus within 
this particular aviation stream.  In particular it is the evidence of a – an 
employee of South African Express.  Her evidence deals with 
particularly the procurement of Jet A1 Fuel by South African Express 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 158 of 228 
 
which was borne out of the operational need of South African Express 
and in particular the Pilanesberg Airport. 
Through this evidence Chair certain questions will be raised.  
The first question is whether or not any proper procurement processes 
were in fact followed for the supply of jet fuel to Pilanesberg Airport 
and forgive me Chair I am – it is Jet A1 Fuel for the record but I may 
just interchangeably use it as jet fuel. 
The next question which is a bit more of a broader one is 
whether or not proper procurement processes were observed when 
South African Express concluded contractual arrangements with a 
10 
particular entity called EML Engineers and Construction trading as EML 
Energy and certain IDC funding that was related to that transaction and 
lastly Chair the other main question that would be placed before this 
Commission is whether or not there were any fraudulent or corrupt 
activities in relation to these particular procurement processes. 
Having said that Chair the bundle before you is marked DD12 
and with your leave if I could just give some clarity to what exactly is 
contained in this bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Under – there are three tabs to the 
20 
bundle.  Under the first tab Chair we will find the affidavit for this 
witness.  Under the second tab Chair are two documents in particular 
which relate to this witness’ bundle but it is just more comprehensive to 
what was actually included in their and under the third bundle is an 
affidavit by a Mr Gavin Fourie who will not be called to give evidence 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 159 of 228 
 
today but we submit that his affidavit which includes some annexures 
be tendered and placed before this – this Commission as evidence. 
During 
the evidence of this 
witness the 
affidavit of 
Mr Gavin Fourie will certainly be looked to – to corroborate or to 
support certain allegations and a version that is tendered by this 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Unless Chair has anything else for 
me to address I then request that the oath be administered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the statement or 
10 
affidavit of Ms Estelle Loock and annexures will be marked EXHIBIT 
DD12.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may administer the oath or 
affirmation to the witness. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Estelle Loock. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 160 of 228 
 
please raise your right hand and say so help me God. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  So help me God. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  (duly sworn, states) 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Loock – if I may – could I ask you 
to turn to page 1 of the bundle before you please?  Do you recognise 
this document? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes this is my affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And can I ask you to turn to page 14 
– 1-4?  Whose signature appears where deponent is marked? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is my signature. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so it is correct then that you 
deposed to this affidavit on 22 May 2019 before a Commissioner of 
Oaths? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 98 
please?  Is it correct that this particular page was not included as part 
of your affidavit when you deposed to it but that you have since had an 
opportunity to have a look at it? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Is it true that you are 
20 
currently employed by South African Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I am Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what position do you hold? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Airport’s Coordinator for SA Express. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When did you first join SA Express 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 161 of 228 
 
Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I joined on 8 November 2000. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what position did you hold when 
you joined the organisation? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I started off as a cabin crew member. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When were you appointed to the 
positon of Airport’s Coordinator? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It was around 2009 – apologies – around 
2008/2009 that I was appointed yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the evidence that you present 
10 
today is it correct that those – that your evidence concerns events that 
took place during 2017? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Well predominantly during 2017? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  2017 - that is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And during that year or during the 
time period of 2017 who were you reporting to as your immediate 
report? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  My immediate report was the General Manager 
for Operations which was Mr Dave Allenby. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How would you describe your working 
relationship with Mr Allenby? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I had a good relationship with Mr Allenby. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would you say that he trusted your 
professional abilities? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 162 of 228 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I can. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how long did you report to him? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  If my memory is correct I reported to him about 
three to four years. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and is he still with SA Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No.  He has gone on pension. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When was that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The end of last year around – I think it is 
September – if I can refer to my affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes you are welcome.  It is actually 
10 
at paragraph 3 on page 1 you do inform that Mr Allenby retired around 
September 2018. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct – September 2018 yes, ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So by the time of the 
year 2017 how long approximately were you in the role of Airport’s 
Coordinator? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Around about eight years. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, okay.  Before we get into what 
exactly your role entailed during our consultation Chair she gave some 
really useful background to set context for her position which is 
20 
necessary to explore.  Ms Loock there are different user departments 
within SA Express as I understand.  Is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so can you please explain to the 
Chair the different user departments within SA Express? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 163 of 228 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Alright.  If I can explain we have main units and 
then – sorry – apologies Chair.  We had main units and then there were 
sub – sub … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do think the mic is close enough.  So you might not 
need to come closer to it. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Need to come forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, just relax and then speak. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Okay.  So we have main sections in our industry 
and then there are subsections underneath those and if you want me to 
I can explain those to you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please if you may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might just have to raise your voice a little bit but 
without going to close to the mic okay alright.  Continue. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Alright.  We have an Operations Department 
which contain Flight Operations.  That is the flight deck and the cabin 
crew.  We have an Airport Operations Section which is – contains 
mostly the stations.  The OCC Department – it stands for Operations 
Control Centre. 
That is more for the aircraft movements and deployment of 
flights and the Ramp Services also fell under Operations and then there 
20 
was a Training and Planning Section under the Operations Department.  
We had a Finance Section.  The Finance Section contained the 
Procurement Section which was the sourcing of the service providers, 
Asset Management which assisted with disposal through moveable 
assets Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 164 of 228 
 
Then we have the Fuelling Section underneath.  The Treasury 
- the Treasury Section was for foreign payments for the cash flow 
section.  Then IT and the Internal Auditors.  That fell all under the 
Finance Department.  We had a commercial – Commercial Department, 
Legal, Technical.  If I can go into detail on the Technical Section. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The Technical had a Heavy Maintenance and a 
Line Maintenance Section.  Heavy Maintenance refers to your major 
maintenance on your aircraft which is like A Checks or C Checks and I 
can explain that if - if you would like to Chair – and then there is the 
10 
Line Maintenance Section was the day to day to maintenance on the 
aircraft, night services planning and the stores. 
We had a Human Capital Department.  We have a quality 
control and safety department which ensures the audits and compliance 
to the regulatory bodies.  Then we also have a Security Department 
where all security incidence were reported to.  We have the CEO 
Office, the Boards and then the Shareholders. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So just to summarise 
then there are essentially eight user departments.  One of which is the 
Operations Department and is that – sorry – is that the user department 
20 
in which you work? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is that the user department to 
which Dave Allenby is the General Manager? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 165 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You also made mention that there are 
certain divisions within operations such being Cabin Services, Airport 
Operations, Flight Operations, Operations Control Centre and Ramp.  
How does your role as Airport’s Coordinator integrate or deal with the 
divisions as just mentioned each of which I understand is led by a 
Divisional Manager? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  My role is more of a supporting and an 
administrative role to the Divisional Managers of the sectors and then I 
report directly to the General Manager Chair.  So I supported these 
sections.  I did administration work for the sections and then 
10 
specifically focused on the stations coordinating the stations.  There 
are several services that go with the stations.  If you would like me to 
explain that Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We will – I think let us – let us … 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Deal with it.  Is that all that you wish 
to state on that point? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes because if we go into detail of exactly what 
all my roles are then we can. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And on your cue we will do exactly 
20 
that.  So paragraph 4 on page 1 of your – of the bundle … 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Deals with your functions as Airport’s 
Coordinator.  Can you give a high level overview of what exactly your 
role and responsibilities were in the position of Airport’s Coordinator 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 166 of 228 
 
particularly during the year of 2017 and even 2018 for that matter? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Alright.  (Clearing throat) - excuse me.  I had 
several different roles being an Airport’s Coordinator which one of them 
was a – a financial type of role where I verified invoices according to 
gazetted rates, according to contracts.  Once I verify it goes to the 
General Manager for authorisation.  Then it goes for payment.  I also 
review budgets with the Divisional Manager of Airports, monitoring the 
– the expenses at the stations, implement cost saving initiatives to see 
where we can cut costs. 
Also work a lot with the payments with the service provider 
10 
ensuring that certain service providers are paid Chair.  On a 
procurement level I was a lot involved in drawing up documentation like 
the RFQs which was the Request for Quotations, the Request for 
Proposals which led to a tender process, deviations.  (Clearing throat) - 
excuse me. 
As a function I drew up these documents.  However it – it 
went to either the Divisional Manager of the Sector or the General 
Manager to sign off before submission to procurement.  Also assisting 
stations with their requirement procurement wise – do they need 
stationery, do they need equipment?  (Clearing throat) - excuse me.  
20 
Contracts 
wise 
I 
normally 
work 
with 
Procurement 
to 
finalise 
agreements. 
I review agreements with the Divisional Manager of that 
section to see if the contract contains what our requirements are.  Also 
assist Divisional Managers with the SLAs that are implemented with the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 167 of 228 
 
service providers to ensure that the service providers do exactly what 
is in the contract.  On a compliance side I assisted stations with having 
updated manuals especially for audit purposes for (IOSA) IATA audits. 
I also distribute documents that compliance is required for 
and also updating of manuals for auditing purposes.  This is not flight 
auditing purposes.  On the distribution side I assisted with giving 
stations or giving stations what they need, sending stations what they 
need like baggage tags and boarding passes, ramp – assisting with 
ramp equipment, reflective jackets all for daily operations what people 
needed and then reporting wise I also did monthly reports for the 
10 
General Manager or Divisional Manager what they required Chair and at 
a stage I was also involved in setting up stations. 
Certain divisions of the airline is required to sit down and see 
exactly what is required for a new station and every department had its 
role in setting up the stations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So generally if – if I 
understand your testimony correct you had a full view of exactly what 
was happening at any particular station and just for the record would – 
what exactly is a station? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  A station is a destination that we fly to.  So 
20 
Bloemfontein, Kimberley that is a station – George. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so that would specifically then 
be the airport within that particular …? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct ja. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 168 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Location. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Airport. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But certainly within the role that you 
had you were in a position to have a full appreciation for the overall 
function and operations of a particular station? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For purposes of the evidence today it 
is important to look at – at least two aspects of your role in greater 
10 
detail.  You made mention of the fact that you are involved in 
procurement at stations.  Is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so can I then ask you to turn to 
page 58 which is under Tab seven?  Do you recognise this document 
Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please identify it? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It is the Supply Chain Management Policy of SA 
Express. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is to be noted that on page 58 
the effective date of this policy is 1 April 2017 with the review date of 
31 March 2018.  Is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it true that this is actually the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 169 of 228 
 
policy that regulated or ought to have regulated procurement during 
this period under scrutiny of your evidence in 2017? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then ask you to turn to page 
62 please?  Chair at - at the preamble on paragraph 1 it sets the tone 
to – to record: 
“This policy establishes an integrated Supply Chain 
Management 
Framework 
within 
which 
the 
acquisition 
of 
goods, 
services 
and 
works 
is 
performed within SA Express.” 
10 
The scope is set out on page 63 which is the next page at 
paragraph 4 and the policy scope is identified as that: 
“It 
shall 
apply 
to 
supply 
chain 
management 
activities within SA Express covering all business 
units of the company.  It is further applicable to all 
procurement 
transactions 
irrespective 
of 
their 
nature or value.” 
On page 64 the responsibility and accountability of the Chief 
Executive Officer is set out in 5.2 which identifies that: 
“He is or she is responsible and accountable for the 
20 
procurement of goods and services for the company 
entering 
into 
contracts, 
strategic 
partnerships, 
arranges the hiring or letting of anything.  The 
acquisition or granting of any right for on behalf of 
SA Express and disposes of moveable SA Express 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 170 of 228 
 
property.” 
Ms Loock if I can now ask you to then turn to page 65 which 
talks particularly to Supply Chain Management Unit at paragraph 5.4.  
In which user department did Supply Chain – did the Supply Chain 
Management Unit sit? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  In the Procurement Section under Finance 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what were the Human Resources 
or the capacity requirements of the Procurement Division during 
2016/2017? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The Procurement Section was not fully manned 
– if I can make that statement Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And why was that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It – changeover of staff, limited staff members. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and how did that impact on the 
procurement of goods and services within SA Express at the time? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Obviously it has led to things not been done or 
things not been finalised – if I can state that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so did that outcome impact on 
your role at all? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes it did ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  In 2017 I had to get more involved in sorting 
out agreements with service providers.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you.  We may proceed. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 171 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  So the lack of 
resources in the Procurement Department impacted on your role? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I became more involved in producing 
documentation that went to procurement to try and source service 
providers Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If you look at page 65 of the 
bundle you will note that under one of the bullet points of the sub 
heading.  It lists that: 
“These 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
unit 
then 
encompasses …” 
10 
On the fifth bullet: 
“…the Chief Procurement Officer is responsible for 
insuring that SA Express’ supply …” 
Forgive me Chair.  I have just noted that that sentence appears to be 
incomplete but having said that: 
“The Chief Procurement Officer …” 
In four bullets down: 
“…may from time to time establish an ad hoc cross 
…” 
Which again appears to be an incomplete sentence.  Nonetheless the 
20 
Chief Procurement Officer was certainly an integral stakeholder in the 
procurement of goods and services at SA Express.  Is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 69 
please and if you look at paragraph 10 which regulates acquisition 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 172 of 228 
 
management 10.1 in particular which talks to the methods of acquisition 
and threshold values for procurement of goods and services.  The table 
below that identifies procurement mechanisms.  The first column on the 
left hand side identifies the mechanism. 
The middle column identifies threshold and the last column 
identifies delegated authority.  Do you see that Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to please list then or 
rather read into the record that which has – which applies or rather if I 
can ask you to read the third line which begins with: 
10 
“RFP/RFI …” 
Into the record and what exactly that would mean in context of 
procurement. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The RFP Chair stands for Request for Proposal.  
So that would have been a tender process that if it is an amount higher 
than 500 000 we have to go out on a tender process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  
Okay and 
who would 
be 
the 
delegated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  Please continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Who would be the 
20 
delegated authority for an RFP/RFI according to the table? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  According to the table it would be the BAC, the 
CE and the Board. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And for the record what does BAC 
stand for? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 173 of 228 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Bid Adjudication Committee. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And CE? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Chief Executive, yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you then look three lines down 
which starts with deviations can you please do the same in respect of 
deviations for the record please? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The delegated authority would be the General 
Manager, the CE, the BAC and the Board. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it correct that or rather what is 
the threshold in relation to deviations for such delegated authority? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That would be above 500 000. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Can I now ask you to 
turn to page 79 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  That emergency procedure 500 is that 
correct?  Emergency procedures 500 – that seems … 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Sir I would believe that would be a typing error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That would be a typing error.  I believe it is 500 
and more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It should be 500 000. 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Apologies – the page number? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 7-9 – 79.  Paragraph 17 deals 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 174 of 228 
 
with the Regulation of Emergency Bids and Deviations.  For the record 
can I ask you to read the first three paragraphs of the section because 
it is quite key to your evidence which continues on page 80? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   
“Emergency Bids and Deviations:  it may become necessary 
during the normal course of business to procure goods or 
services in an emergency situation.  The normal bidding 
processes or procurement process may not be appropriate for 
such an eventuality.  Motivations to deviate from the normal 
supply chain management procedures shall be presented to 
10 
the SA Express Bid Adjudication Committee for consideration 
or submitted for approval to the Chief Executive Officer.  Such 
purchases shall be within threshold prescribed in terms of the 
delegation of authority as well as within the …” 
“...a detailed and sound motivation must be provided when 
submitting requests for deviations.  Under no circumstances 
will the application be supported where it is evident that 
alternative action is proposed with the purpose with the 
purpose of circumventing the S A Express procurement 
processes and that the urgency is due to negligence or bad 
20 
planning.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And you will see then 
that the table below identifies on the one hand cases of emergency and 
alongside it requirement to satisfy support, which is preceded by a 
sentence which reads the criteria reflected in the table below may be 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 175 of 228 
 
used by the S A Express bid adjudication committee during the 
assessment process.   
 
 
For the record can I ask you to identify what is written under 
cases of emergency please? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:     
“Actions where emergency is pleaded.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And alongside where it identifies the 
requirement to satisfy support? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   It reads: 
“Proof that action was in the circumstances of an emergency 
10 
was in the best interest of S A Express.  S A Express did not 
suffer negligence or damages and desirable outcomes or 
objectives will be achieved. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you, and just lastly the S A – 
sorry, paragraph 28, on the same page talks specifically to aircraft on 
ground emergency procurement procedures but it’s within a threshold 
or within a range, a monetary range of what appears to be 500 to 
R1.5million, is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly on page 81 I just wish 
20 
to highlight to you Chair that there are certain provisions as well which 
regulates unsolicited bids at paragraph 31 and at paragraph 32 it talks 
to the sole supplier or single source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I’m still just at that figure, that R500 499,999 do 
you think it’s another type that 500? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 176 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I’m not at liberty to say Chair but 
could be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also if you, I mean the 499 is it – do you read it 
as four million, what is it, is it four hundred and ninety nine thousand 
nine hundred and ninety nine rand. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   That’s how I read it Chair, R499 999. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is that how you read it also Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But isn’t the difficulty with reading it that way, that it 
seems to start from a higher amount to a low amount, number one, 
10 
number two, it makes a difference of what – one Rand. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to if you read it as 500 then it makes 
some sense up to a certain point, but it wouldn’t make much sense if 
you read it as R500 000 to R499 999? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if may ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have some understanding of it Ms September? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I must admit I was a big boggled 
when I saw the 500. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   I was a bit boggled when I too first saw the 
500 but if you look at the two sub-paragraphs there the first paragraphs 
talks to a threshold of 500 to 499 999, the second sub-paragraph has 
another threshold which is from 500 000 to R1.5million. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 177 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That one makes sense. The first one is troublesome. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there was also a reference earlier on to R500 
which I drew Ms Loock’s attention to earlier and she thought it must be 
a mistake, but maybe – it might not be so important for our purposes, 
so you will know better in advance if it will – if it is really of any 
significance for our purposes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact I’m happy to identify that 
whilst reference is made within some correspondence to aircraft on 
ground which is abbreviated to AOG certainly the thresholds do not 
10 
apply and it’s for that purpose that I’ve really just identified this 
particular paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then lastly on page 83 paragraph 
38 talks specifically to contracting and reads in the first sentence: 
“That all contracts within S A Express shall be governed by the 
provisions of the contract management policy.” 
And that is then the – some of the important aspects of the supply  
chain management policy that applied or to have applied during 2017, 
is that right? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to go back to 
page 2 of your affidavit, and in particular paragraph 4.4 mention is 
made in this particular sub-paragraph of ground handling services at 
different stations, is it correct that your role as airports coordinator was 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 178 of 228 
 
it limited to ground handling services or did it extend beyond that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   The services extended beyond ground handling 
ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So it is understood that there is an 
important distinction between airports that are owned by ACSA and 
airports that are not owned by ACSA, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Looking at the listing of stations, or 
airports as I would commonly know them to be can I ask you to identify 
in the list which stations or airports are in fact ACSA airports please? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   Johannesburg, Durban, East London, Port 
Elizabeth, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Kimberley and George. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And why is the distinction between 
ACSA airports and non-ACSA owned airports so important, for purposes 
of your evidence today, sorry. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   In the context of my affidavit it relates to the 
SAA Fuel Contract which links to the ACSA airports. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay so if I understand you correctly 
are you then, is it your evidence that the SAA, S A Express Jet A1 fuel 
contract only applies to ACSA owned airports? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   According to the quantum ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may have had too many on this, and confused 
her.  You want to find out whether it applied to ACSA airports only? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct, it applies to ACSA owned 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 179 of 228 
 
airports yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So how would jet fuel or 
jet A1 fuel then be supplied at the airports which are not ACSA owned 
or non-ACSA airports? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   You would have to either use the service 
provider that has been contracted by the Airports Company that – with 
a privately owned airport, they would have their own fuelling 
companies, supplying fuel at the station, so you would have to then 
contract with a single sole service provider Chair, that is with 
recommended or told by the Airports Company that you may use Chair.    
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So the distinction then in summary is 
that at ACSA owned airports an airline would contract for the supply of 
jet fuel at those airports or rather S A Express sorry would contract for 
the supply of jet fuel at those airports on the basis of the SAA/SA 
Express Jet Fuel Contract, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then at the airports which are 
not ACSA owned S A Express would need to contract with the fuel 
supply service provider that has been identified and nominated by the 
owner of that airport? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sun City or Pilanesberg station and 
Mafeking station is it correct that those two stations are not ACSA 
owned? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 180 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now your role as airports coordinator 
did it extend to all of these stations at the time? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   At the time of this no, I was prior to that I was 
removed from the set up of the Sun City and the Mafeking stations. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And when were they, approximately 
when were the Pilanesberg or Mafeking, or Sun City station and 
Mafeking set up, do you remember? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   I’m talking under correction, it’s either in 2016. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  According to our investigations it was 
set up during the year of 2015. 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   Oh, correct yes, that is correct ja, Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Having said that you now mentioned 
that you were removed from the setting up of these two particular 
airports, which for record purposes we will refer to as Pilanesberg and 
Mafeking airports, who removed you and why? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   The Divisional Manager at the time removed 
me and if I can explain how it works. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please do. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  And you would have a better understanding of 
it.  Certain sections in the airline have certain responsibilities in setting 
20 
up the station, like I explained earlier, and me under Airport Operations 
we had certain things that we were responsible in setting up and for 
example providing radio services, providing ramp equipment and so on.  
In this instance I was totally not actively involved, I was removed by 
the Divisional Manager as this was a commercial department venture 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 181 of 228 
 
into Sun City and Mafeking. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who was the divisional manager 
at the time. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That was Stompie Tshesane. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And would that have been the 
divisional manager of operations? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Airport operations yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So who exactly according to your 
knowledge was involved in the setting up of the Mafeking and the 
Pilanesberg Airports. 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It would have been the Commercial Section. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did they explain to you why Ms Loock 
you were excluded from the set up of these two stations. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I cannot remember the details Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is Ms Tshesane still working at S 
A Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No she’s not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Why not, or do you know the reasons 
why she’s no longer working there? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I do believe she was suspended but you may 
20 
confirm that with our Human Capital Department. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Were you ever involved in the 
supply ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September did you provide the spelling for that 
surname? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 182 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No I did not but with Ms Loock’s 
assistance it will be much appreciated if she could, if you could just 
place on record the spelling of Ms Stompie Tshesane please. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Right, can I ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is if you know it. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I do.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Stompie which is S-t-o-m-p-i-e and T-s-h-e-s-a-
n-e. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Were you involved in any 
10 
procurement of jet fuel at any of the stations? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Other than which resulted in the situation in my 
affidavit no. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay, and this situation that you 
speak of is this the requirement for jet fuel at Pilanesberg Airport? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please explain to the Chair 
how – when firstly, and how an operational requirement for the supply 
of jet fuel arose at the Pilanesberg Airport, and now we’re on 
paragraph, we’re starting on paragraph 5 of the affidavit which is on 
20 
page 2.   
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The jet A1 fuel problem came in due to the 
service provider at Pilanesberg we found that the fuel was not user 
friendly, if I can place it that way. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What does user friendly mean?   
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119

MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  For example contaminated, so it was not safe to 
use it on our aircraft.  We resulted in doing a fuel audit so I did go to 
our Quality Department and requested that a fuel audit be done on the 
current supplier at Pilanesberg just to ensure that the fuel is safe, the 
report did come back, a report was then discussed with the flight 
operations department as well as the General Manager of Operations, 
Dave Allenby, and confirmed that the fuel cannot be uplifted, which 
means we cannot take fuel in Sun City due to the contamination of the 
fuel. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who was the fuel service provider at 
10 
Pilanesberg at the time? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  RSI Fuel. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So it’s now understood that RSI Fuel 
as a fuel service provider in Pilanesberg was not your solution to 
getting the supply of fuel at Pilanesberg Airport? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  More particularly Ms Loock why did 
you need operationally fuel to be provided to your aircraft in 
Pilanesberg? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  S A Express had a flight from Cape Town to 
20 
Pilanesberg, the distance is too long for that aircraft to turn around and 
go back to Cape Town so the requirement was to uplift fuel in Sun City 
to ensure that that aircraft can fly back to Cape Town. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So the reason for obtaining or rather 
the reason for the need for fuel was to refuel on the route from Cape 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 184 of 228 
 
Town to Pilanesberg. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What then happened when you learnt 
of the difficulty in relation to RSI Fuel which was the fuel service 
provider at the time at Pilanesberg? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The difficult was that we could not use that 
supplier at the station, the flight was too long, fuel was needed in Sun 
City so there must be an alternative to get fuel to Sun City and that 
was the main reason, I was then instructed by my General Manager, if 
we move on with the affidavit. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes please, we are.  So your General 
Manager being Mr Dave Allenby? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So he instructed you to explore? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As solution. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  What happened there was that he indicated to 
me and because of the requirement especially from the flight operation 
side the necessity of getting fuel in Sun City was quite urgent and 
important.  The general manager instructed me to contact technical and 
20 
in this context I am going to refer to the Technical Department was 
busy with a company called EML reviewing the process with them for 
the defueling and the refuelling of an aircraft. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just for clarity for those of us who 
may need clarity in the aviation terminology context, what exactly is 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 185 of 228 
 
defueling and refuelling for purposes of the requirements of S A 
Express Technical? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The defueling of an aircraft is when you remove 
all the fuel from the fuel tank of the aircraft, that will be applicable 
when you have heavy maintenance on an aircraft, so when an aircraft is 
pulled into a hanger and we call it a C-check which I explained earlier 
is a major service on the aircraft.  It is needed to remove the fuel from 
the tanks to ensure that the fuel tank can be investigated for any 
damage or to ensure that the fuel tank is still fine.  The refuelling is 
obviously placing fuel back into that aircraft so that it can be 
10 
operational. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
so 
just 
for 
a 
better 
understanding when someone is contracted to do refuelling, sorry, 
defueling and then refuelling would it ordinarily include the supply of 
Jet A1 fuel?  Do you know? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I don’t. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If somebody is contracted to refuel or rather to defuel 
the proper person may also refuel. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Most likely that is what would 
happen, the same entity would ...(intervention)  
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I would believe the same entity would provide 
the fuel yes, it would make the job easier, that’s correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  That kind of entity that would do that 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 186 of 228 
 
would be the entity that normally provides what I assume would be 
simply called fuelling, so I guess when an aircraft has landed and it 
doesn’t have enough fuel to go back but there is some fuel and fuel is 
put into it that’s fuelling. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That’s fuelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to defueling and refuelling the refuelling 
is when fuel has been taken out and then you take it back, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Defueling is removing all the fuel, refuelling is 
putting fuel into the aircraft, it’s fuelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that’s what I’m saying, you defuel when you take 
10 
it out, but when you take it back you are refuelling. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you just put it in without taking out anything 
you are fuelling. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and that can be done by the same person, the 
same entity?   
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes the fuel supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of it all three, fuelling, defueling, refuelling can all 
be done by the same business, in other words a business that does 
20 
fuelling can also do defueling and refuelling, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Loock before 
we close off the fuelling and defueling concept what is a bowser? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 187 of 228 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   My understanding a bowser is a (indistinct) 
that goes from the fuelling truck to the aircraft to enable fuel to be 
pumped from a vehicle through to the aircraft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just like in a garage. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you were explaining Ms Loock 
that you were asked by Mr Allenby to look into the requirement of the 
supply of fuel at Pilanesberg Airport and that you were directed to 
technical.  Who in S A Express Technical did you approach? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I was referred to Peter Corver in Technical as 
10 
they were already in communication with EML for the defueling and 
refuelling of aircraft at O R Tambo International Airport. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did it concern any particular aircraft 
that you were aware of? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  As far as I’m aware it consisted of November 
Mike Echo and November Mike November, but I stand to be corrected. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So November, can we just do this 
again, November Mike November and November? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Mike Echo, that is aviation lingo, alphabet 
actually where ...(intervention)  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please clarify? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Ja, November, Mike, Echo is a registration of 
an aircraft Chair, ja. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
so 
those 
are 
unique 
identification registrations on each aircraft? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 188 of 228 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so you’re referring to two 
particular aircraft that S A Express Technical was looking into in 
relation to the defueling and refuelling of. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Is it correct that this all 
took place around May of 2017? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you approached Mr Corver and 
you provides you a business card for EML, what do you then do with 
10 
this particular information? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  As instructed by my general manager the 
instruction was clear just to find out whether EML can provide a fuel 
truck to travel to Sun City to fuel our aircraft according to the schedule 
of Sun City, which was twice a week, that’s four flights, two on Monday 
and two on Friday Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the solution then if I understand 
your correctly was to transport Jet A1 fuel from Johannesburg to 
Pilanesberg in order to meet the operational requirement for the flight 
route from Cape Town to Pilanesberg? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 16 
please, 16.  In fact if we could start on page 17, oops sorry, page 18, 
sorry about that.  In fact it begins on the preceding page which is – it is 
listed as an email that is sent from yourself on Tuesday the 16 t h of May 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 189 of 228 
 
2017 at 10:59 am, to a certain Eric Motlake and the subject is jet fuel 
to Sun City Airport.  Who is Eric Motlake? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I believe Eric Motlake is the CEO of EML, CEO 
meaning owner of EML. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you, and if I can ask you to 
read then your email on page 18 into the record, which is addressed to 
him. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   
“Good day Eric, 
I received your details from Peter Corver from our Technical 
10 
Department.  S A Express would like to find out whether your 
company can transport jet fuel to Sun City as per our flight 
schedule and what the cost would be.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You can continue to inform of the 
flight, what’s written below that. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Alright; 
“Flight schedule OR Tambo Airport to Sun City Monday and 
Friday and Cape Town to Sun City Monday and Friday. 
Regards Estelle” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now this email was sent off the back 
20 
of an instruction that you received from your general manager, Mr Dave 
Allenby, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What exactly was the instruction in 
the context of what you were asking a quotation to be provided on? 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 190 of 228 
 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  In this context it’s obviously to obtain a truck 
that can transport jet A1 fuel to Sun City Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if it’s understood then, if I’m 
understanding your evidence correctly it was a turnkey solution if we 
could call it that, in that it was not just the transportation of fuel but it 
may have even included the supply of fuel, is that right or am I 
misunderstanding? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then turn to page 17, the 
previous page, the senders details is actually on page 16 and its from 
10 
Eric/EML Energy Pty Ltd and it’s sent Tuesday May 15 2017 at 11:06 
am and it’s Tshenolo and you have been copied in on it together with 
Thilly Basaya, if I’m pronouncing that correctly, spelt Thilly second 
word Basaya.  The subject fuel – subject being RE jet fuel to Sun City 
Airport.  Who is Tshenolo? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I have never met Tshenolo Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But is it correct that this is in fact an 
email which requests you to receive a response quite urgently on – on 
request for a quotation? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct.  So I believed that Tshenolo 
20 
then worked for EML or was part of EML. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Your name is however highlighted 
there as a particular statement for your attention? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please read that part into the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 191 of 228 
 
record? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It states: 
“Best Tshenolo please revert to Estelle as a matter 
of urgency.  Estelle please advise on the quantities 
that you would require per day and or per week.  
Best Regards EML Motlake.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And just below that signature Mr 
Mothlake is identified as the Managing Director of EML? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Apologies yes Managing Director ja Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you then turn to page 16.  There 
10 
appears an email of response from yourself and it is sent on the 9 June 
2017 at 10:32 to Eric of EML Energy PTY LTD and Mr Dave Allenby is 
CC’d on the email.  The subject is titled Re: Jet Fuel of Sun City 
Airport.  Please read this email into the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know Ms September why these emails are in 
reverse order?  You start with ones in May here and then you go – or 
do I misunderstand something?  Ja the ones in May are after the one in 
June? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  My understanding is that it is an 
email trail.  So instead of the individual emails having been printed it 
20 
is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but an email trail is – an email is – in an email 
trail  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The email that you should read first you should 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 192 of 228 
 
receive first is one that is in May and not one that is in June.  The one 
that is in June should come after the one in May.  Here at page 17 do 
you not have a May 2017, email and at page 16 you have a June 2017 
email? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja do you know why that is so? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  My understanding is that the June 
email is in response to the May email which is in response to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but that means the email – May email should 
come first.  If the June email is – if the June – if the June email is in 
10 
response to a May email we should come across the May email first, is 
it not?  And then because the person who sent the May email would 
have sent it in May and then the person who responded to it would have 
responded to it in June. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I fully agree with you.  In this 
instance though it appears that instead of them printing the individual 
emails they printed a string of emails which consequently … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which must have been mixed because I – there can 
be a string but you can separate them so that when one reads one… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Gets the picture as it evolved over a month or over 
weeks you do not read – you do not read a June email first and then 
come to a May email.  You first read the May email then you come to 
the June email. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 193 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I am talking about. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess – you understand what I am talking 
about? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes you know I certainly hear you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That the order is almost… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have expected… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In reverse. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes one would have expected that the… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is in reverse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the May emails would have come before in the 
sequence of documents. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the June emails come after.  So as – so that 
as you read and you go through the annexures you can follow how the 
events and the correspondence evolved in actual in reality. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I will be pleased to get instructions 
from the investigators as to why it was printed off in this fashion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that somebody just did not … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As opposed to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might not have paid attention but otherwise one can 
easily get confused.  Alright let us continue.  If you do find a sound 
explanation you would let me know if not if there is a chance of 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 194 of 228 
 
arranging them in terms of dates that accord with what would have 
happened in reality.  As I say if I sent you an email today and you 
respond tomorrow in the file I should not come across tomorrow’s email 
response before I come across the one to which you respond to. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I have been informed that as I 
have already alluded those that it is an email trail with the most recent 
email being on top and so const… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That does not explain anything. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The most recent email then on page 
16 is sent from yourself to Eric of EML Energy PTY LTD on which Mr 
Dave Allenby is copied and the subject title is Jet Fuel to Sun City 
Airport.  Can you please read your email into the record? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The email states: 
“Good day Eric, trust you are well.  As per our 
telephonic discussion this morning kindly note that 
SA Express will be looking at around 8500 litres of 
jet A1 fuel per week for Sun City.  The current 
schedule is still running at two flights on Monday and 
20 
two flights on Friday.  Kindly provide us with a 
quotation that includes the delivery of the fuel to Sun 
City.  Kind Regards, Estelle.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so in light of your earlier 
evidence Ms Loock your response which was in line with the request for 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 195 of 228 
 
quotation that you sent Mr Eric Motlhake is to dovetail with any 
engagements that SA Express Technical was having with EML? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you know whether or not SA 
Express Technical was engaged in a procurement process with EML at 
the time? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I was under the  understanding from my 
instruction from my general manager that Technical was already in 
discussions with EML at the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you do any independent 
10 
investigations on your side to establish whether there was in fact a 
procurement process in play between SA Express Technical and EML? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I can just recall a conversation with Mr Peter 
Corver stating that they were already discussing things with EML but no 
I did not check up on whether they were busy with the procurement 
process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to the next 
annexure to our affidavit and that is on page 21 of the bundle.  This is 
20 
an email from Mr Dave Allanby sent Friday May 18, 2017 at 4:43 pm 
and it is sent to Samuel VIlakazi copied on this email is Maureen 
Jacobs and Estelle Loock being yourself and the subject is titled “Fuel 
at Sun City and Denel”.  What is the relevance of Denel? 
MS 
ESTELLE 
LOOCK:  
Denel 
is 
where 
the 
technical heavy 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 196 of 228 
 
maintenance took place on our aircraft Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so based on the subject title it 
really deals with two primary requirements.  One being Sun City or 
rather fuel at Sun City and the other being Denel Technical, is that 
right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just for the record this particular 
email is one which is sent from Mr Allanby to Mr Vilakazi which informs 
them about the alternate fuel supply for Pilanesberg that have been 
“unearthed” is that right? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it also correct that Eric 
Motlhake is identified as the CEO of EML Energy in this email? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then below contact number can 
you please read the last two sentences into the record please? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Below the contact number? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   
“He says he can send a fuel bowser to Pilanesberg 
20 
for us and can also assist in fuelling our aircraft at 
Denel where he is based.  Please follow through with 
him as fuel at NTY is a major issue necessitating 
that our NTY Cape Town flight has to route through 
Johannesburg for a fuel uplift.” 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 197 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what is NTY? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is the abbreviation for Sun City. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So when reference is made to a fuel 
bowser is it reasonable to assume that it would have included then the 
supply of jet A1 fuel? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I would say so yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so that would then accord with 
your understanding of what the instruction was to obtain a quotation 
from EML? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 10 of your affidavit on 
page 3 talks about economies of scale and in particular on the last 
sentence you talk to Mr Corver informing you about economies of scale. 
Can you please explain to the Chair what exactly is meant in that last 
line of this paragraph? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  When you refer to economies of scale you refer 
to the more you order the better price you get if I can put it in short 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so is that to be understood 
based on the two requirements that were needed such being jet fuel 
20 
and Pilanesberg and the requirements for refuelling and defueling or 
sorry defueling and refuelling at Denel ORTIA? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you request the quotation, you 
are requested to provide quantities that are needed of fuel in 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 198 of 228 
 
Pilanesberg what do you do when you receive this request for 
quantities?  Are you in a position to provide such information? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Quantities I cannot work out.  SA Express at 
the time had a staff member which is Gavin Fourie which also made an 
affidavit which was the fuel specialist that worked out the relevant 
requirements, distance travelled versus fuel to be used Chair.  I would 
approach – I would have approached Gavin to give me the quantities to 
make sure that it is the correct number Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you approach Mr Gavin Fourie to 
do so? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes I did Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair according to the affidavit that 
has been submitted Mr Gavin Fourie has been – he was appointed as 
the Aircraft Performance Engineer employed by SA Express.  How 
would you explain the working relationship between yourself and Mr 
Gavin Fourie? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  We had a very good working relationship Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so how did his role and 
responsibilities 
inform 
or 
collaborate 
with 
your 
role 
and 
responsibilities? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  On certain elements of our works – in our 
working space we assisted one another.  For him I needed assistance 
with – he would normally work out which countries we would fly over to 
another destination which then came back to me verifying invoices for 
certain ATMS’s overflight charges and things like that and I assisted 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 199 of 228 
 
him on the other hand with relevant documentation for procurement if 
he need sourcing regarding planning or requirements relating to his 
work Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were you – were you and Mr Gavin 
Fourie based at the same location? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Me and Gavin shared an office Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you had quite a close working 
relationship? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In support of each other’s functions? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it also correct that after you 
communicated the litre requirements – the quantity requirements of jet 
fuel to Mr Motlhake you had also informed Mr Allanby about it.  Or 
rather was Mr Allanby fully aware of exactly what those quantities 
were? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  As the norm him being my General Manager I 
would copy him in on everything that I have done especially if he has 
instructed me to do something I would copy him in so that he could see 
that I have done it Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is certainly evident from the 
email that you read into the record on the 9 June 2017? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So once you receive the quantities 
needed and you communicate that how long do you remain to be part of 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 200 of 228 
 
the process to solve this operational need? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  After I notified I copy Dave Allanby in I was 
basically totally out of this process completely Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so your knowledge as to what 
happened thereafter is by and large informed by documents that you 
have been provided by the commission’s investigators? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  If I can ask you to turn 
to page 25.  Is it correct that this document is the aviation fuel service 
agreement between South African Airways and South African Express 
10 
Airways PTY LTD? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And this is in fact the 
agreement which regulates the provi – the pro – the supply of fuel to 
SA Express Aircrafts at ACSA owned airports? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And if I can then just ask 
you quickly to turn to page 46 of the bundle.  Is it correct that this 
agreement was concluded on the 31 August 2011? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is this agreement still in place? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It is my understanding that it is Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Once you were – once 
you did what you needed to do in obtaining the literage, passing it onto 
Mr Motlhake who took over the responsibility of dealing with the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 201 of 228 
 
Pilanesberg jet fuel requirement? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It was handed over to Doctor Samuel Vilakazi 
which was the CPO, Chief Procurement Officer of SA Express at the 
time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Based on your knowledge of what 
had transpired up to this point were proper procurement processes 
followed? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Up to the point of where we are now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  In my affidavit.  I believe no because sourcing 
10 
should have been done through a procurement process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was not done? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No that was not done Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  After you then made the request for 
the quotation provided the quantities did you ever see a copy of the 
quotation from EML at any point in time? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I did not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The next part of your affidavit talks 
to different processes that were followed in the context of this 
transaction.  If I can – we are on page 4 and from paragraphs 15 to 17 
20 
you talk about a Whatsapp round robin approval.  Are you aware of 
when a round robin approval is used within SA Express? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It is my understanding that it is when there is 
an emergency situation.  Aircraft on ground for example where a 
service is so urgently required that it cannot take a long process to get 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 202 of 228 
 
the type of service.  That is my understanding of it Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And now can I ask you to 
turn to page 48 which is an exchange of Whatsapp communications 
between members of the bid adjudication committee as you have been 
informed.  Just for the record who is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 48? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This page at 48 is not very clear. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I have asked the investigators to 
provide a clearer copy and unfortunately we do not have one yet but as 
10 
soon as one becomes available it will be made available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the legal team must always try in advance of the 
hearing to check all copies that are not clear and try and obtain clearer 
copies so that once the hearing – the witness starts we do not have to 
be looking for clearer copies. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair I had hoped to 
receive a clearer copy or even a bigger copy by now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But unfortunately… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There was nothing forthcoming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I note that it is I am not sure if 
my watch is right but it is nearly quarter past four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 203 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Or it is just after… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much more time do we still need to… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I will need some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go in terms of your estimation? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I will certainly need some time.  
Probably an hour and a half? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Probably an hour and a half or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well try and just focus on the important things.  We 
can go up to five let us see whether we cannot finish by five.  If we 
10 
have not finished by then we can reassess.  Ms Loock is that fine with 
you if we continue beyond four o’clock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes that is fine with me thank you Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine?  Okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I will certainly do my best. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Within that timeframe.  Ms Loock are 
you aware of this round robin resolution at all? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I am not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you become aware of it at some 
20 
later stage if reference is made to paragraph 15 of your affidavit? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct that is according to an email 
that I read ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which was when? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  On the 18 October 2017. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 204 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was certainly long after the 
approval was granted on the 1 July 2017? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair having studied this in a – as 
best as possible may I proceed to just read the relevant sections of this 
Whatsapp record into the – into the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said 48? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 48 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you can read if you are able to who says what to 
whom. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair the first communication is by 
Mr Sam Vilakazi and that is on the 1 July 2017 at 11.22 which reads 
BAC members please check your emails and assist with round robin 
approval needed urgently in respect of or iro NME.  Ms Loock NME is 
that the registration identification code of one of your aircraft? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct that is November Mike Echo it is 
a CRJ 200 aircraft. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  At the time how many 
aircraft were there as part of the SA Express fleet? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I speak under correction but at the time it was 
20 
schedule of around fourteen aircraft. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  The next line is by Mr 
Dave Allanby sent on the same date of 1 July 2017 two minutes after 
the previous message at 11.24 which reads:  It is for both NME and 
NMN defueling requirement.  Two lines down Mr Dave Allanby then 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 205 of 228 
 
gives his approval in a message at 11.27 on the same date which 
informs Sam you have my email confirming approval.  Below that 
reference that line is a line from Merriam Mochoele who is that Ms 
Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Merriam was the GM for Legal Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what role did she play in the bid 
adjudication committee at the time? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  She was the chairperson of the BAC Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  And her… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give the spelling for the surname? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  It is also 
referenced at paragraph 16.3 on page 5 of the affidavit and it is spelt 
slightly different to what is reflected here and Ms Loock you will correct 
me if it is Merriam and the surname is Mochoele? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct the I needs to be replaced by an 
e.  Merriam Mochoele. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mochoele. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Mochoele. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  The message from Ms 
Mochoele at 11.30 on the same date of 1 July 2017 reads:  Hi Sam what 
20 
is EML?  The response to that at the same time and second of 11:30 
from Sam Vilakazi informs:  Fuel supplier based at Denel.  In response 
Ms Mochoele… 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Mochoele ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mochoele apologies informs at 11:32 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 206 of 228 
 
that this is for the supply of fuel where?  Sorry I do not have the 
background facts.  To which Sam Vilakazi responds 1 minute later what 
appears to be one minute later at ORTIA.  On the next page of 49 
according to the investigators this particular message is written by 
Gatele Nkala who is Ms Nkala Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  She was the general manager of Human 
Capital. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this message was sent then at 
11:41 on the same date of 1 July 2017 which reads:  Hi Sam have 
responded to your mail I did not see the submission but again I did not 
10 
attend BAC yesterday so approved in principle so as to avoid AOG.  
What is AOG Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is Aircraft on Ground Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And you – is it correct that the supply 
chain management policy deals specifically with Aircraft on Ground but 
within the thresholds of R500 unless it was a typographical error and 
R1.5 million. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct.  There is reference to that in 
the policy Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If one looks a bit further down on the 
20 
same page of 49 there is an – a response from Mr Mark Shelley.  Spelt 
M-A-R-K, Shelley S-H-E-L-L-E-Y.  Who is Mr Mark Shelly Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  He was the Chief Financial Officer at the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and his message at 11:42 
reads: 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 207 of 228 
 
“Hi, I do not have access to an email.  Please use 
this message as approval.” 
Is it correct that it is to be inferred that he did not – he approved 
without seeing the content of an email which was relative to the – to 
this approval? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Reading it in the contents of the WhatsApp I 
would say yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is responded to in the next line by 
Ms Merriam Mochoele. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Mochoele. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mochoele. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mochoele. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Mochoele yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For getting the surname wrong - 
humble apologies – at 11:42 which says: 
“This was not discussed at BAC yesterday.  Thanks 
for the explanation.  I will approve an email but will 
need to meet to ratify the decision based on a 
submitted memorandum.” 
20 
At 11:48 or what appears to be 11:48 Sam Vilakazi responds and says: 
“Hi Kgatile there was no submission but according 
to Captain Allenby they are able to assist us on the 
heavy maintenance side and Sun City.” 
When reference is made to heavy maintenance side at Sun City what is 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 208 of 228 
 
the – your understanding or inference of the scope of this approval that 
is sought? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I would – according to what is discussed here 
the reference is heavy maintenance side and Sun City.  Meaning it 
would be a requirement for Denel which is the defueling and refuelling 
and also then the fuel Jet A1 Fuel supply to Pilanesberg Sun City. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then if we turn to page 51 at the 
top there is a message from Mr Dave Allenby on the same date of 
1 July 2017 at 11:49 which reads: 
“EML have fuel tankers based at Denel.  We have 
10 
begun engagement with them as a potential solution 
to our fuel supply problems at NTY.” 
Being Sun City - is that right Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is – that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The messages continues to read: 
“Their 
geographical 
locality 
to 
our 
heavy 
maintenance facility at Denel makes them ideal to 
assist with fuelling and defueling on aircraft on that 
side of the airport.  Otherwise we can wait 24 hours 
for a dedicated defuel bowser from apron side.  We 
20 
currently need two aircraft defueled in order to 
carry out work to get them back in the sky.  Hope 
this 
helps 
with 
clarification, 
thank 
you 
BAC 
Members.” 
And in response to that is a message from Mr Victor Xaba 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 209 of 228 
 
which is sent at 11:52 and reads: 
“Approved subject to BAC ratification.” 
According to this communication exchange Ms Loock it 
certainly appears that the Bid Adjudication Committee approved by way 
of a round robin resolution a scope of approval which included the fuel 
requirement at Pilanesberg Airport and the requirement for defueling 
and refuelling at – by SA Express Technical based at Denel at ORTIA.  
Is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct according to the WhatsApp 
round robin.  I can see that it is for the Denel side and also for the 
10 
Pilanesberg side. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Does it extend to any other airports? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No.  We did not have a requirement for other 
airports Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So it is only two locations? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct yes.  That is my understanding 
as well.  It was only for the two sections Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Now if we can turn to 
page 6 of your affidavit.  You now address from paragraph 18 to 
paragraph 24 a motivation for deviation from the bid process.  Do you 
20 
have any personal knowledge of the motivation to deviate Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The deviation done in respect of – of this 
process was not done by myself.  It was done by my General Manager – 
Dave Allenby - Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is that the ordinary process that 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 210 of 228 
 
ought to have been followed? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  What normally happened was that I drew up a 
document – a deviation document and submit it for signatures.  In this 
instance my General Manager drew up the deviation himself Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how did you find out about this 
deviation Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I normally had meetings with my General 
Managers to verify and authorise expenses – invoices – and on one 
occasion he did mention that there is a deviation and I did see it in his 
office Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you then to turn to page 53 
please?  Is this in fact the memorandum which motivates the deviation 
from bid process in relation to services to be contracted with EML? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This memorandum is – for the record 
– dated 5 July 2017 and the purpose of the memorandum is outlined in 
paragraph 1 which reads one point – rather: 
“The purpose of this memorandum is 1.1:  to 
request approval to contract with EML Engineers 
and Construction trading as EML Energy for the 
20 
supply of fuel at Pilanesberg Airport and periodic 
fuelling and defueling as the SA Express Heavy 
Maintenance 
Facility 
at 
Denel 
OR 
Tambo 
International Airport.” 
And 1.2: 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 211 of 228 
 
“To request approval to deviate from the normal bid 
planning activities relating to the review and 
approval of EML …” 
And it goes further in – insofar as the processes are concerned.  Is it 
correct that there are two backgrounds which are outlined in this 
memorandum Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the first background talks 
specifically to the fuel supply requirement at Pilanesberg Airport 
outlined from paragraphs 2.1 to 2.9.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In particular at paragraph 2.9 on 
page 54.  It reads that: 
“EML Energy have submitted a proposal in which 
they would supply fuel to the SAX Aircraft at NTY 
via mobile fuel bowser.” 
So if there was any query about whether or not EML ought to 
have provided fuel was that – was that doubt resolved in this 
paragraph? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes because the paragraph refers to already a 
20 
proposal Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and so the scenario two 
which is outlined from paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 deals with the technical 
requirement of defueling and refuelling? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 212 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 4 which talks to financial 
implications says: 
“Ad hoc as per negotiated contract.” 
What was your observations on that being a motivation in relation to 
financial implications? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  If – if a deviation would have been done for 
example by myself I would understand that there should have been a 
better financial summary indicating expenses to be incurred by SA 
Express.  Here it just states ad hoc as per negotiated contract which I 
feel is not sufficient for this process … 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you have …? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you have a contract before an 
approval? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  My understanding is that when you implement a 
deviation the deviation must be fully authorised and goes – it goes 
through a process.  Once it is fully authorised then only can the Legal 
Department actually start negotiating an agreement Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then on page 55 paragraph 5 
which talks to the rationale for deviation from bid process.  Once again 
20 
in paragraph 3 limited to two airports.  It is paragraph 5.3. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  5.3. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 55.  Which two airports are 
those? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  NTY which is Pilanesberg Sun City and JNB 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 213 of 228 
 
which is Johannesburg OR Tambo on the Denel premises – it states 
here … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then paragraph 7 outlines the 
approval that is requested and having studied the document it certainly 
aligns with the purpose of the document.  When one talks – when one 
looks at page 56 is it correct that all those persons who had been 
included in the WhatsApp communication been Dave Allenby, Sam 
Vilakazi, Mark Shelly, Merriam Mochoele and Victor Xaba in fact signed 
10 
in approval of the motivation to deviate? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The only additional person there is 
Mpho Selepe? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But as the DM of Finance recorded 
on this page similarly Mpho Selepe approved this – this memorandum? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If one can then turn to page 8 of your 
– of the bundle.  At paragraph … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Page 56 is that where you were talking 
about approval and the signatures? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Excuse me Chair - apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you at page 56? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 214 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you were talking about approvals? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which – which signatures – where you referring to on 
page 56?  There is one, two, three, four, five, six - the names are given 
on the left hand side.  Is that right? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I see that in regard to Merriam Mochoele there is 
no 
indication 
if 
she 
was 
approving 
or 
declining. 
 
Says 
approved/declined and she did not cross out any.  Same with 
Mark Shelley 
and 
Mpho Selepe’s 
was 
simply 
– 
said 
proposed 
10 
acquisition is budgeted. 
So that is what he or she was signing for I guess.  So the one 
who appears to have approved is Mr Victor Xaba - the CEO.  Was – was 
he the only one was supposed to approve?  Ms Loock was – was 
Mr Xaba the only one who was supposed to approve?  Was his approval 
sufficient - as far as you know? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Sir on a deviation yes but with my experience 
with doing deviations each section has provision to say approved or 
and they normally mark the section if they do approve it or disapprove 
it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  In this instance I – I would believe that the 
Acting CEO would have override it or but I would expect every single 
person to accept or decline yes.  That is the normal process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – do you see what I am talking about 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 215 of 228 
 
Ms September? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  I am indebted to you for 
that clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want us to – to be sure who approved who did 
not approve.  From what I see here it looks like only Mr Xaba approved.  
The other persons namely Ms Merriam Mochoele and Mr Mark Shelley 
were expected to either approve or disapprove or approve or decline 
and although they signed but they did not indicate whether they were 
approving or disapproving. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Certainly that appears on the face of 
the document.  All but one being Mpho Selepe were involved in the 
round robin approval who had approved that particular approval at the 
time notwithstanding the fact that I certainly take your point Chair that 
it is unclear from here other than Victor Xaba who expressed he 
approves it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It may well be that – may well be that if they 
approved by way of the round robin that is – that might be good enough 
but it is just important to make sure that we do not say the document 
20 
shows that they approved if it does not show that they approved.  
Definitely Mr Xaba it shows him to have approved. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  I am indebted to you for 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 216 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correction and clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you – it – it maybe – it maybe that it is not 
particular significant.  I just wanted to make sure that we are on the 
same page as to who approved in terms of that document and who did 
not. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I certainly agree that on the face of it 
– it is exactly as you say Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you have any further clarity in 
relation to that Ms Loock outside of what you have already informed the 
10 
Chair about? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  When I look at the deviation like this and the 
signatures are placed on it and especially with these people authorising 
the WhatsApp’s I would believe that they approved it because they 
signed the document irrespective of marking it approved or disapproved 
but that would be my personal opinion on this document Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you would say they approved but not 
because of this document? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Not because of … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of the round robin? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  In relation to the round robin that everyone 
approved and putting down their signatures on the document … 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 217 of 228 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  My personal opinion sir would be that they have 
approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well the document made provision for each one of 
them to indicate whether they approve … 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not approve and they did not make any indication 
except for Mr Xaba. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Xaba crossed out disapproved or declined.  So 
10 
approved remained.  That is clear. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not make that election and therefore it 
becomes unclear where they stood until you read it together with the 
round robin if you want to read it with that.  Okay, alright.  Let us take 
a short break for 10 minutes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will resumes at 20 to five.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s see how far we are able to go. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Page 8 Ms Loock 
of the bundle addresses two letters, the first letter is an appointment 
letter to EML Energy and the second letter is a “to whom it may 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 218 of 228 
 
concern” letter.  If you can quickly first deal with the appointment letter 
to EML Energy, do you have, is it correct that this letter was given to 
you by the Commission’s investigators? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct (microphone off). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that the second letter 
was similarly given to you by the Commission’s investigators? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so do you have any personal 
knowledge of these letters? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No I don’t Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can ask you to turn to page 93 
please.  Chair for the record this letter is a letter on an S A Express 
letterhead, it is sent by Mr Samuel Vilikazi, the Chief Procurement 
Officer, dated 5 July 2017 and it’s titled “Award for supply of fuel to S A 
Express”.  It is for the address of EML Energy based in Kempton Park 
and it’s address specifically to Eric.  It reads: 
“This letter serves as a formal confirmation that EML Energy 
has been appointed for the above service.  This award is 
subject to the following condition: 
1. Successful negotiation and conclusion of a contract 
20 
between S A Express and EML Energy; 
And then a little bit further down it reads that: 
“This letter of award is effective from 1 July 2017.  We trust 
that this award shall be beneficial and fruitful to both parties. 
Your sincerely” 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 219 of 228 
 
Ms Loock in your understanding based on what had transpired such 
being that there was the Whatsapp Round Robin approval on the 1 s t of 
July 2017 and then the deviation on the 1 s t of August 2018 sorry, what’s 
problematic with the issuance of this letter. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  This letter is very broad, and it’s got no 
specification on the Pilanesberg or the fuelling requirements at 
Technical.  It states award for supply of fuel to S A Express, which is 
extremely broad Chair. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
Two 
days 
...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have any understanding of what the 
significance was at a practical level of the statement in the letter that 
the appointment was with effect from 1 July 2017 in circumstances 
where the letter itself was signed on the 5 t h of July 2017?  Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No sir I have no knowledge, this took place 
without my knowledge of it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why the appointment would have to be backdated? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I would understand so yes sir Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, what I’m asking is whether you have any 
understanding of why it was necessary to do that, to backdate it as 
20 
such seeing that it was saying that the appointment was subject to the 
conclusion of a contract, I take it that until the contract was concluded 
there was nothing at a practical level that the entity was going to be 
obliged to do  
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  So then they would obviously ensure that the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 220 of 228 
 
services that was taking place already then runs from the 1 s t of July 
that is line with then the contract that they signed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No what I’m saying is, is my understanding correct 
that the mere fact that this entity who would receive this letter would 
not mean that they should begin to provide any service until the 
contract has been conclude. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore to the extent that this letter said their 
appointment, or if appointed the appointment of this entity was with 
effect from 1 July 2017 and was subject to the conclusion of a contract 
10 
really at a practical level didn’t mean anything, there was nothing they 
were supposed to do or there was no obligation for them to perform any 
service until the conclusion of the contract. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I would agree to that yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so therefore as far as you are concerned the 
appointment may have been with effect from the date of the letter? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I take that the appointment itself doesn’t 
mean anything other than that, that is the appointment before the 
conclusion of the contract, the appointment without the contract means 
20 
nothing more than that as a bidder or as an entity you then know that 
you must enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a contract 
with S A Express, you must avail yourself for meetings for that purpose 
and the signing of the contract once agreement has been reached and t 
that you must kind of prepare yourself for performing in terms of the 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 221 of 228 
 
contract in case it is successfully concluded, is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so you must ready yourself so that when the 
contract has been signed and goes into operation you are ready to 
perform, but other than that really that you have been appointed 
doesn’t mean anything else.  Okay. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  This letter is dated 
the 5 t h of July 2017, can I ask you to turn to back to page 56 please.  
This is the signature page of the motivation for deviation, on what date 
10 
does Mr Dave Allenby, the General Manager of Operations submit this 
document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 63? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five Six? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Five Six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On what date does Mr Dave Allenby 
sign this document which appears to be the date on which he submits? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The 1 s t of the 7 t h 2017. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that’s the same date of the date 
of the letter of award, signed off by Mr Samuel Vilikazi? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I now ask you to turn to 
Annexure 10 which appears at page 96.  This letter is dated about two 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 222 of 228 
 
days later, on the 7 t h of July 2017, is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this letter for the record reads: 
“To whom it may concern 
This letter serves to confirm that EML Engineers and 
Construction trading as EML Energy with the registration 
number indicated has been appointed by South African Express 
as the fuel supplier for a period of three years.  The fuel 
requirements will initially be confined to the two stations, that 
is OR Tambo International Airport (25million litres) and 
10 
Pilanesberg Airport (8million litres) per annum respectively.  
The volumes will be adjusted and increased over the contract 
period as part of developing EML Energy as the Emerging 
Black 
Owned 
Supplier 
in 
line 
with 
the 
transformation 
imperatives outlining the procurement policy of South African 
Express.  I trust that you will find the above in order. 
Your sincerely  
Dr Sam Vilikazi 
Chief Procurement Officer” 
What are your observations or any concerns that you may have with 
20 
this letter Ms Loock? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If any. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I first observed the period of three years I also 
observe the litres, 25million litres and also 8million litres per annum 
which is a bit exorbitant in my view chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 223 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 28 on page 8 of your 
affidavit you remind of the quantities that were required specifically to 
Pilanesberg Airport.  For the record can you just remind exactly of what 
those litres were per week required and how it translates into a per 
annum requirement. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The requirement, I just want to refer back to my 
paragraph, which was 8 500 litres per week which resulted in a total of 
approximately 442 litres per annum if we use a 52 week Chair.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you had or rather did your 
requirement at all include any airport other than Pilanesberg? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  No it didn’t Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So to summarise your concerns the 
one was the duration of the appointment purported in the letter at page 
96, the other was the number of litres of jet fuel to be provided on a 
weekly basis when even translated into a per annum quantity still far 
exceeded that which is indicated in the letter and the third is that it’s 
not specific to only Pilanesberg Airport, is that right? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
Chair 
just 
for 
the 
record 
...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, what was the last point about not specific? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  It’s not only confined to Pilanesberg Airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It includes OR Tambo? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a concern because the Round Robin resolution 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 224 of 228 
 
did not include OR Tambo Ms Loock? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Apologies Chair, just repeat? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you concerned that the letter also talks about OR 
Tambo and not just Pilanesberg, because the resolution, Round Robin 
resolution, did not include OR Tambo and was confined to Pilanesberg, 
what’s the basis of your concern? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  The specifications should have been Denel, 
because that’s where the heavy maintenance took place, so that would 
be Denel at OR Tambo, it is based at OR Tambo International, but if 
you place OR Tambo International it can mean anywhere at OR Tambo 
10 
International, so a specification like Denel or for heavy maintenance at 
Denel Technical Denel and Pilanesberg Operations would have been in 
my view better. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but is your concern that if you say OR Tambo as 
opposed to saying Denel OR Tambo whatever, if you simply say at OR 
Tambo the same service could be provided by somebody else other 
than the one at Denel OR Tambo or is the position that no there 
wouldn’t be anyone else to provide such a service, only the one at 
Denel would be able to, it’s just that it’s not a proper or accurate 
description? 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  We had an ongoing contract with SAA to supply, 
to assist with the fuel at OR Tambo for our normal operations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is the concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your point is not just a technical one, it’s a 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 225 of 228 
 
substantive one in the space that the letter makes it open for what 
should be obtained from Denel to be obtained from elsewhere? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that’s part of your concern. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The second one is the amount of litres of fuel per 
year. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from what you say at paragraph 8 you say that if 
you bear in mind that the flights would be like two times a week, is that 
10 
correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Two times a week, that would be four flights, 
that would be two on a Monday and two on a Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, four flights, and you say in a year you have got 
52 weeks based on that you say the amount of litres would be 442 000 
litres per year, is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your concern is that the letter from Dr Vilikazi 
says that the amount of litres and in regard to OR Tambo is 25million 
litres per year and in regard to Pilanesberg it says 8million per year, 
20 
that’s your concern? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in so far as Pilanesberg is concerned is the 
position that the correct amount of litres would have been 153 000 – 
no, no 8 500 litres – no that’s per week, what would have been the total 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 226 of 228 
 
per year for Pilanesberg? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  442 000 litres per annum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is inclusive of everything? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That’s per annum for Pilanesberg only Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and for OR Tambo? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I cannot comment on OR Tambo because I do 
not ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t know where that came from. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I don’t know the requirements of technical how 
many litres they actually negotiated yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but for Pilanesberg you say it’s 442 000? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  Yes that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Way below the 8million litres that the letter talks 
about? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Is it then correct 
Ms Loock that up and until this stage the only operational requirements 
that Pilanesberg was one for the supply of fuel and the transportation 
of such fuel from Johannesburg to Pilanesberg twice a week. 
20 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the quantities that were 
required was 8 500 litres per week, which translated to 442 000 litres 
per annum on a 52 week basis? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 227 of 228 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That was the total sum of 
requirement for Pilanesberg Airport. 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct, from an operational point yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then from an operational point 
as well up and until this stage the only operational need at OR Tambo 
International Airport related to defueling and refuelling on an ad hoc 
basis of aircraft through S A Express Technical? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so it did not include the supply 
of fuel generally as was needed in Pilanesberg Airport? 
10 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But now we have letters which talks 
to a different scope of service, is that correct? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
If 
I 
can 
ask you now 
to 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we are at five. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I said we would look at the situation at five o’clock.  I 
understand that if we finish with Ms Loock this afternoon tomorrow we 
20 
might not use the whole day. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the – except if Ms Loock would have some 
difficulty with coming back tomorrow it might – there might not be much 
need for us to go on to much later today if tomorrow we will end up not 
24 JUNE 2019 – DAY 119 
 
Page 228 of 228 
 
being able to use the whole time.  Ms Loock what is your situation 
about the possibility of coming back tomorrow morning and we finish 
your evidence tomorrow before we start with the next witness, how is 
your situation? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  My situation is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would be fine with that? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  I will be fine, I’m also okay with going on, it’s 
not a problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, no that’s fine, it’s just that I wouldn’t want 
to cause any inconvenience to any witness, but I think that if Ms Loock 
10 
hasn’t got any problem as she says then we probably should stop now 
and and ask her to come back tomorrow morning because it’s not like 
tomorrow we are likely to run into any problems in terms of finishing the 
witness.  I take it that you might be left with maybe 30 minutes or 45 
minutes to finish? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair, another 30 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No let’s fine, let’s do that tomorrow.  We will stop at 
this stage Ms Loock and tomorrow we start at ten o’clock, please come 
back tomorrow at ten o’clock.  Is that alright? 
MS ESTELLE LOOCK:  That’s correct, thank you Chair, that’s fine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  We will then adjourn for today and 
tomorrow we start at ten.   
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 25 JUNE 2019
