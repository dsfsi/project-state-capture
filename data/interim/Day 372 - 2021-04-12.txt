PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 12 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I got your message that Mr Singh’s 
counsel indicated that they might be a few minutes late. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I see that it is sixteen minutes past 
ten and they are still not here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are still not here Chairperson.  I 
10 
have phoned the Advocate again and she indicated to me 
that they are running ten to fifteen minutes late because 
they needed to commission an affidavit of Mr Singh so it is 
a further affidavit apparently which they would like to hand 
up this morning and that will take us beyond half past ten 
by the look of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any affidavit they have for this morning 
obviously will not be used this morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it could have been dealt with later.  
20 
So – so it is really – it was not a few minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No it is more than a few minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So the – the further fifteen minutes 
or so was from what time when you called them and they 
said that? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 4 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From just two… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two minutes ago? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just two minutes before the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that will take us beyond half past. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  But she is – she is apologising 
profusely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja that is quite late.  I am going to 
adjourn just a pity that we are losing a whole thirty 
minutes.  I will – I will adjourn again and come back at half 
past. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Than you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that Mr Singh and his counsel are 
still not here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are not Chair but the attorney is 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja 
this 
is 
unacceptable. 
This 
is 
completely unacceptable.  The commission does not have 
time   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are working into the evenings, we 
working weekends to try and make sure we can finish in 
time.  We cannot afford to lose time like this.  I am going 
to adjourn.  I hope that whatever affidavit they prepared – I 
am going to adjourn until half past eleven.  I would like you 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 5 of 240 
 
to get a chance to read whatever affidavit they have 
prepared so that if possible that can be used today as well 
because we – we are losing time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to adjourn and will return at 
half past eleven. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see Counsel for Mr Singh and Mr Singh 
are here now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am sure Counsel for Mr Singh would 
like to say something. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yes good morning Chair person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   First of all we want to apologise 
for being late this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Unfortunately as it go with these 
things we had a few challenges some of them personal 
others just running late so we apologise for not being here 
on time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine you have given me a full 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 6 of 240 
 
explanation in chambers. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Okay alright let us start then 
and let us try and increase the pace. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright please administer the oath or 
affirmation to Mr Singh again. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Anoj Singh. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR SINGH:  I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MR SINGH:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you 
will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
20 
God. 
MR SINGH:  So help me God. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson before Mr Seleka 
start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 7 of 240 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Based on the questions that was 
asked on the last occasion we prepared an affidavit for Mr 
Singh.  We believe that it is in the interest of this 
commission that Mr Singh start with some of those issues. I 
think having regard to where we were on the last occasion it 
would give you an the commission clarity on – on some 
important issues.  So we – we beg leave for Mr Singh to first 
deal with the issues that is in the affidavit before Mr Pule 
continues leading his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka will see how – whether he is – it 
10 
is accords with his plan to do so but of course if there were 
things that needed clarification last time at some stage or 
another they need – the clarification should be given. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Did you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had a chance to look at the 
affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes during the adjournment I did glance 
through the affidavit.  The affidavit itself is fairly short – it is 
eight pages but the annexures are quite voluminous.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You have not had a chance to look at 
20 
the annexures? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not all of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh some of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I looked at one or two of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 8 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I have seen the contents of the 
affidavits.  What I could do for Mr Singh is to – I could ask 
you – some of the questions which I intended asking Mr 
Singh this morning bear on the issues that he seeks to 
address in the affidavit.  So I could follow my line and then 
in 
the 
course 
of 
him 
answering 
he 
could 
refer 
the 
Chairperson to that affidavit to the extent that he wants to 
answer some of the questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I know the Chairperson has not seen 
10 
the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you sent me just the affidavit Whatsapp 
– on Whatsapp and I had a superficial look.  So I think that 
the important thing is whether it is going to be fruitful to ask 
him questions on these matters before you have read the 
annexures. If – if it will be manageable that is fine but I have 
not … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not read the – I have seen some 
parts of the affidavit I have not read it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So of course we can – you could continue 
on the way you had planned and if Mr Singh in responding to 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 9 of 240 
 
those questions uses information that is in the affidavit that 
is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but later on when you have had a 
chance to look at the annexures and everything. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when I have had a chance we might 
revisit the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So I think let us carry on on that 
10 
basis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Singh you understand – so we 
carry on on the basis that I have prepared insofar as you 
need to refer to this new affidavit – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think when – I think when he answers he 
can answer using the information that is in the affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But since we have not had… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Read it there might be difficulties if he is 
20 
going to refer in detail. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To annexures.  So maybe he can use the 
knowledge that he has and say that some of the things are 
dealt with in certain annexures at a later stage when we 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 10 of 240 
 
have all had a chance to read the affidavit and annexures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can go back and then he can 
supplement his answers by referring in detail if he wishes to 
the annexures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Okay you follow that Mr 
Singh.  Chairperson the affidavits of Mr Singh are found – 
well the ones which are already in the bundle are found in 
10 
Eskom Bundle 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got Bundle 16. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 16.  But the bundle Chair 
which I wish us to focus on as we proceed now is Eskom 
Bundle 14(c).  Eskom Bundle 14(c) and from time to time I 
will refer to the relevant passages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want to forget this Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It relates to Eskom but not to Mr Singh.  I 
wanted to look for something in Mr Marokane’s affidavit for 
20 
whether we can – I could only see the supplementary 
affidavit or second not the first.  Apparently when my 
Registrar mentioned the name to you – you… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You could not remember. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 11 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe I did not pronounce it correctly 
when I spoke to her but I thought I had because I 
subsequently checked the spelling and I thought I got it 
right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know which affidavit I am talking 
about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it is – if it is Dan Marokane Chair I 
know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He – I do not know his first name I just 
know the surname. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you can indicate to her where she will 
find that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Singh just by way of 
recapping on this we were mainly dealing with the McKinsey 
matters last time when we adjourned.  We dealt with the 
corporate plan and the – we started with the MSA and on the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 12 of 240 
 
corporate plan it was a debate for the in inverted commas “at 
the heart” who rendered services and we were trying to 
enquire as to who rendered services and in regard to the – 
well we had gone beyond that enquiry about who rendered 
services and on the MSA we were dealing with the 
conclusion thereof. 
 
Now I just want to quickly finish off by reference to 
the affidavits of Dr Weiss and Dr Amankwah on the services 
or the identity of the entities which rendered services in 
respect of the corporate plan and I am going to simply refer 
10 
you to the paragraphs without too much time being taken on 
that. 
 
So that is Eskom Bundle 14 Chairperson.  Mr Singh 
turn – I will start first with – firstly with the affidavit of Dr 
Weiss and I – I will read from paragraph 38 – oh page – 
page 692 – 692 yes. 
MR SINGH:  Black numbers, correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The black numbers as usual.  692. 
MR SINGH:  I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are there.   
20 
MR SINGH:  Paragraph 38? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  So you will see the heading there 
above paragraph 37 is an introduction of Regiments/Trillian 
at Eskom and subsequent dealings with Regiments/Trillian 
and then the sub-heading is introduction of Regiments at 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 13 of 240 
 
Eskom. 
 
Then paragraph 38 says: 
“As discussed above when Mr Molefe and Mr 
Singh transitioned from Transnet to Eskom in 
mid-2015 Regiments worked with McKinsey 
on a two month project that arose out of the 
CEO and CFO on board.  I understand that 
Regiments was an established firm that had 
relevant 
expertise 
on 
the 
financial 
and 
balance sheet aspects of the project and 
10 
thus well equipped to lead the portion of the 
project.  I was aware of the project but had 
limited personal involvement in it and thus 
limited interaction with Regiments at that 
time.” 
 
Then under paragraph 39 you have a heading where 
he says: 
“Mid-2015 work with Regiments at Eskom” 
 
And then paragraph 40 reads: 
“McKinsey presented the model developed 
20 
during the two month project to Mr Singh 
around July/August – or August 2015 and 
was asked to support Eskom in writing its 
Annual Corporate Plan based on the model.  
Though McKinsey had not previously been 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 14 of 240 
 
engaged to provide support to Eskom in 
writing this annual submission I believe the 
model was representative of the expensive 
institutional knowledge we had of Eskom and 
that Mr Singh recognised the importance of 
such existing knowledge during a period of 
great challenges for Eskom when a sound 
corporate plan was urgently needed.” 
 
Then he says in paragraph 41: 
“We wrote a proposal and the letter of 
10 
acceptance 
we 
received 
from 
Eskom 
specified McKinsey was required to engage a 
SD 
and 
L 
partner. 
 
Given 
Regiment’s 
financial modelling capabilities and work on 
the previous projects which form the basis of 
the corporate plan we envisaged Regiments 
as the SD and L partner for the corporate 
plan project.” 
 
In paragraph 42 he then says: 
“As explained further below in October or 
20 
November 2015 we learnt that a Regiment’s 
partner with whom we had worked on the 
month – on the two month project was 
planning to – a spin-off of the management 
consulting arm of Regiments which would 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 15 of 240 
 
ultimately result in the creation of an entity 
called Trillian Management Consulting.  We 
did 
not 
have 
a 
formal 
sub-contracting 
agreement for the corporate plan but we 
worked 
alongside 
Regiments/Trillian 
who 
provided 
financial 
component 
of 
the 
modelling required for the corporate plan.” 
 
You see that Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now the dates of October and November 
10 
2015 are significant in regard to a partner of Regiments 
going 
to 
form 
a 
company 
called Trillian 
Management 
Consulting because he comes back to that in paragraph 45.  
And you will see that as – he says: 
“As discussed above around October or 
November 2015 we learnt that a Regiments 
partner Dr Eric Wood was in the process of 
buying out the management consulting arm of 
Regiments from his business partners and 
would spin it off into Trillian.  At that time 
20 
Regiments 
was 
already 
working 
on 
the 
corporate plan and McKinsey was finalising 
the turnaround programme with Eskom which 
envisaged 
Regiments 
as 
McKinsey’s 
as 
00:15:34 
partner. 
 
Though 
my 
personal 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 16 of 240 
 
interaction with Regiments were limited at 
the time I understood that many consultants 
then at Regiments would move over to 
Trillian with Dr Wood and conduct the same 
management consulting business under the 
Trillian corporate name.” 
 
And what I wish to draw to your attention and I think I 
must have done so previously is that sentence which he 
says: 
“At that time Regiments was already working 
10 
on the corporate plan and McKinsey was 
finalising the turnaround programme.” 
 
I am going to read again or further from the affidavit 
of Mr Amankwah and I want to read a paragraph where he 
makes concluding remarks after several paragraphs in his 
affidavit. 
 
So let us go to page – and I will give you a chance to 
comment after that because the theme is the same.  Page 
702. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry just repeat that 7? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes 702.221. 
MR SINGH:  .221 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now just for context … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember to just tell us Mr Seleka whose 
affidavit you are … 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 17 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Referring to at 702.221. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – yes – the affidavit that we read pre 
– that we have just come from now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dr Weiss. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is Dr Weiss’ affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this one is still his? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This one now is one of Mr Amankwah 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which starts on page 7021. 174. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay give it to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We read certain excerpts from this 
affidavit previously and I have said page 702.221.  Just by 
way of context Mr Singh what Mr Amankwah deals with starts 
on the page 2 – page 702.220 and it is under the heading 9 
February 2016 Letter.  And he has – is Chairperson on page 
702.220? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not actually but I did hear that I am 
checking something else.  You can continue I have got 220. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Singh let us start on point 220 – 
paragraph 20.18. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We going to 220? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 18 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Paragraph 20.18.  So he say: 
“By way of summary and in light of what has been 
stated above I draw attention to the following 
features of the relationship between McKinsey 
and Trillian – one he says: 
1. McKinsey 
entered 
into 
discussions 
with 
Trillian in order to explore the possibility of 
working 
with 
Trillian 
as 
a 
supplier 
development partner at Eskom.  Those 
discussions were terminated in March 2016 
10 
when Trillian failed to satisfy McKinsey’s 
due diligence requirements. 
2. McKinsey never entered into a sub-contract 
or any other contractual relationship with 
Trillian 
whether 
for 
the 
corporate 
plan/project or the turnaround programme.  
Trillian has never been a sub-contractor to 
McKinsey.” 
And then he mentions other points. Can you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well they are important – 
20 
3.  Says McKinsey never paid money to Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And says  
4. Or McKinsey never authorised payment to 
Trillian by Eskom.  Then 5.   
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 19 of 240 
 
5. Any payments that were made by Eskom to 
Trillian or paid after McKinsey had informed 
Eskom of the fact that Trillian had failed its due 
diligence requirements. 
6. McKinsey has found no evidence to suggest 
that any of its personnel were involved in 
corrupt 
activities 
with 
any 
employees 
of 
Trillian.” 
I just thought 3, 4 – 3, 4 and 5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Appear to be quite important in the light of 
the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no the Chairperson is correct those 
aspects are important.  And Then Mr Singh in regard to this 
letter of the 9 th of February 2016 which relates to the direct 
payment to Trillian of R30.6 million that reads on the next 
page.  He says paragraph 21.1. 
“On 
9 
February 
2016 
Mr 
Vikas 
Sagar 
transmitted a letter to Mr Prish Govender of 
Eskom.” 
20 
 
And he references their annexure K65. 
“The 
letter 
related 
to 
the 
professional 
services contract that is the corporate plan.  
The letter recorded that McKinsey has sub-
contracted a portion of the services to be 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 20 of 240 
 
performed under the agreement to Trillian 
Proprietary Limited.  It authorised Eskom to 
make payments directly to Trillian but only if 
McKinsey confirmed in writing that it was 
satisfied 
with 
the 
relevant 
services 
performed by Trillian and that the amount of 
the invoice was correct.  Two conditions that 
were never met.” 
 
Then the next paragraph 21.2 says: 
“Trillian was never McKinsey’s sub-contractor 
10 
under 
the 
corporate 
plan 
because 
the 
assertion in the letter that McKinsey had 
sub-contracted to Trillian was wrong.  This 
letter has generated significant confusion 
while it was expected at the time that Trillian 
would be McKinsey’s supply development 
partner on the turnaround programme which 
Mr Singh I will add which would have been 
administered under the MSA as explained 
elsewhere in my statement McKinsey had not 
20 
yet entered into a sub-contract with Trillian 
and would indeed in the weeks following the 
letter decide not to do so.” 
 
And please turn to page 702. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Seleka be careful not to have a 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 21 of 240 
 
situation where you have read to Mr Singh a number of 
things. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you ask him to comment he 
cannot remember a lot of things so I think you need to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Break it into manageable portions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Components ja.  That is alright Chair.  It 
is just the paragraphs I wanted to read all deal with the 
same theme. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. So they all deal with the same theme. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will give him a chance just to respond 
to this one before I go to the next ones.  Mr Singh lastly turn 
to page 702 – 2.224. 
MR SINGH:  224? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  224 paragraph 21.7 he says: 
“In 
some 
McKinsey 
regrets 
that 
the 
9 
February letter contained inaccuracies which 
20 
generated confusion and misunderstanding.  
All of the people who had – who had 
involvement in the creation of the letter have 
been disciplined or have left the firm but the 
notion that the 9 February letter can be taken 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 22 of 240 
 
to 
confirm 
that 
Trillian 
was 
actually 
McKinsey’s sub-contractor is wrong.  This 
has been thoroughly investigated and cannot 
be 
reconciled 
with 
contemporaneous 
information.  Such evidence makes clear that 
Trillian was not McKinsey’s sub-contractor 
was 
still 
undergoing 
the 
due 
diligence 
process and never became McKinsey’s sub-
contractor.” 
 
I can read further but I suppose you – you get the 
10 
point of what the two gentlemen are making in regard to the 
corporate plan.  So what emerges from here is that in 
respect of the corporate plan McKinsey was not – I mean 
Trillian was not just not but never McKinsey sub-contractor 
in respect of the corporate plan.  We can deal with that first 
or you can even address it in respect of the MSA which is 
the turnaround programme in respect of which they also or 
he also says McKinsey – Trillian was never the sub-
contractor to McKinsey because of failing to pass the test on 
the due diligence.  But let us first deal with the corporate 
20 
plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as – as you prepare to do that Mr 
Singh I just want you to be aware that last time and I think 
the occasion for last time we dealt with the issue of whether 
it was Regiments who had the sub-contract with McKinsey or 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 23 of 240 
 
Trillian or both and the question of who rendered the 
services was it Trillian or Regiments and the question of 
whether Eskom should have paid Trillian direct.  So I do not 
want us to repeat the same thing but I do believe that Mr 
Seleka was right to draw your attention to the portions of 
affidavits that he has done so.  So as you respond just bear 
in mind that I know what you – what your version was that 
you have said or if you do not intend changing it then you 
just want to add or clarify it is enough.  You do not need to – 
go into details about that. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Thank you Mr Chair and again just from my side 
just apology for the delay that we had caused this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  But we – at least I am of the view that the 
information that was provided this morning would eventually 
in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Reduce the amount of time we would have to 
spend on this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  Your counsel did 
20 
explain to me in chambers.  It is just that the way it happens 
was not good but as I have said your counsel has explained 
everything to me and… 
MR SINGH:  Thank you for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 24 of 240 
 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
Thank 
you 
for 
your 
indulgence 
and 
understanding Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair just a couple of points before we go 
into the – the responses.  Firstly in terms of Dr Weiss’ 
affidavit Mr Chair I would like to place on record that the – 
the paragraphs that I am asked to respond do not form part 
of the 3.3 Notice that we have received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not form part of? 
MR SINGH:  Part of the 3.3 Notices that we have received. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so? 
MR SINGH:  Relating to Mr Weiss’ statement because we 
received a redacted version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR SINGH:  To that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
MR SINGH:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But have you had a chance to read them 
subsequent to the 3.3 Notice that did not include them or you 
have not had a chance to read them? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Well we have not received the unredacted 
version I think as of here – as at now but obviously we have 
read it now to Mr Seleka’s passage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so your only chance to look at them 
was now? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 25 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  Was now, we did have, or I certainly have 
occasion to read Dr Weiss’ transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   Relating to his evidence.  And secondly 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   ...sir ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, sorry. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Sorry, to interrupt.  Maybe just 
to place on record that we have in writing – probably on 
the 
go, 
requested 
the 
unredacted 
versions 
of 
both 
10 
Dr Weiss’ and Fines’ affidavits.  As I think in my client’s 
response to with what we were given, he makes it quite 
clear that he has only been given certain pages with 
certain paragraphs but up to now – and I think I have 
approached my learned friend, also, on one of the 
occasions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   ...but we have not yet received 
the unredacted versions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  No.  Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I know that they – we traversed 
this last time.  They were or Mr Singh was given the 
affidavit through the Money Flow work stream because they 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 26 of 240 
 
– the evidence of Dr Weiss was led by the Money Flow.  So 
the request, I think, would have gone – would have been 
addressed to that work stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the full affidavit of Dr Weiss is in 
the bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh has been given the bundle 
from the time or prior to the time of his appearance.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we have asked him questions, 
previously, on two occasions relevant to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do remember that there was a request 
to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...an affidavit of Dr Weiss.  It is just that 
I do not know whether he has provided one affidavit or 
more one affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do recall that there was reference 
20 
to at least an affidavit of Dr Weiss. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you say to me this is the only affidavit, 
then it means it was this one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is this one but what Mr Singh and my 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 27 of 240 
 
learned friend are saying is that when they were given the 
affidavit the first time around, last year, it was redacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the Money Flows? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By the Money Flows. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was redacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I have since explained to them, 
Chair, and even here in an open session that witnesses are 
given affidavits to the extent that they are implicated.  
10 
Mr Singh has dealt with the affidavit in reply.  He has a 
replying supplementary affidavit where he is expressly 
saying the affidavit of Dr Weiss does not implicate him. 
 
So all we are doing, Chair, from our point of 
view, is to put Dr Weiss’ affidavit in the bundle for his 
benefit and then we put the version of Dr Weiss to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the – but your real answer to the 
concern ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...is that Dr Weiss’ affidavit to which you 
20 
have referred know has been in the bundle that was given 
to Mr Singh quite some time back. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Prior 
to 
his 
appearance 
by 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before his first appearance? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 28 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Before his appearance in the Eskom 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the Eskom matters? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Counsel for Mr Singh, do you 
accept that? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Except that, Chairperson 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   I think what my client is trying to 
10 
explain and what we are trying to explain is that at the time 
when he responded ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   It was a partial response to a 
redacted version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   So, basically, he cannot be 
faltered for only dealing with those specific paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, that is fine.  As I 
understand it, Mr Singh, Dr Weiss’ affidavit was included in 
20 
the bundle that was given to you before you came to testify 
in the Eskom work stream the last time for – I mean, for 
the first time.  And if that is so, it would seem that there 
has been enough time for you to familiarise yourself with 
it.   
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 29 of 240 
 
 
And from what Mr Seleka says, it does look like 
you did look at it and you did not think there was anything 
implicating you.  And you may be right about that but what 
Mr Seleka is doing – is saying:  Here is something might 
not be implicate you in Dr Weiss’ affidavit but it might be 
contrary to your version about Trillian.  So I think that is 
the point. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the point is taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   I think my additional comment regarding this 
10 
is, Mr Chair.  If the issue relating to Dr Weiss was going to 
be relevant to the discussion ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Relating to? 
MR SINGH:   The affidavit of Dr Weiss ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   ...was relevant and produced in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Seleka is correct in saying that the 
affidavit that we have been provided to before did not 
implicate me.  Yet we comment on the paragraphs that 
20 
were required to comment.  If it was as significant as what 
we are now saying, my question is.  Notwithstanding the 
fact that it does not implicate me, we should have been 
given the opportunity to comment on it in its entirety. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, but I thought you said it does not 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 30 of 240 
 
implicate you? 
MR SINGH:   On the redacted version, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR SINGH:   Not this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand it, which is not redacted, 
was part of the bundle that was given to you a long time 
ago. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair, but the comment around not 
being implicated relates to the unredacted version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, no, no.  I understand that, 
10 
yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   And a similar point I have with Mr Amankwah.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Yes, it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, it is now going back to the bundle.  We 
have access to it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...because of Mr Seleka has ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   ...has given it to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But again, if we were placing such reliance 
on this document, as we are now doing, then I would have 
at least expected that this would have been provided to us 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 31 of 240 
 
for us to provide an appropriate affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, but I think the bottom line is.  
As far as these particular paragraphs that Mr Seleka has 
referred you to.  As I understand the position is.  They 
might not be implicating you.  All he is doing is.  You have 
been given certain version and here is somebody else who 
might be talking not having you in mind but says something 
that might be contradictory to what you want to say.   
 
In fairness, he wants to give you a chance to 
say:  What do you say about Dr Weiss who says the 
10 
following things? 
MR SINGH:   Ja, I realise that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   I just want to place on record ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...my reservations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   But I am done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   So in that light, we can continue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine.  Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I am just trying to think the best of 
way of dealing with this issue.  Okay, it is fine.  Let us deal 
with 692 first, relating to Dr Weiss’ comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want us to go to what page, 220, 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 32 of 240 
 
or what now?   
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir, 692. 
CHAIRPERSON:   692 first?  Yes, okay.  Yes, you may 
continue. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if we look at the paragraphs that 
have been referred to by Advocate Seleka, as he had 
mentioned, they relatively have one theme that runs 
throughout, is that mister – Dr Weiss was of the view, at 
some point in time, there was Regiment that was doing 
certain amount of work and there was then a period of time 
10 
when there was a, let us call it a merger or acquisition type 
of initiative that was happening between Regiments and 
Trillian.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, a spin-off.  A spin-off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, alright ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   A spin-off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Okay let us call it a buy-out.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think there would be a normal word for 
it.  A break-away.  [laughs]   
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was to be a break-away from 
Regiments. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 33 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, I think – I certainly do not deny 
that but what I want to raise in terms of the issue relating 
to the – whether Mr Weiss has concretely concluded that 
Trillian or Regiments had done the copy plan work.  If you 
have reference to his transcripts, those that I have read, 
then we can probably go to the relevant paragraph. 
 
When he was posed the questions, Chair, it was 
not definitively answered.  He basically said, there were 
emails, there was training, there were people, there were 
meetings and Regiments and Trillian people attended these 
10 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Regiments and Trillian people..? 
MR SINGH:   Attended these meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   They were trained as such. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Emails came from Trillian email addresses.  
They came from Regiments’ email addresses.  So he could 
not conclusively conclude that Trillian had not done the 
work, from my recollection of his transcripts.  And that is 
20 
my 
response 
to 
the 
question 
relating 
to 
Dr 
Weiss’ 
comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, for now.  If you allow me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, before you proceed. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 34 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to say.  Depending on 
whether you accept his evidence that Trillian never had a 
subcontract with McKinsey.  Your answer that you gave 
might not be so important. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not think whether Trillian had a 
subcontractor for McKinsey was put to Dr Weiss. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, but in his affidavit, in that – in 
the passages that Mr Seleka read earlier on, if I recall 
correctly.  It is just that I was reading other passages 
10 
whereas he might not have read.  So I may be mistaken but 
he does say somewhere that...  No, actually, the – one of 
the passages that he read where I even read more of the 
paragraphs, he does say that Trillian never had any 
contract with McKinsey.   
MR SINGH:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am saying, if that – if you accept 
that and I do not know if you do accept it.  If you accept it, 
it may be that the fact that they may have or certain people 
who were with Regiments or Trillian attended meetings, the 
20 
weight one attaches to that, it might be different if 
compared to a situation where there was a contract. 
 
So, in other words, if the contract was only with 
Regiments, whatever that personnel may have been doing, 
they may have been doing for Regiments and not Trillian if 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 35 of 240 
 
Trillian had no subcontractors with McKinsey.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, firstly, the passage that you are 
referring to comes from Mr Amankwah(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
MR SINGH:   Not Dr Weiss. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not Dr Weiss ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   And I will deal with that when we are dealing 
with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine.  That is fine. 
MR SINGH:   But for now my response relating to the 
10 
paragraphs is that, from what I recall from Dr Weiss’ 
transcripts is that he is not definitive on the question 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Not definitive? 
MR SINGH:   He was not definitive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   In terms of saying Regiments’ people did the 
work ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   On the Corporate Plan. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   He was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  And I will come back to this point when 
I deal with the issue of Mr Amankwah’s comments.  In 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 36 of 240 
 
having to deal with Mr Amankwah’s comments.  I think, 
Mr Chair, I will have to refer you back to one of my 
affidavits.  I am not too sure which one it is.  It is the one 
that we responded to the Corporate Plan.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the first ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You want your counsel to assist – to 
remind you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know what it is, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 16, page 591. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Filed there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply- silence] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you referring to your affidavit that is 
on page 591 of Bundle 16, Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir.  I am there.  I am just looking for 
the relevant paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You are looking for a paragraph 
that says what so we can assist you if we see it. 
MR SINGH:   in terms of the STLN - I think I have found it 
20 
in paragraph 15. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 15? 
MR SINGH:   You see, Mr Chair, if you look at para – so 
page 597, it deals with the point I was making, which says: 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 37 of 240 
 
“Dr Weiss, in addition, outlines how Trillian 
came 
to 
be 
an 
SDL 
partner 
instead 
of 
Regiments...” 
 
Then somebody here outlines the following in 
this regard: 
“Dr Wood intended to start up his own Black 
Economic 
Empowerment 
in 
management 
consulting called Trillian. 
This 
would 
be 
achieved 
by 
buying 
out 
Regiments’ management consulting division. 
10 
McKinsey communicated with both Trillian’s 
and Regiments’ staff. 
McKinsey 
trained 
staff 
that 
moved 
from 
Regiments to Trillian...” 
 
So, Mr Chair, this is what I was talking about in 
terms of the fact that he was not actually definitive to say 
Regiments did not do the work on the Corporate Plan, 
firstly.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Mr Singh.  But he is talking 
about Trillian becoming an SDL partner of McKinsey 
20 
instead of Regiments.  That is in regard to the Turnaround 
Programme, the NMSA.  It is not the Corporate Plan.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we can check that but my 
understanding and my recollection of the transcripts was, if 
that was a response to a question as to whether he could 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 38 of 240 
 
say whether Regiments or Trillian was actually the people 
that did the work on the Corporate Plan.   
 
Further, Mr Chair, I would like to take you to the 
emails that relate to the 9 t h of February letter.  I am just 
trying to find it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   In fact, Mr Singh, you have answered 
that question yourself in the paragraph – in the preceding 
paragraph on the page before which specifically shows that 
his answer relates to the Turnaround Programme and not 
the Corporate Plan.   
10 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Just give me one second.  I just want 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.   
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair.  I am not sure where this...  
Sorry.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to indicate what you are 
looking for? 
MR SINGH:   I am looking for the emails that relate to the 
20 
9 t h of February letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   An email from who to who? 
MR SINGH:   It is a string of emails Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR SINGH:   That culminated in the issuance of this 9 t h of 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 39 of 240 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That relates to the letter from McKinsey 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that talked about Trillian? 
MR SINGH:   Trillian.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, are you able to assist him?  
And his counsel can indicate if she is able to say where we 
find those emails. 
MR SINGH:   It is in one of the affidavits but while we 
10 
looking for that, Mr Chair.  In the interest of primarily, I can 
just deal with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or what we can do is.  We can deal with 
other matters and then later on ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No, I will deal with Mr Amankwah’s 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Responses to the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   ...while we are trying to find this. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   So we are looking at Mr Amankwah’s issues 
relating to paragraph 20.18(?).   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you done with Dr Weiss? 
MR SINGH:   No, no I am saying ...[intervenes]  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 40 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will come back? 
MR SINGH:   I will come back once we find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  That is fine. 
MR SINGH:   If we indeed have then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Mr Singh, if we move on to 
Mr Amankwah. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was saying to you.  In your affidavit 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...you referred the Chairperson to page 
597 and you read paragraph 18. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I was drawing your attention that 
what Dr Weiss is talking about there is the proposal to 
have Trillian as an SDL partner of McKinsey in the 
Turnaround 
Programme 
and 
not 
the 
Corporate 
Plan 
because we are dealing with the Corporate Plan. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And I am saying, the answer that 
gives credence to what I am putting to you is evident from 
your quotation in the previous page that he is specifically 
dealing with the Turnaround Programme.  You are quoting 
from page 595, paragraph 17. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 41 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And in summary, Dr Weiss states, and 
then you have all those paragraphs. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Regiments was actually quite capable 
internationally - and he talks about Regiments.  If you turn 
the page and you go to the last paragraph on that page, he 
says: 
“We have worked with them (that is Regiments) 
before and even done a due diligence with 
10 
them before and this, you know, how – and we 
consider 
them 
also 
as 
potential 
supply 
development partner for Eskom’s Turnaround 
Programme...” 
 
Then you go on to say what you say in 
paragraph 18.  And you are correct insofar as it is the 
Turnaround Programme because they did intent to replace 
Regiments with Trillian as a subcontractor in respect of the 
Turnaround Programme. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I said.  I will check these 
20 
transcripts 
and 
come 
back, 
if 
indeed 
it 
is 
that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...we will, obviously, accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, it is fine. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 42 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   But for now I am saying, the reason why I put 
this is because of my distinct recollection that this was 
asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
MR SINGH:   As it relates to page 29 of his transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you have a chance to look at those 
emails and then come back. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Amankwah? 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, in terms of responding to 
10 
Mr Amankwah’s affidavit relating to paragraphs – sorry, on 
page 702.221, which is paragraphs 20.18, 21.1, 21.2 and 
21.7.  Mr Chair, in order for me to respond.  Or well, now...  
Okay.  I would need for the Chairperson to actually go to 
paragraph 21.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Go back to Bundle 14, is that right? 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
MR SINGH:   Let me just get it for you, sir.  It will be on, 
Mr Chair, 702.221.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, just give us the reference again, 
Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   It is starting on 702.221, which is at – where 
you 
stopped 
at 
and 
you 
have 
quoted 
all 
of 
those 
paragraphs. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 43 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
MR SINGH:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, in order for me to respond to 
those specific paragraphs and the issue that was put to me 
by Mr Seleka.  If we – I would need for the Chairperson to 
go to paragraph 21.5 which is on page 702.221. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am there. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if you would allow me, I will read 
the following.  This 9 t h of February 2016 letter have been 
prepared at the request of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the request of both? 
MR SINGH:   At the request of both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was the request then granted? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be checked? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 44 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   And Trillian.  IN order to streamline the 
process for Trillian to receive payments for work, it had 
undertaken to that date in conjunction with the Corporate 
Project Plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are reading now from page 702.221.  
What paragraph? 
MR SINGH:   Paragraph 21.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, at 222.  Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Oh, sorry, yes.  701... 702.222. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Paragraph 21.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   It says – let me start again, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
“This 9 t h of February 2016 letter has been 
prepared at the request of Eskom and Trillian 
in order to streamline the process for Trillian 
to receive payment for work it had taken – 
20 
undertaken up to that date in connection with 
the Corporate Plan Project...: 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   It then puts in brackets: 
“This letter has nothing whatsoever to do with 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 45 of 240 
 
the Turnaround Programme...:   
 
This is clear from the contents of the letter.  
Okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   So what it says to me, Mr Chair, that this 
letter 
was 
not 
simply 
contemplated 
by 
somebody 
in 
McKinsey that made a mistake to this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Firstly.  Secondly.  He then goes off to state 
in paragraph 21.1, 21.5(1). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
“Dr Weiss and McKinsey partner and Mr Sagar, 
consulted 
with 
McKinsey’s 
legal 
advisor 
regarding the content of the letter. 
As a result, certain internal communication are 
subject to attorney-client privilege and have 
not been reflected below...” 
 
But what is important for me is that Dr Weiss, 
whose affidavit we have just been through, is part of this 
20 
process in preparing this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I am not sure that, Mr Seleka, an 
internal legal advisor would give advice to an attorney-
client privilege. 
MR SINGH:   Well, that was the other raised point that 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 46 of 240 
 
counsel going to raise, but I ...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja, I mean an internal legal 
advisor is just an employee.  
MR SINGH:   Yes, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So they might have to produce 
those – that – those communications they did not produce 
because they sought to – they sought cover under 
attorney-client privilege. 
10 
MR SINGH:   And Mr Chair, we will implore that we will 
actually get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Because we would like to see what this was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, that must be pursued 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has not been pursued, ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes, Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   Then on subparagraph 2 it says: 
“On 26 January 2016 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  It is just – ja, I have got 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 47 of 240 
 
something with regard to my - no, but I think something to 
be dealt with outside the hearing.  Okay alright.  Continue.   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, then 21.5(2): 
“On 
26 
February 
2016, 
Trillian, 
being 
represented by Mr Clive Angel, and others 
copied, wrote to McKinsey, Dr Weiss and 
Sagar...” 
 
So these are the emails that I am trying to find, 
Mr Chair, but obviously it is confirmed. 
“...seeks assistance in receiving payment from 
10 
Eskom...” 
 
And he actually attaches the same emails that I 
am trying to find. 
“Mr Angel asked McKinsey to write to Eskom 
on Trillian’s behalf, seeking permission for 
McKinsey 
and 
Trillian 
to 
invoice 
Eskom 
separately under any contracts where Trillian 
is appointed supply development partner...” 
 
Okay?  And I concede, it is any at this stage.   
“On 8 February 2016, Sagar emailed Dr Weiss 
20 
relating that Eskom had asked McKinsey to 
issue a letter stating that Trillian can invoice 
Eskom directly...” 
 
And there is the email again. 
“Mr Sagar stated that he had received a 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 48 of 240 
 
request from Mr Angel and asked Dr Weiss 
whether 
he 
had 
also 
received 
the 
same 
request. 
In response, Dr Weiss informs Sagar that he 
had not received the request...” 
 
But obviously that is contradictory to the email.  
Paragraph 4.  Oh, sorry, bracket 4. 
“On 9 February 2016, Sagar, after consulting with 
McKinsey in-house counsel sent the first draft of 
the proposed letter to Mr Angel and Dr Wood at 
10 
Trillian. 
And there is the attached email. 
Later that day Sagar sent the signed letter to Angel 
and Dr Wood relating that this would be the letter 
they would be sending to Eskom.” 
And then there is the letter.  Then (5): 
“Shortly thereafter Sagar also transmit the letter to 
Prish Govender at Eskom.  While the covering email 
discusses the MSA contract, the 9 February letter 
only relates to fixed fee six month corporate plan 
20 
for which work can largely been completed in the 
time of this letter.  This is clear from the content of 
the letter.  Eskom also confirmed that the 9 
February related solely to the corporate plan and 
provided no authority whatsoever in respect of the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 49 of 240 
 
turnaround programme.” 
Para 6: 
“In 
addition, 
the 
letter 
transmitted 
to 
Eskom 
includes two important conditions that requires 
McKinsey to issue written confirmation of our 
satisfaction of the relevant services performed by 
Trillian to McKinsey and to confirm the correctness 
of the amounts invoiced.  None of these conditions 
were fulfilled.” 
Again (7): 
10 
“Later on 9 February Angel reverts to Trillian 
proposed changes to the letter.” 
And there is an email attached. 
“These request changes from Trillian including 
removing the conditions described as above as they 
would introduce further administrative issues into 
the process because the letter only referred to the 
corporate plan contract.  McKinsey did not adopt 
Trillian’s 
proposed 
amendment. 
 
The 
correspondence 
further 
envisages 
the 
party’s 
20 
understanding at the time of 9 February letter 
submitted to Eskom related exclusively to the 
corporate plan project.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, evinces. 
MR SINGH:   Evinces? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 50 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  
MR SINGH:   Never heard the word.  (8) 
“Mr Clive Angel followed up Mr Vikas’ email noting 
that Trillian had invoiced Eskom and under the 
conditions of the letter McKinsey needs to write to 
Eskom to the effect that McKinsey was satisfied 
with the work Trillian had done on the corporate 
plan.  Eskom never requested such a letter of 
satisfaction and McKinsey sent such confirmation.  
Eskom has confirmed that the 9 February did not in 
10 
itself basically…” 
I would like to stop there, Mr Chair, in terms of the 
question that was posed by – or the issue that was raised 
by Mr Seleka is that, Mr Chair, I do not believe that if you 
read these passages that it can be simply dismissed, that 
this letter was an erroneous letter that just happened to be 
issued and for …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it seems to have been – before it was 
sent to Eskom you say it seems that it was subjected to 
quite some detailed scrutiny within McKinsey and Trillian. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of the email trail that I am 
requesting is provided, you will even see post the letter the 
legal head of McKinsey follows up on the letter to suggest 
is there anything further that has actually happened 
relating to this letter.  He then escalates it to the head of 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 51 of 240 
 
the accounts department within McKinsey to say please 
follow up on this matter and make sure it is dealt with.  He 
then sends an email to Eskom saying to Eskom – and this 
went to a lady called Mary-Anne Hendricks who I think is 
the PA of Mr Prish Govender who was the project manager 
on this project which states that should you have any 
issues relating to this matter further, please bring it to my 
attention within McKinsey so I can elevate it to the 
appropriate leadership level within the company to ensure 
that these things are streamlined.  Now, Mr Chair, taking 
10 
all of that into account I will not understand how McKinsey 
basically says that this letter was prepared on the basis 
that it was incorrect and stand away from it. 
 
Mr Chair, this brings me to another point that I 
would like to make to the Commission for the Commission 
to take note of.  Mr Chair, these documents, this letter, 9 
February letter, is a letter that has been issued by 
McKinsey signed by a partner of McKinsey, received by 
Eskom.  Now, Mr Chair, when Eskom receives this letter, in 
what mind does Eskom receive it?  It receives it in good 
20 
faith that McKinsey has issued this letter.  What does 
Eskom do with it?  Eskom places reliance on it that this 
letter was received in good faith. 
 
Now for whatever reason, McKinsey decides to 
sidestep this letter and say no, we did not issue it or it was 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 52 of 240 
 
invalid or for the fact that these two clauses in the 
agreement was not fulfilled by Eskom therefore it is 
invalid.  Part for one minute, Mr Chair, the fact that the 
letter may have in Eskom been used for other purpose but 
for now, the purpose that we are using the letter is to 
understand 
whether 
McKinsey 
at 
any 
point 
in 
time 
contemplated Trillian to be their SDL partner and from what 
I have read to you, Mr Chair, I cannot find it in my being to 
suggest that they were not. 
 
So McKinsey can say and do whatever they want 
10 
but on objective fact that I have just read to you, in Mr 
Amankwah’s affidavit himself which suggested that they at 
all material times believed that Trillian should have been 
paid for the work that they did on the corporate plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just talking about Eskom receiving 
it in good faith, Mr Singh, just remember that he says this 
was a letter at the request – prepared for the request of 
Eskom and Trillian. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the point. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, again, if we look at …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let me just finish.  So it is not as if 
the letter comes unexpected to Eskom and Eskom simply 
oh, it comes from McKinsey, we will act on the letter in 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 53 of 240 
 
good faith.  It was specifically Eskom and Trillian who 
requested the letter to be prepared according to Mr 
Amankwah. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Chair, again, McKinsey is a world-
renowned company, they are a global company.  If they 
receive a request from Mr Singh and Mr Singh says to them 
listen, I want this letter or it comes from Mr Molefe or it 
comes from Mr Govender or it comes from whoever in 
Eskom and he purports to request McKinsey to not 
factually represent the state of affairs that McKinsey 
10 
knows, why would McKinsey issue the letter?  Or why 
would McKinsey have to issue the letter and that is where I 
am saying, if I request something in good faith I expect the 
reciprocation and therefore we rely on letters or we rely on 
assertions or we rely on representation or we rely on 
warrants that are made in good faith. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, speaking generally, there ought to 
be no problem with placing reliance on a letter that comes 
from – that genuinely comes from McKinsey but two things 
that I want to clarify.  One, as I recall that letter, it did not 
20 
specify certain conditions which, as I recall from last time 
we were dealing with that letter, would have had to have 
been met before any payment could have been made to 
Trillian and where they met. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair …[intervenes] 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 54 of 240 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I think the letter 
that we are speaking about is AS19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   To my client’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   So I am going to leave it there 
because I have got a further issue with the interpretation 
that is attached to the letter but I am going to let my client 
deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   And if necessary, I will bring it 
to your attention.  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine.  Which bundle 
or what page is the letter if you are able to…? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Sorry, it is AS7, my attorney just 
corrected me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it helps if we know the bundle. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   It is from 16-697, it is in the 
black… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we – it is also contained, 
Chairperson, in Eskom bundle 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think my registrar already has bundle 
16.  16, is that correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, 14. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 55 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it does appear there as counsel 
indicated then we can use that one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got the letter at Eskom 
bundle 
16 
page 
697, the 
letter from McKinsey 
and 
Company and it is addressed to Prish Govender at Eskom.  
Just to refresh everybody’s mind it says: 
“Dear Prish, authorisation to pay subcontractor 
directly.” 
That is the subject or heading. 
10 
“We refer to the professional services contract for 
the provision of consulting services for six months 
entered into between Eskom SOC Limited, Eskom, 
and McKinsey and Company Africa (Proprietary) 
Limited, McKinsey, dated 29 September 2015, the 
agreement. 
 
As 
you 
know, 
McKinsey 
has 
subcontracted a portion of the services to be 
performed 
under 
the 
agreement 
to 
Trillian 
(Proprietary) Ltd, Trillian.” 
So in this letter they make is clear in the second sentence 
20 
that McKinsey had subcontracted a portion of the services 
to be performed under the agreement to Trillian and then it 
says in the second paragraph: 
“Subject to: 
1. The terms of the agreement relating to any 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 56 of 240 
 
payments to be made by Eskom to us, and  
2. Us 
issuing 
a 
written 
confirmation 
of 
our 
satisfaction with the relevant services to be 
performed by Trillian to McKinsey, and 
3. The correctness of the amount to be invoiced, we 
hereby agree for and authorise Trillian to invoice 
and be paid directly by Eskom for any services 
performed by it in pursuance of our obligations 
under this agreement.” 
Okay.  So would you agree, Mr Singh, that on the face of it, 
10 
in that letter, second paragraph, McKinsey’s agreement 
and authorisation that Trillian be paid directly by Eskom 
was subject to those three conditions?  Do you go along 
with that understanding of paragraph 2? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do, on the basis that it is forming 
part of the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  And then the next 
question would be, when Eskom made the payment to 
Trillian, had these conditions been satisfied? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think before we go and answer 
20 
that question… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Let us deal with the issue that Mr Seleka had 
posed to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 57 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Relating to the identity of the party that 
performed the services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, deal with that and then come 
to this. 
MR SINGH:   And I am saying, given the content of this 
letter in terms of sentences one and two of paragraph 1, it 
is clear for all intents and purposes and at all material 
times McKinsey understood that Trillian had been doing the 
work 
and 
there 
was 
a 
subcontract, 
they 
were 
the 
subcontractor to them …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think that you necessarily need 
to misrepresent anything but when you say at material 
times that that might widen. 
MR SINGH:   Okay, okay.  Alright, so at the date of this 
letter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Not it would appear, it is factual that based 
on the paragraphs that I have read to you from Mr 
Amankwah’s letter – I mean, Mr Amankwah’s affidavit, as 
well as the – which results in this letter of 9 February, it 
20 
would – it is that McKinsey accepted that Trillian would be 
their subcontractor on the corporate plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me mention this and then we can 
hear how you deal with it.  That last sentence in the first 
paragraph of the letter suggests two things.  One, that 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 58 of 240 
 
McKinsey at the time of the writing of this letter had 
already subcontracted a portion of the services to Trillian.  
That is one. 
 
But two, but that the services were yet to be 
performed under the agreement.  That might be a certain 
interpretation, maybe somebody else might interpret that 
sentence differently but my first impression was it looks 
like they are saying we have already subcontracted to 
Trillian but that is for services to be performed in the 
future but maybe what they meant is, at the time of 
10 
subcontracting, the services were to be performed, but 
maybe they had already been performed by the 9 t h, I am 
not sure.  I just want you to deal with those things. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would hazard to say it is your 
second interpretation and I will tell you why I say so.  
Firstly the reference “the agreement” which can only be the 
corporate plan agreement because they actually define it in 
the first sentence, okay? 
 
And secondly, Mr Amankwah in the passages that I 
have read to you, states that the bit on which this letter 
20 
was prepared in the process that I had taken you through, 
by that time the work relating to the corporate plan had 
substantially been completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR SINGH:   If you recall the corporate plan would have 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 59 of 240 
 
needed to be submitted by the 28 February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
MR SINGH:   And this is around the 9 t h, so substantial 
completion was achieved by that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.  Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, Chair, your – the 
Chairperson’s question about the condition should not be 
forgotten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, yes.  Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Oh, yes.  So hopefully, Mr Chair, this puts 
paid to the issue of whether the identity of the party 
relating to the corporate plan is still a mystery or not.  In 
my view, it should not.  In terms …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is – we will put everything into the 
basket, into the pot and see what we come out with, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, because, Mr Singh, we cannot turn 
a blind eye to the correction they made that the information 
was inaccurate and the people who drafted the letter have 
since been disciplined or have left the firm. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, the fact that the people 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us not go back to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us leave it at this that everything 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 60 of 240 
 
must be put into the pot to see what the real picture is, 
what you have said, the passages that you read in the 
affidavit and what Mr Seleka referred to, everything will be 
looked at to see exactly what picture emerges. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   I think again, Mr Chair, not going back to the 
issue… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   But the fact that someone has been 
10 
disciplined, someone who has left the organisation, does 
not detract from the fact that this is a legitimate letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, I understand what you say, I 
understand what you say. 
MR SINGH:   Coming back to the issue of, Mr Chair 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The conditions. 
MR SINGH:   Not the conditions.  Mr Chair, as I understand 
it, once Mr Angel – once this letter was transmitted to 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   To Eskom and to Trillian and after Mr Angel’s 
subsequent 
amendments 
to 
the 
letter 
was 
rejected, 
Trillian’s CFO, Mr Lebalo, issued a letter or an email to 
McKinsey 
requesting 
this 
sign-off 
in 
terms 
of 
these 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 61 of 240 
 
proceedings and I think the email had been sent to Mr 
Lawrence Chamberlain a McKinsey manager or senior 
partner and he then in the email basically said the sign-off 
should be sent to Mr Edwin Mabelane.  In terms of whether 
the sign-off was actually provided or not, I am not too sure, 
but I know that a request had been made.  In my affidavit I 
do go to the extent of saying that Mr Govender also 
engaged with Mr Lawrence to understand whether this is 
approved by McKinsey or not.  I do not have an email to 
prove that Mr Lawrence had given the go-ahead but maybe 
10 
when Mr Govender is requested for an affidavit or when Mr 
Govender 
appears 
he 
can 
be 
asked 
and 
Mr 
Edwin 
Mabelane can also be asked in terms of what was the 
status of these conditions being [indistinct – dropping 
voice] or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your short answer is you have no 
personal knowledge whether or not these conditions were 
complied – had been complied with by the time Eskom paid 
the money to Trillian. 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Other than the documents …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No in this case meaning yes to my 
question. 
MR SINGH:   No, I did not …[intervenes] 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 62 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I said is your short answer that you have 
no personal knowledge of whether these conditions had 
been met by the time Eskom …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, it is yes.  Ja, you know, no and 
yes can confuse.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Just for the benefit 
of the Chairperson, Mr Singh, in the same affidavit of Mr 
Amankwah and I will not read this Chair unless when you 
look at them you will find them crucial(?). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well if you think it is important you 
can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let us look at paragraph 7, Eskom 
bundle 14, Eskom bundle 14 page 702.191. 
MR SINGH:   191? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, point 191.  You know it is just… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Take it that we do not – we will not be 
going back to this letter of the 9 t h any time soon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair.  You can put aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this can go.  702.191? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   191, correct, Chair, paragraph 7.  And I 
am concluding on this because… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Remember Mr Amankwah said the 
information in the letter is inaccurate because they did not 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 63 of 240 
 
subcontract 
to 
Trillian 
and 
to 
say 
otherwise, 
would 
contradict information that existed at the time, in that last 
paragraph 
we 
read. 
 
And 
he 
deals 
with 
that 
in 
…[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair, can you just repeat? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  He says in paragraph 21.7. 
MR SINGH:   21.7? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you have moved from page 
702.191 now? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have – yes, Chair, I thought – sorry, 
Mr Singh, what did you want?  Let me ask you what did you 
want? 
MR SINGH:   No, no, you started speaking and I was not 
listening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MR SINGH:   So I just said if you could just repeat what 
you have said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, just repeat, yes.  Okay, but you 
are on page …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You referred us to page 702.191, Mr 
Seleka, paragraph 7. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, Chair.  Paragraph 7, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what was the point about paragraph 
7? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 64 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So before I read it, I want to 
underscore the paragraphs here by what Mr Amankwah 
says. 
MR SINGH:   So which are those paragraphs? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is what he said in paragraph 
21.7. 
MR SINGH:   21.7? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR SINGH:   That is what I was looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, tell us what he says there, Mr 
10 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is where he says it is inaccurate to 
say Trillian had been subcontracted in corporate plan as 
McKinsey’s 
subcontractor. 
 
To 
say 
otherwise 
is 
not 
reconcilable with contemporaneous information.  Yes.  So 
that is the underscore.  Then I go to this paragraph.  Do 
you hear, Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, go to paragraph 
7 then. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 Then 
paragraph 
7 
deals 
with 
20 
Regiments’ role in the corporate plan projects and there he 
deals with it.  He says: 
“7.1 
McKinsey was notified late in the contracting 
process in Eskom’s acceptance letter of 29 
September 2015 that McKinsey would need 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 65 of 240 
 
to outsource 30% of the corporate plan 
contract to a SDP.” 
Which is supply development partner. 
“7.2 
At this time Regiments Capital (Regiments) a 
firm that had previously performed work at 
Eskom and a financial strategy was viewed 
as a logical candidate to partner for the 
corporate 
plan. 
 
Regiments’ 
prior 
track 
record at Eskom and its prior work with 
McKinsey positioned it to make an important 
10 
contribution to the corporate plan. 
7.3 
In the end, however, there was no formalised 
relationship in the form of a contract with 
Regiments 
for 
work 
at 
Eskom 
on 
the 
corporate plan.  Regiments reported directly 
to Eskom on its work and McKinsey and 
Regiments largely worked on separate work 
streams 
although 
McKinsey’s 
consultants 
collaborated 
with 
Regiments 
on 
select 
issues. 
20 
7.4 
Regiments worked on the financial part of 
the corporate plan, had formed the funding 
plan 
chapter 
which 
was 
work 
that 
was 
directly overseen by Eskom.” 
Then he refers to the annexures. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 66 of 240 
 
“This was an extension of the financial 
modelling work that Regiments had worked 
on for Eskom on what I understand was on a 
pro bono basis. 
7.5 
McKinsey’s decision to proceed with the 
corporate plan without a formal contract in 
place with a supply development partner is 
an example of a mistake that should not 
have been made.” 
Mr Singh, I can read the entire paragraph. 
10 
“While 
it 
appears 
to 
have 
stemmed 
principally from the fact that Regiments was 
already working at Eskom on related work 
streams and was in the process of spinning 
off its consulting business, it is nevertheless 
regrettable.  Although Regiments’ work on 
the corporate plan was overseen by Eskom, 
the ambiguity surrounding the relationship 
between 
McKinsey 
and 
Regiments 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
corporate 
plan 
led 
to 
20 
confusion 
among 
McKinsey 
team 
and 
allowed Regiments to undertake its work 
with less supervision from McKinsey that it 
might have received otherwise.  This lack of 
contractual rigor is an example of the type of 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 67 of 240 
 
mistake McKinsey has sought to remedy with 
updates to its policies described below.” 
But I have read this to you, Mr Singh, to show that no way 
in these paragraphs he refers to Trillian and he is explicit 
about 
who 
was 
intended 
to 
be 
the 
SDP, 
supply 
development partner, for McKinsey in respect of the 
corporate plan and that is Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to say anything, Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Indeed, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of the passages that were 
read by Mr Seleka, firstly I would like to point to 7.1.  It is 
disingenuous of Mr Amankwah to say that McKinsey was 
notified late in the contracting process that Eskom would 
require and SD partner for work being performed at Eskom.  
This is not the first piece of work that McKinsey was doing 
at Eskom, so they know that there is always an SDL portion 
relating to McKinsey work – I mean, work at a state owned 
company like Eskom. 
 
In terms of late, Mr Chair, he signed – Dr Weiss 
20 
signed a letter of acceptance for the work I think on the 29 
September 2015 which indicated that 30% SDL partner.  So 
before that date they could have not known that they would 
get this work because it was not approved.  So how would 
we have told them before that?  So it could not have been 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 68 of 240 
 
late 
in 
the 
process. 
 
The 
letter 
that 
he 
signed 
acknowledged that 30% had to be sub-contracted, an 
acceptable statement that he made.    
 
In terms of the rest of the paragraphs that Mr 
Seleka is saying Mr Chair again if you look at paragraph 
7.5 for example McKinsey’s decision to proceed with the 
Corporate Plan, without a formal contract in place with any 
supplier, with a supplier development partner, it doesn’t 
say Regiments, it says a supplier development partner, is 
an example of the mistake that should not have been made 
10 
continuous to the last sentence of this paragraph, the lack 
of contractual rigour is an example of the type of mistake 
McKinsey has sought to remedy with the updates to its 
policies described below.   
 
Now they – Mr Amankwah and McKinsey specifically 
try and obfuscate the obligation relating to the fact that 
they 
had 
a 
relationship 
with 
Trillian, 
originally 
with 
Regiments and it morphed into Trillian and for whatever 
reason that currently is playing out, whether it be political 
or 
reputational 
or 
otherwise 
they 
are 
attempting 
to 
20 
obfuscate the actual facts that were available at the time, 
and I will come back to paragraph 27, at 21.7 Mr Chair, 
because it is 
now 
very 
convenient to 
say 
although 
Regiments 
worked 
on 
the 
Corporate 
Plan 
and 
was 
overseen 
by 
Eskom 
the 
ambiguity 
surrounding 
the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 69 of 240 
 
relationship 
between 
McKinsey 
and 
Regiments, 
with 
respect to the Corporate Plan led to confusion amongst 
McKinsey staff and allowed Regiments to undertake work 
with less supervision. 
 
Mr Chair I can understand if my kids were confused, 
this is the Legal Head of McKinsey South Africa, it is the 
head of their Accounts Department, two senior partners 
from McKinsey are involved in the process.  Dr Weiss has 
two PHD’s, not one, two.   Now you are trying to tell me 
that these individuals that were part of the process, that 
10 
was involved on a daily basis, that met me almost on a 
daily basis, were involved in meetings relating to all of 
these projects, were all of a sudden confused, and had 
ambiguity in their mind to produce a formal letter that went 
through the rigour of the process I just explained to you 
and now McKinsey is of the view that it was ambiguous. 
 
I cannot reconcile the two Mr Chair.   If you go back 
to 21.7 which is on page 702, point 224 Mr Chair such 
evidence makes it clear that Trillian was not McKinsey’s 
sub-contractor, because it was not contemporaneous with 
20 
the information that exist. 
 
Mr Chair I took you through the information that 
exist, it is just convenient for McKinsey to now state that it 
was Regiments that was doing the work at the time.   There 
is no ambiguity in my view and I do not believe that 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 70 of 240 
 
McKinsey can claim ambiguity.    
 
If anything Mr Chair if you look at the process that 
letter went through for it to be issued, and if McKinsey 
distance itself from that letter now we should be asking the 
question who actually committed fraud. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Seleka there may be different 
points that need to be looked into with regard to the 
Corporate Plan, Trillian, Regiments, McKinsey, Eskom and 
the payment that was made but on the face of it if 
McKinsey gave Eskom a letter that said you may pay our 
10 
sub-contractor, Trillian, directly on the face of it Trillian 
can’t say McKinsey – I mean Eskom should not have paid 
except insofar as they say we did say Eskom could pay 
Trillian directly but we said if certain conditions were met 
and Eskom was  not supposed to pay Trillian directly those 
conditions were not met, so that – the latter point I 
understand.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think that to the extent that there 
may be the question of – to the extent that the letter of 9 
20 
February may be seen as relevant to the question whether 
Eskom should have paid Trillian directly, even assuming 
Trillian was McKinsey’s sub-contractor the real question, it 
seems to me, would be whether Eskom ensured that the 
conditions that McKinsey said should be met before Eskom 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 71 of 240 
 
could pay Trillian directly were met. 
 
So that is – that is how I see, if there are other 
points one can take it from there.   You have indicated that 
you don’t have personal knowledge of whether those 
conditions were met or not by the time Eskom made the 
payment.   Maybe somebody else would tell us whether 
they were met.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair if I may, before we take the 
lunch adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think Mr Singh to add to what the 
Chairperson is saying the other factor I think Chair to be 
looked at is the fact that the letter doesn’t appear to have 
come voluntarily from McKinsey, in the sense of it did not 
come without a prior request, it came on the basis of a 
prior request from Eskom and Trillian, and you may want to 
answer the question Mr Singh why did Eskom make that 
request to McKinsey.   Could you, ja? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
20 
MR SINGH:   I will just ask Mr Seleka to repeat the 
question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the question is you made the point 
earlier when you gave the background or the context of the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 72 of 240 
 
letter of demand, that Eskom and Trillian asked McKinsey 
to provide the letter, as I recall what you said, and Mr 
Seleka’s question is why did Eskom ask for the letter?  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I was not the guy – I was not the 
person that requested the letter but I would assume that 
the letter was requested as Trillian has indicated that 
Eskom required confirmation that the main contractor was 
happy that the sub-contractor would be paid directly in 
terms of the content of the letter, and if you look at the 
emails that were attached to it and Mr Amankwah’s 
10 
confirmation that could only be the reason for the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, yes, well I – Mr Seleka you 
can look at it and then pursue what you believe needs to 
be pursued.  On the face of it I would imagine that if 
Eskom did not have a contract with Trillian and Trillian was 
supposed to have been McKinsey’s sub-contractor Trillian 
should look to McKinsey for payment and not to Eskom, 
and if Trillian approached Eskom to say please pay us 
directly Eskom if it was thinking about agreeing to that first 
would have been acting prudently to say the least, let us 
20 
see whether McKinsey, with whom we have a contract, has 
any problem with that, in which case we would like to have 
something in writing so when one looks at it in that way 
one can understand but it may well be, and you would know 
better, it may well be that there are other issues that you 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 73 of 240 
 
want to explore in relation to that first, so I just mention 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Chair, let’s finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but we should take the lunch 
adjournment now, I just want to say I am keen for us to 
move away from the Corporate Plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have already spent a lot of time last 
time on it, but obviously if there are passages and 
affidavits that are important or documents and so on it may 
10 
be important that at least we place on record which 
documents or which paragraphs and which affidavits I must 
have regard to when I come to deal with this matter, so 
that I can go to those documents, go to those passages in 
– when I consider the matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am just saying I am keen that we 
move away to go and deal with other matters but if when 
we come back somebody feels strongly that there is 
something that needs to be mentioned other than saying 
20 
Chairperson 
when 
you 
deal 
with 
this 
matter 
please 
remember to look at that paragraph and that affidavit and 
that 
document, 
then 
let 
me 
know, 
otherwise 
in 
the 
afternoon we could just do that exercise and move on to 
something else. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 74 of 240 
 
 
Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will adjourn now, it is ten past one, 
we will resume at ten past two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS   
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson 
Mr Anoj Singh and his team wanted us to emphasise 
something that Mr Singh said during the testimony about Dr 
Weiss, that in his transcript when he was asked whether it 
was – well the question is: 
“If it was Regiments that rendered services in 
respect of the Corporate Plan, and not Trillian.” 
Asked by the Evidence Leader, his response was: 
“That Chairperson I wish I could give you a razor 
sharp answer to that question, but I cannot.” 
20 
It is to emphasise that Mr Singh in saying to you earlier 
that Dr Weiss did not have a clear answer to that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but from his affidavit I was making 
a different point. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 75 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   About who McKinsey intended to be 
the supplier development partner and that it was in respect 
of the corporate plan, I mean the turnaround program 
based on that paragraph of Mr Singh’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright is there a particular page 
in the transcript where we will find Dr Weiss answer that 
you have just told me about, if that could be mentioned on 
record so one can know where to find it in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is right. 
10 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson on – I do not know 
where exactly it is in the – they are just going to show me 
on the bundle itself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   So it is in the transcript on page 29 
of 
the 
day 
323 
approximately, 
line 
eight, 
Advocate 
Chaskalson asked it, and am I correct Justice that the 
supply development work that was done on that Corporate 
Plan was work that was done by Regiments not Trillian, Dr 
Weiss answers: 
20 
“Chair, I would love to give you a razor sharp 
answer onto this question, I am afraid I cannot.  I 
can just tell you what I experienced back at the 
time.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 76 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just give the date please? 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   It is on the 11 t h of December of 
2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:   11 of December of 2020? 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Yes, as I said it is day 323 of the 
transcripts.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine.  
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Singh, I am 
going to move on.  Thank you, Chair, the - Chair I am going 
10 
to move on to the Master Services Agreement, which is this 
Corporate Plan, and I start off by the paragraph Mr Singh 
in Dr Weiss’s affidavit paragraph 29 and 30. 
MR SINGH:   What page sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 9 of the bundle B or C? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom bundle 14 (c), page number 
690. 
CHAIRPERSON:   390? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Six, nine, zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Six, nine, zero? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, paragraph 29 and 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we read it previously but just to 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 77 of 240 
 
recap and then we move forward.  The paragraph 29 reads: 
“With the letter of acceptance in place, we had a 
signed agreement between Eskom and McKinsey, 
and we began work on the turnaround program in 
January 2016.  At the same time, we continue to 
work to finalise the Services Level Agreement 
despite McKinsey’s efforts Eskom delayed signing 
the SLA. I eventually received a signed SLA from 
Eskom in late September or early October 2016 by 
then Eskom had terminated the turnaround program 
10 
and had compensated McKinsey for our work.  At 
that time, I did not expect that McKinsey would 
receive any additional compensation from Eskom.” 
Paragraph 30: 
“The SLA that I received was signed on behalf of 
Eskom as of January 7, 2016 after consulting with 
in House Counsel regarding the SLA, I signed the 
SLA on behalf of McKinsey as of January 11, 2016, 
which was the approximate date that McKinsey 
began to work on the project. I understood that 
20 
Eskom’s preference was that the SLA be signed as 
of the effective date, which was the date that we 
began work, I regret any confusion that this may 
have caused.” 
So the SLA is the same as the MSA, Mr Singh, is that 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 78 of 240 
 
correct?  
MR SINGH:   It was used interchangeably, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
MR SINGH:   I said it was used interchangeably. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Interchangeably, yes.  So from these 
two paragraphs…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair, if I just can clarify that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just Say that again? 
MR SINGH:   I said, if I can also just clarify that point.  It 
would seem that at some point in time, between Eskom and 
10 
McKinsey, they had contemplated concluding a Master 
Services Agreement which is the MSA and additionally, 
SLA’s or Service Level Agreements.  So there would be an 
overarching Master Services Agreement and then basically 
underpinning the Master Service Agreement, there will be 
these individual Service Level Agreements, from what I 
understand, but eventually it migrated into the SLA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the MSA, would be like an instrument 
that would broadly regulate the relationship between the 
two. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there would be under a specific 
agreement relating to specific matters. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, matters, as I understood it, but I do not 
think it actually…[intervene] 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 79 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Went that way. 
MR SINGH:   Went that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   And that enhanced the interchangeable use 
of MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, I am going into approaches this 
with Mr Singh from what we read in here is that there was 
a delay on the part of Eskom in signing that Service Level 
Agreement, that agreement.  He then ultimately receives 
10 
the signed copy in late September 2016 or early October 
2016 and when he signs it, he gives it a date of 11 January 
2016. The signing of it at the very latest, maybe September 
or earliest maybe September the latest October 2016.  But 
then, he says: 
“By that time Eskom had already terminated the 
turnaround program.” 
And from the evidence in this affidavit, in Mr Amankwah’s  
affidavit and from Mr Mabelane’s affidavit, that termination 
was by letter, dated 16 June 2016.  So on the evidence, it 
20 
appears that before this agreement could even have been 
concluded, it was terminated.  Your comment on that?  
MR SINGH:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, I think in 
responding, I would, in the interest of time, not want to 
traverse the whole issue of the 1034 document which I 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 80 of 240 
 
think you and Mr Koko and Mr Seleka has traversed quite 
significantly 
in 
Mr 
Koko’s 
last 
appearance 
at 
the 
Commission.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, as long as you do not feel that that 
is unfair on your part. 
MR SINGH:   No, no I mean, at the end of the day, it was 
what I had started in my previous sessions and I think it 
was further amplified by Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
MR SINGH:   And hence, in the interest of time, I will not 
10 
repeat that but it also does form part of our affidavit that 
we have submitted into the record or it will be submitted 
into the record as of today.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine. 
MR SINGH:   So from that perspective, the sentiments are 
alike. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   So in response to Mr Seleka’s question about 
an agreement not being in place, in terms of the 1034 
document, there is a legally binding commitment between 
20 
Eskom and McKinsey on signing of this, and that was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to remind me when you say that is 
that reliance on the correspondence that was exchanged? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A formal agreement? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 81 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Remember, there was a letter of acceptance 
that was signed by McKinsey and Eskom dated 6 t h 
December 2015.  So that creates the legal obligation 
between Eskom and McKinsey, as of December and that is 
the basis on which they begin work in January, based on 
the temporary order, so that's the first response. 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, maybe just to assist 
on the affidavit that we brought today.  It is annexure AS3, 
we took the liberty of attaching it for you with the front 
page and the relevant provision that deals with it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  I do not believe I 
have the affidavit in front of me as yet. So that is fine.  So, 
but my question, Mr Singh was this.  When you say there 
was an agreement whether you mean, there was already a 
formal agreement, as we know it, or whether you were 
saying there was an agreement because there was an 
offer, that is the clarification I was looking for. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I am saying there was an offer an 
acceptance therefore there was an agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   An agreement, based on the offer and 
20 
acceptance. 
MR SINGH:   Based on the offer, which was a letter that 
was sent on the 6 t h of December, so, it is the first part of 
the response. 
Mr Chair then he - then if you look at the next part 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 82 of 240 
 
of paragraph 29 – and actually Mr Weiss concedes that the 
letter of acceptance was binding on Eskom comment. He 
then says: 
“Despite McKinsey's efforts, Eskom delayed the 
signing and I eventually received the signed SLA 
from Eskom in late September or early October 
2016, by then Eskom had terminated the turnaround 
program and had compensated McKinsey for our 
work.” 
But let us deal with each one of them.  So, Mr Chair in 
10 
dealing with it, I would have to refer to - let me just check 
if I am right.  Page reference 7, on here, 740 and I hope I 
am right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mentioned the page you are looking 
for is it not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   743, yes I am right sir so in the same 
bundle…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   743, in the bundle 14 (c) that we are 
dealing with? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 743? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes I have got it.  
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair I will come to the letter itself, 
Mr Seleka is correct in that the MSA was terminated via a 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 83 of 240 
 
BTC resolution, a Board Tender Committee resolution and 
that then empowered Mr Mabelane to inform McKinsey of 
the termination via a letter, the letter that was dated 16 
June 2016.  
Subsequent to that, Mr Chair, there were various 
letters that were exchanged between Mr Mabelane and Dr 
Weiss regarding the termination between, let us say, the 
16 t h and the 28 t h, which is the letter in question, which is 
at 743.  
And the letter in question at 743 Mr Chair, is the 
10 
final letter but our affidavit that we have submitted this 
morning covers the other letters that transpired before 
them.  But for the purposes of now, let us just cover the 
issue relating to the issues that appear on 743.  Now, if we 
look at 743 it says: 
“Top Consulting Group, MSA reimbursement of 
costs.” 
That is the heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this is a letter from Mr Vikas Sagar 
and Dr Weiss, that is from McKinsey and is addressed to 
20 
Mr Edwin Mabelane, chief procurement officer at Eskom 
and the subject is: 
“Top Consulting Group MSA, re-investment of cost.” 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, take it from there. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 84 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   So you will see or note Mr Chair that the 
letter refers to a previous letter of 24 June 2016, in the 
first four lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the gist of the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can read the relevant part, if you 
want to. 
MR SINGH:   Just in terms of background, the previous 
letters that Mr Mabelane had sent to McKinsey and you will 
see it when you see that, they will deal with it.  But just in 
10 
gist Mr Mabelane terminated the relationship and also in 
his letters referred to the fact that because of the 
termination, Eskom will not reimburse them on a risk basis.  
But he will reimburse them on a cost, on a time and 
material basis let us put it that way and the exchange of 
letters prior to this letter related thereto which culminated 
in this letter.  So, this letter Mr Chair, basically, is 
McKinsey's, let us call it for a want of a better word, 
McKinsey’s letter of demand vis a vis…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   McKinsey’s letter of? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Demand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:    In inverted commas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Vis a vis it is the termination of the Masters 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 85 of 240 
 
Service Level Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, I will read the most relevant 
parts. It says: 
“We are very surprised that Eskom is of the opinion 
that 
the 
cost 
base 
settlement 
is 
a 
prudent 
mechanism to conclude a risk based MSA with 
McKinsey, we have put 100% of our consulting fees 
at risk and have since six months not received a 
single payment to cover the risk taken.” 
10 
Now six months referring back to December 2015 being the 
signing of the letter of acceptance: 
“We have virtually an army of consultants working 
across the business at significant cost. This effort 
has yielded significant results for Eskom and we 
have delivered and generated impact far exceeding 
R25billion to date.  You will recognise that we 
dedicated a team for six months starting on 6/12/ 
2015.” 
Which is the letter of acceptance date: 
20 
“To negotiate the Master Service Agreement that we 
finally concluded in January 2016.  This agreement 
clearly outlines how McKinsey will be reimbursed, 
including in the case of termination.” 
And then they go through each termination clause.  If you 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 86 of 240 
 
would like I would read them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Only if it is necessary for the point you 
wanted to make. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the point that I would like to make 
is that if you take this letter, which is dated June 28, 2016.  
It is difficult to understand how Mr Weiss in paragraph 30 
refers to a date in September when these things are 
concluded 
yet 
he 
is 
signing 
a 
letter 
in 
June, 
that 
references a January date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say there is a contradiction.  
10 
MR SINGH:   What I am saying either one of these things 
are not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, one of them is not true, you say? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, and I am saying this ostensibly is a 
letter that we received again, I am saying in good faith 
from McKinsey based on the facts that exist as an existing 
yet again for matter of convenience or I am not too sure 
what motivates Mr Weiss to say he signed in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the point you are making is there is 
talk of a termination mid-year 2016. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of Dr Weiss’s affidavits he 
said he signed the agreement late in the year. 
MR SINGH:   In October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But backdated it because he believed 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 87 of 240 
 
that is what Eskom preferred, is that right? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think what I am trying to say is the 
date on which Mr Weiss backdate or the date on which Mr 
Weiss asserts or alleges to have backdated the agreement 
in October, I am saying it cannot be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Because he signed a letter that references 
the January in June, right. So there must have existed an 
agreement signed on the date of this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I think I understood you, your 
10 
point clearly, ja.  You sought to say, how could he be 
signing the agreement in October when already mid-year 
20 in June, he is talking about the January with the same 
agreement. 
MR SINGH:   With the January date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, with the January date. 
MR SINGH:   Which he alleges he inserted in October.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying that if he is right, in 
saying he signed the agreement in October and backdated 
it to January…[intervene] 
20 
MR SINGH:   This letter would not have reference to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …he would not have – there would not 
have been talk of a termination of an agreement in June.  
MR SINGH:   With a date that references January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is - well, I am not sure if I 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 88 of 240 
 
understand 
your 
emphasis 
on 
the 
date 
in 
January, 
because…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, what I am saying…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   …my understanding, just hang on one 
sec.  If he is right, that is I think the point you are making.  
If he is right, that he only signed the agreement in October, 
then that means as at June, there was no agreement. 
There is therefore nobody could talk about the termination 
of an agreement that did not exist in June.  
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And I am using the date of January to come 
to the conclusion you have come to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, although I do not follow your part of 
referring to that once you accept…[intervene] 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second - just because whether 
the date was May or whatever, as long as in June, he had 
not signed, there was no agreement to terminate. 
MR SINGH:  But my point Mr Chair is that he alleges that 
20 
he signed the agreement in October and backdated it with 
a date of January, in October, okay, yet in June, there is a 
letter that is signed by him.   
That references the very same agreement that he 
says he only signed in October and backdated it to 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 89 of 240 
 
January.  I am saying when he drafted this letter in June, 
how would he have known the date of January if he only 
signed it in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, I think I am not sure that your 
emphasis in January makes much difference but I think the 
importance of your point, as I have said is on his version if 
he signed in October, then there was no agreement in 
June, and if there is no agreement in June, how could he 
be writing this letter. 
MR SINGH:   Correct, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Counsel, you are done? 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, I just wanted to - I 
think the points that my clients trying to make specifically 
refers to paragraph 2 of the letter.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Where he states emphatically that 
the agreement, finally was concluded in January of 2016.  
So his status as a fact that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay no then that is different, jag 
that different, ja.  Then you are not - your reliance should 
20 
not be about backdating.  
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Your reliance should be about what he 
says here. 
MR SINGH:   Here, yes. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 90 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay no that is fine. 
MR SINGH:   So I am saying in here Mr Chair instead 
of…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What he says in his affidavit, when he 
says he signed the agreement in October, is contradicted 
by what he says here when he says the agreement was 
concluded in January 2016 taking in June. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because in June, if he had not signed 
the agreement yet, on his version, he could not talk about 
10 
the agreement having been concluded in January.  
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright Mr Seleka. 
MR SINGH:   I…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you were still making – continuing. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So those are the first two responses to Mr 
Seleka’s question relating to the fact that it would seem on 
McKinsey's 
version, 
that 
a 
MSA 
did 
not 
exist 
the 
20 
termination, 16 June and I am saying another point to 
consider coming back to the issue that McKinsey is a 
global company.  
Mr Chair, again, if you look at the testimony of Dr 
Weiss, Mr Amankwah, Mr Mieszala, Dr Fine I think those 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 91 of 240 
 
were the guys that testified from McKinsey.  And not maybe 
not too much, Mr Fine but certainly the other three.   
They go on record and state the extent to which - 
and even this letter goes out and states it, the extent to 
which McKinsey was taking risk, not only relating to the 
fact that there was no signed contract, or no signed SLA on 
the fact of the magnitude of the project being 100% risk in 
terms of a MSA, zero success, zero payment.  
Now, imagine in a firm such as McKinsey, you go 
and take undertake this project.  You do not have 
10 
according to them; you do not have a signed agreement in 
place.  And all of a sudden the client gives you a 
termination – even the exposure that they had taken Mr 
Chair, 
in 
my 
considered 
unprofessional, 
if 
it's 
inconceivable that this thing would have not triggered 
alarm bells from the people that were sitting at Eskom right 
through 
to 
someone 
in 
Globe 
because 
of 
the 
size, 
magnitude and risk relating to the standard.  So my view 
would be that when this termination letter landed at Eskom 
or was given to Dr Weiss, Dr Weiss’s first reaction would 
20 
have been to take it to legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Taken to? 
MR SINGH:   Take it to legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And say, listen, we have got this termination 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 92 of 240 
 
thing, this termination letter from Eskom.  It is our biggest 
project in Africa, and it is now been terminated.  
The legal guy’s response to Dr Weiss would have 
been to say, fine, bring me the agreement, because what is 
the legal guy going to do if there is no agreement?  So it 
cannot be, in my view that when this termination notice 
was served that everyone in McKinsey, just left Dr Weiss in 
his little corner to do as he pleased with this significant 
exposure that McKinsey had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess, also, you may be making the 
10 
point in due course if you are not already making it, that it 
looks like this is at least the second letter from McKinsey 
where they write one thing in correspondence but in 
affidavits seems to say something that contradicts what 
they have written in correspondence.  
MR SINGH:   It is completely different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because there was the letter of the 
9 t h…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …of February that we are talking about.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Except, insofar as with regard to the 
letter of the 9 t h of February, insofar as they may have said 
our authorisation or agreement that you may pay as Eskom 
you may and direct subject to the fulfilment of this 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 93 of 240 
 
condition.  
 
Except for that there are other things in that letter, 
which you say they seem to want to deny or run away from 
in the affidavit.   
MR SINGH:    That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
you 
say 
certainly 
here 
the 
correspondence of the time says one thing, but in affidavits 
that they have signed subsequently they seek to say 
something else, is that right? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR SINGH:   And, and again Mr Chair, I mean, at the end 
of the day, if you look at this letter, there is no way that 
McKinsey would send us a letter like this if it had not gone 
through 
corporate 
legal 
within 
McKinsey 
itself. 
And 
basically, they are here saying that they request that 
Eskom basically applies the termination clauses, which will 
give rise to the claim of R2.8billion that they would claim 
under the MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, if McKinsey received a letter 
20 
from Eskom that brought them to terminate an agreement 
and if they - that is now on 24 June 2016 and if they did not 
know that there was an agreement between them and Eskom 
on the particular subject they would have said what are you 
talking about? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 94 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not have an agreement yet. 
MR SINGH:  Or they would have said if Dr Weiss’ version is 
correct they would have said we understand that these 
things are not concluded – they are not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  They are not – can we find a suitable way to 
conclude these things an arbitration or an investigation or 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but certainly they would not receive a 
10 
letter saying we – we are terminating an agreement and they 
thought there was no agreement but respond as if there was 
an agreement. 
MR SINGH:  Was an agreement – exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am assuming Mr – Mr Singh you 
have completed or you still have some points to make? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair if – if Mr Seleka wants me to 
cover the other aspects of the paragraph I can do that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think you should – you should cover 
yourself by making sure you have responded to everything 
that you need to respond to. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Seleka that page and the reference 
again? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 95 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You want the reference to the paragraph? 
MR SINGH:  690ne? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  29 and 30. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  So Mr Chair to go back to paragraph – 
page number – page reference 690. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
MR SINGH:  690. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  If we then look at the second last sentence of 
that paragraph Mr Chair which reads: 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph. 
MR SINGH:   
“By then.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 30 – paragraph 29? 
MR SINGH:  Oh sorry paragraph 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  It says second last sentence.  It says: 
“By then” 
Are you there Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am at paragraph 29 I am just looking for 
20 
– yes I can see “by then”. 
MR SINGH:  It says: 
“By 
then 
Eskom 
had 
terminated 
the 
turnaround programme and had compensated 
McKinsey for our work.” 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 96 of 240 
 
 
So Mr Chair again if Mr – Dr Weiss – actually Mr 
Weiss is factually correct.  We had terminated the agreement 
and we had paid them because he is referring to a date of 
October in this affidavit and the first payment we had made 
to McKinsey under the MSA if my – if I recall correctly was 
sometime in August.  So we had terminated and we had paid.   
 
But the important point Mr Chair is if you look at all 
of the correspondence whether it be any of the affidavits 
from Dr Weiss – well Mr Weiss – Dr Weiss refers to it but he 
does not explicitly refer to the point that I am going to make. 
10 
 
Mr – Dr – M Mzala refers to it but also does not 
explicitly refer – Mr Amankwah does not refer to it at all. 
 
In the court papers between Eskom, McKinsey and 
Trillian they do not also raise this point.  And the point that I 
am trying to raise if now Mr – Dr Weiss is referring to the 
fact that there was no contract then equally just like Trillian 
was paid without a contract McKinsey then was paid without 
a contract for the August payment.  Yet no-one in any of the 
legal documents seems to rely on the fact that McKinsey was 
paid without a contract and therefore they should refund the 
20 
money.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja no I mean if you say in August 
McKinsey was paid in regard to this work and – and Dr Weiss 
says the agreement was only signed by McKinsey in October 
it means in August when they were paid there was no 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 97 of 240 
 
agreement.  That is what it would mean and that is the point 
you making. 
MR SINGH:  That I am making. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  And nowhere does anyone rely on that specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is – what is the implication of the fact 
that in that sentence that you have just read Mr Singh Dr 
Weiss 
talks 
about 
the 
termination 
of 
the 
turnaround 
programme as opposed to the termination of the agreement.  
Is there – is he using those terms interchangeably? 
10 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
Mr 
Chair 
I 
think 
he 
is 
using 
them 
interchangeably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then as … 
MR SINGH:  Chair if I can continue? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No can I just comment on this one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because I think he is not necessarily 
using them interchangeably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is because the turnaround programme 
Chairperson was going to be rendered pursuant to the SLA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So I think he is using it deliberately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 98 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To distinguish between the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because on his version in the affidavit 
this – the SLA had not been concluded.  So what got to be 
terminated was their services as rendered in terms of the 
turnaround programme.  Because he does say they had 
already started rendering services.   
 
So I think it is a deliberate use of words or choice of 
words there Mr Singh. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson with the greatest of 
10 
respect to my learned friend if you look at the letters it is 
specifically refers to the MSA.  Now my client has alluded to 
the fact that there is other letters that precedes this. We 
have attached them to our current agreement but they all 
consistently refer to the MSA so there can be no doubt that 
they did – they are referring… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Not to a programme but to an 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay let Mr Singh be the one to deal 
20 
with that. Mr Singh what do you say to Mr Seleka’s 
proposition that Dr Weiss is deliberately talking about the 
termination of the turnaround programme here because he 
knows that there is no agreement at that stage. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair … 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 99 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course I see that in the previous 
sentence he – he talks about October 2016 and then in the – 
he then says by then which must mean by October 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair sorry Mr Singh.  Look at how he 
starts paragraph 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He says: 
“With the letter of acceptance in place we 
10 
had signed an agreement between Eskom 
and McKinsey and we began work on the 
turnaround programme in January 2016.” 
He says: 
“At the same time” 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he talks about there.  Which was – 
which agreement is he talking about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your understanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is this acceptance and I suppose it is 
20 
the acceptance but because I want to – you will see how he 
deals with it in the second paragraph – I mean not paragraph 
but sentence.  He says: 
“At the same time we continued to work to 
finalise the services level agreement.” 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 100 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which agreement is he talking about in 
the first line of paragraph 29 that he says: 
“Had been signed.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  According to my understanding he 
is specifically referring to as Mr Singh is saying to the 
Chairperson the letter of acceptance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But you – you – he would not – the 
reference to signing an agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Contemplates as I understand it where 
10 
there would be a single document that has been signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to an agreement that is 
constituted by the sending of an offer and the sending of an 
acceptance which are signed separately. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if that understanding is correct what 
agreement was he talking about in the first line? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct.  I will – I mean one will 
have to see whether they canvass this with him during his 
20 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When he was here on the 11 th of 
December 2020 Chair and how it was dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Mr 
Singh 
what 
would 
be 
your 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 101 of 240 
 
understanding of what agreement he is talking about in the 
first line of paragraph 29 when he says: 
“With the letter of acceptance in place we 
had signed agreement between Eskom and 
McKinsey 
and 
we 
began 
work 
on 
the 
turnaround programme in January 2016.” 
 
The letter of acceptance would have been – just 
remind me Mr Singh the letter of acceptance would have 
come from – from Eskom? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would have been sent to McKinsey? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when it was – it did have play – two 
places for signature. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By McKinsey and by Eskom.  Okay if it had 
that then one could talk about an agreement being signed.  
Maybe one could talk because it is – it is a single document, 
it is signed by both sides – both parties and it may well be 
that Mr Seleka is right in his understanding that the 
20 
agreement that he is talking about there is the agreement as 
constituted by the offer and acceptance.  You would go along 
with that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay at least that part I 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 102 of 240 
 
understand.  Okay I think you were still wanting to go on to 
make some points Mr Singh or had you finished? 
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Chair it was just in response to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Seleka’s or I think it was your question Mr 
Chair that the termination is there a distinction between 
terminating the turnaround programme or terminating the 
SMA?  And I said I think it is used interchangeably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja 
MR SINGH:  And I think Mr Seleka then went to … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:  His path to try and explain that is probably not 
used interchangeably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.   
MR SINGH:  In my view Mr Chair it is a moot point if we 
accept that the 28th of June letter could not exist as we have 
just explained it.  So whether he is terminating the 
turnaround programme now in the context of this – of this 
date which is October it is moot point.   
 
Mr Chair in terms of the next sentence where it says: 
20 
“I did not expect that McKinsey would receive 
any additional compensation from Eskom.” 
 
Mr Chair again that is contrary to the actual events 
that transpired because McKinsey then entered into a 
settlement agreement with Eskom dated February 2017 that 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 103 of 240 
 
enabled them to get further payment.  So if this was true Mr 
– Dr Weiss should have not signed the settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  Or engaged with the settlement process that 
started sometime in – well started with this 28t h of June 
letter – well actually started with the 16 June letter and 
ended with the 17 February I think it was settlement 
agreement it was signed between Eskom and McKinsey. 
 
So again I am not too sure why Mr Weiss is stated 
these things but I guess he can – he can explain if need be. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  You did do Mr 00:13:09 as well Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I did. 
MR SINGH:  Again Mr Chair if you will see Dr Weiss qualifies 
in paragraph 30: 
“The fact that the SLA I received was signed 
on behalf of Eskom as of 7 January 2016.”   
That is the first sentence.  And then he says: 
“After 
consulting 
with 
in-house 
counsel 
regarding the SLA I signed the SLA on behalf 
20 
of McKinsey as of January 11, 2016 which is 
the approximate date that McKinsey began 
the work on the project.” 
 
Now again there is reference to in-house legal 
counsel.  Now I cannot believe again that he would refer to 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 104 of 240 
 
in-house legal counsel in October yet he is issued a letter in 
June saying that there was an agreement or concluded an 
agreement.  It would have been more likely that he actually 
engaged with legal – in-house legal in June because that is 
when he actually had the – the – prepared the letter for 
termination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could it be that there is confusion and 
confusion is created by the fact that at a certain level 
McKinsey talks about an agreement had been having been 
signed on the basis of – of an acceptance.  And then talks 
10 
about a formal agreement as I understand it a formal 
agreement not in the context of a – for an offer and 
acceptance but a normal agreement. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I find… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Being signed by McKinsey in October.  Is it 
not two – two transactions or two documents maybe they 
relate to the transaction but first you have an offer and 
acceptance which in law could constitute a contract but then 
there is a desire to have one document that reflects all the 
terms and conditions of the agreement and that process 
20 
comes after the – the signing of the acceptance by both 
parties and that is what comes later but should the situation 
arise where for some reason the formal agreement is not 
signed any one of the parties can still say based on the offer 
and acceptance with details an agreement and this is what I 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 105 of 240 
 
did under that agreement and I should be paid this or that 
and that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair that is the version that McKinsey 
prefer you to accept or to believe.  And I find that very 
difficult to – in my own mind accept it.  And the reason 
therefore is Mr Chair if you look the June letter it does not 
refer to a letter of acceptance.  It refers to a signed MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But you – you have a version that 
also goes along with the idea that once there was an offer 
and acceptance and the signing of the acceptance there was 
10 
an agreement. 
MR SINGH:  No, no I agree Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you agree with that part. 
MR SINGH:  I gave – I agree that there is a two step vote. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:  In terms of Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  There would have been a legally binding 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:  On the acceptance on the signing of the 
acceptance letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  But the point that Mr Seleka is trying to raise or 
he is trying to make is that the date on which there was 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 106 of 240 
 
termination there was termination of a non-existent contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but if – if we were to go along with the 
idea that a contract came about when there was an 
acceptance of an offer then in June there would have been 
an agreement is it not? 
MR SINGH:  Correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why do we not look at whether the 
termination we are talking about that they are talking about 
in that letter of June is – relates to the termination of that 
agreement as constituted by the offer and acceptance? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Let us go there Sir – Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Hm. 
MR SINGH:  It is 743 I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words what I am – in trying to 
establish what really seems to be confusing I want to see 
whether if we follow that line – that approach the whole thing 
does not begin to make sense or not. 
MR SINGH:  Indeed Sir.  So we go to 743 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  743.  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Which is the term – which is the letter of 28 
20 
June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Where is the letter of termination? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson Eskom Bundle 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let us – maybe I just want to look at 
that first. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 107 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 877.26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  877. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja 877.26.  
MR SINGH:  877.26 
ADV SELEKA SC:  877.26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is a letter from Mr Edwin Mabelane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chief Procurement Officer and it is 
10 
addressed to Dr Weiss of McKinsey and Company and it is 
dated 16 June.  Oh this one is dated 16 June 2016 not 24 
but let me see this one.  It is a letter of termination it seems. 
“This letter serves to official notify McKinsey 
and Company of a board decision taken on 9 
June 2016 to terminate the McKinsey Risk 
Based Contract.  You are requested to 
engage with Mr Prish Govender to discuss 
the pertinent issue to give effect to the board 
resolution.  In conclusion Eskom will embark 
20 
on a transparent procurement process to 
reallocate the activities under the Risk Based 
Contract. McKinsey and Company is welcome 
to participate in this process.” 
 
That Risk Based Contract could fall within – I mean 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 108 of 240 
 
the – the contract if there was one that would have come 
about as a result of the offer and acceptance could fall 
within this M – is it not? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if you look at the heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  There is a – it will … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Subject line Chair. 
MR SINGH:  The subject line it says: 
“Termination of Top Consulting Group MSA.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  MSA. 
10 
MR SINGH:  MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is… 
MR SINGH:  So this Risk Based Contract refers to the MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Refers to MSA? 
MR SINGH:  MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So… 
MR SINGH:  Because the – so the MSA… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not what we are looking for is that 
right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No that is the one Chair. 
20 
MR SINGH:  No that is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That we are looking for? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but – okay no, these contracts have 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 109 of 240 
 
got different names. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No look. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one that Dr Weiss says he signed in 
October. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it the MSA or this Service Level 
Agreement. 
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair as I explained originally when we 
started the topic.  The MSA/SLA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was over 00:21:27. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Was usually interchangeable.  But what they 
eventually signed whether it be January or June or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or October or whatever. 
MR SINGH:  October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Was the SLA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SLA? 
MR SINGH:  A SLA was signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  But they interchangeably use it in conversation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they refer to it – ja. 
MR SINGH:  As SLA, MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  MSA. 
MR SINGH:  Risk Based Contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 110 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  But effectively it is there Sir it was signed either 
in January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:   June or October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So on… 
MR SINGH:  And there was in December a letter of 
acceptance that was signed by both McKinsey and Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is December 2015? 
MR SINGH:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair those are the only two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Let us call it Contractual documents that exist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay so the offer and 
acceptance also referred to MSA? 
MR SINGH:  Where is that one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know that correspondence that we 
talked about. 
MR SINGH:  We will find it for you now Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words the subject matter was the 
20 
same. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page – can I give the Chairperson the 
page number? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  811. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 111 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  811. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .111.  I see this – Mr Singh you – you 
might have the signed one by McKinsey.  This one is only 
signed by Mr Adrian Mabelane. 
MR SINGH:  Oh ja – maybe I did sign it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In your annexures. 
MR SINGH:  I think we may have… 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson can we just all get on 
the same page.  I do not know what my learned friend is 
referring to at this stage maybe he can just guide us. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The acceptance letter page 811.111. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Eskom Bundle 14.  Eskom Bundle 
14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got 811 page – you say 112? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No 111. 
CHAIRPERSON:  111? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Singh you are there? 
MR SINGH:    Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You are there? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  That is the letter – that is the 
letter of acceptance.  But where is the part signed by 
McKinsey? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I see in the bundle investigators have 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 112 of 240 
 
this one which is not signed by McKinsey and I was asking 
Mr Singh whether the one which is attached to his affidavit of 
this morning is signed by both parties. 
MR SINGH:  This does not form part of our 00:24:29. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh you do not reference no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay but do we know whether there is a 
letter of acceptance that has the signatures of both parties in 
the same document? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson maybe just for the 
record I do not think for purposes of your discussion it would 
10 
really make a difference if you look at the one that is not 
sighed.  I think what you are interested in is what exactly is 
stated in the letter of acceptance whether it can be 
construed as an agreement or not visa vie the points that 
you raise.  And I think for that purpose you can look at the 
one that is signed by only one party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes but I am now going back to an 
earlier point that I had made remember Mr Singh had said to 
me in response to a question I put to him that the parties 
had signed the same document in terms of letter of 
20 
acceptance and that kind of answered by query.  But if 
factually that is not the case it might revive that concern. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson in fact Dr Weiss 
refers to it.  He says that they have signed the letter of 
acceptance in December of 2015. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 113 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  On the 17 th of December 2015.  As 
I say the – my learned friend might not be able to lay his 
hands on the actual signed one but you can accept it for a 
fact that is what is stated that there was a signed letter of 
acceptance by the same date that they got the offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  They have signed the acceptance 
and that is the 17 th of December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm.  Well maybe somebody will have 
10 
a look and then we can take it from there.  Let us move on in 
the meantime. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair the investigator is checking 
exactly that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The Chairperson’s second point or I think 
Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair you were looking to understand 
whether there was a correlation between the letter of 
acceptance. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the letter of … 
MR SINGH:  Given that it was signed by both parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  Equals an MSA or a SLA. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 114 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Or what was conflicted by that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:  So if you then look at basis of acceptance Mr 
Chair you will see: 
“We accept your proposal for the…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the page of that letter again? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Chair you are now at 811.111. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I have got it yes. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  If you look at – it is addressed to Mr – Dr 
10 
Weiss McKinsey and Company Notification of Acceptance for 
Provision of Consultancy Services Basis of Acceptance. 
“We accept you proposal for the provision of 
consulting 
services 
concerning 
the 
Top 
Engineers Programme on the terms and 
conditions generally agreed in the draft 
contract 
recently 
negotiated 
between 
McKinsey and Eskom.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  You see.  So what you will find Mr Chair as a 
20 
common thing is that whether you refer to MSA or SLA it 
always – it always encapsulates the Top – the Top… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Engineers. 
MR SINGH:  Engineers Programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 115 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  So that is a – that is a thing that will string 
across all of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  So when you go back to your termination letter 
which is at 877.26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  You will see it says: 
“Term 
– 
in 
the 
subject 
line 
it 
says 
Termination of Top Consulting Group which is 
Top Engineers Programme.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  And then it says MSA or it could have said SLA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Which is basically – and then in the – in the 
body text it refers to McKinsey Risk Base Contract which 
again is the other colloquial term. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja MSA. 
MR SINGH:  That we have used – MSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Which was the Risk Base Contract. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So this is what 00:28:16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so going back to one of my earlier 
questions what do you say to my thinking that – thinking that 
the termination of the agreement that both parties Eskom 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 116 of 240 
 
and McKinsey are talking about in June 2016 could be the 
termination of the agreement that came about as a result of 
the acceptance of the offer?  What would you say to that? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair then we – we were then going to page 
reference 743 before you Mr Chair took us to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:  The letter of termination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So I think we have now established that there is 
a link between the letter of acceptance, between the letter of 
10 
termination and now we come to this letter of 28 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Responding to the letter of termination. 
MR SINGH:  Which in essence – which – ja responds to the 
letter of termination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  And this I think will be able to answer your 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:  As to whether it is one or both or where does it 
lie? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am there what do you say about it? 
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair if you look at the second paragraph 
it says: 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 117 of 240 
 
“You will recognise that we dedicated a team 
for a period of six months starting on 6.12 to 
negotiate the Master Service Agreement that 
was finally concluded in January.” 
So basically one of the two must be false. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he might, at that stage, have said 
so but with all the discussions, he might have made up his 
mind which one is false.  [laughs]  Mr Singh, have you 
made up your mind which one is false or not yet? 
MR SINGH:   [laughs]  Mr Chair, as you quite correctly 
10 
concluded, Mr Chair, it would seem that, for the sake of 
convenience, McKinsey moves between versions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of affidavit – when it is required to 
commit to an affidavit versus what was committed on 
evidence during the previous time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But Mr Seleka says, earlier on you 
were not sure which one is false of the two versions 
...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, on objective evidence 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says he thinks you are now 
saying there is a particular one that is false. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I just want you to clarify. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 118 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, on objective evidence, as I have 
said. If you look at the letter and if you look at the 
contents of paragraph 29, I am saying this is blatantly 
false.  If you look – and I have said it, not only in terms of 
the termination, but also to the fact that Mr Weiss says he 
did not expect any other compensation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Yet he then receives compensation and he 
signs the termination agreement ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but Mr Singh, if you are not sure 
10 
yet whether you are choosing which version is false, you 
do not have to say so now. 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Seleka just wanted to have 
clarification and I wanted to have clarification too. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether you have reached the point 
where you say this is the false version or you say:  Look, I 
am not sure yet but one of them is false. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that where you are Mr Singh?  One of 
them false.  You are not sure which one? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I am saying that I believe that 
this one is, based on what I have read in the letter 
...[intervenes]  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 119 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...this does not make sense to me and this 
should be false.  It is false. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the version that he signed in 
October? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is false? 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
Because 
I 
do 
not 
find 
any 
other 
correspondence, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   That either exist in Eskom or exist in all of 
the 
plethora 
of 
pages 
that 
we 
have 
gone 
through 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...that refers to a contract that was signed in 
October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   October, ja. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Mabelane who is the subject matter of 
signing this document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR SINGH:   ...also does not refer to a date in his 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Relating to where he has signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 120 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   But based on the letters that he has received, 
Mr Chair, because if Mabelane received this letter and if he 
was of the view that there was no signed agreement.  
Again, he would have said that there was no signed 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is fine. 
MR SINGH:   So why he is lying on a termination clause. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not motivate further because you 
10 
have covered the ground. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had completed the points that you 
wanted to make, Mr Singh, or had you not? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
In 
response 
to 
Mr 
Seleka’s 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   I mean, just the last point in terms of the fact 
20 
that, again, as you have said, McKinsey moves through 
these issues and they are critical issues.  Yet they write it 
off as confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   Mister – Dr Weiss in his last sentence in 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 121 of 240 
 
paragraph 30, it says: 
“I 
regret 
any 
confusion 
that 
may 
have 
caused...” 
 
Yet it is a fundamental issue that causes great 
anxiety and reputational damage and everything to people 
and yet we write it off to confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chairperson, just to 
envisage the point.  I think when you – as you follow the 
trial 
of 
documentation. 
 
The 
acceptance 
letter 
is 
10 
17 December 2015.  And apparently it was counter signed 
by the parties on that date.  What Mr Singh has said in his 
affidavit is that the Service Level Agreement/MSA was 
concluded in January 2016.   
 
This letter from Dr Weiss says the same.   
“In January 2016, in negotiate the Master 
Services Agreement that we finally concluded 
in January 2016...” 
 
Now this is a letter of demand, Mr Singh, by 
McKinsey.  When he, Dr Weiss, puts the facts in the 
20 
affidavit, he explains how he signed the Master Services 
Agreement or when he signed it.  Now I want to take you to 
your own letter because the operative date here or month 
is June 2016.   
 
Remember, we showed you your letter of the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 122 of 240 
 
19 t h  of February 2016, last time on your appearance, 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, I want to go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  Before you go 
there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please do not forget what you want to 
deal with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just remembered.  There is something 
10 
that I need it to be cleared.  You remember when we went 
to the letter of acceptance? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, to the letter of termination.  I was – I 
had asked for the letter dated 24 June 2016 because in 
McKinsey’s letter of 28 June 2016, which is at page 743, 
they say many thanks for the letter dated 24 June 2016.  
But you said I would find that letter at whatever page you 
said 
but 
that 
letter 
was 
dated 
16 
June 
and 
not 
24 June 2016 and yet you said that was the letter of 
20 
termination.   
 
So I want to raise the question.  What is the 
story between – is there a letter dated 24 June 2016 or 
was that an error. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I think I was not answering your 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 123 of 240 
 
question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   In so far as it relates to the 24 t h. 
MR SINGH:   If I can just add clarity, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   You – the letter on 743 does refer to the 
letter of 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   The 24 June letter does exist. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...not in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But it is part of our new evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is it the termination letter? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   It – Mr Chair, if you recall when I introduce 
the subject, I said Mr Mabelane correctly did terminate the 
MSA through a letter dated 16 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR SINGH:   He then sends subsequent letters between 16 
and 28(?) June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR SINGH:   And there are three letters, I think 
...[intervenes]  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 124 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   That followed the same train of thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the fact that Eskom has 
terminated ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...and we are reimbursing you on a cost 
basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Not on a ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   ...risk basis.  So the others, really, just 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So the termination letter is the one who 
is dated 16 June. 
MR SINGH:   16, Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
there 
was 
subsequent 
correspondence, one of which is the letter of 24 June. 
MR SINGH:   24 June, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is more about ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR SINGH:   The basis of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...matter ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   ...the basis of settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Okay.  Now I understand. 
MR SINGH:   So now one disputed this. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 125 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   No one disputed the termination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Okay Mr Seleka, I think that 
has been cleared for. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Mr Singh for that clarity.  So 
Mr Sing, then, talking about this date of January 2016 
being the conclusion date and looking at Dr Weiss’ 
affidavit.  The last time we accepted to the bundle your 
10 
letter dated 19 February 2016 which we marked – we 
paginated as 877.156.  So it will be the – at the very end 
of Eskom Bundle 14(c), Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   877.156.   
CHAIRPERSON:   what is the bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the one I have will not have page 
77.  You said page 77? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 77 ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, it will not have.  So it must be B 
because I have C. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It might be D. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it B? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It might be D. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 126 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   D? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, D. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, should not be D...  Are the numbers 
not going up? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because this is C and it does not have 5 
– page 500...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   877. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry.  Maybe it does.  I am 
sorry.  No, no 77 it will not because it starts at six-hundred 
10 
and something.  That is for 1-14-c. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you are saying Bundle 14, page 77 
it must be another bundle and it should be Bundle A, I 
would imagine.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, you have the numbers in 
reverse order.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I have in front of me Eskom Bundle 
14(c). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, go to the very last – at the end of 
20 
it, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the end of...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of that very same bundle, Eskom 
14(c). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must go to the end? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 127 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the very end of it.  877. 
CHAIRPERSON:   877? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I have been saying 77 and you 
did not say no.  You said 877.  That is why I am saying it 
must be an earlier bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you said 77. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, no.  I thought you heard me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I say... 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  It is eight ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why I was saying it has to be 
earlier than Bundle C. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Sorry, I thought ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   877. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   877. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  What, point what or only that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point 156.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   156.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not have it there? 
20 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now why is this page not marked, 
paginated? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is – the last page is 877.155. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 128 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there is a document that comes 
after that, Exhibit U-33.1 but it is not paginated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And that the last document.  So it must 
have been slotted in at some stage but your team – you 
should have made sure they have paginated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That in fact Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it the Eskom’s formal request for 
information? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson.  It should have 
been formally – the bundle should have been formally 
updated, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Will you make sure that it is done after 
we have adjourned? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I noted that a message has been 
sent already Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay, okay.  I am – have you got it 
Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, not in the Reference Bundle but I 
20 
have ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
you 
have 
got 
it 
somewhere 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   I have got a copy that Mr Seleka has given 
us, yes.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 129 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Just make sure, Mr Seleka, that 
in mine and the witness’s one, as well as, of course, yours 
that we all have the same thing paginated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes.  Yes, and the Chairperson had 
requested that the first page be separated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that you have two – the front is 
enlarged to have two of these sheets in two pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Chair I have made the request.  
10 
Let me... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me move on.  Mr Singh, in this 
letter we – we have traversed this letter of 19 February 
2016 the last time.  The essence ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This is a letter from Mr Anoj Singh, CFO 
of Eskom addressed to Dr Alexander Weiss of McKinsey & 
Company dated 19 February 2016 and the subject is Top 
Consultant Programme, Risk Based Contract Proposal and 
Negotiations. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it says: 
“In relation to the above, Eskom requests a 
formal response and the following items. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 130 of 240 
 
Eskom understands that they intend to be 
partner 
to 
McKinsey, 
this 
Regiments 
Group(?)...” 
 
Ja, Mr Singh, that itself speaks volumes, that 
you would have said so in this letter in respect of the MSA.   
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
“We also further note that Regiments Group is 
in a process of transition and that ultimate 
BEE partner would be Trillian Group. 
10 
Eskom would like McKinsey to provide a 
response relating to an article published on 
page 9 of the Financial Mail, February 18 to 
February 24 regarding allegations associated 
with Mr Mohammed Bogart, a former employee 
of Regiments Group...” 
 
Second bullet point: 
“Further 
to 
the 
above, 
Eskom 
seeks 
a 
response to key issues raised by myself at a 
meeting with McKinsey that took place on 
20 
9 February 2016, relating to the objectives of 
the above-mentioned proposed contract. 
The issues are as follows...” 
 
And the issues are listed there Chairperson, one 
to six. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 131 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I will not read it.  I will go to what 
should be the next page, the last paragraph.  It says: 
“Your urgent response within seven days on 
the above issues will be appreciated. 
The 
signing 
of 
the 
proposed 
contract 
is 
contingent upon the receipt of satisfactory 
responses to the above request...” 
 
And so Mr Singh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  [laughs]  Mr Singh, these 
10 
documents and letters and emails that you and McKinsey 
and them were writing are confusing.  [laughs]   
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were just saying that the agreement 
was concluded in February. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In January but now in February – on 
February 19, you are still talking about the agreement still 
to be signed. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair if I can add some ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not add confusion, please. 
MR SINGH:   No, no confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You give clarification? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 132 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Chair.  If you recall, Mr Chair, when I 
was traversing this issue of when exactly was the, let us 
call it the SLA, signed because that is the document that 
was eventually signed.  I said it was either signed in 
January for the date or it was signed by June or it was 
signed in October for Dr Weiss.  So I gave a range of dates 
because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you say to – or October on 
Dr Weiss’ ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Dr Weiss’s version. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Version. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  And Mr Chair, this letter is the letter.  
It is signed.  On this date, there was a draft version of this 
contract that we had contemplated signing within seven 
days or whenever.  So Mr Chair, I do not concede that 
there was a backdated – I do concede that there was a 
backdating of the agreement of some sorts on objective 
facts. 
20 
 
Whether it was in October, is what we are trying 
to establish but on objective evidence, there has to be 
some backdate.  And Mr Chair, the other point I would like 
to raise which is also in our, I think, our new affidavit that 
we submit, is that you would recall that Advocate Seleka 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 133 of 240 
 
started the MSA by traversing the happenings at what was 
called the Steering Committee, okay. 
 
Now I think it was – I think it is the presentation 
to the second Steering Committee that took place, that 
there is a slight that effectively envisages the signing of 
the MSA.  I think it was by the 31 s t of March or some date.  
I think is the second Steer Co.  There is a presentation and 
there is a table there and it says MSA and I think it says 
31 March or something here.   
 
So even that Steer Co minutes, Mr Chair, 
10 
envisages that there was something that was draft and not 
signed, as of that date of the Steer Co but it envisaged the 
signing by the 31 s t of March.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, earlier on your evidence 
was – your evidence in reaction to Dr Weiss’ statement in 
his affidavit that he only signed the agreement in October, 
backdated it to January.  Your evidence was that the 
agreement either was or must have been signed in 
January. 
 
I understood that to mean even by him.  In other 
20 
words, this backdating from October, you were rejecting.  
Is it – was my understanding correct, at that time, that is 
what you were saying before we came to this letter? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, what I was saying is that the 
backdating occurring in October ...[intervenes]  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 134 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   ...it was not possible ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   ...giving the letter that existed on the 
20 t h of June that said an agreement had been concluded in 
January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   And then they go on to effectively list the 
termination clauses that they then relay on relating to that 
agreement that was concluded in January.  So that was the 
10 
point that I was trying to make there, is that, if the 
agreement was only signed in October, it will be making 
reference to it, as you have already said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   If it did not exist on that date, then they 
would have said but why are you terminating something 
that does not exist, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   So it was in reference to the existence of a 
signed contract by that date being the 28 t h of June. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...I did not say that it was not backdated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 135 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   There was an element of backdating 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   ...on Eskom’s side as well McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  You see, my understanding of what 
you were saying, and I thought that that letter of 28 June 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...from Dr Weiss was supporting – was 
supportive of your version because I understood you to be 
10 
saying the agreement was signed in January.  This whole 
story that he only signed in October is not supporting by 
anything, you know.  And then you remembered that in the 
second paragraph of that letter ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of 28 June, he himself says the 
agreement was concluded in January 2016. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is when I was thinking he is 
supportive of your version because I had thought your 
20 
version was the agreement was signed or must have been 
signed in January. 
MR SINGH:   Okay let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Then the story about October is really 
not good enough 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 136 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  So let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What you are saying, certainly now, is 
that there must have been some backdating that happened. 
MR SINGH:   There must have been some back – on both, 
Eskom as well as McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was about to ask whether you say on 
both or only one side. 
MR SINGH:   No, I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You say on both? 
MR SINGH:   Essentially, that will be on both. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Because even in the Steer Co ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...which was chaired(?) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   It was envisaged that the agreement would 
have been signed sometime in – end of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MR SINGH:   And those Steer Co documents were prepared 
by Mr Govender ’s and Mr Mabelane’s ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   So they would have known the status of that 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Seleka.  [laughs]  So the 
confusion does not get properly clarified but we continue to 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 137 of 240 
 
try and understand... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It would help, Mr Singh, if you tell the 
Chairperson the facts as you knew them, because clearly, 
on the basis of the facts, you are now saying the Steering 
Committee meeting on the 9 t h of February 2016, this letter 
of yours and there will be another letter from McKinsey.  
Two letters, in fact.  You would clearly have known that 
January cannot have been – January 2016 cannot have 
been the month in which the MSA was... 
MR SINGH:   If I can offer my view? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   As to a response to Mr Seleka’s point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, ja. 
MR SINGH:   You will recall that the SLA required – it was 
basically in place and was, let us say, agreed to by the 
parties.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Agreed to by...? 
MR SINGH:   Agreed to by the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  And the parties operates as if the SLA 
was in place? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was not there? 
MR SINGH:   No, was in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As if it had been signed? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 138 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   As if it has been signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At a time when it had not yet been 
signed? 
MR SINGH:   When it had not been signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  The agreement itself contained – the 
SLA.  Let us just use the word SLA.  The SLA itself 
contained two suspensive conditions.  And Mr Seleka led 
evidence, the last time, to say:  Do you know whether 
these things were fulfilled or not?  And my personal 
10 
knowledge at the time was that I did not know.   
 
However, in our affidavit that we will introduce 
today, we have provided certain evidence to suggest why 
we believe those two suspensive conditions were fulfilled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were fulfilled? 
MR SINGH:   Were fulfilled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   As of the required date to January.  And those 
two suspensive conditions, Mr Chair, was one, that a 
steering committee should be constituted.  So in our view 
20 
we have provided a VTC minute from July 2015 that in our 
view constitutes the steering committee, we have provided 
an email – I think it was dated 26 January, if memory 
serves, that effectively says listen, these are the steering 
committee 
members. 
 
There 
is 
another 
email 
from 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 139 of 240 
 
McKinsey 
that 
says 
listen, 
these 
are 
the 
steering 
committee members that must come from their side as well 
as two Trillian representatives.  Then we attach a terms of 
reference relating to the steering committee that was 
agreed to between Eskom and McKinsey.   
So in our view those documents indicate that by the 
steering committee was constituted albeit that it met on the 
9 February due to, as they identified in the emails, due to 
diary constraints. 
The second point, Mr Chair, was that there needed 
10 
to be auditors’ sign-off in something called a Wave tool.  
Now the Wave tool is basically a McKinsey proprietary 
software that basically tracks these let us say risk-based 
contracts and, Mr Chair, there we offer an email – well, it 
is actually an email as well as a report.  The email 
basically – I think it is sometime in December 2015 dated, 
if I recall correctly, and copies the head of IT, Mr Sean 
Maritz, he copies two individuals from Eskom internal audit 
and it is from the head of information security, I think, at 
Eskom IT. 
20 
Now the issue is that the suspensive conditions 
required auditor sign-off on the Wave.  So in my view, Mr 
Chair, you find that Eskom internal audit individuals are 
copied in the mail, the individual that actually does the 
work is from IT and he is identified as an individual called 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 140 of 240 
 
Mr Vimal Nike(?) and he does a whole lot of work, it is in a 
document that is six pages long and he basically says he is 
happy with the Wave tool with certain reservations.  He 
then sends that to the head of IT, Mr Sean Maritz and the 
internal audit individuals are copied in that mail.  But for 
me, my understanding was that is what Eskom relied to say 
that the suspensive conditions were fulfilled in terms of 
audit sign-off on the Wave tool. 
In addition to that, Mr Chair, we attach an audit 
report that was provided by McKinsey from audit firm Ernst 
10 
& Young which basically gives also some comfort around 
Wave tool and security measures and the Wave tool and so 
on.  So that is the basis on which we believed or Eskom 
believed at the time that the suspensive conditions were 
fulfilled.  I am assuming that that is the same view that 
McKinsey took at the time because we continued as if the 
contract existed in terms of our behaviour because we set 
up the Steercos, we went on to do the work, we did all of 
these things. 
So, from that perspective, when we talk about the 
20 
contract being concluded, so there being a contract that 
existed, it was on the basis that the suspensive conditions 
relating to the contract had been fulfilled.  What remained 
thereafter, Mr Chair, may have been the annexures or the 
schedules to the contract relating to certain initiatives, 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 141 of 240 
 
maybe the BEE partner because obviously at that point in 
time Trillian was still going through a vetting process and 
all of that stuff, so those may be things that were still 
outstanding which prevented the formal signing of the 
agreement but the parties operated as if the agreement of 
the suspensive conditions to the agreement had been 
fulfilled by the 31 January.  So that is the reason why, Mr 
Chair, we would say that the word concluded in January 
would be appropriate to use because the suspensive 
conditions relating to the contract was concluded in 
10 
January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 
But 
the 
preconditions, Mr Singh, do not bear on the conclusion of 
the agreement so I think your letter of the 19 February is 
what it is.  It was a proposed contract, you say the signing 
of 
it 
was 
contingent 
upon 
them 
satisfying 
those 
requirements.  They responded to you in the letter of the 
25 February – and Chair, I should again apologise because 
the updates have not been done.  I do not know whether 
20 
the Chairperson will have that letter, it goes with – this is 
one we have read of the 19 February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page did you say we must go to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the next page, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 142 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is the same situation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the same situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have paginated mine, I know because 
I had to ask for leave to have them admitted as exhibits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But does the Chair have that letter of 
25 February 2016? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got the letter so it is – and we 
10 
admitted the document previously as EXHIBIT U33.2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what remains is just the pagination. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this is a response from McKinsey to 
Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Responding to Mr Singh’s letter of 19 
February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  And there are certain 
relevant paragraphs here which might be of – which are of 
importance, Chair.  And I want to go to page one, two, 
three, four which has paragraphs (3) and (4) and (5).  I 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 143 of 240 
 
would read (4), Chairperson which is… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
“The development of BEE partners as regards to the 
vision, aspirations, skills and competency mix.” 
Mr Singh, you have that in front of you? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  It says: 
“As described…” 
Ja: 
10 
“…competency mix and overall plan for success 
over the contract duration including a focus on the 
health of the relationship with McKinsey.  As 
described earlier in this note, the development of 
BEE partners forms an integral part of the overall 
programme.  As a supplement to the SLA, the whole 
memorandum 
was 
negotiated 
with 
the 
title 
“Summary 
SDL 
discussion 
results.” 
 
In 
this 
memorandum it is clearly defined how BEE partners 
should be development.  We are a hundred percent 
20 
committed to the result of the negotiations between 
Eskom 
and 
McKinsey 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
development targets, the following development 
philosophy 
management 
consulting 
partner 
had 
been negotiated.” 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 144 of 240 
 
And then they talk about philosophy there.  Chair, I would 
like to cut to the chase.  If we may go to the next page 
where it says, after the bullet points: 
“The 
selection 
of 
the 
management 
consulting 
partners will be fully aligned with Eskom.  Besides 
Letsema, McKinsey pre-confirmed to Regiments and 
a 
company 
advisory 
as 
black 
management 
consulting partners.  McKinsey is happy to qualify 
additional partners and will seek Eskom’s advice 
and guidance in this matter.  For an instance, black 
10 
consultancies listed on the Eskom consultancy 
panel could be considered viable partners in this 
context.  With respect to the abovementioned 
question, series of discussions between McKinsey 
and the potential BEE partner have been taking 
place. 
 
The 
result 
of 
these 
discussion 
is 
summarised on slides 15 to 23 of the supplementing 
slide pack and entails answers to all questions 
raised by Eskom.  We would like to take the 
opportunity to highlight that Regiments will not be 
20 
our BEE partner but potentially and subject to 
completion of further review, Trillian.  In addition to 
this, 
the 
SLA 
leaves 
the 
opportunity 
to 
add 
additional BEE partners and/or change partners.  In 
this case, the same criteria apply.” 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 145 of 240 
 
Then you have paragraph (5) which reads: 
“The 
development 
of 
Eskom’s 
top 
consultants 
regarding the intended aspirations, road map and 
key success measures with a clear goal to minimise 
the future use of consultants in the organisation.  
The 
development 
of 
Eskom’s 
top 
consultant 
programme forms the core and centre of the SLA 
between Eskom and McKinsey and in fact has been 
the basis for the contract.  Therefore, the full 
details of the process and the achievements has 
10 
been outlined in the SD and L memorandum that 
supplements 
the 
SLA. 
 
In 
particular, 
the 
memorandum outlined the following design criteria.” 
And those are set out, which I will not read, Chair, in the 
interest of time.  There is a paragraph which talks about – 
along the lines of Mr Singh’s letter about the SLA still 
being a contract to be signed.  So the last page, paragraph 
(6): 
“The inclusion into the programme of other key 
focus areas such as contract management and fraud 
20 
and corruption.” 
Says: 
“The conditions of the SLA specifically allow for 
additional scope to be included in the scope of work 
and hence can accommodate additional topics like 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 146 of 240 
 
contract management and fraud and corruption.  
Specifically on these two topics McKinsey has 
already 
worked 
on 
setting 
up 
a 
contract 
management office to build Eskom’s claims and 
management 
capability. 
 
This 
can 
be 
easily 
extended to interface with or include a fraud and 
corruption 
capability. 
 
We 
would 
welcome the 
opportunity to discuss any of the issues in this note 
and how we can best serve you on the programme 
further with you.  We will aim to update you further 
10 
on the issues relating to Trillian by 4 March 2016 
and would be grateful if you could confirm this will 
be acceptable.  We will naturally keep you apprised 
of any relevant developments in the meantime.” 
So what we have read there, Chair, relates to the 
envisaged supply development partner that McKinsey had 
in mind to subcontract to.  Mr Singh, you see that?   
MR SINGH:   I do, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that and I think they too 
accepted – there was a paragraph I was looking for which 
20 
also 
suggests 
that 
the 
proposed 
agreement 
to 
be 
concluded between you – between Eskom, sorry, not 
between you, between Eskom and McKinsey was also at a 
time envisaged that it would be signed.   We did read it 
previously but I cannot find it now, Chair.   
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 147 of 240 
 
 
Anyway, the subsequent letter, there is another 
letter, one of the 30 March 2016, where you are advised 
that they will also not subcontract with Trillian in respect of 
the MSA.   Do you recall that as well? 
MR SINGH:   I do, but if you can refer me to the letter, it 
will refresh me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That letter …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, Mr Seleka, what was the – or what 
were the points that you sought to make by reference to 
these letters, was it that even in March there was still no 
10 
signed agreement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because of the letter of the 30 
March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And are you going to be 
taking that a step further and saying that it is likely that 
even in June no agreement had been signed yet or you are 
not going to go that far? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am going to take it that far, 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because Mr Singh, when McKinsey – 
McKinsey is like a creditor, has on its version rendered 
services to Eskom.  You would understand why they say 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 148 of 240 
 
the agreement was concluded in January 2016 because 
they want to be paid.  They are demanding payment.  But 
when Dr Weiss puts in an affidavit – because now it is a 
sworn statement, he has to tell the Commission the true 
facts as to when he signed this agreement and that is what 
he says in his affidavit.  I do not know whether – because 
that letter does not say we signed the agreement in June 
2016, it says the agreement was concluded in January 
2016 which you have said – well, you did not say but on 
your version subsequent, that cannot be true because 
10 
there was delayed from both sides and backdating from 
both sides. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that – do not forget your point – 
I guess, Mr Singh, you must tell me whether you know from 
what the date is when Eskom signed had backdated and 
what the date is when McKinsey signed and backdated if in 
respect of McKinsey you are saying it is not October. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, within my personal knowledge I 
cannot say and hence I – the only person that can tell you 
when he actually signed was Mr Mabelane. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But from where I sit in terms of the 
documents that I see, I could only envisage that by the 28 
June, based on McKinsey’s letter, that an agreement 
existed and was signed. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 149 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but you – are you saying you do not 
have personal knowledge as to when Eskom actually 
signed? 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you do not have personal knowledge 
as to when McKinsey signed but based on what you have 
seen in the documentation, none of them signed in January 
2016 and for sometime thereafter there was – nobody had 
signed.  So you say they must both have signed at some 
stage after January 2016 they backdated. 
10 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As to both, you do not know exactly 
when but you say that well, in regard to Eskom Mr 
Mabelane must be able to say.  But why would you then 
dispute Dr Weiss’ evidence that look – in the affidavit, that 
I actually signed in October but the document gives the – 
reflects that I signed it January because I gave that date 
but the reason why I did so, because I was – I understood 
that Eskom preferred that we should put that date.  Why 
are you disputing that evidence? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, because as I said, other than for 
the letter itself, had said we concluded an agreement in 
January.  The letter …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not accept now? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 150 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   The letter goes on to rely on the termination 
clauses that existed within the agreement or the SLA.  Now 
it is inconceivable that you would – you would send a letter 
of demand to somebody and not say that it is actually 
based on an unsigned agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But basically you are saying you 
challenge 
it 
because 
of 
your 
understanding 
of 
the 
correspondence and other documents and your terms of 
logic but you do not have personal knowledge. 
10 
MR SINGH:   No, no, I do not have personal knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But, Mr Singh, if the facts are as they 
are, it would have been Eskom which should have said but 
we have a defence to this claim, to this legal – to this 
demand in the sense that we have not signed the 
agreement or send it to them to sign, they have no leg to 
stand on.  It is you who should raise that as the person to 
be sued as opposed to the one who is suing you. 
MR SINGH:   But that is exactly my point, Sir, I am saying 
20 
that by 28 June, when the letter arrives, there had to be a 
signed contract between McKinsey and Eskom else why 
would Mr Mabelane not raise that defence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why would? 
MR SINGH:   Why would Mr Mabelane not raise exactly the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 151 of 240 
 
point that you are raising? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying if to Eskom’s 
knowledge …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …when McKinsey sent that letter of the 
28 June… 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which you said is a letter of demand. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If, to Eskom’s knowledge, no agreement 
10 
had been signed, one would expect Eskom to say but we 
have no signed agreement. 
MR SINGH:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say the fact that they did not 
say that suggests to you that there must have been a 
signed agreement by that date. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you say. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the basis on which you say 
20 
by that time the parties must have signed and backdated. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You no longer say in January there was 
a conclusion of the agreement to say – it must have been 
later than that but not later than 28 June. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 152 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somewhere in between both of them 
must have signed but they backdated? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you are saying. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, just by way of reference, the 
letter of the 30 March 2016, is in the same bundle, Eskom 
bundle 14C, page 876. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 876? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 876, 877 and Chair you will see 
on 877 the penultimate paragraph still refers to a draft of 
the service level agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said I must go to page 876? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am there but maybe we are at ten past 
four, maybe we should take a short adjournment.  We can 
take it either now or you can complete the point you 
wanted to make with reference to this letter. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the point is made, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In what you said to me, I am just 
giving you the reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 153 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To where you will see even McKinsey 
says: 
“We acknowledge that the draft of the service level 
agreement between Eskom and McKinsey entails…” 
Even as at 30 March 2016 they refer to it as a draft. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are you reading from on page 
876? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you reading from page 876? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair, sorry, please turn to 877. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The penultimate paragraph: 
“We acknowledge that the draft…” 
CHAIRPERSON:    
“..of the service level agreement between Eskom 
and 
McKinsey 
entails 
the 
requirement 
of 
outsourcing a percentage of the total resulting fee a 
supply development but now we are fully committed 
to giving effect to this obligation despite the 
termination in light of the previous subcontracting 
20 
relationship with Trillian which under the current 
conditions would not be possible.  We would 
appreciate an opportunity to develop options with 
Eskom to ensure that meet our supply development 
obligations.” 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 154 of 240 
 
So they – two points are made in this paragraph.  One, is 
there is a draft service level agreement between Eskom 
and McKinsey, which means it has not been signed as at 
the end of March 2016 but they say: 
“We are fully committed to giving effect to this 
obligation despite the termination…” 
The termination that they are talking about there is 
obviously earlier than the termination that is contained in 
the letter of 16 June 2016.  So which termination are they 
talking about there? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it in the same paragraph, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, same paragraph, after the first 
sentence, the second sentence says: 
“We are fully committed to giving effect to this 
obligation despite the termination. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh yes, okay, I see.  Not that is the 
termination of McKinsey’s further discussions with Trillian 
for Trillian to become their subcontractor. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh, 
the 
termination 
of 
those 
discussions? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then they decide here that Trillian 
will not be McKinsey’s supply development partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess is the point you are making 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 155 of 240 
 
that as we look at when it is that the agreement was 
signed, we must accept that as at 30 March 2016 it had not 
been signed otherwise they would not talk in these terms.  
That is the point you were making. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You accept that point, Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept it?   
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Okay, alright.  Was there another 
10 
point in regard to this letter that you were making other 
than…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think – I wanted to follow up on that 
demand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Follow up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I follow up on the demand, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, you see, it seems to – it 
20 
seems on the documentation that the payment or the 
decision to make a payment to McKinsey came from Eskom 
and McKinsey only reacted pursuant to the letter of 
termination and I would you like you to quickly, before we 
take the adjournment to turn to the same bundle, page 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 156 of 240 
 
829.19 which is a submission to the BTC.  Eskom bundle 
14C, 829.19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it, it is dated 9 June 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
MR SINGH:   829 point? 
CHAIRPERSON:   829.19. 
MR SINGH:   Point 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is submission document from Eskom to 
the board tender committee and it is dated 9 June 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so that is before McKinsey’s letter 
10 
of demand and the resolution required is: 
“It is resolved that the BTC grant approval to cancel 
McKinsey’s risk-based process. 
2.1 
Allow …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you deal with that, Mr Seleka, let 
us just for the sake of completeness say who signed the 
submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was – it is not clear who compiled it 
but on page 829.22 it says: 
20 
“Supported by Prish Govender, Programme Director” 
And he has signed on 6 June 2016.  And then below that 
says: 
“Approved by Edwin Mabelane, Chief Procurement 
Officer” 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 157 of 240 
 
And he has signed and that is on the same date and then 
you can tell us what it says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Now Mr Singh 
would you have had sight of this before? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s say the title of the submission is 
given as “Briefing on McKinsey risk-based contract”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is under one, under two it says 
resolution required and it says: 
“It is resolved that the BTC grant: 
10 
2.1 
approval to cancel McKinsey risk based 
process; 
2.2 
allow all cost to be negotiated and finalised 
to 
be 
approved 
by 
the 
relevant 
tender 
committee. 
2.3 
approval of activities to be redirected to 
existing contracts where appropriate with the 
incorporation of similar SDL objectives and 
the 
option 
of 
contracting 
on 
risk-based 
approach.” 
20 
Okay, you can continue 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so in this submission Mr Singh it 
...[indistinct – coughing] the BTC it appears that the 
willingness to make a payment, negotiate and finalise on 
cost came from the part of Eskom, even before the letter of 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 158 of 240 
 
demand, even before the purported termination of the MSA 
or SLA.  Your comment? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chairman ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, would you just repeat, I am 
sorry I was looking at something that I raised just now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it appears from this document, this 
submission to the BTC, that the willingness to make a 
payment under the MSA, even before it is terminated, 
purportedly terminated, even before the letter of demand 
you have referred to of McKinsey, that Eskom was willing 
10 
to negotiate and finalise on the cost with McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may comment Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your comment? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I think the first question that Mr 
Seleka asked was would you have had sight of this 
document.  Mr Chair I would not have had sight of this 
document, and I did not sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But the nexus of this document, or the origins 
of this document originates from the Steering Committee 
20 
meeting, was it the second or the third Steering Committee 
– at one of the Steering Committee meetings there was a 
closed session where there was a discussion held, and I 
think it was I think either the June, I think it was the June 
meeting, but anyway, there was a Steering Committee 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 159 of 240 
 
meeting where we held a closed session to decide on the 
future of the MSA, and at that meeting the Steerco 
resolved that it would probably be best for the reasons 
discussed at the Steerco, that it would recommend to the 
BTC to consider cancelling the MSA for the reasons that it 
had discussed as well as the reasons that are set out by 
Mr Mabelane and Mr Govender in this submission. 
 
So that is the nexus we hand this document Mr 
Chair.   In that meeting Mr Chair I also requested, given 
the fact that Steerco had come to the conclusion that there 
10 
would need to be a termination of the MSA I requested Mr 
Mabelane and Mr Govender consult legal as well as 
commercial, 
now 
commercial 
was 
another 
word 
for 
procurement 
within 
Eskom, 
to 
understand 
the 
consequences of the said termination, and once they were 
satisfied with that they would proceed to the BTC who at 
that 
stage 
did 
the 
required 
approval 
or 
submit 
a 
recommendation to get an approval as to what they had 
thought would be appropriate in the circumstances. 
 
So that is the background, so Mr Chair in terms of 
20 
responding to Mr Seleka’s comment directly no I would not 
have had sight of this specific document but I would have 
known of it, because of that, yes. 
 
Secondly Mr Chair I am not too sure how Mr Seleka 
comes to the conclusion that Eskom had mooted us before 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 160 of 240 
 
the termination of the SLA, because the termination is 
contemplated in the document, so they would have taken a 
decision to terminate if they thought it appropriate and if 
so I would assume that Mr Mabelane had gotten advice to 
understand whether there was cost implications relating to 
termination and again Mr Chair if there was a signed 
contract between McKinsey and Eskom at the time the 
termination clauses of that contract would result in these 
costs that are requested, so as it relates to Eskom being 
willing to pay again it would rely and relate to the 
10 
contractual agreement between Eskom and McKinsey at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I see that in this document, the first 
page of this document in bullet or under bullet point – the 
second bullet point it just said: 
”the contract was signed in January 2016.”  
Before that it says:  
“A letter of acceptance was issued to McKinsey in 
December 2015 allowing work to commence until 
the contract was fully developed and finalised for 
20 
signature.” 
It then says: 
“The contract was signed in January 2016.” 
And then next bullet point: 
“Eskom submitted a letter to McKinsey on 19 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 161 of 240 
 
February 
following 
a 
problem 
kick-off. 
 
The 
committee were in key concerns on the programme.   
Mechanics were raised.”  
In June 2019 a document signed by among others Mr Prish 
– well signed by Mr Prish Govender and Mr Adrian 
Mabelane signed on the 6 t h of June 2016 says that the 
contract between Eskom and McKinsey was signed in 
January 2016. 
 
The confusion does not stop. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Evidently Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   Let us take the short 
adjournment, it will be ten minutes.  
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay thank you Chairperson.  Chair we 
will ask Mr Singh about allegations made by the travel agent 
in due course. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  By? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  By the travel agents in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But Mr Singh has indicated in an affidavit 
the supplementary affidavit that he wishes first to have – for 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 162 of 240 
 
his team – legal team to engage with the legal team for Mr 
Essa before he responds to those allegations. But we have 
agreed that he could deal with some of the aspects relevant 
to or arising from that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if he is still going to respond I was 
hoping that if we did not finish Mr Singh’s evidence today we 
would finish tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know he is due to come back on Transnet 
later – later in the month so how far is that process? 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson I think maybe it is 
also prudent to place on record that we were also over the 
weekend served additional documents etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And based on that I have informed 
my learned friend I do not want to go into the details is that 
we most probably going to do another affidavit to deal inter 
alia with some of the issues that is now being raised in 
respect of McKinsey and the witness’ which would most 
probably make incriminating statements with reference to 
20 
people but time will be needed to actually serve it on the 
relevant persons.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  So the – even if we come to the 
end of Mr Seleka’s examination by tomorrow we cannot take 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 163 of 240 
 
it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  We have however when it comes 
to the issue of the travel agent agreed Mr Seleka can ask 
him about the various invoices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  But what my client has done he 
has gone and he has analysed it and he has drafted a little 
spread sheet to be able to deal with those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  So he can to that extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  He feels comfortable enough to 
with reliance on this deal with the various invoices etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And that we think would also 
assist in speeding things along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  At this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I guess what I am looking 
20 
for is that there ought to be an understanding of where or 
when the process of obtaining or preparing his further 
affidavit will be completed or when the affidavit would be 
available.  Obviously if it has got to be served by way of a 
Rule 3.3 on certain people may be implicated in it that would 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 164 of 240 
 
have to be done.  So maybe at some stage either at the end 
of today’s proceedings or tomorrow let us – let us try and 
have finality on the dates.  But if Mr Singh is able to deal 
with some of the issues connected with that then whatever 
can be done should be done in terms of covering as many 
issues as possible.  And those that he might not yet be able 
to deal with until he has done the affidavit then he would 
deal with them then hopefully if we have to find to make time 
for him at some stage or other after tomorrow then the time 
would be limited just to come with these specific issues. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson it would even go a 
little bit further in lieu of spending a lot of time on re-
examining. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  We will take care of those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And literally just highlight it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Under oath say we refer to this 
issue, this issue and I think that would save a lot of time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Because I think you can see there 
is going to be a number issues to be dealt with in re-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 165 of 240 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Okay Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson before I 
proceed during the adjournment my learned friends made a 
request to me in regard to that letter of the 28th of June 2016 
which is in Eskom Bundle 14(c) page 743.  A request which I 
am not going to do I am told is that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you are not going to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am not going to do what they are asking 
me to do. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay ja 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I need to place it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What they are asking could be done is to 
have the letter the bullet points in that letter read to the 
record because the letter seeks to quote clauses of the – of 
the contract and we produced them in this letter and they 
wanted me to give Mr Singh the opportunity to comment on 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he – he could comment even if they 
20 
are not read into the record if that was necessary. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is what you were not inclined to do reading 
into the record or allowing Mr Singh to comment or not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No the former. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 166 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The reading into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because the question is where would 
Dr Weiss and Mr Vikas Sagar have obtained these clauses if 
he says in his affidavit that the contract was only sent to him 
in late September early October 2016? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not want to ask Mr Singh to 
10 
comment on those – those parts without reading them into 
the record. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then if you want to question him on his 
comments then you do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Singh you have referred the 
Chairperson to that letter – the letter from McKinsey which is 
a letter essentially of demand and the – I suppose you know 
20 
what your legal representatives wish to have done are you 
able to comment on the clauses that are quoted in that 
letter? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair.  The – the clauses as quoted in 
the letter refer to clause 24.14 of the SLA.  13.1 of the SLA. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 167 of 240 
 
7.3, 7.31, 7.32, 7.33, 7.35, 7.33 again 7.34, 7.35 and 7.6 
lastly.  You see the point again is as Mr Seleka has raised 
that these clauses come verbatim from the Service Level 
Agreement that we have said has been signed.  So the issue 
is if Mr Weiss only received a copy of this agreement in 
October as he alleges where did these clauses actually 
emanate from? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am just going to 7.7 – 74.3.  Now 
this is the letter which says the Master Services Agreement 
was finally concluded in January 2016. 
10 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you dispute – which you challenge? 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair what we are challenging is when 
this agreement was actually signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but when we conclude we are talking 
about signing – you and I understand that – we are on the 
same page on that. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I tried to explain to you before in 
the contract contained two suspensive clauses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
20 
MR SINGH:  And those suspensive clauses needed to have 
been fulfilled by the 31st of January and Eskom’s – well our 
version is that those conditions were fulfilled and therefore 
the contract was concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you remember when we were talking 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 168 of 240 
 
earlier about whether the agreement was concluded in 
January or later we were talking out when it was signed and 
– and you said at a certain stage nobody signed the 
agreement in January as far as you are concerned. 
MR SINGH:  If we were… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everybody signed it later but backdated it. 
MR SINGH:  Okay if you define concluded as the date of 
signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is – that is – ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:  Then it is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if it is meant to be signed until 
both sides have signed it is not concluded.  Okay.  You 
accept that?  An agreement that requires to be signed is not 
concluded until both sides have signed. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair in signing it would (laughing so 
not audible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright but – but you and I agreed 
earlier I thought that if we find a time in 2016 when the 
parties had not signed the agreement then there was no 
agreement between the parties yet.  I leave out the issue of 
20 
the offer and acceptance which we discussed earlier.  But I 
thought that we – we understood each other that as long as 
Eskom had not signed McKinsey had not signed there was no 
agreement yet. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 169 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did I misunderstand? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair if we look at it right legally there 
was an obligation through the letter of award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Letter? 
MR SINGH:  From – through the letter of award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  There was a binding agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Between Eskom and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but remember I said let us leave that 
10 
(speaking over one another). 
MR SINGH:  Part that 00:12:02 and partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the letter or an offer and 
acceptance. 
MR SINGH:  Offer and acceptance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Flowing there from is the Service Level 
Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Now the Service Level Agreement itself has two 
20 
suspensive conditions for it to become effective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That I understand you have explained 
that so I know that. 
MR SINGH:  Yes so from what I understand is if the 
suspensive conditions are fulfilled the contract becomes 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 170 of 240 
 
effective notwithstanding when it is signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but too when you say that you are 
relying on the offer and acceptance is it not? 
MR SINGH:  No even – even the agreement itself Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if it has not been signed. 
MR SINGH:  Unless – unless… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it has not been signed I would (speaking 
over one another). 
MR SINGH:  Unless there is an express clause in the 
agreement that says this agreement only becomes effective 
10 
on date of signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No remember we are talking about an 
agreement here which we both understood or understand to 
have required both parties to sign. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why they signed and that is why 
they even backdated it because it was important that it be 
seen to have – that from a certain date. 
MR SINGH:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or am I confusing you? 
20 
MR SINGH:  I think you are Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright let – let us take it – let us 
take it step by step.  Do you accept that there was no 
Service Level Agreement or MSA before both Eskom and 
McKinsey signed? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 171 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair no because in my… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say – you say it was that? 
MR SINGH:  It – when the suspensive conditions were 
fulfilled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair the agreement became effective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Mr – Dr Weiss even agrees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  That it became effective or there was a desire 
10 
to backdate the agreement to the date on which it became 
effective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
MR SINGH:  Which is sometime in January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your – is your position that even in 
February remember you have a letter – you letter to 
McKinsey dated 19 February. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Saying – talking about signing that was 
still to happen. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the contract. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying even on the 19 th of 
February as far as you are concerned if the two suspensive 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 172 of 240 
 
conditions had been met already and I cannot recall whether 
they had been met – if they had been met then as far as you 
are concerned there was a Service – a Master Service 
Agreement between McKinsey and Eskom as at that date? 
MR SINGH:  Was effective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was there. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was binding. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so you say the signing was neither 
10 
here nor there? 
MR SINGH:  It was good for – for governance purposes to 
have it signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was not important? 
MR SINGH:  It was not important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so when – when the termination 
happened you remember you said earlier on there must have 
– there must have been – they must have signed by the 28 t h 
of June. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because otherwise if anyone or if Eskom 
talked 
about 
termination 
McKinsey 
should 
have 
said 
termination of what because we have not even signed. 
MR SINGH:  Agreed or when the letter of demand came. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 173 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  Transnet – Eskom should have said but why you 
issuing a letter of demand? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then if signing was not important then 
it would not have been open to Eskom to say why – what are 
you talking about because we have not signed?  Because the 
answer would be we do not have to sign we already have the 
agreement on your version. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair I think maybe when I said signing 
is not important it is probably tongue in cheek but the – there 
is a requirement for contracts to be signed within Eskom. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Singh it was not in tongue in cheek. 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair okay seriously I think there was a 
requirement for the – for the contract to be signed in terms 
of if you look at the 1034 document as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  There is a requirement for the contract to be 
signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – but once you accept that then 
you have got to change your earlier evidence that there was 
a Master Services Level Agreement even before the parties 
20 
signed.  Once you say they – it was a requirement to sign 
and at a time when that requirement had not been met there 
could not be a Master Service Agreement between the 
parties. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair my understanding is that if the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 174 of 240 
 
conditions of the contract are the suspensive conditions of 
the contract are fulfilled the contract becomes effective on 
the date on which it was fulfilled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes leave out the suspensive conditions 
because we have talked about that.  Just talking about 
signing. 
MR SINGH:  Okay if there was no – if there was no 
suspensive conditions and there was no other agreement 
between the parties to say listen this thing is effective other 
than the fact that we have not signed then signature is 
10 
required.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you just said to me a while ago that 
when you said signature – signing was not important that 
was tongue in cheek okay and you said seriously signing 
was required, do you remember that?  And in response to 
that I said to you but if signing was important – was a 
requirement then you cannot say that there was a Master 
Services Agreement between the parties at a time when they 
had not signed.  In other words when they had not met that 
requirement. 
20 
MR SINGH:  But Mr Chair again I think we talking about 
hypothetical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no before we get there – before we 
get there remember that there is an issue here. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 175 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That Mr – Dr Weiss says in effect in his 
affidavit in June the McKinsey had not signed the agreement 
– I am saying in June but for many months before October 
there was no – no agreement because McKinsey had not 
signed. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he says he signed in October but 
backdated … 
MR SINGH:  To January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His – to his signature to January.  So the 
10 
question of whether – of when it was that there was an 
agreement between the two parties is important because 
whatever payment gets made we want to find out was it 
made at a time when there was an agreement and what was 
the – what was the effect of the agreement.  So we have 
letters that say the agreement was concluded in January but 
you have said no it cannot be.  So – but on what I 
understand you to be saying now you accept that  
1. The signing by the parties of the agreement was – or 
was a requirement here and you accept that if we find 
20 
at any time that they had not signed we can accept that 
therefore at that time there could not have been a 
Master Services Agreement between the parties. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I still do not see how the suspensive 
conditions are not relevant in that 00:20:22. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 176 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just repeat that? 
MR SINGH:  I said Mr Chair what I find difficult in agreeing 
to your last proposition is in the absence of the fulfilment of 
the suspensive conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no what I am saying is I – I am not 
dealing with the question of the fulfilment of the suspensive 
conditions now but I am simply saying assume that the 
conditions – the suspensive conditions were met. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the agreement had not been signed and 
10 
you say the signing was a requirement I am expecting that 
you will accept that as long as the agreement was not signed 
we cannot say there was an – a Master Services Agreement 
between the parties because you say signing was a 
requirement in this case. 
MR SINGH:  Okay let us maybe answer the question 
differently.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So let us agree that on your version… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not my version. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Or on your – on your proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Proposition ja. 
MR SINGH:  On your proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  That there would be no agreement with no 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 177 of 240 
 
signature that is your proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you say if there is no signature. 
MR SINGH:  Then there is no … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no agreement. 
MR SINGH:  There is no acceptance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your – that is what you said ja. 
MR SINGH:  So my – all I am distinguishing Sir is I am 
saying there might be no signature and therefore there is no 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:  As you – as you proposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  But why I am taking that one step further to say 
by virtue of the fact that there was no signature it does not 
mean that there is no liability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well you introducing liability now we are 
talking about whether there is an agreement or there is no 
agreement. 
MR SINGH:  Because – because Mr Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When there is no signature. 
20 
MR SINGH:  You prefaced this by saying that the signature is 
important to understand whether the payments were made in 
terms of an existing liability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I said in terms of an existing 
agreement. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 178 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  But that is the point Mr Chair where does the – 
where is the liability – where does the liability come from? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if you talk about liability you might 
talk about liability that comes from the contract; you might 
talk about liability that comes from something else okay.  So 
that is why I am just saying let us talk about the contract but 
my understanding of what – where you are now on your 
evidence is that you are saying in this case the signing of 
the agreement by both parties was a requirement and as 
long as they had not signed one cannot say there was an 
10 
agreement.  But it is a different situation where the signing 
is not a requirement.  I am now going back to something you 
said earlier as I understood.  That is where I understand you 
to be.  Is it not what you intend conveying? 
MR SINGH:  Okay Mr Chair let us just put it this way.  For 
ease of reference my version is a signed version of this 
contract existed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Sometime between March and June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Based on the evidence that I have seen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  So that puts… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You going back to the – to the facts. 
MR SINGH:  Yes so… 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 179 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or to the version that you put. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying not necessarily to the facts 
because – because we are trying to establish when … 
MR SINGH:  The contract is signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The contract is signed. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I have told you what I make of your 
evidence now.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no thank you Chair because – 
10 
because Mr Singh your letter of the 19 th of February would 
not have been drafted the way it was drafted if you believed 
that the fulfilment of the suspensive conditions went about 
the existence of the agreement. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair again we go back to this issue of 
whether there was an agreement – the parties for all intents 
and purposes if the parties did not believe that there was an 
agreement and the suspensive conditions were fulfilled there 
would have been no need for a stakeholder – there would 
have been no need for mobilised people. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I am talking about you Mr Singh.  You 
wrote a letter on the 19 th of February. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2016 and you said the –  
“The signing of the proposed agreement” 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 180 of 240 
 
Not the coming into effect you specifically say: 
“The signing is contingent upon the receipt of 
satisfactory responses to the above request.” 
You were very specific. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  Of the proposed agreement.  I did not say 
of the fact that we did not have an – an effective contract 
because the parties behaved as if there was an agreement in 
place.  There was… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There was 00:25:38. 
MR SINGH:  Yes there was only the mere fact of actually the 
10 
physical signature of the contract and that was the only thing 
that was outstanding and therefore we referred to a draft 
contract.  It does not say if that was the case Mr Chair the 
letter would have been drafted very differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am – I am not sure what the answer 
– what effects of the answer that you are giving to Mr Seleka 
is but I just remain on what I think has come out clearly from 
your evidence namely the signing of this agreement by the 
parties was a requirement in this case therefore if the parties 
– if we talk about any time in 2016 when factually the parties 
20 
had not signed we cannot say as at that time there was a 
Master Services Agreement between Eskom and McKinsey. 
So that is the one set. 
 
You have said something about the suspensive 
conditions.  For now for my purposes in terms of what I have 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 181 of 240 
 
been asking you for me that is neither here nor there for 
present purposes you know.  What was important is to – to 
establish what your understanding was.  So that is where I 
am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair I – and the letter 
is what it is is the signing of the proposed contract is 
contingent or if you want to use a simple word is dependent 
upon the receipt of satisfactory responses to the above 
question.  It is a proposal but I am going to leave it there Mr 
Singh.  If you want to comment you may comment but I am 
10 
going to leave it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he has said enough. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have already said to the Chairperson 
– ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think he wants to say anything 
further. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But based on this letter Mr Singh and you 
were expecting a response I suppose from McKinsey is it not 
20 
fair to say it would be expected of you to know when exactly 
was this SOA signed? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think we have also traversed this 
issue the previous time that we gave testimony.  The 
delegated authority relating to signing of contracts. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 182 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it not in relation to the corporate 
plan? 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was in regard to this one? 
MR SINGH:  No it was relying on this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  Was and eventually signed by Mr Mabelane and 
as I mentioned before that the second stakeholder did 
indicate that the contract was going to be signed by the 31st 
of March.  So for all intents and purposes I was under the 
10 
impression that the agreement was signed by the 31st of 
March and if you look at 00:29:06 evidence in terms of you 
go back to the letter 743 for example Mr Chair again it would 
be rather how can I say - bizarre for McKinsey to send a 
letter of demand as the letter of 28 June 2016 is and let us 
say we dispute it Eskom dispute the fact that a contract 
existed and we went into a court process we would either 
have produced a document that does not exist or was not 
signed for this thing, and that is McKinsey because they are 
claiming that there is this contract that exists, yet we prove 
20 
that it does not exist.  And I do not think McKinsey would 
have taken a potential risk such as that to issue a letter of 
demand knowing that a letter of – that a Service Level 
Agreement is not signed. 
MR SINGH:   Now, you see, Mr Singh.  I do not have any 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 183 of 240 
 
difficulty with that point you make, namely, one would 
expect that McKinsey would not issue a letter of demand 
based on an agreement that had not been signed.  I do not 
have a difficulty with that point in principle.   
 
Obviously, Mr Seleka can canvas issues further 
around that but I do not have a difficulty.  One – that is 
what one would expect equally, I think, as Mr Seleka said 
earlier on, one would have expected Eskom, upon receiving 
that letter of demand, which was based on an agreement, 
to have taken the point or have taken the position that:  
10 
But we do not have an agreement with you.  If that was the 
– if the position was that there no... 
MR SINGH:   Exactly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not have difficulty with that, you 
know.  But it makes it all the more important to establish 
as to exactly what the position is because Dr Weiss has 
said:  I signed this agreement in October and backdated it.  
Now when you look at that, it would not – it was not to 
McKinsey’s benefit or advantage for Dr Weiss to disclose 
that, to disclose that he signed it in October and backdated 
20 
it.   
 
It does not help them to explain that but if it is 
the truth, it is the truth, as far as they are concerned, 
which is the truth, as Mr Seleka was saying, maybe to...  
said:  Well, it is a fact.  That is what happened.  So you 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 184 of 240 
 
ask yourself.  Why would Dr Weiss have said he signed the 
agreement in October and backdated it to January if he 
actually signed it earlier?   
 
Because actually a version that showed that he 
signed it earlier would have been – may have put them in a 
better light then, saying we signed in October and 
backdated it to January.  You see what I am talking about?   
 
It may well be that you might say or somebody 
else might say:  No, Chair, there is something that you 
have missed.  This is how it would happen to say it was 
10 
signed in October instead of admitting that it was signed 
during the first six months of 2016.  But then if there is 
such a thing, somebody must have ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I will attempt to clarify(?).  
Mr Chair, if – I mean, McKinsey has gone on record on a 
number of times.  At the Parliamentary Inquiry, making 
announcements on their own relating to the billion or so 
that they paid back.   
 
Have gone through an extensive exercise in – on 
their own version, looking at thousands of records, emails 
20 
and investigating I do not know how many of their 
employees.  Look, that entire process, no one actually 
discloses that this agreement was actually – did not exist.  
Yet in December 2020, Dr Weiss decides to say but this 
agreement did not exist.   
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 185 of 240 
 
 
So during that entire process and that entire and 
that entire investigation, what was mister – Dr Weiss’ view 
and what was McKinsey’s view, during that entire process.  
It was not actively(?) approaches if you understand how 
and what they did.   
 
In the Eskom application, Mr Chair, itself, they 
do not rely on the fact that an agreement did not exist, that 
they paid(?) the money(?).  [Speaker not clear.]  They go 
to this entire process of saying, now they understand that 
Eskom mislead them relating to the fact that the National 
10 
Treasury approval was not welcomed.   
 
Even on that version, the truth(?) say but listen 
it would be really easy for them to say:  Well, you know 
what, we made a mistake.  There was no agreement and 
therefore we are repaying the money.  It would have been 
an easier way to explain the reason as to why they are 
repaying the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you not accept in all of these 
circumstances they would not have sought to advantage 
themselves in any way by saying they signed the letter in 
20 
October if in fact they signed it much earlier?  But 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if that is the case.  I come back to 
my original point that I made this morning, is, if that is the 
case then the 28 t h of June letter is either made in bad faith 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 186 of 240 
 
or is fraudulent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   But it was because – the truth of the matter 
is, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Eskom relied on this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but that is fine.  Remember, my 
question is.  Do you accept or do you know that – I mean, 
normally – from what you have said, I think you are 
suggesting that Dr Weiss is being untruthful in saying that 
10 
he signed the agreement in October.  He must have signed 
before or during the second – the first half of 2016. 
 
So my question is whether you do not accept 
that he or McKinsey would not derive any benefit from 
saying they – he signed the document, the agreement in 
October if, actually, he signed it in the first six months of 
2016. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I think they derived 
substantial... 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that? 
20 
MR SINGH:   By getting Eskom to believe that the 
agreement was signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   By getting Eskom to believe that the 
agreement was signed if indeed it was not signed but not 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 187 of 240 
 
disclosing the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what benefit do they get by saying 
that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if you did not have regard for all of 
the facts that we now know around the issue of the – okay 
my letters are referring to a draft contract, for example, 
and all of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   And you just had these letters that came from 
McKinsey. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   What would your view be?  Your view would 
be there is an agreement that is in place ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   There is termination clauses that are relevant 
to this.  Let us engage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  You are dealing with a different 
point and I know the point you are dealing with because 
you have told me about it and I have indicated to you that I 
understand the point.  I am simply saying, if McKinsey 
20 
actually signed the agreement during the first six months 
of 2016. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does not appear that there would be 
any benefit for them if they said instead untruthfully the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 188 of 240 
 
signed it in October.  Normally, people become, you know, 
tell untruths when they seek to protect themselves or to 
gain benefits.  So I am saying that for them to be paid, it 
would be in their interest, actually, to say we actually 
signed in January.   
 
So 
as 
we 
were 
doing 
work 
there 
was 
an 
agreement in place, you know.  Rather than saying – rather 
than effectively disclose that there was no agreement until 
October and then would backdated it.  So as we were doing 
work for Eskom, we had no agreement with Eskom.  That 
10 
was not beneficial to them to disclose that. 
MR SINGH:   Look, Mr Chair, I can then only assume that 
the position is that Dr Weiss and Mr Sagar took the 
28 t h of June letter and took in the interest of McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, I – I have said to you I 
understand your point about that. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And about saying – but the letter, the 
letter talks about the agreement had been concluded 
already because it says January but talks about then being 
20 
concluded.  That might need explanation from their side, 
from Dr Weiss’ side and so on and so on.  I understand 
that but I was saying, let us look at the – that part of the 
evidence that was simply to the effect that they signed in 
October but they backdated, if we look at that. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 189 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Ja, I was trying to explain that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So in my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   The only way I could explain this is, if, as I 
said.  Dr Weiss and Mr Sagar acted, let us call it, in their 
professional capacity issuing this letter and in December 
when Dr Weiss gave the affidavit, he probably gave it in 
his personal capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR SINGH:   And wanted to, I do not know, disclose that 
okay this is what – this the actual truth(?) that existed at 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   But in the capacity of the partner of 
McKinsey, this is what I had to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   That is the only explanation I can... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I guess we have ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...canvassed it sufficiently, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I am not going into it, Chair.  
[laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 190 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My question was about Mr Singh’s 
knowledge as to – well, that, would it not be fair, based on 
his letter of the 19 t h, to expect that he would know when is 
the MSA signed because there you say:  The signing of this 
proposed contract is contingent upon you coming back to 
me on these points.  Your answer was you assigned that it 
was signed the 31 s t of March 2016. 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I said it would be incumbent 
upon Mr Mabelane to ensure that the agreement was 
signed in that he was the delegated authority to sign it.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MR SINGH:   My expectation would have been – it would 
have been signed by the 31 s t of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Given the presentation that was done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But by ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe... maybe ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I hope ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...it will just – do not forget your point, 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The issues that you set out in your letter 
in respect of which you said the signing was contingent 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 191 of 240 
 
upon those ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...being satisfied.  To your knowledge, 
were they satisfied all of them and if so, when? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think the Steer Co minutes do go, 
to some extent, to indicate that we were not completely 
satisfied ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...with the responses ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   ...that McKinsey had given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But in principle, if you look at the letter that 
McKinsey’s response was.  They accepted each of the 
issues that were raised in terms of – how can I call it?  Let 
us say, for example, changed management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   They accepted the changed management 
should form part of the master services – or the Top 
Engineering Programme. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   For interruption, for example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Contact management will form part of the...  
So each of the issues that we raised, in principle, they did 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 192 of 240 
 
not reject it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Right.  So the – basically, I think the actual 
timing out of how it would form part of the actual 
underlining Master Services Agreement was the issue that 
was outstanding... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   And that is recorded in the minutes of the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   But up to when was it outstanding?  
Because based on what you say in your letter, as conveyed 
10 
by Mr Seleka because I am relying on what he just said 
now. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There would be no signing until those 
issues were – those requirements were sorted out.  So 
until when did it remain outstanding, that issue? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I am not too sure ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To your knowledge. 
MR SINGH:   ...what the date of that Steer Co was where 
we recorded that ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The date of...? 
MR SINGH:   The date of the Steer Co. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   That recorded the fact that McKinsey had 
responded. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 193 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yet we were not completely satisfied 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...with the responses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   So I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But would it be correct to say you had no 
personal 
knowledge 
of 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
was, 
that 
outstanding issue was ultimately satisfied? 
10 
MR SINGH:   I would not, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Because Mr Mabelane – I do not recall that 
Mr Mabelane had come and engage with me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...regarding this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And the contents thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So Mr Mabelane might be the 
person who can clarify this? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Who can clarity.  From what I can understand, 
Mr Chair, I think there was some discussion at one of the 
Steer Co’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   To say:  Listen, that we did send this letter.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 194 of 240 
 
We did respond.  And there are some issues relating to the 
response.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   But we never then said that it should not - the 
contract should not be signed or anything like that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   It might have been one of the reasons that 
were mooted around the ultimate termination of the 
agreement ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
MR SINGH:   ...at some point.  But I was not – I have no 
personal knowledge relating to Mr Mabelane coming to me 
and saying:  Listen, we sent this letter.  This was the 
response.  Can or cannot.  Or can I or can I not sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, that of course, what you have just 
said now and the contents of your letter insofar as it said 
the signing can only take place after you have satisfied 
these requirements. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Depending on what the evidence is as to 
whether all of those issues were addressed or those 
requirements were satisfied, it may well be that as long as 
one of them was not satisfied, no signing took place which 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 195 of 240 
 
may explain why the signing might have taken place in 
October on the part of McKinsey because they would – 
there was this issue that remained unsatisfied.   
 
But it depends on whether there is somebody 
who can come and say:  Yes, it was satisfied or no it was 
not satisfied.  Because if there was a singing of the 
agreement without those issues having satisfied, that 
would be contrary to your letter.   
MR SINGH:   I agree, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR SINGH:   But if that was the case, Mr Chair, when 
Dr Weiss was presented with the document for signature, 
he... if that was the reason why they had not signed by 
then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat the earlier 
sentence? 
MR SINGH:   I am saying, on your proposition Mr Chair of 
let us call it these issues, being the reason for non-
signature or delays in the signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
20 
MR SINGH:   I would then have expected Dr Weiss to be 
aware that these were the reasons and then once he was 
confronted with the document for signature, he would have 
said but we cannot because Mr Singh still needs to be 
satisfied which is not what he said.   
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 196 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Of course, that is if they were still 
not satisfied, those issue.  If by October, when he signed, 
they had all been satisfied then he would not have raise 
any issues. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, if there was this delay 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...then I would assume so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And if it were for the reasons that you said. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But Mr Singh, if you wanted 
these aspects to be satisfied, you, Eskom.  It would be 
you, Eskom if they are not met and satisfied that you would 
not sign the contract.  I mean, McKinsey stands to be 
benefit.  It can ignore this thing and signs the contract, 
render services and get paid.   
MR SINGH:   No, mister ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But it is to your benefit because the 
demand or the request for these conditions or these 
20 
aspects to be met, it is – it comes from you. 
MR SINGH:   I agree, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I want to deal with one of them but 
let me give you a chance to just address the Chairperson.  
What do you say to that? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 197 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he says he agrees. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And one of them, it seems, was 
never fulfilled which is: 
“The 
development 
of 
a 
BEE 
partner 
(Regiments Group) as regards the vision, 
aspirations, skills and competency needs and 
overall plan for success over the contract 
10 
duration including a focus on the health of the 
relationship with McKinsey...” 
 
They told you in the letter of 25:  We are not 
taking Regiments as a partner but we are contemplating 
taking Trillian but subject to the due diligence.  And then 
on the letter of the 30 t h, they said:  We are not taking even 
Trillian because they failed our due diligence process.  
That condition was never fulfilled.   
MR SINGH:   And I agree. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   In which case, then have you got any 
reason why Eskom would have signed the agreement with 
McKinsey even if one of those requirements, as part in 
your letter, including that one was not satisfied? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, as I have said.  I have no 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 198 of 240 
 
personal knowledge as to when this document was signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   And under what conditions it was or it was not 
signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   All I can say is, factually yes, I did sign the 
letter.  Yes, it had a condition in it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   But if you look at the specific condition that 
Mr Seleka refers to.  In their letter they do say, as you 
10 
said, the relationship is under review and the annexure to 
the SLA allows for multiple or additional – how can you call 
it - ...to be considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   That is the first point.  The second point is.  
When they did inform us that it was going – never – it was 
not going to be Trillian, they came with other options in 
terms of an SDL partner.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
20 
MR SINGH:   It was not on the basis that because that 
thing was not fulfilled that there would no agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   Because they came with other options, right.  
According to Dr Weiss, I think, they came with the 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 199 of 240 
 
proposals right up to September, I think.  August or 
September with proposals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what do you say to this proposition 
that...  Or let me put it this way.  Is the position not that 
you 
as 
Mr 
Singh, 
as 
the 
author 
of 
that 
letter 
of 
19 February 2016, you would have been surprised if Eskom 
or Mr Mabelane signed the agreement even if one of those 
requirements, such as the one that Mr Seleka has named, 
has not been satisfied? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, ordinarily, I would probably be 
10 
surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   If in the absence of this table(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:   So the letter of the 19 t h was issued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   McKinsey responded.  Then there was 
subsequent...  Now these, the letters were, as I said, or 
the responses were discussed and the Steer Co took 
certain positions.  So as I said, ordinarily, if I had issued a 
20 
letter and if I was dealing directly, then I would expect a 
response and I would be the one that decides or makes a 
decision.  But in this case, Mr Chair, there was a Steer Co.   
 
There 
was 
additional 
information 
that 
was 
discussed at this table.  And then there was Mr Mabelane 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 200 of 240 
 
that decided to sign or not sign.  And in my view, given the 
context of the discussions of the Steer Co, Mr Mabelane 
must have signed or decided to sign with whatever date.  I 
am not sure.   
 
But I do not recall Mr Mabelane expressly 
coming to me and say:  Listen, these five things we have 
problem with.  Must I or must I not sign?   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   So that did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SINGH:   Well, if it happened, I do not recall it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have – you expected him to 
come to you and deal with that question if there was one or 
more of the requirements that had not been met, is that 
right? 
MR SINGH:   No, no.  Mr Chair, I am saying.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I accept that you are saying you cannot 
recall whether ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR SINGH:   No, I – what I am trying to convey is that.  In 
the absence of the Steer Co where these things were then 
canvassed that allowed Mr Mabelane to understand what 
was happening, I would not expected him to sign without 
engagement. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 201 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Because he would have not known. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With or without seeing the – you see 
Steer Co or whatever. 
MR SINGH:   No, no.  I am saying.  In the absence of the 
Steer Co ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
you 
would 
have 
expected 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   ...I would have expected him to come to me 
and say:  Listen, we have issued(?) this thing.  Can I  or 
10 
can I not sign? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  But because the Steer Co was in 
operation and these issues were discussed at the Steer Co 
and Mr Mabelane was part of the Steer Co, we would have 
either discussed them and decided on them and that would 
have formed Mr Mabelane’s mindset at the time regarding 
whether he could or could not sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Without coming back to you. 
MR SINGH:   Without coming... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  But you have no personal 
knowledge of ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   I do not...  One, I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no knowledge whether he 
signed with them having been satisfied, all of them, or 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 202 of 240 
 
without them – without one of them or maybe more being 
satisfied?  Or is the position that you accept that one of 
the – one or more of the requirements set out in your letter 
was not satisfied but there may have been a reason that 
persuaded Mr Mabelane to sign even if that was – that one 
was 
not 
satisfied 
because 
of 
the 
discussions 
that 
happened at Steer Co? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think it is the latter proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Singh, I am sure 
10 
Mr Mabelane, he is going to tell – to you as to whether or 
not this requirements were met because you heard the 
matter, they wrote it back to you.  You need to tell us what 
you know because you communicated directly to McKinsey 
and not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I thought he accepts that he has 
no knowledge – he is not in a position to say they were all 
met. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, if you – well, let me put it this 
way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   If you read – if you have a reading of the 
letter, the response.  There are no issues – McKinsey does 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 203 of 240 
 
not take issue with any of the requests, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   S on face value, they – all the requirements 
were met, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   When we go into Steer Co, there is one of the 
Steer Co minutes that reflects that we do not believe that 
McKinsey has addressed all of the issues holistically.  So I 
think that is something – there are some minutes to that 
effect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   But if you had to go and read the letter, all of 
the 
requirements 
were 
met. 
 
So 
they 
have 
not 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   They have not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  You cannot answer the 
question like that Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there is the question of what your 
20 
personal knowledge is, okay? 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether they were all met or they were 
not all met.  And then there is a question of what your 
source of knowledge is, okay? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 204 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you say:  I am only relying on this 
document and this document and I interpreted it to say 
they were all met.  That is one thing.  But you might say:  I 
do know that irrespective of this document, they were all 
met.  I understand you to be saying – I do not understand 
you to be saying that from your personal knowledge you 
know that they were met.   
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I mean, the letter is addressed 
to.  So this letter ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Leave out the letter for now.  In terms of 
just knowing what happened.  Do you or do you have 
knowledge whether all those requirements were met?  And 
then you can go to the letter.  Or in terms of what was 
happening, were you sufficiently involved to have personal 
knowledge whether they were met? 
MR SINGH:   That is what I was getting to Mr Chair.  I 
mean ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
The 
letter 
that 
was 
signed 
by 
me 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...obviously I have got some knowledge of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 205 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   And then the response would have come to 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the response from McKinsey(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So I have personal knowledge ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...of the fact that I – the letter will come to 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Because it is addressed to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   As I then said.  If you have regard to the 
response in terms of each of the issues that was raised. In 
principle, they did not reject any of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   So from that perspective, Mr Chair, I am 
saying that they have acceded to each of our requests.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   First point.  Second point, at some Steer Co 
20 
thereafter, we did raise the concern that in the responses 
that McKinsey had given us notwithstanding the fact that I 
agree that they in principle agreed to each of the issues, 
there will still be a need for us to understand how this 
thing will holistically fit into the – let us call it master 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 206 of 240 
 
services or top engineers programme and that concern was 
raised, I understand.  So that is what I have personal 
knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying to me at a certain 
stage after you had received the response, their response, 
Eskom was not satisfied that they had met all the 
requirements. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And on the one, Mr 
10 
Singh, on which you agree with me was never met, Dr 
Weiss, which is the BEE partner, Dr Weiss – Chair, I am 
just going to refer to paragraph 74 of Eskom bundle 14 
page 700. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we need to go there or not really? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will read it to you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because he talks about …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, where is it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, page 700, of Dr Weiss’ 
20 
paragraph 74, maybe the Chairperson can go there as well. 
MR SINGH:   Paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 74.  Essentially what he is 
saying is: 
“The contract was ultimately terminated without 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 207 of 240 
 
McKinsey being able to appoint another supply 
development partner.” 
So you will see it is right towards the end of the paragraph.  
I will read: 
“The proposal and discussions we had with Eskom 
about this fund…” 
They established a fund. 
“…anticipated that McKinsey and Eskom would 
decide together on new partners on the allocation of 
the fees that had accrued.  Given the short period 
10 
of time …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   700. 
CHAIRPERSON:   700, okay, continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 74. 
“Given the short period of time between McKinsey’s 
proposal of the SD and L fund and the termination 
of the turnaround programme by Eskom’s board in 
June 2016, we ultimately were not able to identify 
any new partners prior to the termination of the 
20 
turnaround programme.” 
So that requirement was in fact never ever fulfilled.  Do 
you see that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the issue of the letter spoke 
…[intervenes] 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 208 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it a yes or no to my question? 
MR SINGH:   No, in the context of the way that you are 
presenting it, Chair …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the way he is, not me. 
MR SINGH:   Ja, well, the way that he is presenting it, 
Chair, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Let us get this right, you are putting to me 
that the condition was not fulfilled because of what he is 
saying.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And I am saying what he is saying does not 
equal what you are asking.  So you are putting a proposal 
to …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, what is your answer? 
MR SINGH:   And I say …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Give your response, yes. 
MR SINGH:   And I am saying the letter that we wrote on 
the 19 t h start to understand certain issues relating to BEE 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which letter are you talking about now? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which letter are you talking about? 
MR SINGH:   The 19  February letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 19 February, your letter? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 209 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes, my letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   Sought to understand certain issues relating 
to BEE and how they were going to integrate and what 
benefits will come out of it for them, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought – I did not – I did not – I am 
not sure that I understood you to seek a clarification, I 
thought it put requirements to say this is what we as 
Eskom wants. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So what I am trying to get to is that it was not 
Trillian specifically, it could have been any BEE partner 
that we were engaging in, in terms of the February 19 
letter and therefore, when we – when the decision was 
made by McKinsey to say there is going to be no Trillian, 
the discussions around the BEE partner so confused 
because it was not as if that condition specifically related 
to Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think what Mr Seleka is saying to 
20 
you is Dr Weiss is saying in paragraph 74 at page 700 that 
by June 2016 they had not been able to identify any 
partner who could have taken the place of Trillian. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore Mr Seleka is saying that 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 210 of 240 
 
means that if one follows the requirement of your letter of 
19 February, that one of those requirements which you said 
in the letter had to be met before the agreement to be 
signed had not been met as at June 2016.  That is the 
point he is making and he is inviting to say whether you 
disagree. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think you cannot go from here to 
the proposition that you are making because the agreement 
may have still been signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, remember the proposition 
10 
that 
he 
is 
putting 
to 
you 
as 
formulated 
by 
me 
is 
…[intervenes] 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
Which 
is 
in 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your letter – is your letter of 19 
February. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Said there cannot be signing of an 
agreement unless all these requirements are met. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now we see that on Dr Weiss’ 
version as at June one of those requirements had not been 
met according to him.  Therefore, if your letter was to be 
complied with, Eskom could not have signed unless they 
were to act in breach of your letter. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 211 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:   No, I agree, Mr Chair, and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree with that, ja. 
MR SINGH:   And, Mr Chair, it is – again, let me come back 
to this point and say it is common cause that the letter was 
signed because there is a physical signature …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The agreement. 
MR SINGH:   Ja, I mean, sorry, was signed because there 
is a physical signature that appears there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:   Okay?  Of both Dr Weiss and Mr Mabelane. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So whether the conditions relating to my 
letter with either fulfilled or not, is immaterial because the 
contract was actually signed.  The question, when was it 
signed?  Was it signed in October or was signed sometime 
in the first six months? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the signing of the – whether the 
agreement was signed in breach of the requirements as set 
out in your letter, probably would not be immaterial but for 
present purposes, that is hard fact, okay?  Is the position 
20 
not that if the requirements in your letter had not been met 
as at June then based on your letter – and not on 
something else and maybe we can look at whether other 
factors might override this but based on your letter, one 
would expect that no agreement had been signed by Eskom 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 212 of 240 
 
because your letter had been clear, those requirements 
must be met.  But that is separate from saying are there 
other factors or events that happened which might have 
overridden 
your 
requirements 
in 
your 
letter. 
You 
understand that?  In terms of simply looking at your letter, 
one would expect Eskom not to have signed by June if one 
of those requirements had not been met but it may well be 
that certain developments had occurred which might have 
persuaded Mr Mabelane to sign even if that requirement 
had not been met. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Agreed, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree, ja.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And just to clarify 
this, Mr Singh, that one requirement says the development 
of a BEE partner (Regiments Group) as regards the vision.  
So it appears to have been very specific.  It may not have 
been to Trillian but it was definitely to Regiments, specific 
to Regiments. 
MR SINGH:   Where are you reading from, Sir? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your letter of 19 February, number 4. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Singh, we are all going to remember 
your letter of 19 February for a long time. 
MR SINGH:   It seems so, Mr Chair.  It seems so, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As well as …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   It is becoming an infamous letter. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 213 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   As well as Dr Weiss’ letter of 28 June. 
MR SINGH:   Of 28 June, yes.  So the question is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am saying you were saying 
earlier your requests were not specific to Trillian, the BEE 
partner request but it is in fact specific to an entity, 
Regiments Group. 
MR SINGH:   As in this – as that was applicable at this 
point in time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Sir, as it is relating to this point in time 
10 
because it says …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   If you look at it, I mean, at the end of the day 
we are also recognising Trillian, at the end of the day in 
the opening paragraph, so it could also refer to Trillian but 
my raising of these issues, Mr Chair, in this letter or what 
my intention was behind raising these issues, was to 
understand how was or what was the actual plans to give 
effect to the intention that an SD partner partnering 
McKinsey would result in a let us call it an empowered 
20 
consultancy firm, right?  And the reasons these issues are 
raised here, Mr Chair, comes from the issues that Ms 
Goodson has raised in the past relating to how McKinsey 
had treated, either you want to call it Trillian – well, 
Goodson was Trillian, so relating to the complaints that Ms 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 214 of 240 
 
Goodson had raised vis-à-vis McKinsey and the way that 
McKinsey 
had 
been 
engaging 
with 
Trillian 
as 
their 
subcontractor for potential supply.  So that is the intention 
behind raising it.  The issue was to get a very clear and 
concise answer in terms of how our objective relating to SD 
would actually realise at the end. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, all I wanted to place on record 
because you were saying your requests were not specific 
to a particular BEE partner. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am saying that your letter was.  That 
is all I wanted to place in record. 
MR SINGH:   Yes and I am giving you a response as to why 
it was specific because it was specific to the company at 
that point in time but had it changed over the life of the 
MSA, the point would still be, I want to know, as Eskom, 
how are you going to develop these people, whoever they 
may be but at this point in time it is either Regiments or 
Trillian as the letter is alluding to.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, should we carry on until half 
20 
past six or less? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we should have talked at four 
o’clock, actually.  You know, we normally talk at about four 
o’clock.  I would like us to go as far as we can today so 
that – to the extent that we do not finish today, we should 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 215 of 240 
 
finish tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously I am interested in hearing 
what you have to say, what Mr Singh has to say and what 
this counsel has to say but particularly because of the time 
that we lost in the morning I would like us to go as far as 
possible.  You know, Mr Singh has been coming here for 
quite a few times.  I know he will still come back for 
Transnet and he might still even if we do cover a lot of his 
evidence tomorrow, there might still be a little bit that he 
10 
comes back for but we are in April and the intention was to 
finish all oral evidence by end of March, so we – so I am 
trying to push as much as possible so that he can finish 
because I do not want to go into May. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may – well, there is already one or two 
witnesses in regard to [indistinct – dropping voice] a date 
or two for May, but I do not want to go into May with oral 
evidence, I want us to finalise.  So counsel for Mr Singh, 
you have heard what I say. 
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I would be the last 
person to indicate to you that you should not use as much 
time as you do but my – I have already placed on record 
that over the weekend we were served with extra papers.  
Reading those papers I understand from my client took 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 216 of 240 
 
most of yesterday because then I think on a Saturday 
evening he got a whole bundle of annexures.  Based on 
that, the client then had to go and read other documents to 
place it in context.  If you work throughout the weekend, 
and in fact he started on Friday, I do not think it is fair to a 
witness and Chairperson, you know it yourself from 
practicing, to keep a person that is tired in a box and keep 
on 
pushing, 
pushing, 
pushing, 
people 
lose 
their 
concentration and was it dependent on me I would have 
said it is – let us try and push through but at this point I 
10 
would rather let us start tomorrow early.  I think we have 
made up two hours of the hour and a half we lost this 
morning.  I would much rather that we start tomorrow 
morning early and give my client an opportunity to – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, even if we had started on 
time, my plan was that we were going to go into the 
evening, so there is that part but if and when a witness 
says I am tired, I am not so [indistinct – dropping voice] I 
will stop but I do not think Mr Singh will say that if he is 
not really tired [indistinct – dropping voice].  So I am quite 
20 
happy to say if and when Mr Singh says look, I am tired, I 
am happy that we adjourn, that we will because it would be 
unfair to continue. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, may we take 
maybe two minutes of your time, if we can adjourn for two 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 217 of 240 
 
minutes, let us just confirm with our client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So but it is important that we 
all do the best.  I know that certainly there has been 
cooperation in terms of us working into the night to try and 
finish but we have been – we have sat for about close to 
two hours since the last break so maybe it is fine, let us 
take a break and then we will talk about – we will finalise 
the subject when we come back.  Okay, let us take a ten 
minutes adjournment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV VAN HEERDEN:  Chairperson, Mr Seleka undertook to 
deal with two questions.  He said he is going to be finished 
before half past and we conceded to that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I must decide.  You said if it 
depended on you we could go on for some time.  
ADV VAN HEERDEN:  But the client is tired, he actually 
wanted ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you, what is your situation Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Singh, I would appreciate ... sorry, Mr 
Chair.  I would appreciate ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN HEERDEN:  You see, he is really tired.   
MR SINGH:  If we could adjourn early today. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 218 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAN HEERDEN:  And tomorrow is probably, you know 
we could go on a bit later tomorrow.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so you - how much else do you need 
to deal with with regard to Mr Singh in terms of issues? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Other than the MSA? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, no I thought we could finish the 
McKinsey matters when I was saying at half past six 
enquiring with the Chairperson at that time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Exactly during that space of time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which was about 25 minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That would have left us with the Tegeta 
matters, the Tegeta transactions which we have led 
evidence on them previously before the commission and I 
envisage that we could run quite fast with her on those 
matters in the morning tomorrow.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Look, we have reserved for 
tomorrow to try and finish Mr Singh’s evidence, but last 
week I did postpone to tomorrow Ms Norma Gigaba’s 
evidence for the evening session.  So we do have some 
time but if indications are that we should finish with Mr 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 219 of 240 
 
Singh’s evidence by lunch time, then there might be no 
need for us to try and go too far this evening, because 
then we will finish early and maybe still have some hours.   
 
So what is your assessment if we finish the issues 
that, two issues that you talked about to council for Mr 
Singh, how much time do you think we would need? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think we will need the whole morning 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  A whole morning? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  No, that is fine.  We are at 
quarter past six now.  We go on until half past or you would 
like, provided Mr Singh agrees and his counsel to go up to 
quarter to, so that you finish those two issues and then 
tomorrow we start on Tegeta or what is the position? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so now it will be well, I should not 
only 
mention 
Tegeta, 
because 
the 
travel 
agent 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Issue should also be touched upon. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I can finish, I think we can finish 
the McKinsey matters now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  In, I have anticipated 30 minutes.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 220 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Roughly, I do not know whether 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Can we try that counsel for Mr Singh, 30 
minutes?  Mr Singh, would that be fine? 
MR SINGH:  Ja, let us give it a try.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us give it a try.  If you feel that you 
have become too tired, let me know.  There is no intention 
to force you to testify even when you are tired because you 
are the only one on that hot seat.  
10 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair, 30 minutes would be alright.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine counsel?  Okay, alright.  So 
let us continue.  Maybe we might finish around quarter to 
seven. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, we might finish earlier than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh, Eskom bundle 14 Mr Singh, 
page 769 ...[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Chair, I do not know if that light has 
moved or something has happened, because ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is it interfering with you? 
MR SINGH:  It was not before.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Can somebody adjust it or 
...[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:  That is fine. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 221 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will that be fine? 
MR SINGH:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, back upon that service level 
agreement.  
MR SINGH:  What page reference was that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 769.  This is going to go fairly 
fast Mr Singh.   
MR SINGH:  Maybe I should take long to turn to the page.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  769. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you in the right bundle? 
MR SINGH:  I am there sir, ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 22.  The PFMA requirement.  
So the clause reads, Chairperson you are there?  Is the 
Chairperson there as well? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 769 I am there, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What document is this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is the same service level agreement 
20 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Clause 22 of this agreement, PFMA: 
“The parties acknowledge that the employer is 
obliged to comply with the provisions of the PFMA.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 222 of 240 
 
In light thereof, the parties acknowledge that the 
employer will not require, will not be required to 
(and the employer warrants and represents to the 
contractor that it shall not take) it shall not take any 
steps contemplated in this agreement including the 
execution of this agreement, unless and until it has 
secured any approvals or consent that may be 
required in terms of the PFMA.” 
 
Now 
when 
Mr 
Koko 
was 
here 
Mr 
Singh 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, who is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  When he was here he said this MSA or 
SLA should never have been concluded because Eskom did 
not obtain the national treasury approval to conclude, to 
appoint McKinsey on a risk basis as opposed to a tariff 
basis.  I suppose you do not disagree with him. 
MR SINGH:  The question is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The question is ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you agree or disagree with Mr Koko’s 
evidence that this agreement should not have been signed 
because 
the 
approvals 
contemplated 
in 
Clause 
22 
approvals in terms of the PFMA were not obtained.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, in terms of I have not seen Mr 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 223 of 240 
 
Koko’s evidence in detail regarding this aspect, but from 
what I can recall, again Mr Chair, these issues were not 
within my personal knowledge as I have explained before 
to my interactions at the parliamentary enquiry.  I had to 
gather this information. 
 
So one of the annexures that we have submitted 
through the affidavit that we received this morning is 
actually an email from national treasury that confirms that 
the practice norm that was applicable at the time, allowed 
for this base contract.  
10 
 
So that is what Eskom had relied upon at the time 
to ensure that the basis on which this contract had been 
included, was appropriate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure if I follow.  Did you, what is 
your answer to the proposition that if the approvals 
required in terms of the PFMA were not obtained, the 
agreement should not have been signed? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, if having regard to paragraph 22, as 
I understand it would normally apply Mr Chair.  These 
approvals would reference either Section 54(2)B I think it 
20 
is, of the PFMA where you would require specific approvals 
in terms of capital projects.  
 
Else it would reference mitigality and significance 
frame 
that 
would 
either 
deal 
with 
capital 
projects, 
procurement contracts and the like.  I do not specifically 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 224 of 240 
 
recall that there was a requirement, well basically the 
PFMA says you must comply with all legislation and to the 
extent that the prescripts of national treasury form part of 
legislation we would require to comply with.  
 
Hence I am saying if it is contemplated that the 
remuneration model of the agreement is contemplated in 
this Section 22, then I am saying Eskom relied on the email 
that it received from Mr [indistinct] of national treasury.  He 
was I think at the time the chief director in governance and 
monitoring in the office of the chief procurement officer 
10 
that indicate the required schedule was applicable at the 
time and enabled this type of agreement to be entered.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Without approvals? 
MR SINGH:  From my reading of the email ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR 
SINGH: 
 
He 
did 
not 
require, 
he 
did 
not 
say 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to approval. 
MR SINGH:  Subject to approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
20 
MR SINGH:  It said the practice note is applicable and 
therefore this contract can be, this type of contract can be 
entered into. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  It then went on to say listen, you must make 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 225 of 240 
 
sure of certain things, but he did not say you know what, 
send me a formal approval request that I would then 
approve for you to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh, what 
transpired in Court is consistent with what Mr Koko said.  
Which is that in order to appoint McKinsey on a risk basis 
contract that Eskom required to have the approval of the 
national treasury. 
 
He distinguished that appointment from what Eskom 
10 
did in regard to McKinsey in relation to their corporate 
plan.  He said the corporate plan was specifically on a 
confinement but on a fixed rate.  Well, the amount was 
agreed or the contract price was agreed.  
 
In this case it was on a risk basis.  That you are 
paid only if you achieve the outcome of the contract.  He 
said to the Chairperson the conclusion of the contract 
without the national treasury approval, was wrong,  it 
should not have been done.  
 
What exactly are you saying to what he is saying? 
20 
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair, maybe we should just clarify 
firstly.  The issue relating, when you say Mr Seleka that 
the court relied on the same assertion that Mr Koko is 
making.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  I say what was said in the court 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 226 of 240 
 
papers 
where 
Eskom 
sued 
McKinsey 
and 
Trillian  
...[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:  This is Mr Radebe’s affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say again? 
MR SINGH:  This is Mr Radebe’s affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It carried the same theme that there 
was no national treasury approval.  Mr Koko came here and 
said the same thing.  So I am trying to understand just in 
10 
response to that what are you saying? 
MR SINGH:  So firstly let me respond to your issue around 
Mr Radebe’s court papers. Mr Chair, Mr Radebe does 
indicate that national treasury approval was required, but 
not for the same reasons that Mr Koko alludes to, or I am 
understanding Mr Koko to allude to. 
 
Mr Radebe in his court papers and maybe we can 
refer to it if it is in the reference bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  We can go there, but from my recollection in 
20 
the interest of time, references, the email that I have just 
referenced, but basically what is down there, the emphasis 
that is placed on that email by Eskom in that it says it is 
arbitrary, right and also it is received from Mr Didifango 
and we do not know his position and we do not know if he 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 227 of 240 
 
was empowered to issue the email. 
 
Now Mr Chair, a simple Google search of who Mr 
Didifango is, would tell you as I have just told you, that he 
was the chief director in governance and monitoring in the 
office of the chief procurement officer of national treasury.  
So that is the weight of the position that he carried.  
 
Secondly, if you read the email as I said, it is quite 
clear that he does not say you require an approval for this.  
He says you can actually do it.  so the issue of the court 
papers is a separate matter vis-a-vis what Mr Koko has 
10 
allegedly assented, and I am not privy to the basis on 
which Mr Koko has made this assumption and maybe if you 
give us some time I will go and refer to it and I can come 
back to you and refer to it, but I know Mr Radebe does 
allude to the fact that national treasury approval is 
required.  
 
The basis on which they rely on the fact that 
national treasury approval is required, is the ambiguity 
between which schedule was applicable at the time.  so 
from an Eskom perspective Mr Chair, Eskom did engage 
20 
with 
the 
council 
in 
terms 
of 
understanding 
which 
remuneration model is acceptable, given the applicable 
practice note, and there was some ambiguity in terms of 
the opinion that was obtained but it eventually said you 
know, just ask treasury because treasury is the authority.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 228 of 240 
 
 
Okay, and there was then a second opinion that was 
obtained, if I am not mistaken.  It was actually obtained by 
McKinsey themselves, that effectively said actually the 
practice note is applicable and therefore you do not need 
approval.   
 
Okay, but notwithstanding that, Eskom thought it 
prudent to actually engage with National Treasury and they 
engaged with National Treasury in the form of a meeting, 
and the outcome of that meeting was this email that then 
was received from Mr Didikane on the 4 t h of February I 
10 
think, 2016.  
 
So that is the basis upon which Eskom relied on the 
fact that it had the necessary authority to enter into this 
space.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Singh, the starting 
point in regard to the requirement for national treasury is 
exactly the appointment on a risk basis in Mr Radebe’s 
affidavit.  That affidavit is in Eskom bundle, 14D.  Eskom 
bundle 14D.   
 
I will give you the page reference.  11, page 1194.  
20 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Seleka, you are at? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 79, on paragraph 79.  Well, 
Chair sorry can we start so that it makes sense.  Let us 
start on page 1193.  I will read from the last paragraph 
78.4. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 229 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just for the record.  State whose affidavit 
we are looking at and obviously the page.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying for the record, state whose 
affidavit we are looking at.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the page.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And obviously in what proceedings.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  This is an affidavit Chairperson of 
10 
Mr Phakemani Radebe.  There is a founding affidavit which 
was filed in the court case, number 22877/2018.  The 
applicant 
there 
being 
Eskom 
Holdings 
against 
five 
respondents; firstly McKinsey and company and the second 
being Trillian Management Consulting, the third being 
Capital Partners and then the National Director of Public 
Prosecution was also cited, as well as the fifth respondent, 
MMS Nxumalo and oh, the affidavit starts on page 1161 of 
Eskom Bundle D, and it runs all the way to page 1132 and 
is dated 29 March 2018.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  You said we must go to 1193.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes, yes Chairperson.  Page 
1193.  There are a couple of issues but I want to 
concentrate 
on 
this 
one 
of 
the 
national 
treasury 
requirement.  I will start Mr Singh rather at paragraph 78.3.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 230 of 240 
 
It says: 
“There was no cap or limit placed on what could be 
paid out under the master services agreement.  This 
is particularly concerning in light of the PFMA 
requirements mentioned above.” 
 
7.8, 78.4: 
“Finally there was also a current awareness that 
this agreement would trigger the duty to report this 
transaction to the minister in terms of Eskom’s 
significance and materiality framework and the 
10 
relevant PFMA provisions.  The minutes record that.  
a number of questions were raised with regard to 
the PFMA implications for this transaction.  In 
response the team advised that they were aware 
that the transaction falls within the materiality 
framework and that discussions around PFMA were 
in progress.  However, the minister was never 
notified of this proposed master services agreement 
either before or after its conclusion.” 
Paragraph 79: 
20 
“These was a further and a far more significant 
difficulty with this decision.  There was a further 
and far more significant difficulty with this decision 
to approve the conclusion of the master services 
agreement.  Eskom had not obtained national 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 231 of 240 
 
treasury’s approval for the intended deviation from 
the national treasury instruction 01/2013/14 on cost 
containment 
measures 
(the 
national 
treasury 
instruction).” 
Then it reads, 79.1: 
“At 
all 
relevant 
times, 
the 
national 
treasury 
instruction was in operation and it had been 
specifically incorporated into Eskom’s own internal 
policies through the Eskom position paper PPO3, 
signed by Mr Koko in August 2015.  As explained 
10 
above, the national treasury instruction and the 
Eskom position paper PPO3, required that external 
consultants may only be appointed as at prescribed 
rates, based on a clear business case and following 
a gap analysis, any deviations required national 
treasury’s approval under Section 79  of the PFMA.  
From early on in the negotiation process with 
McKinsey, Eskom officials raised the concern that 
the national treasury instruction did not permit risk 
based remuneration.” 
20 
Then we carry on, the next page, paragraph 80.1: 
“On 29 June 2015 Ms Veletti, the then acting CFO 
specifically recorded that the national treasury 
instruction must be complied with in relation to 
consultant rates and if an alternative methodology 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 232 of 240 
 
such as incentive based is used, we need to verify 
that it is permissible.” 
This letter appears at item 25 of the record bundle, and 
then on 2 September 2015 Mr Singh you would be there by 
that time, Mr Aziz Laher, Eskom group compliance manager 
and PFMA corporate specialist, addressed an email to a 
number of Eskom officials, including amongst others Mr 
Martin Bryce, Mr Prish Govender, Ms Mayabana, Mr 
Charles Kalima and various parties from legal compliance 
and professional services.  
10 
 
In that email Mr Laher specifically recommended 
that Eskom would need to apply to the national treasury for 
approval of the deviation from the national treasury 
instruction.  The email is in the record bundle.  Mr Laher 
raised 
this 
issue, 
yet 
again 
in 
an 
email 
dated 
14 
September 2015.  
 
On or about 27 October 2015 Mr Laher was called 
to a meeting in Mr Koko’s office.  the meeting was attended 
by Mr Edwin Mabelane, Eskom’s chief procurement officer 
of Eskom, Mr Prish Govender, Eskom’s then project 
20 
director 
of 
Blue 
Capital 
and 
two 
representatives 
of 
McKinsey, Mr Vikus Saga and Dr Alex Bryce. 
 
At this meeting Mr Laher was told to explain why he 
was holding up the conclusion of the master services 
agreement with his view that national treasury approval 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 233 of 240 
 
was required.  Mr Laher explained the restrictions imposed 
by the national treasury instruction and advised that the 
only way forward was to apply for approval.  
 
Mr Koko stated his intention to obtain an external 
legal opinion on the matter.  McKinsey also stated that he 
would 
provide 
their 
own 
view 
about 
whether 
the 
remuneration model was in line with national treasury 
instructions.  
 
If I may stop there, Mr Singh.  What we have read 
so 
far 
specifically 
deals 
with 
the 
national 
treasury 
10 
requirement if you were to appoint McKinsey on a risk base 
or risk basis.  So it is very clear and consistent with what 
Mr Koko said before the commission here.  
 
Your comment? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, as I have mentioned none of these 
issues that Mr Seleka raises, was within my personal 
purview at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  In terms of my response, I have given my 
response in terms of the reliance that Eskom had placed on 
20 
the two opinions as well as the email that was received 
from national treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I take that to be, I take that to mean 
that you are saying look, I do not have personal knowledge 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 234 of 240 
 
of these matters so I am not in a position to agree with 
them 
or 
disagree, 
but 
all 
I 
am 
saying 
is 
that 
my 
understanding is that a 75 note was obtained or email was 
obtained from national treasury which I understood not to 
say we needed approvals in terms of the PFMA for the 
agreement at the time.  
 
That is what you are saying, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  The allegations go 
10 
further with the opinions that are obtained by Eskom, which 
says approval is required and then by McKinsey where it 
says well, we are not sure but let us take a chance, let us 
proceed without an approval.  But of course McKinsey Mr 
Singh alluded earlier that they have come on record, 
saying they were misled by Eskom. 
 
Eskom said to them they had obtained the approval 
when in fact they had not obtained.  Is that correct Mr 
Singh, that is what McKinsey is saying? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, if we are going down this road 
20 
we are not going to finish before eight o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that because you are going to say no, 
that is not your understanding? 
MR SINGH:  Well, it is not my understanding.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of McKinsey’s version? 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 235 of 240 
 
MR SINGH:  Well, Mr Chair this is the reason ... if we are 
going, let me say this.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Whether or not they are right is another 
matter, but I was saying but you understand what I am 
saying. 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because you can come back and 
explain it tomorrow, whether or not they are right that they 
were misled, is another matter.  All I am saying is you 
alluded to that version that earlier that they said they were 
10 
misled into thinking that Eskom had obtained the national 
treasury approval.  
 
That is all I am saying now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you wanted him to confirm whether 
your understanding of what he said was correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That McKinsey said they were misled. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether that they were right in saying so 
or not, you are not going there now? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I am not going there.  We can deal 
with it tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you know that version of theirs. 
MR SINGH:  Yes I do Mr Chair and for the record I do not 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 236 of 240 
 
agree with it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, okay that is all.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will deal with it tomorrow, because 
then on page 1199 Chairperson, paragraph 87. 
MR SINGH:  1199? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1199, paragraph 87.  Then the affidavit 
reads: 
“Despite these concerns over the lawfulness of the 
10 
agreement, Mr Mabalane proceeded to issue an 
acceptance letter to Dr Weiss on 17 December 
2015.” 
So I mean, you know in this affidavit because of what you 
have said you have read it, where there is an exchange 
with an official from national treasury and a concern is 
raised as Mr Singh has said Chair, that where ... this is 
just an email.   
 
Whether it is a ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  It is here somewhere. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I know it is somewhere there.  We 
can go into it tomorrow, but first and foremost is the issue 
of the approval.  Does it mean you knew, or you said it was 
not within your purview?  So then Mr Koko had knowledge 
because he was in that meeting.  
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 237 of 240 
 
 
The policy was signed by him, dated August 2015.  I 
suppose well, let me ask you this whether you can dispute 
what he is saying about the requirement of the approval? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, as I said I am not too sure what 
Mr Koko said in evidence, but if I just had to have 
reference to paragraph 81.4, Mr Koko stated his intention 
to 
obtain 
an 
external 
legal 
opinion 
on 
the 
matter.  
McKinsey also stated they would provide their own view 
about whether the remuneration was in line with national 
treasury instruction. 
10 
 
Now if it is alleged as Mr Seleka is saying, that Mr 
Koko signed the instruction, I mean signed the policy 
document knowing that approval was required, in my view 
then an instruction would have followed from Mr Koko, from 
this meeting, to do the necessary that is requiring him to 
comply with the policy. 
 
Yet, his response here is his intention to obtain an 
external legal opinion on the matter, which then led to the 
opinions that Eskom had received, so in my view this 
indicates that notwithstanding the fact that he signed the 
20 
policy, there was some doubt in Mr Koko’s mind as to 
whether it was applicable or not, hence he sought legal 
opinion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 238 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He has cut a long story short Mr Singh, 
when he came here he was unequivocal, he was very clear 
to the Chairperson, Chair you will recall I even said that 
helps, that saves us three hours of going into the MSA, so 
if you go to his transcript the 29 t h of March 2021 that is 
when he testified. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I said at the end of the day I can 
only go on what is here and based on what is here it would 
seem that at that point in time there was some ambiguity in 
his mind, hence  he is requesting a legal opinion, because 
10 
if he was, as in fact it is what Mr Seleka says when he sat 
in this Chair then the logical thing to have done was to say 
Mabalane get the approval, or Bridge get the approval 
because Mr Nene is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you are not done yet, okay 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well that was the first point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh that was the first point, well we will 
20 
respect the arrangement, Mr Singh can he go into his 
second point? 
MR SINGH:   On the second point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second point Mr Singh is on page 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 239 of 240 
 
811, point 416. 
MR SINGH:  Of this bundle?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of that – no sorry, sorry Chair.   That 
is on Bundle 14. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair I think Mr Seleka requires some 
rest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think he needs some rest? 
MR SINGH:   I think Mr Seleka requires some rest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know he is the only one who has 
been standing the whole day. 
10 
MR SINGH:   That is true Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I envisaged Chair, I think I am going to 
propose we adjourn, I envisage there is going to be a lot of 
questions from this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then that is fine, let us adjourn 
then.   I think that it would be good if Mr Singh could get a 
chance to have a look at Mr Koko’s evidence that has been 
20 
referred to because in answering he has emphasized that 
he has not seen that evidence, so that tomorrow if he has 
picked anything that makes him qualify his evidence or add 
it  he can do so, so I guess that you would be able to 
indicate where he will find it, the relevant evidence. 
12 APRIL 2021 – DAY 372 
 
Page 240 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is already on the website.  That 
would be 9 March 2021. 
MR SINGH:   Are you giving me a date, okay that is fine, 
no I will find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you very much to everybody 
for your cooperation, let us adjourn now and tomorrow we 
could start earlier than ten but there is no point in starting 
earlier than ten if we are going to finish on time anyway, so 
should we make it ten o’clock? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think so ten o’ clock is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, we will adjourn then until 
tomorrow at ten. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 13 APRIL 2021
