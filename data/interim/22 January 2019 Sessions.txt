PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 22 JANUARY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Morning, Chair, are you well? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Agrizzi, I am well thank you.  Mr Pretorius you 
ready to proceed? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed I need to deal with the issue that I promised to 
deal with this morning first.  On Sunday this past Sunday a number of – or certain 
newspapers carried articles concerning evidence that Mr Agrizzi who was already 
10 
giving evidence before this Commission was yet to give.  It would appear that certain 
newspapers had access to a copy of Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit that is before the 
Commission. 
 
In some cases it may be that they did not have access to the affidavit itself, 
but were given information relating to the contents of Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit by certain 
people.  Obviously there was no problem whatsoever with them publishing articles 
concerning evidence that Mr Agrizzi had already given before this Commission, but they 
went further or some of them and published evidence that he was yet to give in the 
Commission. 
 
I want to start off by saying that I have the highest respect for many 
20 
journalists and editors and newspapers who conduct their business professionally and 
in accordance with the law and with due regard to other people′s rights, however, it 
seems to me that there are certain journalists, editors and newspapers who decided 
that they would publish information relating to Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit about which he was 
still to testify and did so in breach of the regulation that I already told everybody about.  
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 3 of 194 
 
It was end of last year.  That is Regulation 11(2) and (3) of the Regulations applicable 
to this Commission. 
 
(2) of Regulation 11 reads: 
″No person shall communicate to any other person any matter 
or information which may have come to his/her knowledge in 
connection with the inquiry or allow or permit any other person 
to have access to any records of the Commission, except 
insofar as it is necessary in the performance of his/her duties in 
connection with the functions of the Commission or by order of 
a competent court.″ 
10 
 
That relates to mainly the staff of the Commission, but it says no person.  
And then (3) says: 
″No person shall without the written permission of the 
Chairperson disseminate any document submitted to the 
Commission by any person in connection with the inquiry or 
publish the contents of any portion of the contents of such 
documents or peruse any document including any statement 
which is destined to be submitted to the Commission to the 
Chairperson or intercept such document whilst it has taken or 
forwarded to the Chairperson.″ 
20 
 
Portions of what Mr Agrizzi′s statement says which he had not dealt with 
where the subject of articles that were published over the weekend and that was done 
without any approach to me as Chairperson to grant permission.  I indicated last year 
that I would allow – grant permission and I was granting permission for publication after 
the witness has given evidence. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 4 of 194 
 
 
I do not know whether the journalists and editors and newspapers who did 
so believe that it was in the public interest that they publish what Mr Agrizzi was to 
testify about ahead of him giving evidence about it.  I can see nothing that is in the 
public interest in the publication of what a witness is going to say a few days earlier, 
when he is going to testify about it and it will be in the public domain. 
 
This is not a situation where a journalist thinks that information will not be 
made public and therefore it is in the public interest that, that information be published.  
This is a case where the journalist knows that this information is in an affidavit and the 
witness will testify about it and the witness is not going to be testifying in camera.  The 
witness is testifying in open – in the open. 
10 
 
So there is absolutely no public interest supporting the decision to publish 
that information, because the information would in a few days′ time be in the public 
domain after the witness has testified.  So what is behind the publication of a witness 
evidence that is still to be testified about ahead of such testimony, it seems to me that it 
must be either, because a newspaper wants to make money or they just want to be the 
first one to tell the public what the witness will say.  They see a scoop, but there is 
absolutely nothing in the public interest. 
 
The nation must know that newspapers and journalists would do that, are not 
doing it in their interest.  They are not serving public interest and they are serving their 
own interest.  You know that this information will be made public in a legal forum, in a 
20 
proper forum in due course, there is nothing hidden, but you want to publish it ahead, 
you want to be the first one.  You are not serving the public, public interest.  Whether 
you are an editor or a journalist. 
 
Unfortunately I think that we have to look at this conduct in its proper 
context.  The Commission was established in order to look into allegations of State 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 5 of 194 
 
Capture and corruption.  We have heard a lot of evidence about bribery and corruption 
since the commencement of the hearings of this Commission last year.  People who 
engage in bribery and corruption do not do so, because they do not know what the law 
is.  They know that what they are doing is against the law, but the law is for them an 
inconvenience for what they want to do. 
 
They want money and they want a lot of it and sometimes they want power 
and they want a lot of it, and the law is standing in their way, it is an inconvenience, and 
because the law is an inconvenience they will disregard it and do something wrong and 
commit criminal acts.  Where does it start?  It starts with what some might think are not 
big issues. 
10 
 
I shared with the media and with the public last year what the law says in the 
Regulations.  No newspaper, no journalist, no editor has gone to court if he/she thinks 
that the law that says they may not publish the way it is indicated in the rules in the 
Regulations, if they think it is unconstitutional they have not gone to court to have it 
declared unconstitutional, which would be the right thing, if you think you have good 
grounds. 
 
It is not in accordance with the Rule of Law that any journalist or editor 
should decide, I do not care what the regulations say, I do not care what the law says, I 
want a scoop, I will publish anyway.  It is wrong, it is unacceptable.  It undermines the 
work of this Commission and for what?  For a scoop.  For making profits. 
20 
 
As I have said there are many journalists and editors for whom I have the 
highest respect.  I thank them and commend them for the good work they do and for 
their professionalism, but it appears that there are some who find that they will not act 
in accordance with the law when the law stands in their way of what they want to do.  I 
also want to say when the media have issues on which they want the Commission to 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 6 of 194 
 
comment before they publish articles, they must give us enough time. 
 
It has happened at least two times, and one of the times was the past few 
days when a journalist or media house plans to write a story and gives the Commission 
a few hours to comment or respond and before the Commission can respond they go 
ahead and publish.  It happened last year as well.  That is not a conduct of a journalist 
or newspaper or media house that is really interested in being fair to a body or a person 
about whom they want to publish. 
 
It is somebody who does not care about the rights of the other person.  
Sometimes people have had a long time to do investigations on an issue and when 
they are supposed to write they give the affected people a few hours to respond, as if 
10 
you have nothing to do, you are just ready, sitting ready to attend to their queries. 
 
My understanding of the basic principles of journalism is that they include 
fairness to the people that you are going to write about and fairness must include that 
you give them a fair opportunity to respond to what you want to write about them.  So I 
would appeal to the media, not just for the Commission only, but if you are going to 
write about people give them a fair opportunity to respond to what you are going to 
write about them. 
 
We regard the work of this Commission as very important.  We regard it as a 
national task.  The Commission has men and women who are very committed to the 
work they do who as – some of whom as you know have been subjected to all kinds of 
20 
insults in the media by certain people.  They continue to wake up every morning and 
come to the Commission to do their work. 
 
I think it is important that they be given support.  We would like to focus on 
the national task we have been given.  We would not like to have sideshows, to have to 
concern ourselves and spend time about what we do about media that is acting in 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 7 of 194 
 
breach of the law.  We would like to focus on the work at hand.  This work is about our 
country.  This work is about our nation and I would think that each and every journalist 
would bear that in mind, and that you would like that we be given space to focus on this 
work and one of the ways in which you do that is to please comply with the law. 
 
Please do not publish information in circumstances where you are 
undermining the work of this Commission.  Do not publish information in circumstances 
where you are acting in breach of the law.  Support the work of this Commission.  
Support the people who are devoting themselves to the work of this Commission.  
Support the witnesses who come to this Commission at great cost, some of them to 
their safety and to the safety of their families, because they appreciate the work of this 
10 
Commission. 
 
There is no reason why you cannot wait for a few days for the witness to 
deal with his/her evidence without it having been published ahead and then after the 
witness has given evidence you can write your articles.  You can do your analysis.  So I 
take this opportunity to appeal once again to the media not to act in a manner that 
undermines the work of this Commission, but to support the Commission. 
 
We obviously fully support the freedom of the media.  There is no doubt 
about that, but we appeal that we all act in accordance with what is expected of us.  
The Commission will continue to give full cooperation to the media in regard to what 
they may ask us.  We will continue to deal with their queries as quickly as we can in the 
20 
mist of everything that we are doing, and we just once again ask that the law be 
respected and that you support the work of this Commission. 
 
I hope that everyone will allow us space to just focus on this national task.  
Thank you.  The one other matter I want to mention is that while the evidence is going 
on this morning a media statement will be issued and I am sure the journalists who are 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 8 of 194 
 
present in the hearing will be given copies relating to the appointment of the acting 
secretary of the Commission.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Morning Mr Agrizzi? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Good morning adv Pretorius, are you well? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, I am thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is good. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi we were dealing with the evidence in your 
affidavit…[intervenes] 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At page 52. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When we adjourned yesterday. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Can we start today at paragraph 27.1? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, we can. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In that paragraph you deal with the matter preceding and 
ultimately the conclusion of a contract with the Department of Correctional Services 
relating to high security fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Would you begin with the events of 2005 and your 
20 
discussions with Mr Gavin Watson in this regard please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you, Chair.  In June 2005 I had informal discussions as 
we would always have, Chair, with Gavin Watson regarding various things and this 
specific morning it was about high security fencing at the Department of Correctional 
Facilities.  And I remember that the discussions were initiated by him and it was evident 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 9 of 194 
 
that he was aware that the department needed some specific solution in this regard and 
I was at that stage I did not know that they needed something, but it was mentioned to 
me and he saw it as a potential business opportunity for the company. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you have the capacity within Bosasa to provide 
fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Security fencing at that stage? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, we had never done fencing before, Chair, it was 
something new to us.  We have never ever put up a fence. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, did the discussion continue with more detail? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, we actually discussed it.  We said, listen we do not have 
the capacity to do this.  It was clear to me, sorry, does that answer your question? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Just go into more detail please in relation to the 
discussion?  In relation to paragraph 27.2. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, so it was clear that, you know, he had been thinking 
about it and I know that him and at that stage Danny Mansell was thinking about it, but 
anyway, he indicated to me that he had discussed the commercial viability with a 
gentleman by the name of Mr Michael Rodenburg from Beta Bastion. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is it Rodenburg? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Rodenburg yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, sorry I interrupted you, please continue. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not a problem.  It was at that stage Beta Bastion if I recall 
correctly and it then changed to Beta Fence during which the procurement of 26% 
shareholding of the South African branch of the company as a BEE was raised. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, just before you go on Beta Bastion which later 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 10 of 194 
 
became Beta Fence was that an international company? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And who would buy 26% of the South African branch of 
that company? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That would be, well that would be Gavin Watson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Was this proposal or contemplation processed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, it was. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Please tell the, Chair, what happened? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Do you want me to talk about the BEE deal?  Sorry, Chair, I 
just want clarity or can I take you through on what I say in my statement?  On how the 
10 
transaction was done? 
CHAIRPERSON:  He will clarify his question.  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, please just say what happened between Bosasa on 
the one hand and Beta Fence on the other. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, thank you, Chair, for the clarity.  So Beta Fence, I was 
one day at the office and Beta sent some test panels, so I do not know if, Chair, knows 
what the fence looks like, but if you look at the clear view fence, that is maybe the 
better, the best example I can give and I got quite a few panels delivered to Bosasa.  
They were delivered there and I asked, you know, what are these for?  And I was told, 
no, they – we need to look at how we can utilise them and are they up to the standard 
20 
that I would put out in the facilities. 
 
At the same time there was a taught wire system that was delivered to the 
facility and a taught wire system is basically a long box with barbed wire attached to it, 
at intervals strands, so if somebody tries to touch it, it triggers an alarm which goes 
through to the control centre. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 11 of 194 
 
 
So I had no clue what to do with it.  I really just – they stood in storage for a 
while, but then I later became aware of the fact that there was actually an agreement 
that had been concluded already. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, tell the, Chair, please what agreement was 
concluded?  Between whom? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The agreement between Beta Fence and Gavin Watson or 
Bosasa, I do not know, because it was actually Bopha and Parforgo which are trusts, 
but I will just use the word Bosasa.  So alright, the agreement had been concluded 
between them for the 26% deal.  So soon thereafter I attended a meeting with Watson 
was there, Mansell was there, Rodenburg was there, who is the Managing Director of 
10 
Beta Fence.  There was a gentleman an engineer called J P Hobbs and there is a 
gentleman called Riaan, but I cannot remember his surname, but he was also from the 
same company as J P Hobbs and during this meeting it appeared that J P Hobbs and 
Riaan were involved were involved in a company called Teqcon and Modutech.  Those 
were the two companies and what they manufactured Chair was the taut wire systems 
as well as a sensor which went on the wired mesh which was a detection process 
system, a detection product for the system.  What was interesting was I, I did not really 
know about it so I started reading up on it and I understood that the specifications that 
they used it for was high security applications.  So if you go to a facility that has a fence 
you have the Bode Mesh from Beta Fence.  Then inside of that you have the taut wire 
20 
system from Modutech.  So those were the two companies and then I started realising 
that this has been put together for a reason and this is why we are meeting. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just before you go on.  At that stage had the Department 
of Correctional Services published any intention or made known any intention to issue a 
tender? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 12 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, there was absolutely no discussion of that.  As a matter of 
fact at that stage they were actually under pressure financially, because they had used 
up their budgets and I was battling to get payments out of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is “they” now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The Department of Correctional Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Why would then this series of events that occurred?  In 
other words can you explain why Mr Gavin Watson would make all these preparations? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It becomes clear later that it was a, it was a ploy between 
Mansell, Rodenburg and Modutech, Riaan, J P bless him.  He is not here, but the other 
10 
people who were involved in it that was a ploy.  It was a plan to capture what was left of 
the fencing business at Correctional Services. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  May I carry on Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright.  I think the discussion really went specifically about 
how companies can work together and especially on getting a project with Correctional 
Services and one of them raised it that well perhaps what should happen is that 
Sondolo should subcontract to one of the other bigger companies and later the two 
companies, I mean, between Modutech and Sondolo they then become the prime, 
became the primary suppliers.  So Modutech did the taut wire and Sondolo did the 
20 
installation of the cameras, the metal detectors, x-rays, screeners if it was necessary.  
They did the installation of alarm systems all that type of thing.  So between the two 
companies they were the suppliers but at the, the third company was Beta Fence who 
would supply the welded mesh. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well whether by way of subcontract or whether 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 13 of 194 
 
by way of cooperation or whether by way of simply of becoming a supplier to the main 
contractor there was an arrangement or a contemplated arrangement at least that there 
would be cooperation between various entities with the prospect of supplying fencing, 
security fencing to the Department of Correctional Services. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  The additional thing is the beauty for 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, just before you go on.  Sondolo at that stage was 
Sondolo IT (Pty) Ltd at Bosasa Group Company? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Go on please at paragraph 27.6. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  At that stage there was a lot of controversy already 
about the Bosasa Group.  So I was not directly involved, but I am giving you exactly as 
I know it.  So Gavin, Gavin and Tony Perry and Danny Mansell negotiated with 
Michael Rodenburg and a lady called Jean Rodenburg, Michael Rodenburg’s wife and 
a lady by the name of Gloria Josephs alright to buy a company which was owned by the 
Rodenburg’s and Gloria Josephs called Phezulu Fencing.  I do not know the specifics 
of the actual agreement, but what I do know is that the sale was destined only to go 
through once the contract had been awarded to Phezulu.  That was made very clear to 
everybody.  It was public knowledge at Bosasa that we had to avert any negativity at 
that stage towards Bosasa and the only way you would avert this, because this is 
20 
massive contract one of the biggest fencing contracts ever done, you know, and 
because they did not want attention we said, they said alright.  Phezulu is there.  Award 
the contract to Phezulu and on top of that the sale would only go through of Phezulu 
once the contract had been awarded to Phezulu. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So that is the sale in broad terms of the interest in 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 14 of 194 
 
Phezulu Fencing (Pty) Ltd to Mr Watson or to …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  [intervenes] let us rather use – let us not personalise it I think 
Chair.  Let us use Bopa and Phafoga. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Those are two trusts in the group of entities under the 
Bosasa …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Control or management? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct and the sale would also only go through when the 
Duplo fencing, because we called it Duplo …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it was called the Duplo fence. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So this was – that was a fact.  It was done to hide that that 
Bosasa Group would receive any more contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Carry on please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Now during that period it was also agreed that Gloria Josephs 
who was heading the company and was a shareholder together with 
Michael Rodenburg’s wife and Phezulu would be paid a nominal fee of a few million 
Rands for the company, but then they would be allowed to subcontractors Gordian (Pty) 
20 
Ltd.  Gloria would have only really to appear in meetings as the Kwazi CEO as 
Phezulu’s CEO and she would basically just be there for name only, but the 
management of Phezulu was taken over from day one of the signing of the contract, but 
the shareholding would only come through later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright …[intervenes]. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 15 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That was maybe a bit confusing.  Did you want so say 
something Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if, if you say it is maybe confusing.  I am sure you are going to 
ask what I wanted to ask.  Go ahead. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us take it step by step then. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In order to carry out the arrangement that was now 
contemplated between these various role players.  It was contemplated that a company 
would be bought called Phezulu Fencing (Pty) Ltd? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  As I understand what you are saying it was contemplated 
to or decided that the shareholding in the company would only be transferred to the 
buyer the Bosasa Trusts once a contract had been awarded by the Department of 
Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  It would be a process - to add an explanation 
– it would be a process that would be undertaken undercover very quietly so that 
nobody really knew about it and nobody would question it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But the management of Phezulu Fencing I understand 
was immediately taken over by interests within the Bosasa Group? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  One of the shareholders at the time – that is before the 
shareholding is transferred in terms of the agreement – was a, Ms Josephs? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you say she was Rodenburg’s wife? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Incorrect.  Chair Mr Rodenburg’s wife was Jean Rodenburg 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 16 of 194 
 
and she was a shareholder as was Gloria Josephs. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Oh, I see.  Ms Josephs and Mr Rodenburg’s wife were 
both shareholders in Phezulu Fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Before the shares were transferred? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they the only shareholders? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, no …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, there were other shareholders? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There were other shareholders, but I cannot recall who they 
are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but do you, was your understanding that together they formed, 
they held the majority of shares or not? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Together Jean Rodenburg and Gloria Josephs held the 
majority shares. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And although their shareholding would in due course be 
transferred to interests within the Bosasa Group they would retain an interest in the 
arrangement I understand through another company Gordian (Pty) Ltd …[intervenes]. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And that company would subcontract within the 
contractual arrangements. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  So the agreement was – just to recap Chair for clarity – 
Bosasa would pay a couple of million Rand for the shareholding in Phezulu as well as 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 17 of 194 
 
agree to subcontract a large portion of the tender to Gordian.  That was the 
arrangement that was made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Were there other contractual arrangements made 
at the time before there was any talk of the Department of Correctional Services issuing 
a tender? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What were those arrangements? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You deal with them in paragraph 27.8. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  At the same time we entered into a supply agreement 
with Beta Fence whereby Phezulu, where at the time when Phezulu Fencing be 
awarded, is awarded the contract for the Department of Correctional Services for the 
Duplo or the double fencing Beta Fence would supply all fencing material to Phezulu 
Fence and it would be at a lower cost.  So it would be at base cost.  Now the Duplo – if 
I can give a little bit of history to it – is a normal mesh fence and we put an extra strand 
on the outside of the fence which gives it slightly more rigidity, but what it does do is it 
changes the makeup of the actual product which is then patented.  So in actual fact it 
was my idea Chair but Michael Rodenburg patented it and his idea.  It did not worry me, 
but just so you know the detail.  Nobody else could manufacture that fence because it 
20 
was patented.  So there was a premium price put onto it Chair so anybody could buy it, 
but they would have to pay the premium price.  Whereas the tendering, the [indistinct] 
that put this together basically had a price advantage of 30 percent already. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So that is because the agreement between Beta Fence 
and Bosasa and I use the latter term loosely was that Beta Fence would supply fencing 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 18 of 194 
 
material to Phezulu Fencing at a lower cost than it would supply those materials to any 
other company? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  To any other competitor? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And was there any quid pro quo or any …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Benefit to Beta Fence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Or to …[intervenes]. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Beta Fence …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Beta Fence at that stage was financially in trouble in South 
Africa.  They were literally in a bad state.  So they needed a massive transaction like 
this and at the same time they also needed empowerment.  So they had another 
company called Syngenta and unfortunately as I mentioned yesterday I did not have 
time to put everything in, but this company gave up their 26 percent shareholding which 
was then given to Bopa and Phafoga so that they would have empowerment as well.  
Not a sent was paid for the shareholding. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So as part of these complex arrangements Beta Fence 
20 
and another entity you mentioned, spell it please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Syngenta.  It was a group called Syngenta.  S-A-G-E-N-T-A 
[spelt]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, those two entities transfer 26 percent of shares in 
which entity? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 19 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Into, in Beta Fence? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In Beta Fence and it was transferred over to the two trusts that 
are held by Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and those two trusts as you have told the Chair are 
Bopa, B-O-P-A and Phafoga, P-H-A-F-O-G-A? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now before we go on, you have told the Chair of 
a very complex series of agreements, understandings and intercompany share 
transfers. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you say this was done in contemplation of a tender 
to be awarded by or a tender to be awarded, yes by …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Correctional Services. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But at this stage there was no public announcement of 
any such tender being issued. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Nobody even knew.  I do not think Corrections knew 
themselves. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Continue please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  After …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  Why do you say you do not even think 
Correctional Services knew themselves? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because it was a shock to them when the tender started 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 20 of 194 
 
coming out.  I remember attending meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but then who issued the tender then? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it was Corrections but maybe, maybe I should clarify.  
Maybe one or two individuals or three individuals who actually knew about it.  It was 
done totally, because remember normally this Chair would go through Public Works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Public Works is responsible.  So …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is that what would normally happen? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Normally …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Fences for Government departments? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  So if there was a need they would have to put a 
need in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Public Works would attend to it, but I do not want to digress 
into that.  I cannot talk about …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That too much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Hm, but what I can tell you is that in 2005 Chair I went to 
Bloemfontein with Danny Mansell.  We flew in.  I remember it because we nearly 
crashed the plane, because they overloaded it.  So it is vivid in my memory and we met 
with the Greylings at SA Fence & Gate and the goal of this meeting which I only found 
out when I walked into the offices of SA Fence & Gate from Danny Mansell that they 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 21 of 194 
 
needed to become subcontractors to Phezulu Fencing after it had been awarded the 
Duplo fencing Correctional Services Contract for the installation of the fences and it 
was not the only one.  That was the only one I attended, but other arrangements were 
made with a company called Live Wire, Gordian, Mavundla Ironclad and L & J Civils.  L 
& J Civils was a company that was owned by Mr Danny Mansell and Jarryd Mansell, his 
son, and his other son was…[indistinct] Mansell, but I cannot recall if he was a 
shareholder and there was a gentleman by the name of Jaco Pitso who represented a 
company which I just cannot remember.  This was over 14 years ago.  So the 
arrangement was what they agreed which I will still - and I was there - the 
aforementioned arrangement required each of them to submit separate tender 
10 
applications for the Duplo fencing tender.  So what I am trying to explain Chair is that 
the agreement was we are submitting as subcontractors for Phezulu, but at the same 
time we are also submitting as our own company.  So …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is that normal? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well, no it is not very normal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is not normal at all. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well when you say submitting as subcontractors, let us 
bear in mind that no tender or invitation to bid had been issued at this stage. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Nothing whatsoever. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let me ask you why would all these complex and 
detailed arrangements be entered into if there was no tender on the horizon? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The reason Chair is because – let us get our ducks in a row.  
This is the biggest fencing tender in the history of South Africa, Africa and probably the 
Southern Hemisphere. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 22 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The fencing was, what was contemplated was that the fencing would 
be done for Correctional Services throughout the whole country. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Originally the plan was to start with Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 
3.  Phase 1 would be the fence at 47 of the Centres of Excellence they call them to 
make sure that everybody sees them and at that stage as well there were quite a few 
escapes and that type of thing.  So this fence would prove as the solution, the utopia of 
how to run a prison and it is being applied in, it is a very good system being applied 
internationally and South Africa’s prisons would be the first in the world to have all of 
10 
them using this technology, but it was also the monopolising of the fencing contracts 
with Correctional Services, because once you were in you were in for life.  You 
controlled the source.  You controlled the client and you could rape our country of as 
much as you wanted to, because you just start charging more and more and more.  
That is a fact. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just clarify one answer you have just given 
Mr Agrizzi.  You spoke of the group of companies and entities who would act as 
subcontractors to Phezulu Fencing. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  If there was to be any response to any bid to be issued 
20 
in the future those subcontractors would be part of a bid on the part of Phezulu 
Fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But you say there was also an arrangement that these 
various entities would bid separately for any tender that was to be issued by the 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 23 of 194 
 
Department of Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, but perhaps I failed to explain that.  They 
would bid in a controlled manner. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, we will come to that in a moment. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say those companies that you are talking about would be the 
ones listed in 27.9? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Live Wire (Pty) Ltd, Gordian (Pty) Ltd, Mavundla Ironclad (Pty) Ltd, L 
J Civils (Pty) Ltd and you say there was another company which was represented by 
10 
somebody called Jaco Pitso.  You cannot remember the name of the company. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What you do not say in your statement and perhaps you 
can assist the Chair in this regard Mr Agrizzi.  Did anyone in Bosasa have any 
knowledge of what the intentions of Correctional Services were in relation to issuing 
tenders for the provision of high security fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Are you; sorry Chair I want some clarity.  Are you asking me 
did somebody in Correctional Services liaise with somebody in Bosasa and knew what 
they wanted out of this deal? 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There is the question, but let me just give you some 
background to the question. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So you can understand why I am asking it. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, sir. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 24 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There are two possible scenarios.  The Bosasa decision 
makers could have been very confident that they would persuade Correctional Services 
to issue a tender and therefore it would be worthwhile to go to these great lengths to 
prepare for the provision of such services.  Alternatively the decision makers and 
Bosasa could have known that such a tender was about to be issued.  Do you know 
which, and the former situation would arise where there was a degree of influence 
exercised by Bosasa over Department of Correctional Services Officials, but you tell the 
Chair if you know anything about…[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair this was …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was happening between Bosasa and Correctional 
10 
Services before the tender was issued. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair this, and I am being frank, because what you said this 
morning was so true.  I did not come here to be crucified by the press.  I came here to 
rid this country and to try and help free us of all the corruption that is killing us and is 
destroying our future of our kids.  So the answer is very simply this was …[indistinct] 
Correctional Service specifically Richmond Linda Mti and Patrick Gillingham would do 
as they were instructed as they had been captured by Gavin Watson, Danny Mansell 
and Bosasa including myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Does that answer the question? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am sure, I am sure if it does not Mr Pretorius will ask further 
questions if he wants you to give more.  So basically what you are saying is there was 
a discussion involving Bosasa and Correctional Services in the form of Mr Linda Mti 
and Mr Gillingham that had preceded this arrangements being made. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct and the rest of my affidavit …[intervenes]. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 25 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Will actually show on this specific topic …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  How it went about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  In regard to the tender about to be 
issued was anything done by anyone and Bosasa regarding specifications? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Mansell complied, compiled the specification documents 
for 47 of the Department of Correctional Services Facilities Chair.  This was for the 
fencing and the security.  He also did the specification for the taut wire.  So what he did 
10 
was he got the companies who would do the taut wire virtually to provide specification 
and print them and put them into the specification.  He personally sat and did them.  I 
know that.  I attended one or two of the meetings.  At that stage he was staying at the 
Cedar Lodge in Krugersdorp and he had quite a large room and he had often asked me 
to come over there and just have a chat with him in the evenings and I would go there 
and we would just talk generally, but I think he was lonely and he needed to talk.  Just 
like I do right now. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you have an opportunity to look at that specifications 
document? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I did. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And again just to confirm, did this occur before any 
tender was issued? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This happened before any tender was issued and I can add to 
this if you need me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, do so if it is relevant to what we are talking about. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 26 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is part of my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he also informed me at one of these meetings that his son 
was already working on the various correctional sites already now this is before a 
tender is even promulgated and he was doing surveys with a specific …[indistinct] light 
that we had bought and an engineer who we had employed unbeknown to myself and 
he was pointing out the various Correctional Centres already.  It was disturbing 
because how can you go and work on the site and rather let them do it, let them do the 
10 
spec and this happened long before the tender documents were even issued.  So those 
…[indistinct] light plans and that were ready before the tender specification was always, 
ever put out.  It is …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But not only, let us just summarise not only did Bosasa 
personnel compile specifications, but also had access to Correctional Services Sites in 
order to survey those sites in order to assist in the preparation of the specifications and 
any bid documents that would be submitted in the future. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair.  If I can give you an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It takes you on average two days to do say Johannesburg 
20 
Management Area.  We had 47 sites to do.  Take 47 times about two that tells you how 
long before the time more or less it was done. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well you say, well the other potential…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry Mr; I think he has not finished.  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am just giving you, I am just giving you how long 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 27 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Before it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because if you take 47 sites it will take you at least let us say 
just a day to do a site. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Say we are working really hard.  47 sites …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Times a day gives you 47 days 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are saying what is more likely is much more than that. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and if it took two days to do each one of them you are looking at 
probably more than 100 days ahead and probably much more than that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You are 100 percent correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Would you explain to the Chair what advantage that 
gave the Bosasa Enterprise in relation to this bid, in relation to the position other 
potential bidders would be in once tenders were issued? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the regulations are very clear that the bid must be 
advertised and there is a period of time that it must lay and the response must be in by 
20 
a period of time.  So I cannot recall exactly when the response was of the top of my 
head.  We can get to that later in my statement, but the benefit is that if I had done the 
surveys with the …[indistinct] light at all the facilities that would come out and tender.  
By the time the tender is put out I have done all the work.  The other people have to run 
around like mad to try and measure the sites and get the distances and all that 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 28 of 194 
 
accurately.  The advantage is here that the Bosasa Group through Phezulu and Bopa 
and Phafoga had the advantage.  We had headway before everybody else could even 
see the spec. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to confirm what I think you said already.  So the idea as you 
came to understand it was that for this particular tender that was going to be advertised 
in due course Bosasa did not want to be the ones who would submit a bid.  Phezulu 
would submit the bid and then Bosasa would benefit it effect and in reality through the 
arrangements that it would have made with Phezulu and with everybody else that you 
have told us about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  And that was because the negative publicity about 
Bosasa had already started, is that right? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So the idea as I understand it was that Phezulu Fencing 
would be awarded the bid and as soon as that occurred the shares would be 
transferred to Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well to the two entities Phafoga and Bopa yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Within Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Within – indirectly Bosasa.  It is all these various names and 
20 
that Chair is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So technically the shares would transferred to the trust?  I think you 
said two trusts? 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 29 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two trusts which fall under Bosasa or the Watson family, is that right 
or Mr Gavin Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You are hundred percent – you are hundred percent correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Technically that is what they would be – the shares would be 
transferred to those trusts and then what those trusts did with them then it was up to 
them and – but that was – they were – those trusts were part basically for all intents 
and purposes of Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You said it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 27.12 you deal with you particular tasks in 
10 
the bidding process.  You talk about the bidding process.  Of course we know from your 
evidence that there was no bidding process at this stage.  But what tasks were you 
asked to perform? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay I was asked Chair to oversee the bid – the bidding 
process.  Normally in the group of companies I would be personally involved with every 
single bid that went out of the company through the bid office.  So I was asked to put a 
team together to draft the tender bid and the submission thereof.  I requested that I was 
at that …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For Phezulu now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  On behalf of Phezulu. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja on behalf of Phezulu? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I requested that you know another team be put on the 
project because there were people available that were not busy.  That I was extremely 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 30 of 194 
 
busy it was a time when we were extremely busy operationally I was spending weeks 
away on the various catering sites and on the Sondolo Security installation sites.  So for 
me to get into the office to do the research to write up on fencing and especially 
because I knew nothing about fencing I actually did not enjoy it.  I did not want to get 
involved with it.  So they agreed.  It was agreed and – but it was told to me that from 
the management and directorate that I must still keep oversight.  They would release 
me from it but I need to be there for oversight and to make sure that the quality of the 
product put down at the end of the day was suitable.  So from my side I just maintained 
oversight and then what happened was I then learnt later on that the team that had 
been put together which compromised of certain people that had been recently 
10 
employed from a fleet management company that worked with Transnet I think it was 
called HAS.  So there was a team that we employed from them, put them in there, they 
then did the tender and the bid submission and it was done in conjunction with various 
of the representatives from the various other fencing companies.  Because remember 
by now the agreements had been tied up with the various companies to do that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So the preparations for the response to the invitation to 
bid were made in collaboration with various other entities that were to bid separately? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and did you see anything in this regard yourself?  
You deal with that in paragraph 27.1.3. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Interesting.  I attended the office and if you know where – if 
you had been to my office you would know that my office was on the right hand side in 
the executive block but the executive block does not have nice toilet facilities and I 
always liked to go through to the main boardroom where I would utilise the facilities 
there and make myself a coffee and then go back to work.  So one evening I was there 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 31 of 194 
 
working late and I walked through to the boardroom and I saw every single one of the 
companies as listed there – they were all working on the bid.  So in one of the 
boardrooms everybody was seated around the boardroom and they were busy working 
on the bid document and the submission of the bid itself.  I then raised a concern.  Two 
reasons number 1 is I asked “did you switch off the camera systems?”  I remember this 
vividly and it is not in my statement.  But I asked “did you switch off the camera 
systems?  Because if that is happening in the boardroom there was at that stage a 
camera in the boardroom.  I said it is not a good thing to show everybody, everybody 
sitting around the same table doing figures and I raised this concern with both Danny 
Mansell and Mr Watson.  But I – like everything else I was always told “do not worry we 
10 
have it all under control.”  Does that answer …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were the two also there or they were not at – in that boardroom on 
that occasion?  That is Mr Mansell. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They were not in the boardroom.  They were not in the 
boardroom at that stage.  They were outside the boardroom.  And then they actually 
came and sat in my office and they were in and out of my office as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say this was in the evening? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes it was one evening ag seven o’clock, eight o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just say again I might have missed it Mr Agrizzi who was 
20 
in the boardroom at that stage to which you refer? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In the boardroom were representatives.  I cannot – no I 
actually can – there were representatives of each of the companies that were part of 
the bid submission.  So it was Phezulu, Gordian, Life Wire.  It was Bosasa people who 
were in there? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 32 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mavundla? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mavundla as well? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mavundla Ironclad and Jaco Pitso’s company as well was 
there. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And was this …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  At that stage what was Beta Fence’s roll or 
had it fallen by the wayside? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No Beta Fence was there as well Mr Michael Rondenburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Beta Fence was there okay. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But he was interacting more with Mansell and Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but they were going to be – that is Beta Fence they were also 
part of the companies that – they were one of the companies that were going to be part 
of the bid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They were one of the companies’ part of the bid but they 
would not submit a bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because they were only a manufacturer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So present as I understand it were companies that would 
form part of the Phezulu Fencing bid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But would also – some of whom would also bid 
separately? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 33 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  It had to look authentic Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one was that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Some of the other companies would bid separately so they 
would put in a bid but then they would be told to put in a separate bid in their own 
companies’ name at a different price so that it would not look obvious that it is only 
Phezulu bidding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Those that were going to be sub-contractors I would imagine 
that Phezulu would disclose them in their bid to say in order to be able to execute this 
project properly and efficiently we will use the following companies as sub-contractors.  
So my question is, was your understanding that their role as sub-contractors was going 
10 
to be made known to Correctional Services and to whoever in terms of it being public? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I cannot recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot recall that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall it at all sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja okay but is my understanding correct that normally if you bid 
for a tender you would normally disclose whoever you will use as a sub-contractor or is 
that only sometimes? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is only in the times of bonafide tenders and bids.  This was 
caucused.  This was corrupt.  They did not have to follow any rules really.  It just 
needed to appear real. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought that Phezulu being the ones that would put in the bid 
may have wanted to be able to answer certain questions.  Maybe they might not have 
bothered about them being asked any questions in the circumstances like do you have 
capacity to do A,B,C,D if so how do you show us you have got the capacity?  So if they 
are going to sub-contract they then say we ourselves do not have that capacity but we 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 34 of 194 
 
are bringing on board a sub-contractor which has that capacity so if you give us the 
tender we will be fine.  I thought that then the whole scheme might still have 
contemplated that sub-contractors would be made public on that understanding but you 
are not sure? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was not normal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Before we move on to the next phase of your evidence in 
regard to the fencing tender let us just summarise.  At the beginning of the process you 
have told the Chair that Bosasa had no capacity to provide high security fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct we would never. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Certainly on the scale that was contemplated at the 
time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not just a lack of capacity actually lack of experience as well in this 
kind of job? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You are hundred percent right Chair and I will substantiate that 
by saying they had asked me to put up a test panel and it was a flop.  We could not 
even do ten meters of it, it was an absolute flop.  I had a maintenance guy by the name 
of Hennie Viljoen who is mentioned in the statement try and put it up it was a gemors of 
note. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You then described to the Chair an elaborate and 
detailed set of corporate arrangements in order to build capacity? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you have also told the Chair that there were persons 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 35 of 194 
 
who attended at sites to measure and calculate what would be required in relation to 
fencing quantity and perhaps quality as well? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  My question is simply, over what period of time did this 
take place? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As I indicated earlier I mean just look at the number of sites 
and times it by the days at minimum two, three months before a tender even was 
promulgated. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and this was all before the tender was 
promulgated? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Far before. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps after the break we will explain the relevance of 
that to the Chair.  May we take the short adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you we will take the tea adjournment and we will resume 
at half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
MEETING ADJOURNS 
MEETING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  You have told the Chair of the history 
of the preparations made in relation to the Correctional Services contract for security 
fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what you have told the Chair that took place over 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 36 of 194 
 
several months was all before the fencing tender was eventually advertised?  When 
was …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is – that is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When was the fencing tender advertised?  You deal with 
that in paragraph 27.14. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am just trying to find my space Chair.  25, 26, 27.14.  Sorry 
Chair I am taking my time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair if I can just mention I remember the other company now 
Mr Jaco Pitso’s company. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It seems to be jogging my memory.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Just for the record it was called Siyaya Fencing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Siyaya Fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that would be S-i-y-a-y-a Fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right when was the fencing tender advertised? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the fencing tender was advertised on the 14 November 
2005. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just check that date please.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  27.14? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 37 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  14 October 2005 it was advertised. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right by whom? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  By the Department of Correctional Services. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was the contract eventually awarded? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the contract was awarded to Phezulu on the 29 
November 2005. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is roughly six weeks after the fencing tender was 
first advertised? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So advertised 14 October, awarded six weeks later.  
10 
How long would each bidder have to prepare documents and submit? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Depends Chair if they would have to visit the sites.  Because 
when the tender is advertised they normally have a site briefing session that takes a 
day.  Then normally what happens is the bidders would have to go to site and 
understand the site itself, the 47 sites.  Now with the electronic GPS theodolite you can 
do it in maybe 47 days.  If you do not have a GPS theodolite it is going to take you 
pretty much longer.  So they were given six weeks to do it.  I can tell you now it was 
virtually impossible for anybody to put in a bid that was of substantial value like this in 
that period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your – the bid documents the information that any company that 
20 
wanted to bid for this tender would have had to include information about all of these 
sites? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 38 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would that be information that would be difficult to get unless 
you visited the sites or is it information that could be obtained by use of technology in 
one way or another? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The only technology that could have perhaps been used was 
the theodolite.  I do not think Google Maps was really working well at that stage so in 
today’s time you could perhaps do it with Google Maps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But that would still be a stretch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that was 2005? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was 2005 there was no Google Maps then. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So whereas Bosasa we know that on paper their name was not 
going to appear in regard to this tender? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in effect Bosasa and that was – that may have been intended – 
maybe I should say was on your evidence intended by certain individuals within 
Correctional Services to ultimately effectively benefit from this?  There Bosasa was 
given a number of months before even the tender was advertised or the bid – or bids 
were invited? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then anyone else would have had – or had only about six 
20 
weeks to submit their bid, is that right? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you.  Do you know or do you not know whether this short 
period that was given to everyone else was deliberately intended to minimise the 
chances of anybody else putting up any tender that would really compete with 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 39 of 194 
 
effectively Bosasa’s tender although in the name of Phezulu?  Or was this the period 
that was normal to be given for tenders? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it was not the normal period because everybody knew 
that this was very tight timing.  They could have given them – there are some tenders 
out at the moment I am busy working on one where you have a three month’s response 
time.  This was specifically made six weeks.  Not the normal thirty days but six weeks to 
say no but we have made it longer than normal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But with special reference to Correctional Services are you able to 
say what the normal period they normally allowed to bidders to put in their bids in 
regard to other tenders at that time? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At that time I do not want to speculate Chair but let me give 
you an example.  The PPP’s we had up to a year to put in a bid document.  On the 
catering tender I think it was thirty days on the one.  On another one there was sixty 
days so it varies from each one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You can see in this one there was specifically the time was 
limited for a reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You refer to the PPP’s what were those? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Those are Public Private Partnerships.  I headed up a 
20 
consortium to submit tenders for the building of the private prisons previously that was 
cancelled. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just go back to this six week time period.  One 
does not have to go into too much detail in relation to the tender process but a 
invitation to bid would be advertised? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 40 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Which  you say happened on the 14 October 2005? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There would then as you have already mentioned be a 
process of interaction between the various bidders and the Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There would then be the submission of the bid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then the bid would still have to be evaluated? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Go through several committees and finally be awarded? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So given the process that normally takes place in 
relation to tenders that six week period from advertisement to award is not the period 
for the submission of the tender or the response to the bid – invitation to bid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct it is actually… 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is a lesser period than six weeks. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair he is actually correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the period for the submission of the – of the bids from 
the time of advertising or inviting bids? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I do not have that information available.  I was not 
intricately involved with this bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   But what Advocate Pretorius just mentioned is a hundred 
percent correct.  There were four weeks literally left. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 41 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They must have used the minimum time.  So it was not six 
weeks it was four weeks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright thank you.  And then of course if it is four weeks – 
if it was four weeks then on your evidence there is simply objectively speaking no way 
that any bidder would have been able you say to visit all these 47 sites? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is not as if Correctional Services would not have appreciated 
10 
this, is that so? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the value of this contract was what? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was R486 937 910,00. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Half a billion rand? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well that was not the total value.  Eventually it – I mean it 
grew and grew and grew.  I cannot recall but that half a billion rand that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – was that half a – more or less half a billion was that the value 
that was known to everybody at the time of bidding? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was the submission value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You will recall earlier I also eluded to the fact that there is like 
with the other tender, with the catering tender I was not involved with the pricing of this 
one but basically you know there is ways and means that you get variation orders and 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 42 of 194 
 
you grow the tender.  And I cannot recall who the accountant was at that stage but he 
was – I remember they – a bright person but they manipulated figures as well if I recall 
correctly and I actually caught them out at one stage.  I will recall the name later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You say in paragraph 27.15 that this project ran its 
course but there was a further contract awarded.  Tell the Chair about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there was a maintenance contract.  So after you have 
implemented the fence you need a maintenance contract.  Like when you implement 
CCTV you need a security guard, control room contract.  So there was a maintenance 
contract which was supposed to run I think it was for three years thereafter and it was 
10 
billed separately. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And to whom was that contract awarded? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was internally awarded from Phezulu to Sondolo IT. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did this contract award go through a tender process? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Were you involved in the execution of the contract after it 
had been awarded to Phezulu Fencing PTY LTD? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I would – I would give oversight when I had to but it was 
not – I was not interested in it, I really was not. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right did you have anything to do with Beta Fence PTY 
20 
LTD? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes unfortunately I would have to attend on behalf of the BEE 
shareholders.  I would have to go to meetings occasionally I would take one or two of 
the directors with me so that we appeared as a company to be BEE. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and did you have anything to do with dividends 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 43 of 194 
 
arising out of the finances of Beta Fence PTY LTD? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes I did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What role did you play there? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair when you have a shareholder and they are entitled to 
dividends the dividends are normally paid into the bank account.  Correct.  The problem 
comes in when you have played games with the dividends – with the shareholding and 
where does the shareholding now – the dividends now get paid to because you talking 
considerable amounts of money?  So the instruction to me was to instruct the attorney 
that the dividends for – that would come to Bopa and Phofoga would basically be paid 
into the trust account of the attorneys which is Mr Brian Biebuyck. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well he might have held that trust account on behalf of 
the shareholders? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well that is – no that is not true Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And we know that the two trusts were 26 % shareholders 
of Beta Fence at that time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did it eventually transpire that the shares of Phezulu 
Fencing PTY LTD were transferred after the contract had now been awarded by 
Correctional Services into the names of the trusts Bopa and Phofoga? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Tony Perry was the company secretary at the 
20 
time and he arranged that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So Phezulu Fencing is awarded the contract and 
in terms of a prior arrangement Bosasa in its most general sense takes control and 
ownership of Phezulu Fencing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well in terms – that is correct to put it that way. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 44 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – do you know who were the trustees in the two trusts that ou 
have told about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I cannot give you the trustee’s names I am sure they are 
on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you know some of them?  Would you  not – was Mr Gavin 
Watson not one of the trustees or not really? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No I – Chair what I can tell you is there is normally about ten 
people that sits on various boards and that would have been one of those people 
because they get swopped around a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it suited them they would move around and this month it 
would be Joe Gumede next month it will be Carol Makele the month after that it would 
be Muneride or Livera and it would change so I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Exactly and unfortunately Chair I do not have documents 
available I rely on what I have got. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, that is fine. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well on paper we have as the real beneficiaries of the 
Correctional Services Fencing contract Phezulu Fencing and its shareholders, Bopa 
and Phafoga Trusts. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  From your own knowledge who was the real beneficiary 
of the contract? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well Gavin Watson and his family ultimately that is how it 
worked. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 45 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us move on then to page 57 and paragraph 28 of 
your statement.  You speak there of a meeting with Mr Gillingham in late 2005? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What happened there?  We are now dealing with a new 
contract? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, what happened was, it was in 2005 I was at the office 
and I bumped into Mr Gillingham for about the fourth time and Day Masso[?] was with 
him as a matter of fact and we were having a five minute informal discussion and one of 
the things that he raised was that the televisions were problematic in correctional 
facilities, because offenders are not there, because they are stupid, and they are there 
10 
because they are very clever.  So they would get TV agreements with these Early Bird 
and those high ring companies, who would put a TV in their cell and they just do not 
pay. 
 
It is very difficult for someone to come and fetch it, but there were major 
issues with TV′s and TV programmes that were watched at night and that was basically 
what he discussed with us and he said can I design a system where you have a 
centrally distributed TV management program that – let me try and explain that. 
 
So in other words, what would happen is, they wanted a system where each 
cell, right around the country had a TV screen that would be able to be programmed so 
that you could decide as the head of prison what they would watch, what volume you 
20 
would set it and what would be distributed to that television.  They wanted it a bit 
further, take it a step further to network all of these together and create a system 
whereby, for instance if the Minister who at that stage would want to speak to every 
offender, he could stand in one place and we would be able to stream over IP 
nationally. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 46 of 194 
 
 
So I designed a system like that for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You designed it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well together with assistance yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But the, can I continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just deal with the rating requirement please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, so the rating of the system would have to be an IP65 
which is Ingress Protection 65, which means that the unit had to be waterproof and 
vandal resistant, so it was a unit that we needed to make sure that nobody could break 
10 
it, nobody could tamper with it and nobody could splash water on it, because it will 
become very expensive to repair. 
 
Can I continue? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, and would you just tell the, Chair, when you 
continue how it came about that you received instructions to design this system? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well Mansell and Gavin Watson indicated to me that that 
department, because obviously they were talking a lot with Richmond Mti who was the 
Commissioner, Patrick Gillingham who was then made the CFO.  So they said that 
Correctional Services had surplus funds in their budget and they needed to use it 
quickly and the problem with that is, if they do not use their funding, this is what I was 
20 
told, it goes back to Treasury and it goes back into the big pot and somebody else will 
get to it. 
 
So what needed to happen was, they said to me I need to go ahead with the 
design of the television system and I must make sure that it has to incorporate a 
network that is interfaced, because in the future we can use that network.  So set up 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 47 of 194 
 
the infrastructure, the network infrastructure there and later on you can use that 
network infrastructure to – that you put in, to transmit the data on TV, which you can 
then use where you can at a later stage, you can then sell, on sell extra products that 
you cannot – sorry, to the system.  Sorry, I am born in South Africa, but I talk with my 
hands.  So unless I sit on my hands.  Sorry, Chair. 
 
So they wanted a network in there so that you could then plug in other value 
adds for instance, cell phone detection.  One of them was video, thermal imaging, 
because sodomy was a major problem.  We have been experiencing the same problem 
at the youth centres and you are allowed to, according to our law you are not allowed to 
put cameras where people change or sleep, but you may put thermal imaging in, 
10 
because you are not getting a clear picture, you are getting thermal imaging pictures.  
So that was one of the future plans as well. 
 
So the whole idea was to create this network using the TV camera systems 
and create it so that we could plug in other internet protocol devices.  Does that answer 
the question sir? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, thank you.  Were there talks at the time about 
computerising the offender management system? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, at that stage as well one of the biggest problems in, 
because we were working daily with Correctional Services, we understood their issues.  
One of the things that they had, needed, was an integrated computerised offender 
20 
management system.  So we were given the documents to design a system on what 
basis, on all the Correctional Services forms.  I think Gillingham actually spent time with 
some of our people in the IT division, actually designing a system. 
 
I do not know if it has been implemented yet, but it was a fully encompassing 
system that designed from the offenders court appearances right the way through to 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 48 of 194 
 
what to do with his body if he needed to be buried or repatriated. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You have told the, Chair, that you, in conjunction 
with others did in fact design such a system? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Your design I presume was incorporated in a single 
document? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did you do with that document? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That document was given to Danny Mansell and was – 
became part of a tender specification. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was it given to anyone else? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was, if I remember correctly, sorry I just want to catch up 
with my notes, you are going a bit fast. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 28.3? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, it was given – after the design was done it was given to 
Mansell and to Gillingham, the same process, but by then they had realised that I knew 
about it, so I would put it on a disc and just hand it over to them. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you then receive an instruction from Gavin Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was that instruction? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the instruction was that the specifications I had to draw 
up the actual nitty gritty specifications and the diagrams and the component level 
diagrams for the tender specification.  So I asked one of the manufacturers who is 
actually innocent in this, but I asked them to assist me in drafting the actual – because 
they are diagrams, they are plans, that type of thing, and that was Elandre Fourie from 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 49 of 194 
 
Pinnacle Micro at that stage. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You told us earlier on when we were dealing with the 
fencing…[intervenes] 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Projects that at that time the National Commissioner of the 
Department of Correctional Services was Mr Richmond Mti, is that right? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When this one was happening that you are now testifying about was 
he still the National Commissioner of Correctional Services? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Now what you have related to the, Chair, in relation to 
the discussions that took place involving amongst others Mr Gillingham in regard to the 
design of a system? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Which you have described and in regard to a preparation 
of a specifications document, when all this occurred had an invitation to bid been 
advertised? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The invitation to bid was only advertised after the planning 
20 
had gone into it, but …[indistinct] to the fencing won the bid.  Document was only 
issued out, advertised on 14 October 2005. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And at that time everything that you have narrated to the, 
Chair, about this contract had already taken place? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 50 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you receive an instruction to respond to the invitation 
to bid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Everything I did was based on instruction, Chair, that is 
correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did a Bosasa company respond to the invitation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was done through Sondolo IT which was a recently 
established company that was set up. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Now when you say Bosasa did not and Sondolo IT did, 
you already told the, Chair, about Sondolo IT, but let us just remind him.  Did Sondolo It 
have any relationship with Bosasa? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is one and the same, Chair.  The easiest way for me to 
explain it, Chair, is to say that every single company in the group has one bank account 
and that is a singular bank account.  So it all filters from all this, filters into one central 
bank account. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So Sondolo IT Pty Ltd was part of the Bosasa stable? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did you know when you received the instruction 
from Gavin Watson what the likelihood was of Sondolo IT being awarded the contract? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was a given. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, how do you know that? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because it was prepped before the time, it was – everybody 
knew that this was going to happen.  You know the famous words were do not worry 
about it my mate, I have got it under control we will get it.  That is how it went. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And was Sondolo IT Pty Ltd ultimately awarded the 
contract? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 51 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  On 3 March 2006. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is about five months in this case after the 
advertisement of the invitation to bid. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just go back a bit to the issue of one account.  As I 
understand you, you were saying there may have been a number of companies under 
Bosasa, but they shared one account, bank account, is that right? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That bank account who was the holder of that account, or which 
10 
company has its name on that account? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I recall correctly and I am sure I am right it was 
Bosasa Operations Pty Limited.  I never had access to that account, but I recall that 
was the account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The initial contract value of the contract in relation to the 
television services, what was that value? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was R224 364 480. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Was that the annual amount or is that the total 
amount certainly at that stage? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was as I mentioned earlier, Chair, where it all started.  It 
then needed to grow. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, let us move on then to a different topic.  You deal 
with in paragraph 29 of your affidavit and it concerns Mr Mti and what occurred during 
2006, would you tell the, Chair, please of what happened? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 52 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well in 2006 I remember it was actually very comical, because 
poor Tony Perry had to subject himself to prayer meetings every morning and he did not 
enjoy it and he would complain excessively, but he was asked by Gavin Watson to 
register Mti′s company called Leonora Investments.  Leonora is basically Richmond 
Mti′s mother′s or late mom′s name, but I remember it vividly, because of the fact that 
poor Tony Perry was an elderly man would have to come in and get on his knees and 
he complained that his knees would get very sore in the prayer meeting. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Tony Perry was the company secretary? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know why the company was to be registered? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not know why. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Alright, and then you deal in paragraph 29.2 with 
events that took place during July 2007 in relation to the catering tender. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the catering tender of which we have spoken? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What happened? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the catering tender, the one that started in July – during 
July 2007, the catering tender was extended for a further year, as it was about to expire 
in September of 2007, so it was then also then further extended by another six months.  
20 
The person that ensured that it got extended was a lady by the name of 
Nontsikelelo Jolingana and she was the acting head at that stage of the bid 
adjudication committee of DCS. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That name Nontsikelelo would you spell it please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Nontsikelo[spelt]. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 53 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Jolingana. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know which position she held? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, I thought you were spelling Nontsikelelo? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Nontsikelelo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, the name is here, I am sorry I did not see that.  Nontsikelelo.  It 
is in 29.2. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Are you sure of that spelling? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am not sure of the spelling. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am instructed that you may be correct, Chair, it may be 
Nontsikelelo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be Nontsikelelo that is a normal name rather than Nontsikelo. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We will check that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies if the name is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I actually you know when one starts to read through this, 
Chair, sorry…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  One starts to remember things and it reminds you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I actually recall in the meeting when this was extended that 
there was an objection at the time from the Jennie Schreiner and there was another 
person that objected and there was a big feral about this.  So perhaps, I do not know if 
the investigation team just wants to check up, there are minutes to that. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 54 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just deal with that in a little more detail then.  You 
say there was an objection from amongst others Jennie Schreiner? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What position did she hold at the time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  She was at a senior level, I do not know exactly what position 
she held, but I do recall getting a call saying that this whole thing is not going down 
very well with everybody to have the extension and they should have put it out on 
tender, which is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was she within Bosasa or from within Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, she was in Correctional Services.  Sorry, it just jogged my 
10 
memory now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But she assisted, well not assisted, she was against going 
against the protocol that should have been followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I recall that.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she was raising that objection in a meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In a meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, it was in the actual meeting. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just clarify your evidence then in that regard, 
because we do not want to get it wrong.  You have not mentioned Ms Schreiner′s name 
before.  You say, if I heard you correctly she was against the protocol that should have 
been implemented? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 55 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then you say she objected to the improper extension 
of the contract.  Please clarify? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  She was not happy that the contract would be extended like 
this.  It needed to go out to tender again. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I remember that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So the two extensions that you have referred to in 
paragraph 29.2? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I understand your evidence to be these extensions 
10 
should have gone out for further tender? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  They did not and the contract was merely extended for 
the benefit of the Bosasa stable? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, that is correct.  I do not want to confuse issues by just 
giving this information right now, but it came to my memory and I thought let me just 
give it to you so that you can – the team can collaborate that what we are putting before 
you is the truth. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No, that is in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  So are you saying that the decision to 
20 
extend that contract was taken in a meeting and you must – can you just say who was 
at that meeting if you are able to remember? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or at least some of the people? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, there were two/three – there were two people at the 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 56 of 194 
 
meeting that I know of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then the other members of the bid adjudication committee 
would have been there, but the record is there.  We can pull the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And we can verify it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that at that meeting, well there must have 
been more than one meeting, because the contract was extended twice? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But at one meeting several members of the Correctional 
Services bid adjudication committee were present? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And indeed the contract was extended on two 
occasions? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  First for a year and then for a further six months? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And that at some stage during that whole process an 
objection was lodged by Ms Schreiner? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The objection was lodged for the record on the first extension 
which was a year extension. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you might need just to be careful with the word lodged, because 
Mr Pretorius had just used the word lodged in his question.  You had simply said that 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 57 of 194 
 
she objected now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if you talk about lodging that implies there was a document 
containing the objection, is that what happened? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not know about that.  I know that she raised an objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She raised an objection? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, and I think let us stick to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But this matter was investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You base it on knowledge? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I understand the point you are making. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, on knowledge that you have.  Okay, alright, yes? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am not sure, I must stress it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but at least as far as Mr Agrizzi is concerned Ms Schreiner 
raised an objection. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In what form might be another issue. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, let us ignore the word that I used, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did Mr Mti eventually resign as Commissioner of 
Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know when that occurred? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 58 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think, Chair, that was in November 2006. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Until then had you had any direct contact with 
Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, I had not. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you have any indirect dealings with him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just assisted with things that I was told to do by Mr Watson, 
assistance in terms of documents or if he needed some information or research done I 
would do it for him. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now you have told the, Chair, that 
from…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am just looking at 29.5 with regard 
to Mr Mti′s resignation and what you said.  You have just told us that he resigned you 
think around November 2006.  The first line of sentence of 29.5 says after Mti′s 
resignation, during approximately 2007, I met Mti.  So the one idea that came to my 
mind is that the approximately 2007 related to the resignation, but it is possible that you 
– it is there to say when you met Mti for the second time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, so it is November 2006 and then in 2007 of the new year 
that is when I met him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the second meeting. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So what I mean by that is during approximately 2007 it was 
20 
the second meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what I am saying is that period that you are talking about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Approximately 2007 does not relate to the resignation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 59 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It relates to your second meeting with Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, so it should have read after 2006 during 2007, that is 
what it should say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go back one paragraph, we have not dealt with 
that.  You have told the, Chair, that from time to time there would be negative publicity 
concerning Bosasa and its activities and in particular its relationship with government 
departments? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall more or less when the first media 
publication of this nature occurred? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It happened in about 2005, Chair.  That is where it really 
started and it was predominantly the Beeld and Die Burger, it was Karien du Plessis 
and Adriaan Basson and it is marked in my bundle as Annexure K. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, let us go then to page 345 of the bundle.  At 
page 346 there is a collation on that page through to page 348 of the content of various 
press articles. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And if one took time to read them they are revelations in 
the press of the relationship between Correctional Services on the one hand and the 
Bosasa group of companies on the other. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And mentioned by name in those articles are amongst 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 60 of 194 
 
other persons Mr Gavin Watson, Mr Mti and Mr Patrick Gillingham. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did these sorts of exposures of the Bosasa 
group of companies′ activities continue? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely.  It was perpetual. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And it was obviously a matter of some concern to 
Bosasa and its officials? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely it was uncomfortable. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, then would you – the relevance of that will 
become apparent later, but would you then go on to talk of the meeting with Mr Mti 
10 
during 2007?  You have highlighted this for the, Chair, already. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, during 2007 it was – I cannot remember exact dates 
and that.  I met Mr Mti for the second time so I would, it was in the morning sometime I 
went with Mr Watson to Richmond Mti′s house in Savannah Hills Estate and I was 
informed, we sat outside waiting, because he had gone on a morning walk I think and 
we sat outside waiting and Gavin said you see this beautiful house, he was actually 
being vicarious and said you build for this politician meaning that you know he was 
being, he was saying that we worked and we earned the money and he would say that 
you actually build it, because it was an expensive house. 
 
So I was also informed that all the furnishings in the house had been done 
20 
and later on the scheme when the SIU report broke and that and everything started 
coming out I was then only really informed of the scheme that happened.  Until that 
time I did not know how they had done it.  I suspected that there was bribery in terms of 
Richmond Mti and the house and all that, but I did not have a clue who had organised 
it, how it had been done, it was very secretive. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 61 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well you provide detail on page 59 and perhaps you 
should place that on record. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there is a company called Riekele Construction. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Riekele[spelt]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is the correct spelling there Riekele.  Riekele[spelt] which 
is operated by a gentleman of the name of Riaan Hoeksma.  He did not only build that 
house, but he also was involved with the building of the house for Gillingham and 
Gillingham′s house was at Midstream Estates.  It was I think Hartengate, I cannot 
remember, obviously I am not going to give out the actual addresses, because that 
would put them at risk and that type of thing. 
10 
 
So, at this stage Riekele Construction had been given a lot of work by 
Bosasa.  He was busy revamping certain parts of Lindela.  Then we bought up two 
hostels, the old hostels, one is – one was called Two North and so they were doing a lot 
of work and there was a lot of building taking place.  So all the payment of these costs 
of these houses the construction of them was done via Bosasa through Riekele or 
whatever, but the payment of these costs of the houses done by Bosasa was done via 
a company which Danny Mansell had set up to handle this type of thing and was called 
Prande Four Pty Limited. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Prande Four[spelt]? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Grande[spelt], okay, is that fine? 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Subsequently false invoices were submitted then by 
Grande Four to Bosasa.  So the reason I know about Grande Four is, because when 
we had to do a clean-up we had to specifically go look for Grande Four and we had to 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 62 of 194 
 
take the invoices out, we had to change them manually as well. 
 
So they then submitted these false invoices into the books with the original 
ones were destroyed when the SIU report started coming out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat that about the invoices being changed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So what happened was when we got wind of the SIU Report 
coming out we had to look for every single aspect that could be used to nail Bosasa 
especially Gavin and Danny Mansell.  So what had to happen was we had to drill down 
- the computerised system is called Great Plains Dynamics.  So we would have to drill 
down.  You would do a search, Gillingham.  So you type in Gillingham in searches and 
it would show up certain invoices.  Those invoices the detail on them would say this 
10 
was for Richmond Mti.  He wanted his room a little bit bigger.  So we built an extra 400 
m² onto the house so that he had his own private swimming pool inside and all that 
detail was there.  So that detail had to be removed and a dummy invoice put in its place 
which said work at Lindela.  We built a stadium for the detainees to play soccer in.  So 
we swopped the invoice, because your reference cannot be taken off the Microsoft 
System at that stage.  So that is why there were fraudulent invoices going around, but it 
would need really forensic work and I mean that is why I have tendered my assistance 
to assist there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Does that clarify it for you Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  Thank you, it does.  Thank you.  You may proceed 
or …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was another method used to conceal expenses?  You 
referred to that in the last sentence of paragraph 29.5.1. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  So what would happen is and there was one specific 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 63 of 194 
 
example with a mezzanine floor that needed to be built and concrete needed to be 
thrown where our …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Where? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Where was this mezzanine floor? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This was at, at one of the construction sites at Leopards Vlei.  
If you want the detail I can give you the detail Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No, it is not necessary. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, you were going to talk of a method of invoicing 
10 
that was used to …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  Sorry you …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  To conceal costs of the construction on of the houses. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  So basically they inflated those costs and then put 
some of the house costs through there. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So for work being done by Bosasa by the Bosasa stable 
for a Government entity invoices would be inflated and the monies used to pay for the 
building of the houses of Messieurs Mti and Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then at 29.5.2 you talk about the registration of the Mti 
20 
house in the name of a particular company.  Would you tell the Chair about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it was a very, I do not think this does it justice at all and, 
and quite simply it cannot be explained.  You know, one needs to do it forensically, but 
basically the house was registered in a company called Autumn Storm Investments 
which was a company which Riekele Construction had an interest in.  That is how it 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 64 of 194 
 
was registered.  The whole idea was that there was a tender out, put out, for the 
accommodation of the National Commissioner at that stage. Riekele bid for it, got it and 
then just basically moved him into the house.  So the tender came out – I would prefer 
if we do a forensic on that, but to put it in a nutshell a tender was promulgated and 
Riekele got the business.  The house had been already built and all that happened then 
was Public Works entered into a rental agreement with Riekele and the department 
paid the rent every month for that property. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the name of that company as you record it here was 
Autumn Storm Investments 119 (Pty) Ltd. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In regard to the furnishing and décor at what we have 
referred to as the empty house what were the arrangements? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know I am commenting Chair on this, because I found this 
out afterwards.  I did not know what had actually happened there, but Bosasa paid for 
the furnishings of both the houses and Mark and Sharon Taverner owned and operated 
a company.  I think it was …[indistinct] or something like that which then sought to the 
furnishing and the decor and invoiced Bosasa for that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did Bosasa pay for the furnishing and décor? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You then refer in paragraph 29.5.4 to the rental 
20 
arrangements in regard to the empty house.  You have told the Chair what you say here 
that the house was rented by the Department of Correctional Services pursuant to 
some sort of tendering process as you put it. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair that is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you say that rent was paid by the Department 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 65 of 194 
 
of Correctional Services to the company called Autumn Storm Investments 119 (Pty) 
Ltd? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what happened to that rental monies to your 
knowledge? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The agreement, the agreement according to Mti was that 
rental would accumulate and accumulate and eventually once Mti was out of politics 
and out of Government then he would be able to say it was a growing investment.  He 
would be able to then access the funds. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who would access the funds? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mti. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know whether this ever happened or not? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It would not have happened, because in 2009 with the release 
or 2007 with the release of the SUI Report they would not, I mean it would be too 
obvious. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, so that was the agreement that was never 
implemented according to your evidence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, but it can be corroborated by the investigators. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was there also any agreement about the final fate of the 
ownership of the house? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well yes, the house was supposed to be transferred over to 
him.  That never happened.  I believe that, you know, the gentleman Riaan Hoeksma 
took advantage of the situation and sold the house. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You have told the Chair that Mr Mti resigned as 
Commissioner in November 2006. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 66 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before that, so after the house had been built and 
furnished that is Mr Mti’s house is your evidence that the building, the building and the 
furnishing was never really paid for by Mti himself, but it was paid for by Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You are 100 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or he may have paid some portions or you do not know? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Everything was paid by Mark and Sharon Taverner.  The 
building was paid by Riekele Construction and there was rental paid by Correctional 
Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi you say that Mr Mti 
10 
resigned as National Commissioner in November 2006? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I can correctly correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did he leave the house then? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, he did not leave straightaway.  He left a while later.  He, 
he relocated to another house, but he continued to pay the rent, because he thought he 
was getting the money back from Riaan Hoeksma. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Do you know for how long he remained in what 
we have referred to as the Mti house, the first house? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I refer to my statement and I say in 29.5.5 it was 
approximately 18 months. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and then in 29.5.6 of your affidavit you say: 
“He then relocated to another house owned by him.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, but just a correction.  It was not at Savannah Hills.  It 
was close to Savannah Hills.  There is another estate just down the road. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we should just abandon that to a house close to …[intervenes]. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 67 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Savannah Hills. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct], so we delete in and put close to, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  So that was an oversight Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did Mr Mti receive any benefit from Bosasa in relation to 
this house and I am talking about the Bosasa stable here? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, most definitely. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what was that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well furniture, repairs, maintenance a variety of things that, 
you know.  There are certain things that I know of and certain things I will not know of. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then you say in relation I do not know to which 
house, because the house close to Savannah Hills you say was owned by Mti, but then 
you talk about a potential transfer.  Please explain what you say in paragraph 29.5.7. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So later when Riaan Hoeksma was supposed to actually 
transfer the house to Mti we actually said to him, I went to a meeting with 
Andries van Tonder and we said well everything had kind of quietened down a little bit.  
We were …[indistinct] so we said, we went to go and see Riaan Hoeksma and said you 
need to transfer the house now.  That was the agreement you had made with Gavin and 
Mansell and Mti, because they us told us that was the agreement and Hoeksma said, 
look sorry guys I have registered a bond over the house and I used the rent to pay the 
20 
bond. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But which house are we talking of now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We are talking about the Savannah Hills house. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 68 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But you say in paragraph 29.5.6: 
“Mti then relocated to a house close to Savannah Hills owned 
by him.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But why was it necessary to transfer the house to him if 
it was already owned by him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no there are two houses.  There are two different houses. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Which house are you talking about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the first one in 29.5.6 is the Savannah Hills he, where he 
relocated to Savannah Hills.  That is a complex and we actually drove past it this 
10 
morning.  It is a complex right next door to Savannah Hills.  Remember I said in 259.5.6 
it should read: 
“Mti then relocated to a house close to Savannah Hills.” 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I see. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Savannah Hills is a complex. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  You, you have told the Chair that in relation to, let 
us refer to it as the first house, there was an arrangement or an agreement that it would 
ultimately be transferred to Mr Mti. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us refer to that as the first house.  Are you saying 
20 
that house was actually in Savannah Hills? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well was one in Savannah Hills another one close to Savannah 
Hills? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 69 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The complexes are right next to each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  One is a high end complex, Savannah Hills. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then there is a slightly middle class/upper class complex 
next door to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Which he also owned a property, but that one was registered 
in his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So we then went, if you look at the chronology that I have put 
on page 60 is quite simply: 
“Mti relocated to the new house.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  “He then was living in the, the new town house.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  “In the, in the estate close to Savannah Hills.” 
I say in 29.5.7: 
20 
“Later on…” 
So the house stood empty, the Savannah Hills House was empty. 
“Later on when Riaan Hoeksma was supposed to transfer the 
house things had gone quiet and Richmond Mti actually asked 
us at one stage what is happening with the house.  So we went 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 70 of 194 
 
to go and see Riaan Hoeksma.  When we spoke to 
Riaan Hoeksma he said that he had registered a bound over 
the house and he was using the rent money to pay the bond.” 
So in other words where that house should not have been bonded Hoeksma because 
the company was in his name went and registered the bond.  He saw it as a cash cow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, ja.  Well I was about to ask you.  You said Riekele Construction 
had an interest in Autumn Storm Investments 119 (Pty) Ltd.  Who else had an interest 
in Autumn Storm Investments, if you know? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know.  Okay, but your understanding is that Riekele held 
10 
the majority of shares in that, in Autumn Storm Investments? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So if I can just clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I want to just explain.  So you had Autumn Storm Investments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That company should have been transferred over to 
Richmond Mti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There should be no bond there or anything like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Riaan Hoeksma must have got himself into cash flow 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 71 of 194 
 
problems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he went to register a bond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because then he got four/five million or R6 million out on the 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, him. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he then says, we asked him but you are supposed to 
have this pot of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Where every month the rent was paid into and you are 
supposed to not have a bond there.  Now you do not have the pot of money and you do 
not have the house, because it is bonded up, but of course he has got a beautiful game 
farm and all those type of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when this happened or when you discovered this was it during 
Mr Mti’s time as Commissioner or was it after he had resigned? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was after. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because that was specifically why everything had calmed 
down. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And we went to go and see Riaan Hoeksma to move the 
property into his name, because he was asking for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Does that clarify? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 72 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Let us move on.  Did you have occasion to 
meet with Mr Mti together with Gavin Watson at some stage after his resignation?  I am 
referring to the meeting at 29.6. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who attended that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Just repeat the question sir.  I did not hear that clearly. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who attended that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The meeting was attended by Gavin Watson, myself and Mti. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and what occurred at that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well he wanted a proposal to be presented that he could 
10 
utilise for presentation on the 2010 World Cup Security. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And were you given any tasks? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I was given a task to prepare a security plan and assist 
him wherever possible in doing the presentation that he would at a later stage present. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the 2010 World Cup? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, did anything else of note happen at that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, Mr Mti got his monthly fees paid over by Gavin Watson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did you see? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I saw the grey bag being given to Mr Mti. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The grey security bag? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when was this meeting and where was it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was at Mti’s house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one close to Savannah? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 73 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No this one, this one was actually at Savannah still. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, the one okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja and when was it if you are able to remember? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was just before the World Cup presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would say about two/three months before they did the World 
Cup presentation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, how did you learn of this payment?  Apart from 
10 
seeing the grey security bag being handed over.  I am referring to a discussion that you 
say you had with Gavin Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, I am not aware of it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In other words what did he tell you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  On the way back, I would drive the car normally.  What 
happened was Gavin Watson jokingly said you see we pay monopoly money, but this 
man delivers on his promises.  That, he called him that fat man, delivers on his 
promises.  He would always call fat people fat, but I am just giving you, he said that 
man delivers on his promises. If he promises something he gets it done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Joking about Mr Mti? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but now as at the date of this meeting that you deal with in 
paragraph 29.6 Mr Mti had already resigned from, from Correctional Services is that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now since he had already resigned from Correctional Services 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 74 of 194 
 
what was Bosasa or Mr Gavin Watson seeking?  What benefit did they seek to get from 
him in giving him more money in these grey security bags?  What could he still give 
Bosasa or was it arrears from earlier? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This was because, I mean as long as the contract lasted the 
agreement with him and, and Watson was as long as the agreement last, the contract 
lasted he would be paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think yesterday you told us that I think I do not know if, if it was 
Mr Magagula one of the members of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services, 
I think you told us that when he I think left the Portfolio Committee or left Parliament I 
am not sure payments to him stopped, but with regard to Mr Mti payments did not stop 
10 
when he resigned from Correctional Services. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct and I mentioned the other lady as well 
Ms Winnie Ngwenya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And Ruben Pillay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So with the junior people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But because Mti was instrumental, he and Gillingham were 
instrumental in Correctional Services that is why to today they are still being looked 
after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because those contracts are still in place  
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 75 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because those contracts are still in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you just say till today or till to…? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well till …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to the …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair up to the time I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Which was on 15 December 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was still getting paid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Monthly? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you and that would have been, this was now you left 
Bosasa at the end of 2016. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  15 December 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Was my last working day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that that, that actually was almost 10 years to the dot from when 
Mr Mti resigned from Correctional Services.  You said he resigned in November 2006. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, you are right …[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So for about at least 10 years thereafter he continued to be paid. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Money. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As a matter of fact Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 76 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I think it is further on you will see in my statement.  I will 
not go there now I had actually refused to do a delivery and Gavin Watson came to 
fetch at, at my house and he did the delivery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I will get into it later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You have referred the Chair to a conversation 
that took place between yourself and Gavin Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On the way back from the visit to Mr Mti. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And during that conversation mention was made of 
“monopoly money” paid to Mr Mti, because Mr Mti always delivered on his promises. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The words used by you here and it may be 
important because Mr Mti had always delivered on his promises. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  He always delivered on his promises.  I do not 
understand question. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No, hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I, I think Mr Pretorius was simply looking at the tense. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You exactly had always, you know that is …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Had an …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to that stage what you were, your understanding or what 
Mr Gavin Watson’s exact words prior to that he had always delivered.  So there was no 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 77 of 194 
 
reason to …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To doubt that he would deliver. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whenever he was, he had made a promise. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you learn anything about the frequency of payments 
and the amount of payments from Mr Watson during that conversation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was only later after the conversation that I learnt that it 
was a monthly amount and there was a monthly fee of R65 000 a month, but from then 
10 
on I would start accompany to more and more meetings. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you actually see transfers of grey security bags to 
Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On how many occasions approximately? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well every month from 20, when he was released from the 
World Cup and even before, but every month that Gavin Watson would go through to 
Mti I would accompany him.  So it is phenomenal.  I mean at least for 24/30 times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is over what period more or less …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  From when he left Correctional Services, because that is 
20 
when I really got to know him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So from around end of 2006 up the time that you left Bosasa in 
November 2016. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were a number of times maybe 30 or thereabout. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 78 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you accompanied Mr Watson to Mr Mti. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And on some of those occasions there would either you or 
Mr Watson would carry a grey security bag with money to hand over to him.  Is that 
what, is that more or less what you are saying? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Spot on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Can I just ask you Chair when the Polokwane elections was, 
because there is a timeline there as well that I can refer back to then?  I am just 
10 
thinking now when. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZ:  What year was it?  It was in December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Polokwane Conference was, I think was in 2007. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  No, just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry it just ties up with, with what I was saying.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Did you become aware at that time of 
any other benefits which the Mti family enjoyed at the expense of Bosasa with the 
20 
Bosasa stable? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I did.  I became aware of travelling costs that were paid 
for.  I became aware that apparently a holiday was arranged by Gavin Watson’s 
brother-in-law Mark Taverner at the Bushman’s River, but I would be often tasked as 
well to do, arrange flights for the whole family.  I was instructed to just make sure that 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 79 of 194 
 
everything went well.  So I had to open up an account with Blakes Travel and the 
account’s name was in JJ Venter’s name.  There were payments for some of the 
studies of the kids and from the previous marriage his son actually worked at Bosasa 
and there would be various other ways that we could assist and, and try and make him 
feel good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So after Mr Mti had left Correctional Services is the position that 
there was nothing new that he was delivering to, to Bosasa?  It was simply that the 
contract that Bosasa had obtained or maybe I should say contracts that he had, Bosasa 
had obtained during Mr Mti’s time at Correctional Services was still going on and the, 
the arrangement was that as long as that contract was still going one should be paid. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who is JJ Venter? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He was actually my later father-in-law. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did you say that that account was used to invoice 
and pay for travel expenses incurred by Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct and other people as well.  Other politicians as 
well would use that account. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your father-in-law alive at the time this account was used? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, we just used the name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you just used the name. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was not registered or. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There was no, Brian Blake from Blakes Travel knew me 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 80 of 194 
 
exceptionally well and he was not interested in being, I just used the name JJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just clarify that in case it is a subject of further 
investigation.  Were there tickets booked in the name of JJ Venter or was an account 
registered in the name of JJ Venter? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I submitted all the documentation to the team and with the 
accounts as well.  There are accounts in JJ Venters name, but the tickets and the 
names on the tickets.  For example at the Jazz Festival and that is in the person’s 
name who actually did the travelling. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So in cases relevant to him, Mr Mti? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then you have told the Chair the information 
recorded in paragraph 29.8 that Bosasa paid for the studies of two children. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Of Mr Mti. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Were any other services provided at the home of Mr Mti 
at a later stage after the World Cup? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there was a security official put there to look after him by 
Bosasa.  Joe Gumede arranged it.  There was an incident one evening I recall where 
20 
Mr Mti pulled out a gun and there was an issue there and there was driving under the 
influence.  So those are the type of things.  Is that the answer you are looking for? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No, I am just asking whether security services were 
provided at the home. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 81 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At the home of Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  The answer is that is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Aright and what services were those you say the 
provision of a guard? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius I am looking for paragraph which deals with the 
payments of – payments for Mr Mti’s childrens studies? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes paragraph 29.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right you then relate in paragraph 29.8 an incident 
relating to a criminal charge brought against Mr Mti and please if you would deal with 
the information you provide and tell the Chair how you come to know of what you are 
going to tell him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well I was not involved in the sense that I had to go to court 
and sort out the thing.  But Mr Gumede requested money once, cash money to – he 
needed to bribe an official at one of the courts and it was to pay – to make a payment 
for – to get rid of a drunken driving charge. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know – that is why Mr Gumede requested the 
money according to yourself you know of that obviously? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is true. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you know what he told you obviously. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair that is true. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But are you able to confirm that the money was actually 
paid for the purpose you related? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 82 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot confirm that Chair I can only confirm what I gave Mr 
Gumede. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So you are telling the Chair that the reason you gave Mr 
Gumede the money that he requested was the reason related to you by Mr Gumede 
you have no further evidence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And would you tell the Chair please of the 
further circumstance referred to in paragraph 29.8 regarding the submission of 
invoices? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well Chair my …[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before he does that Mr Pretorius are you able to recall how 
much money you gave Mr Joe Gumede for the purpose that he told you the purpose of 
getting rid of the criminal charge against Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I cannot recall but it would have been more than just 
pocket change.  It would have been considerable – it would have been between 
R10 000,00 and R20 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot remember the exact amount let me rather not say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Mr Pretorius you can maybe repeat your 
question. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  In the last five lines of paragraph 29.8 you refer to 
certain circumstances which allowed money to be raised and paid to Mr Mti, how was 
that done? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair and it is not the only one I have to refer to another issue 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 83 of 194 
 
as well that happened and that was with – that involved a business school Ndlala which 
my – I was – I started off with son but there were two – there were two issues and sorry 
my apologies Advocate Pretorius as I said this was done very quickly.  The issue with 
regards to my brother was that my brother Watson said – I happened to be in the car 
with Watson when I went to go and visit a business started by my brother.  The 
business Watson tried to get us to pay Mti because Mti at that stage was complaining 
that he was not getting a salary and the banks were starting to get suspicious and he 
could not deposit the cash.  So he needed to filter money through my brother and put it 
through his business.  My brother was very uncomfortable about it.  I think he did one 
transaction and he terminated it.  He said listen this is not how I was brought up and he 
10 
is not going to do it.  So he was very annoyed with me about it.  And basically what it 
was was to pay Mti money and then Bosasa would be invoiced for electrical work or 
whatever work he did for them.  So he was very uncomfortable about that.  And a 
similar situation happened with my son where he started a consulting business and 
what happened was I was asked by Gavin because the son of Mti was not – he was 
going through a rough patch and he needed to be paired up with somebody who would 
motivate him and encourage him.  So unfortunately Watson said well there is Angelo he 
has got a son and my son was doing very well and why do you not set up the two.  So I 
asked my son please can you work with this guy you know develop him, see what can 
happen?   Maybe there is something in the future.  Because he was having 
20 
phenomenal problems with this boy.  So he needed a role model, he needed somebody 
to guide and aspire him so – and I am sorry this is not in the affidavit but I will follow up 
in writing.  So what actually happened was my son got involved with – through me I 
made the mistake.  So there was a meeting held I think we had it at Clearwater Mall at 
a restaurant.  I tried to motivate the kid.  Well my son was there, Richmmond Mti was 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 84 of 194 
 
there, I was there and my son was there and the youngster was there his name is 
Vukani and we – we had a chat but nothing happened of it because my son also turned 
around and said look I think he registered the company and then he just canned it.  It 
did not trade a day.  So it was those type of situations that we were always subjected or 
I was subjected to.  You got to speak to this one, you have got to help that kid, you got 
to do this, you got to do that and it started to have a toll on me and on my family 
because my brother who I had raised started looking at me and saying well why?  My 
own son was being brought into this thing.  It was – you know it was terrible.  I mean I 
recall – I recall – sorry I am diverting sorry.  Sorry Advocate Pretorius.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes perhaps as you have undertaken you could take 
10 
your time record that evidence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes I will. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And if and when appropriate we will deal with that by 
handing in a supplementary statement up. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But I would like to clarify what you referred to in 
paragraph 29.8.  Your brother would render fictitious invoices for electrical services 
rendered to Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The money which was then paid by Bosasa was handed 
20 
over to Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI: Chair that is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And your brother as you say here became uncomfortable 
with this arrangement and the practice was terminated? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 85 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not say your brother only did one invoice? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI: I cannot remember exactly I think it was one or two invoices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he just canned it he was unhappy with it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair I am about to move to a new topic.  Oh no I am not 
sure of what the arrangements should be.  I am told that lunch will only be served at 
13:30 and not 13:00 but I am not sure that is relevant to whether we take the 
adjournment now or not and I am not sure of what todays’ arrangements are.  Are we 
going to sit until five? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes today we will sit until five in terms of the arrangement yesterday 
but I know nothing about – about that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, no it should not influence any decision now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes carry on. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am about to move to a new topic, would now be a 
convenient time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  From my side I do not mind if we adjourn at half past one if that 
is going to be convenient for catering and lunch purposes for the legal team but I am – I 
do not mind if we adjourn now either. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I think in this case my feet should take priority Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment we will 
resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.

Page 86 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius you may proceed. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Excuse me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Agrizzi. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Can I just for completeness just clarify something before Mr – 
Advocate Pretorius begins. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just would like to clarify 27.17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In terms of the payment of the dividends into the trust account 
10 
of the attorney.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just want to clarify that.  So the dividends from Beta Fence 
would be paid into the trust account of the attorneys and it would then on instruction be 
transferred into the bank account of Bosasa Operations and that would be the flow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As is. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As a transfer of dividends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the – there was no need to open up an account for Bopa 
and Phofoga. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay just for completeness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say why it was necessary for the dividends to go to 
the attorney’s trust account first before they were transferred as they were to Bosasa’s 
account? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 87 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am – I am willing to tell you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the reason is simple because the shareholders would 
have normally had to receive the dividends.  In this instance the shareholders who were 
reflected on paper were actually not shareholders.  So they did not get the dividends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And a simple search and a request you would be able to verify 
that the dividends were never actually paid to the shareholders they were paid to 
Bosasa Operations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Every single time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry Mr – Advocate Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We also omitted to refer to paragraph 29.5.8.  If you 
would go there please and just tell the Chair about the meeting referred to in that 
paragraph. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry could you repeat the paragraph number please? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  29.5.8. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry I am just looking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is on page 60 of your affidavit. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ah there we go sorry, sorry I did not see that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 29.5.8. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I together with Andries Van Tonder on instruction from 
Gavin Watson then had to attend to a meeting that was held with Riaan Hoeksma and 
the reason why was that we needed to make sure that he did not present a version to 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 88 of 194 
 
events – of events if he was questioned during an investigation that might incriminate 
any of the parties.  And at that stage and I believe to date he has still not been 
interviewed by anybody from the SIU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So we attended a meeting to say to him please cover up in 
short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he agreed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the events which are referred to in that paragraph 
10 
are the events related to the house of Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The one in Savanna Hills that is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And it might clarity matters a little.  Savanna Hills is not a 
suburb it is a townhouse complex I understand? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it is a townhouse complex situated if you coming from 
Johannesburg side – if you driving towards the Protea Hotel it is on that road.  It is on 
your left hand side Savannah Hills.  If you need details of the actual I can provide that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that reminds me the house that was built by Riaan Hoeksma’s 
company for Mr Mti do you have a recollection of what its value was more or less? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was on the market for about R6 million if I am not mistaken 
20 
at one stage but that was quite a while back, about ten years ago.  And so the value of 
the property if I compare it for instance to my property I mean it is much more elaborate 
and my property is only valued at about R10 million.  That property would be valued at 
closer to about R18 million, R16 million between there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As of now or as at the time when it was built? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 89 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no as of now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As of now. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so it would be your estimate is that it would be around R18 
million in value? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  If you go please to paragraph 29.9 Mr Agrizzi.   
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  29.9.  During 2007 Mr Vernie Petersen was appointed as the 
National Commissioner and on numerous occasions I tried to communicate with him – 
with him about possible ventures but he would have nothing to do with the Bosasa 
Group of Companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just before you proceed on that let me just complete the picture 
with regard to what we have referred to as Mr Mti’s house. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is you evidence that ultimately Mr Mti lost out on that house.  It never 
got registered in his name as had been planned initially? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even to this day? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Even to this day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He may have enjoyed the benefits of living in it but he paid rent 
which he – he thought would be returned to him but ultimately it was never returned, is 
that correct? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 90 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he lost out? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He lost out.  He walked out with only the furniture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that was mainly because the SIU had started working – 
investigating is it why he lost out? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there was fear that if it was transferred to him it would just spell 
trouble? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He was given an option of either staying in the house and 
staying in jail or moving out of the house so it could be covered up. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who paid the rent for that house? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At one stage we increased his payment from R65 000,00 a 
month in cash to R100 000,00 in cash.  That was when he left the department.  
Because the department originally was paying for his rent of the property which Bosasa 
had built. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, so before he – before he left Correctional Services the 
department was paying his rent? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And after he had left the department Bosasa paid the rent by way of 
20 
increasing his monthly payment or it just increased his monthly payment and he would 
then pay the rent himself? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We increased the monthly payments so that he could pay the 
rent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 91 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you Chair.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi you say during mid 2007 Vernie Petersen was 
appointed as National Commissioner, National Commissioner of which department? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Of the Department of Correctional Services. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You say you attempted to communicate with him about 
possible future ventures but he would have nothing to do with any of the companies in 
the Bosasa Group? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  At around that time was a further meeting held 
with officials of the Department of Correctional Services? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Could you please tell the Chair of that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair a meeting was co-ordinated I was called into the 
meeting it was the – it was not the first meeting, it was the second meeting and at the 
same meeting it was arranged between myself, Gavin Watson, there was a gentleman 
by the name of Khulekani Sitole who used to be the previous chairman – Commissioner 
of Correctional Services.  Another person that was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had been – okay maybe let me ask this. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of time or year where are we now in regard to that meeting? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  2007 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2007? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so if you say Mr Khulekani Sitole used to be Commissioner of 
the Department of Correctional Services that would have been before Mr Mti or even 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 92 of 194 
 
before that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am not too sure when he was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you will. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But it was before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There was another gentleman by the name of Sbu or I cannot 
recall his surname.  At the time I was told he was the I think the General Secretary of 
Popcru. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is a trade union? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  I cannot verify that I was told that Chair.  At that stage 
10 
you know I was not really interested in the process. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was the subject matter of that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the subject meeting was to discuss how they could swing 
Vernie Petersen and get to a solution where he would start communicating with 
Bosasa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you finish telling us the people who attended the meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The one person was Sbu, it was Khulekani Sitole those were 
the people that attended with Watson and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall if there were other Bosasa directors at the 
20 
meeting. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You say that the subject matter of the meeting was an 
attempt to find a solution to Mr Petersen’s refusal to communicate with Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes what happened? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 93 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it was agreed that they which included Mr Mxele who was 
the Regional Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services would be paid a 
million rand per month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Regional Commissioner of Department of Correctional Services in 
Gauteng? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no in KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When you say it was agreed that they including Mr Nxele 
would paid a million rand per month what is the detail?  Was that for all, some, who 
were the they? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was for the team.  How they were going to distribute it I 
have not got a clue I was not involved in that.  It was an invoice that they would provide 
us. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who would provide you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it would normally come from Sitole would get somebody 
to email it to us and I would then receive it and pass it on to accounts.  Get Gavin 
Watson to approve it and put it through for payment. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who would produce the invoices? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall my – I do not have my laptop anymore that is in 
possession of African Global but the invoices would be sent to me and I would then 
20 
process the invoices and it was from – on a company letter – invoice which was called 
Vleissentraal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is what you are saying this that the purpose of the meeting was to 
discuss what was to be done about Mr Petersen’s refusal to have anything to do with 
Bosasa, is that right? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 94 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The group of companies you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja and you say it was agreed at that meeting that the – is it two or 
three correctional services people Khulekani Sitole, M Nxele is it – it was those two? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was those two that were there from the previous correctional 
services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that they would be paid an amount of R1 millioin which they would 
distribute among themselves or it would be paid in certain amounts that and you do not 
know what amounts but the amount for them was R1 million.  Was that R1 million per 
month? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R1 million a month. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And at that stage Chair and I think I go into it later on.  There 
was even a dispute in terms of the VAT payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But – oh I think Mr Pretorius is still going to come to it let me 
allow him to do that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps I will thank Chair.  You say that invoices were 
produced, fictitious invoices on behalf of the team for R1 million per month and these 
would be paid by Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe I will ask this before because I want to know it now. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of the agreement reached at that meeting what were the 
two people going to do in order to – what were they going to do for Bosasa because the 
National Commissioner was Mr Petersen and he wanted to have nothing to do with 
Bosasa, what were they going to do?  He was the top man, is it not? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 95 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  Chair my and once more it is my thinking from 
what I heard in the meeting was that they would put undue pressure on the department 
and on Vernie Petersen through the associations with Popcru and with the unions and 
the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so what was thought was that they would do whatever was 
necessary to put pressure on Mr Petersen I guess to make sure that the attitude 
towards Bosasa changed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and you refer in the last sentence of 29.10 to that 
10 
very quick pro qua? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was the intention of the payment? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was the intention of the payment? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the intention was to utilise that to get influence against 
Vernie Petersen and to get him to either agree to work with us or to feel the wrath of 
Popcru. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what was the purpose of obtaining Mr Petersen’s 
co-operation? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At that stage he was the decision maker he was the 
accounting officer for Correctional Services. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But it may be obvious in the light of your earlier evidence 
but let us be express here what was the purpose of obtaining his co-operation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well because obviously we wanted more business and new 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 96 of 194 
 
opportunities.  I mean all the opportunities had now dried up.  All the effort and the 
money that had been spent before it all disappeared. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright were these payments made? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes they were. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On a monthly basis you say? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And for how long did they continue? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall exactly how long they – or what period they 
were at but what I do recall is that at one stage there was an issue with regards to the 
VAT which I said was their baby and their responsibility and at one stage we lost the 
10 
staffing of the control rooms at Correctional Services.  And so we reduced the amount 
from R1 million to R700 000,00. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I understand you evidence to be that the recipients of the 
payments were unhappy that the R1 million included VAT? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The money that the two got Mr Khulekani Sitole and Mr M Mxele do 
you know what Mr Mxele’s full name is or was? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I cannot pronounce it but it is I can provide you with it 
later. Well it is in the record somewhere. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So this R1 million was for the two of them as far as you 
understood or were they to share it with other people? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No we were told that they were the leaders of the pack and 
they would share it with the other hungry – what do you call them people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean that it was hoped that part of it would – that they 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 97 of 194 
 
would try and use it to try and get Mr Petersen to change his attitude or it was clear that 
Mr Petersen was not that type of person? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Petersen was not that type of person.  I do not know how 
they – they would have tried to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so but. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I did not ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what you are saying is they would use it for themselves but 
they would or could use it to help other – to get other decision makers within – within 
Correctional Services or to get other people who could put pressure to put pressure? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was that amount of R1 million amended at any stage? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was Chair it was dropped down to R700 000,00 per month 
and purely because there was one contract that Sondolo lost so it was taken down to 
R700 000,00.  And then eventually I think we had realised and I went to Mr Watson and 
I said look we wasting our time with these guys just stop it, we wasting money. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the contract that you lost specify that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was the staffing of the control rooms if I am not mistaken. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At Correctional Services facilities? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You have spoken about that contract earlier, have you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that you ultimately you said to Mr Watson you were 
wasting money on these people, is it the two that you have talked about in the previous 
paragraph that you are talking about? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 98 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your evidence that they were not delivering? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At the end of the day it was just they were not delivering 
anything to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We were just paying money out to them every month on an 
invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and by the, and did Mr Watson agree that…[intervenes] 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not agree. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you continued paying them? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It continued for months and then it was cancelled and he 
agreed to cancel it and he offered them an option, an optional alternative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, well what happened during 2008 in this regard? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it seized. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What seized? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The payment of the R700 000 and what happened was it 
continued, but because Nxele was the Commissioner of KZN and he made life very 
20 
difficult if he did not pay on time. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right let us just stop there, because it may be confusing.  
It could not seize and continue.  Just be a bit more particular. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Just repeat your question please? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So what happened to the arrangement in 2008? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 99 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It seized. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Completely? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It seized with Sithole and Sbu. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And in relation to Mr Nxele? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it continued, they continued but on a different basis. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well will you tell the, Chair, about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, so let us say that agreement stopped, but we realised 
that and there was enough pressure and at that stage I never even met Nxele.  I am 
just giving you as it was.  He put a lot of pressure, he would phone up Gavin Watson all 
hours of the day.  I remember one day strangely enough that he sent a message to 
10 
Gavin Watson and to all the other Directors to say abakathi I do not know what that 
means, but I got it as well.  Angelo, he mentioned my name abakathi something like 
that.  I do not know, I do not know what the word means. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, well do you know how it was spelt? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I probably got the message here.  I will find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, these things are coming back to me, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But what happened was it was agreed that an amount of 
R57 500 would be given Nxele on a monthly basis for his influence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Nxele? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  For in the KZN region of the Department of Correctional 
Services. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 100 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was Mr Nxele happy about that amount? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, he was extremely unhappy about it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did he want? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it was about the same time and I accompanied 
Mr Johannes Gumede to a meeting with Nxele.  So whenever they did not want to pay 
somebody they will always take me with and I will have to explain about the auditors 
that are all over us and we cannot do it anymore and that type of thing.  So I went to the 
meeting and the meeting was held at the Intercontinental Hotel at O R Tambo in the 
Quills, I think it is called, restaurant. 
 
Down at the bottom in the furthest left hand side and the meeting started 
10 
very cordial.  As a matter of fact Mr Nxele was in his full regalia, full uniform and I 
commented…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Correctional Services uniform? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, yes and I commented on how smart he looked and he 
was getting on a plane back to KZN so he had limited time to meet with us.  Or he was 
on his way to Johannesburg, I cannot remember what the – if he was leaving or 
coming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But he was at the restaurant with us in uniform.  This was my 
very first meeting with him.  I never met him before.  Now prior to that meeting 
20 
Mr Gumede and myself were in the fault when Gavin Watson was briefing us on what to 
say to him and also packing the money for him in one of the security envelopes.  So I 
specifically looked at the amount and I asked what the amount was and I checked that 
it was packed in properly and it was R57 500 and the bag was sealed…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  R57 500? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 101 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  The bag was sealed and the bag was placed 
– Mr Gumede took the bag and then during lunch we actually sat with him.  He was 
very cordial. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the hotel now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At the hotel.  So I am just telling you about the packing of it, 
because it has got relevance and he said that he was unhappy with the amount that 
was paid to him and I explained to him that Bosasa at that stage was not in a position 
to increase the agreed upon amount and the security bag was handed over across the 
table from – actually it was handed to him by Mr Gumede. 
 
And then during lunch everything was fine, but after lunch he actually – sorry 
10 
during lunch everything was fine.  When it got to the end of lunch he said that he was 
unhappy and he would convey this dissatisfaction to Gavin Watson.  Alright, he said 
that the money that was in the bag was not the money that was promised to him.  So I 
thought and I confronted Joe Gumede that maybe he had taken out some money. 
 
It was not the case.  He did not take out anything.  Joe would not lie to me 
about something like that and we found out that it was actually the amount and that he 
was just unhappy with it.  So he phoned Joe and he left messages for Joe Gumede. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Before you go on, who was present at that lunch? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Myself, Johannes Gumede were present at that lunch. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And Mr Nxele? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those were the people who were at the meeting as well? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was three people? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 102 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well do I understand that the meeting and the lunch 
were the same occasion or am I incorrect? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no, you are 100% right.  That is the meeting at the Quill′s 
lunch and then there is a second one that was held. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Are you still to come to that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, alright well let us get there. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You deal with it in paragraph 29.15. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right.  So Nxele was still not happy and satisfied and 
he conveyed this dissatisfaction to Gavin Watson.  Numerous messages.  As a matter 
of fact it got so bad that eventually he would be passed from one handler to the next.  
So first Ishmael would handle him, then Joe will try and handle him, then Joe will give 
up and then Trevor had to handle him.  So Trevor Mathenjwa was now given the 
responsibility of handling Mr Nxele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is now in the months after that meeting. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is two weeks later, it is three weeks later, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, so, Chair, what happened was I was then told to once 
20 
more accompany Trevor Mathenjwa who was at that stage a Director of Sondolo, 
Managing Director to the Beverly Hills Hotel in Umhlanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Durban. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh, okay, Durban, right next to the Oyster Box. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 103 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, and so we went through to the – I went through to 
Beverly Hills Hotel, because I had my own vehicle down there and we had a meeting 
with Mr Nxele and it was a long meeting, it was about two hours and at the meeting I 
explained to him that we were not – that Bosasa was not in the position to increase the 
amounts. 
 
They were not in the position to give him any more and he was not happy 
with it at all.  He was not happy.  He said he would deal with it in his own way and he 
left with the explanation, he was not happy.  He just said I am leaving, he was not 
happy with the explanation, he got up and stormed out and he left without taking the 
grey security bag.  He left that with Mr Mathenjwa. 
10 
 
So I was sitting…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so you went to this meeting at Beverly Hills with a security bag 
containing money for him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, R57 500. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is the second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So what happened was comical, because we sat in the 
Beverly Hills lounge, we offered to give him the bag, he said he is not taking it and he 
stormed out and about ten minutes later he then phoned Mr Mathenjwa up and he said 
20 
where is my bag, can I come back and fetch my bag?  So it was a bit comical at this 
stage and he then told Trevor to make arrangements for the collection thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Trevor being Mr Mathenjwa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 104 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he got his bag at the end of the day.  I was with Trevor 
when he phoned him to ask where Trevor was so that Trevor could still give him back 
the bag. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So on that occasion you were present when the bag was handed 
over to him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius, I do not know, you know sometimes 
when you read the transcript later, because the transcriber or the one typing the record 
does not know how a certain name is spelled, they can write things that do not relate to 
10 
what exactly happened.  Maybe we should spell some of the names that may be 
difficult for purposes of the transcriber, what do you think? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I have done so, but perhaps I should do more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I am thinking particularly of Nxele, because it is Nxele, but the 
witness pronounces it not as Nxele and somebody who is typing the surname might 
write Nene or something else.  So it might help. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nxele is Nxele[spelt].  Okay, let us move on, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There are other ways to do it, we can provide the 
20 
transcriber with the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am quite happy as long as it is done, even if we do not do it here, 
just to make sure that when they type they have the right spelling so that, that can be 
done.  If there is another way doing it without us spelling the names here I am quite 
happy. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 105 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, I think of Frans for example, how that would be 
spelt by the transcriber and we have got lots of experience with that.  You refer in 
paragraph 29.16 to two purchases and you say this occurred at some stage.  Can you 
recall when?  More or less. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think this – the timing of this was probably in the region of 
about 2006/2007 I think, Chair.  I stand to correction.  I stand to correction.  In terms of 
29.16. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well perhaps there is another way of dealing with it.  At 
that time what position did Mr Gillingham hold? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Gillingham was a Chief Financial Officer. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Department of Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, and what happened? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Gavin Watson instructed Frans Vorster that he needed to buy 
a new E-Class Mercedes for Gillingham from Constantia Kloof Motors and 
Andries van Tonder had to purchase a new Polo VW from The Glen for 
Megan Gillingham his daughter. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The Polo was purchased according to your evidence 
from who? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  From Volkswagen, The Glen, which is in Alberton. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And how were these payments to be made? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Look the payments had to be made from electronic transfers 
from personal accounts, because you cannot very well go with a bag of cash and say I 
want to buy a Mercedes E320 or I want to buy a new Polo.  People are not going to 
accept it.  It is going to raise a lot of concerns and you cannot just deposit it into their 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 106 of 194 
 
account.  So the only way to do it is to actually do an EFT and to pay for it like that. 
 
Or to do it like every other normal person and take it over on a HP contract.  
So it was done via EFT from personal accounts. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Whose personal accounts? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I got to remember now, sorry, Chair, this is quite some time 
ago. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  If you cannot remember that is fine we can move on. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Excuse me? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  29.17, if you cannot remember from whose personal 
accounts these payments were made, we can move on. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well I know it was through Frans Vorster′s personal account 
and Andries van Tonder′s personal account. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And would there be any refund to the person who 
financed the purchase? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  How would that be affected? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well how it would be done is a bonus would be put through for 
the person and the payment would then be made, the tax payed them it and the cheque 
or the EFT would be deposited into the person′s account that had to make the payment. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And which company affected the refund? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the refund would have been done via 
Concilium Business Consultants. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and did an issue arise in relation to this 
arrangement?  You deal with that in paragraph 29.18. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there was an issue, because the Mercedes Benz had to 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 107 of 194 
 
be paid immediately.  They needed the payment and when you order a car from 
Mercedes Benz you basically have to take delivery of the car.  You cannot turn around 
and say well I prefer Mr X to take over the car.  The car was ordered by Frans and the 
only way to get it into Gillingham′s name would be to do it through a company or to do it 
– to actually order it in his name. 
 
So what happened was I received a bonus of R150 000 which I then paid 
over to Carlos Bonifacio who was a Bosasa employee as a loan and then I would be 
reimbursed via Concilium Consultants.  I received the bonus, I paid my money to Carlos 
and Carlos in turn paid Constantia Kloof Motors. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What happened to Mr Gillingham during 
10 
September 2008? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He was suspended together with Zach Modise. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did Mr Gillingham contest his suspension? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, he did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was he assisted in any respect by Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, we paid his attorney fees. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, and what happened during 2008 in relation to the 
SIU investigation and Mr Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the SIU raided his house, Mr Gillingham′s house.  
Gavin Watson phoned me and said that the SIU had raided the house, come across a 
20 
Bosasa laptop in the possession of Gillingham with the specification documents on it.  
He instructed me to go and meet with Gillingham and I left the office and was on my 
way to Gillingham and to meet him at his house. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you meet Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, when I arrived at his house he mentioned that the SIU 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 108 of 194 
 
had also found a business card printed for him by Dr Jurgen Smit which showed that he 
was a consultant for Concilium Business Consultants.  I did not – I must just add I knew 
nothing about that.  He then informed me he was instructed by Gavin Watson to 
accompany Dr Jurgen Smit to a meeting with the manufacturer of items for the 
Department of Correctional Services and that they had to believe that he was a Director 
of Concilium Business Consultants. 
 
So…[intervenes] 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At the time do you know whether – well you know that 
Mr Gillingham was still employed albeit on suspension by the Department of 
Correctional Services? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you know whether he was also a consultant for 
Concilium? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He was not. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At that time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He was not actually a consultant for Concilium, because I 
checked afterwards and he never appeared on Concilium′s payroll. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know whether he was a Director of 
Concilium Business Consultants at that time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, he was not a Director.  At the meeting he was to lead 
20 
them to believe that he was a Director of Concilium Business Consultants. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There will be evidence later about the SIU search on the 
premises of Mr Gillingham, but in the meanwhile did you receive any instructions from 
Gavin Watson relating to ramifications that the raid might have had for those 
concerned? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 109 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely.  I was told that the legal ramifications needed 
to be dealt with and we needed to sort, to get strong legal representative. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In particular what did Gavin Watson tell you to do? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He told me…[intervenes] 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did he say should happen? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He told me that I needed to arrange fictitious loan agreements 
between – that needed to be drafted and concluded between Gillingham and the 
various Bosasa employees for all the moneys. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  All the moneys? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That they had received. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That who had received? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That Gillingham had received and the benefits. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you do that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I did do that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Where are those agreements? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Those agreements are currently with the attorneys and with 
the various Gillingham himself and the people. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have any in your possession? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I mark here Annexure L which is the only thing that I had in my 
possession relating to that and that refers to a declaration that he made to the 
20 
Commission at that stage with Mti, which was back dated so that it coincided with when 
Mti was the Commissioner, that basically said that he had declared some of the loans. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, let us take that step by step. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps I pre-empted your evidence.  In 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 110 of 194 
 
paragraph 29.23.2 you say that you were also instructed to do something by 
Gavin Watson in relation to the outcome of the raid or the search and seizure operation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I had to prepare a declaration in terms – on behalf of 
Gillingham declaring that the money and the benefits he received were in fact loans to 
Mti and I had to back date the declaration.  Mti was then to approve the declaration and 
hold on, given back to Gillingham and I then took the declaration.  I got Gillingham to 
sign it, took the declaration to Mti where I met him at the Protea Midrand who after – he 
did not want to sign it, but after I had spoken to Watson over the phone handed him the 
10 
phone he then agreed to sign it.  And it is reflected in Annexure L. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, before we go to Annexure L, let us just get two 
things clear.  You took the declaration to Mti at the Protea Midrand? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You asked Mti to sign? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Mti initially refused? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You phoned Mr Gavin Watson and spoke to him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You then handed the phone to Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Whilst Gavin Watson was still on the phone? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And a discussion probably took place, is that correct? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 111 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius do you want him to give more of that evidence himself? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am just summarising and then he can add anything 
more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  After that discussion, what did Mr Mti do? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well after that discussion what can I say, Mr Mti what did he 
do? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no he just left it.  I mean he just gave me the document 
10 
back. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He back dated and he signed it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  He signed it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, I thought that was in my statement, I thought you had 
seen it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, I am just taking it through step by step. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It might have been unclear. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no, after he had spoken to Gavin Watson on the phone he 
gave the phone back to me.  He received an instruction from Gavin Watson and he just 
did as he was told.  He just signed and gave it back to me and it was back dated. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Would you go to page 349 of the bundle, which is the 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 112 of 194 
 
cover page and then there is a document at page 350? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What is this document? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That document is, every year I was told that I was explained – 
it was explained to me that they do a declaration of any gifts or anything that needs to 
be declared.  This is a document that we got typed up. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who got typed up? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Patrick Gillingham got it typed up.  Well I assisted typing it, he 
got me the letterhead. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And this document was typed? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is a document signed by POC Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And it reads: 
″Our personal discussion on this matter refers:″ 
 
It is addressed to the Commissioner? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At that time Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And it reads: 
20 
"Our personal discussion on this matter refers:  Since the 
document which is designed for the disclosure of the financial 
status for SMS members does not make provision for the 
information on personal loans.  I wish to bring the following to 
your attention as discussed.  I have entered into personal 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 113 of 194 
 
agreements, arrangements with private individuals for 
assistance for my house and other personal assets.  I wish to 
place on record that these individuals are not members of this 
Department, nor are they employed by government.  For your 
information and record purposes.″ 
 
And there is a signature, do you recognise that signature? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And it is against the date 12 April 2006? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is this the document that you were referring to? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is the document. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is it signed by anyone other than Mr Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, it is also signed by Richmond Mti. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  There is a handwritten note on that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  When you say it is also signed by Mr Mti, are you saying 
the same document or a similar document is signed by Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was the same document, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am getting there, Chair, it is the handwritten portion in 
the bottom right hand corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the signature that appears at the right hand corner the bottom of 
20 
the document at page 350, is that Mr Mti′s signature? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Just above my signature, yes, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well page 350 is initialled by two persons, presumably 
as you said yourself and one other? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 114 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That would have happened when this document was 
commissioned? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  By this document I mean the affidavit and the 
Annexures? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But the particular memorandum that we are referring to 
has some handwriting in the bottom right hand corner.  Do you see that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And if I can read it, it reads: 
10 
″Noted.  Please ensure that this…″ 
 
And I cannot really read what it says thereafter, can you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does not interfere, is it interfere? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  ″Please ensure that this does not interfere with your job or…″ 
CHAIRPERSON:  ″Or rather has no conflict of interest…″ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  ″With the Department.″ 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  ″To the Department.″ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Or to the Department. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Do you – you were at the meeting that you have 
20 
just referred to.  Were you present when this was signed by Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was present. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And were you present when the note was made? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was present. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who made the note? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 115 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Mti. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So at the meeting you have referred to the 
document was produced, there was a discussion with Mr Watson and pursuant to or 
after that discussion a note was placed on the document and signed in your presence 
by Mr Mti? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You speak of Mr Peterson, Vernie Petersen, 
Vernie Petersen again in paragraph 29.24 and the period late 2008, what happened 
then? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well during late 2008 we still could not speak to 
10 
Vernie Petersen, so he was sort of moved to the Department of Sports and Recreation 
and the lady who was at Sports and Recreation as the Director General was moved and 
appointed as the National Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who was that person? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That person was Xoliswa Sibeko. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And that is Xoliswa[spelt]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think it is pronounced Xoliswa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Xoliswa. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And Sibeko[spelt]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Now after she – you say she was appointed as the 
National Commissioner for the Department of Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  After that appointment did you receive information 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 116 of 194 
 
regarding the fate of the control room contract held by Sondolo IT Pty Limited? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, sir. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What were you told? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We were told that the Department of Correctional Services 
was going to cancel the contract and Xoliswa Sibeko was adamant that she did not 
want the Bosasa group involved with Correctional Services.  So I was tasked by 
Mr Gavin Watson to accompany Papa Leshabane to the Intercontinental Hotel again at 
O R Tambo Airport to meet with Mr Zach Modise. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, before you go on which contract was this?  You 
say the control room contract? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was it the staffing of the control rooms? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was the staffing of the control rooms. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, and you have referred to that contract before? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, and then who was Mr Modise at the time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Zach Modise was at that stage in charge of Correctional 
Care Chair and Security at the Department of Correctional Services.  So he was pretty 
high up in, in the department.  He had a Chief Deputy Commissioner status. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What happened at this meeting? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well I, the meeting commenced with myself and Mr Modise 
and I was busy explaining to him the benefits of the outsourcing and it was then that 
Leshabane arrived and he gave, while we were discussing the benefits of, of 
outsourcing he gave Mr Modise a packet, the grey security packet wrapped in a 
newspaper. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 117 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Had anything happened earlier that day to give you an 
indication of what this parcel was all about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well earlier that day Gavin Watson and myself had actually a 
grey plastic bag with cash to be handed over to Modise and the bag was given to 
Leshabane.  So very similar to what happened with Joe Gumede previously where he 
took the bag with him.  In this instance it was Papa Leshabane who took the bag with 
him. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what did you actually see physically at the meeting 
in relation to this bag? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, could you please clarify that question. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did you see physically that happened at the 
meeting in relation to the bag? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the bag was handed over in the newspaper.  So you can 
see whether the bag is not fully covered and wrapped.  It is not wrapped like fish and 
chips or something.  It is still sticks open.  So there was a newspaper and it was 
handed over in a newspaper.  That is what I saw. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you speak to Mr Leshabane about that particular 
event after the meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I spoke to him afterwards and just to confirm that he had given 
the full amount to Modise. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what was Mr Leshabane’s response? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That he had. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the full amount for Mr Modise? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I cannot remember? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 118 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think I mention it in the statement.  I think we get to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, you can get to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So who was at the meeting, yourself, Mr …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was myself, Papa Leshabane and Mr Zach Modise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did you say this was at the Intercontinental Hotel at OR 
Tambo. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, but we did not have lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that, but that is the same hotel where you had met Mr Nxele at 
10 
some stage? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This meeting specifically was in the foyer where there is a 
lounge area not in a restaurant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Oh, mister, your meeting with Mr Nxele in the same hotel 
at some stage was in a restaurant in the hotel? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At the hotel.  We were having lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Would you go to page 352 please? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I am sorry.  Mister, did Mr Modise accept the, the money the bag, 
security bag and did he go with it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Must have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he take it with him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Must have.  He was actually on his way either to Cape Town 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 119 of 194 
 
or to Durban one of the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You go on now in your affidavit to talk of a media 
release. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Would you go to page 352 of Bundle S1? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am there. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is this the document that you are referring to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry.  I may 
have missed this.  Mr Modise was not one of those who were getting monthly 
10 
payments.  Was he? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, he was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time, he was? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is what appears to be a press release or a transcript of 
a press release under the heading “Prisons Graft here is the proof Minister”. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the by-line is that of the Journalist Adriaan Basson 
Johannesburg South Africa, 30 January 2009. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I recall the article very well.  It was probably one of the most 
accurate articles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that Mr Pretorius? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 120 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  January, the 30th. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The page no, the page where I would find that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  352. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You say this article is accurate to your knowledge? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely not like some of the smut being written today. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us just stick to this article shall we. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It reads: 
10 
“On Sunday the Department of Correctional Services placed 
expensive advertisements in three national newspapers urging 
anyone with proof of impropriety in the awarding of prisons 
contracts to inform South Africa’s Law Enforcement Agencies.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall those advertisements? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the second paragraph reads: 
“This week we present the proof.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It continues to read: 
“Confidential documents and correspondents leaked to the Mail 
& Guardian suggests a highly improper relationship between 
the department and controversial Facilities Management Group 
Bosasa.” 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 121 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It goes on to read: 
“We can reveal that Bosasa which has received nearly R3 
billion in contracts from Correctional Services Minister 
Ngconde Balfour’s Department had confidential documents 
leaked to it by the Department’s former Chief Financial Officer 
and Balfour confidante Patrick Gillingham had access to tender 
documents for major prison projects before they were 
advertised and spied on senior correctional services officials 
during a 2006 workshop.” 
10 
Let us just review that paragraph please Mr Agrizzi.  The estimate of R3 billion 
contracts received by Bosasa from Correctional Services.  Is that estimate reasonably 
accurate? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think, you know, of one adds up everything together.  I have 
not done the exercise right now but it looks, it was an accurate article.  It was actually a 
very good article. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the amount? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot comment.  I would have to actually work it out. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The first bullet refers to the receipt of confidential 
documents leaked to Bosasa by the Departments former Chief Financial Officer and 
20 
Balfour confidante Patrick Gillingham.  Leave aside the relationship between Gillingham 
and Balfour for the moment please.  That fact is it correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In terms of the Balfour, sorry can you refer me to the 
paragraph and it is in my statement. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You are at page 352? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 122 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  I am just reading the article. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You see in the top third of the article or the 
…[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Document  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There are three bullets. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  I am dealing with the first bullet. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am not asking you about the relationship between then 
Mr Balfour and Patrick Gillingham. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What I am asking you is whether it is correct to your 
knowledge that confidential documents and documents confidential to the Department 
of Correctional Services were leaked to Bosasa by Mr Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you have given evidence of exchange of 
20 
documents. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Already and you may give more. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The second bullet reads: 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 123 of 194 
 
“Bosasa had access to tender documents for major prison projects before they were 
advertised.”  Is that also …[intervenes]? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That that is correct.  I would like us to go back to the second 
bullet. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The first point? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The first bullet. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You would like to go back to the first point. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Balfour, alright at that stage Minister Ngconde Balfour 
actually only received probably a glass of wine from Bosasa when he visited us.  He did 
not receive anything.  I want that clarified. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And there is no, I mean he maybe had a glass of wine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Red wine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The third bullet reads: 
20 
“Spied on senior correctional services officials during a 2006 
workshop.” 
Do you know anything about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  It was done. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What happened?  I do not recall it was in your evidence 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 124 of 194 
 
…[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it was an instruction. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thus far. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is… 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We should try and speak one at a time if that is possible. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So tell the Chair about that spying operation or event. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  What happened there Chair was that basically I was asked to 
do a spying exercise on them by Patrick Gillingham and at that stage he was so 
powerful and Richmond Mti was so powerful he just followed.  Whatever they wanted 
10 
they got.  As simple as that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So what actually happened? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there was a company employed to go and take 
photographs and to actually mingle with them.  I cannot remember which company it 
was and to give a report back on them. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Them meaning Correctional Services Officials? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the event at which this occurred was a workshop 
which was held in 2006? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did you supervise that exercise? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just got feedback from it.  I actually if, if you ask me if I 
supervised it.  Yes, I would take responsibility and I supervised it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and to whom did the report of this exercise go? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It went to Patrick Gillingham. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 125 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The next paragraph deals with Mr Gavin Watson.  
We need not deal with that.  The next paragraph deals with Lindela and perhaps we 
should just read that onto the record. 
“The Group also runs the controversial Lindela Repatriation 
Camp...” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “…for the Department of Home Affairs…” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “…and has large contracts with the South 
African Post Office, Airport Company of South Africa and the 
10 
Departments of Justice and Transport.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You have testified to those matters.  It goes on to say: 
“The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has been probing the 
Bosasa since 2006 and raided its offices in December.  Three 
weeks after the raid the company was re-awarded the massive 
prisons catering contract it landed in 2004.” 
Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I said that this is probably the most accurate news report, but I 
did not say that it did not have errors in it and the one error is that there were three 
20 
weeks after the raid.  There was not actually a raid.  It was arranged that they come 
and copy the server file.  So that is not correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So the Special Investigating Unit …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  (SIU) did attend at Bosasa premises and carried out 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 126 of 194 
 
certain search, searches there in particular copying of servers? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, it was, but it was not a raid. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  [Intervenes] detail of that in due course. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But is it correct that three weeks after that event and 
notwithstanding that event Bosasa was re-awarded the catering contract that was 
originally or had originally being granted in 2004? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  It goes on to read: 
“The department’s advertisements on Sunday were a reaction 
10 
to the Mail & Guardian’s report last week of alleged regularities 
and the awarding of the latest catering tender.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It goes on to say: 
“Former Prisons Commissioner Vernie Petersen suspended 
Gillingham in September after receiving a preliminary SIU 
Report.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “Petersen was later transferred to the Sports 
Department in what was widely seen as a reprisal for his 
20 
opposition to Balfour’s attempts to extend the 2004 contract.” 
That is what the report says, but you give no evidence in regard to Minister Balfour. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think Balfour was innocent in this.  I do not think he tried to 
extend it.  I think what happened was he walked into a meeting if I recall correctly.  He 
was annoyed with Vernie Petersen, because Vernie Petersen had accused him of 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 127 of 194 
 
receiving a vehicle from Bosasa and what happened was and I am sorry.  I did not 
comment on this, because I did not think you would ask, but basically he was annoyed 
with Vernie Petersen and he said I will show you who is boss.  That is apparently what 
happened, but I can tell you now that there was no evidence ever that Balfour had 
received a vehicle or anything like that and I do not think it was Balfour that pushed him 
out. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But in any event it is correct you say that 
Vernie Petersen suspended Gillingham in September. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That point is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Of which year?  2006 is it? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was later.  It was about 2007 I think, 2008 around there or I 
cannot recall. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  After, let us just interpose here, because it is relevant 
and will become relevant later.  After Mr Petersen had suspended Gillingham you say 
Mr Petersen or the article says Mr Petersen was later transferred out of the Department 
of Correctional Services. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What happened to Mr Gillingham after his suspension or 
after this suspension? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well he sat as home and. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No, but do you know whether he was reemployed or was 
finally dismissed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, just explain again to me.  I do not understand.  He was 
not dismissed.  He was, he was put on suspension. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 128 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he went on suspension for about a year. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not know if that clarifies that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he wants to know what happened after that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then he resigned. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He actually resigned from the department and he was in. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is what it was. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was there an earlier occasion on which Mr Gillingham 
was suspended? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No.  Not that I am aware of. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  We will deal with that evidence in due course. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us get back to the text of the press release on page 
352 and I am sorry I took you out of sequence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know what role Mr Gillingham played in relation 
to the award of what is referred to here as the latest catering tender? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well as far as I know he was the Head of the Tender 
Committee. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Bid Adjudication and the Bid Evaluation Committees. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and we will get to the detail of that when we deal 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 129 of 194 
 
with the SIU Report. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And then there is a heading “2004 A New Romance”.  
The press release under the heading “Here is the proof Minister” continues.  It reads: 
“In 2004 the contract for running prisons kitchens was 
outsourced for the first time.  The tender was officially 
advertised on May, the 21st in the Government’s Tender 
Bulletin…” 
You have given evidence about…[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That contract.  It goes on to read: 
“…but documents show that on May, the 1st Bosasa employee 
and co-founder Danny Mansell sent Bosasa’s Operations 
Coordinator Angelo Agrizzi papers containing more than 90 
percent of the bid conditions and specifications.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So that is a communication of information relevant to the 
bid to yourself approximately three weeks before the tender was first advertised? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The article continues: 
20 
“Three weeks later the Department of Correctional Services 
made available the same document with the same spelling 
errors to the rest of the catering sector.” 
Do you recall that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I do. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 130 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  is it correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is 100 percent correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “On August, the 6th Bosasa was awarded the 
entire contract worth R239 million a year for three years.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It goes onto read: 
“The Department extended Bosasa’s contract for another year 
and expanded it to include more prisons adding R82 million to 
the bill.” 
Is that correct? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think I do cover that in my affidavit as well. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And that paragraph concludes: 
“It was the further extension that led to Petersen’s clash with 
Balfour.” 
Do you know anything about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As I mentioned earlier there was a discussion between 
Petersen and Balfour and there was an altercation about the vehicle, the actual 
altercation was about the vehicle which Petersen wrongly accused Balfour of. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, but do you know anything about the further 
extension of the contract being a matter of some dispute between Petersen and 
Balfour? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am not fully aware of that, no. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  It continues that is the article continues and we 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 131 of 194 
 
are at page 353. 
“In July 2004 the department also gave Bosasa a R1 million 
tender for nutritional training for prisons kitchen staff.” 
Is that a correct fact? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is, that is correct, because and you will recall yesterday I 
alluded to it in terms of the function that I was invited to by Dr Smith.  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The paragraph continues: 
“Again Mansell sent Agrizzi large parts of the tender document 
including bid conditions and specifications on May, the 12th.  
The tender was advertised on June, the 4th.” 
10 
Are those facts correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So just to summarise again once more you were in 
possession of tender documents including bid conditions and specifications before the 
advertisement of the tender? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, but I just want to clarify something.  I think this refers 
to the HK2 2004 which was a catering tender. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  We will get to the detail. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Of four particular tenders investigated. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Reasonably comprehensively it appears at least from the 
…[intervenes].  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Documents by the SIU. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 132 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We will deal with that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am happy with that Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Hopefully sooner rather than later. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then there is a heading on page 353 which reads “2005 
You Have got Mail”.  Do you see that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The paragraph under that heading reads: 
“The inclusion of CCTV Cameras in the catering tender meant 
10 
that by 2005 Bosasa had a national control centre to monitor 
the kitchens.” 
Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It continues to read: 
“This linked perfectly with its next contract the R237 million 
tender for access control and CCTV in 66 prisons.  It went to a 
newly registered company Sondolo IT which Beeld revealed in 
2006 was 40 percent owned by Bosasa Operations.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was the interest in Sondolo IT limited to 40 percent? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Which is owned by Bosasa? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, it was 40 percent.  The others, shareholding was held by 
other companies.  I cannot recall all of them at the moment. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 133 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Other companies …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Other entities. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Bosasa. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Other entities. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Within the Bosasa Group or external to the Bosasa 
Group? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall.  Sorry, Chair.  That was the early days and I 
cannot recall. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In any event the reference here to the CCTV Contract is 
this the same contract to which you had referred in your evidence earlier today? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just before we go on do you know what documents 
Adriaan Basson had in his possession to enable him to author this press release? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In terms of? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well where did he get his information from? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Are you talking specifically about the, the travel invoices?  Are 
you talking about …[intervenes]? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No, I am talking generally about …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The contents of the article. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The contents of …[intervenes]. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh the contents. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This was common knowledge.  He had done his homework.  
He had actually gone and looked for the, for the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Pretorius is asking whether you are able to assist to say 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 134 of 194 
 
this is where she, he must have or he did get the information from. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well he got it from inside the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You, you had nothing to do with the information being given to, 
to him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  I think Mr Pretorius was just trying to see whether there 
might have been somebody inside who was giving the …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There were, there were a couple of people inside, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You have given your evidence and this is the point of the 
10 
question …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You have given your evidence from your own memory 
and your own records? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  This information if you had nothing to do with any 
communication with Mr Basson presumably came from some other source. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I have spoken to him once or twice and that is it.  [Intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But you did not give this information …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, I would not have spoken to him in those years anyway. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and it was given at a time when I understand that 
you were still loyal to Bosasa. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Unfortunately yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So well we can submit, but perhaps I can just 
place on record the submission will be that this is corroborating information from 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 135 of 194 
 
another source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us get back to Sondolo IT.  You said you are not sure 
of who the shareholders were, but you confirm it was 40 percent owned by Bosasa 
Operations in 2006. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair just to give you a bit of background.  The shareholding 
changed like kids eating sweeties.  Sometimes they like separating and having blue 
ones and sometimes they are yellow smarties and sometimes orange smarties.  This 
was a mess.  One never knew what the shareholding was.  It was how Gavin got up in 
the morning.  So I cannot recall. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think it is a point you have made also before to say the 
shareholding used to change very regularly. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The article continues to say: 
“Other shareholders…” 
And the reference is to Sondolo IT. 
“…included former President Thabo Mbeki’s Political Advisor, 
Titus Mafolo.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “…and former Strategic Fuel Fund 
Chairperson Seth Phalatse, P-H-A-L-A-T-S-E.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know that as a fact? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes that is a fact. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 136 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then the article continues in the next 
paragraph to read: 
“On December, the 17th 2004 Bosasa’s IT Coordinator 
Johan Helmand, H-E-L-M-A-N-D, emailed Agrizzi certain tender 
specifications that were to appear in the official bid document 
published on February, the 4th 2005.” 
Is that information correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So once again before the publication of an official bid 
document by the Department of Correctional Services you had in your possession with 
10 
the assistance of Mr Johan Helmand tender specifications? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The articles continues on. 
“On April, the 29th Sondolo IT was awarded the contract.” 
Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “In 2005 Agrizzi and Gillingham started 
emailing each other prison research reports and newspaper 
clippings.” 
Is that correct? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He would send me often his resource papers and all that type 
and …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was the purpose of that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was the purpose of that? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 137 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Perhaps he was trying to keep me informed of what was 
happening in the industry.  I really was not that interested in it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Oh. 
“On August, the 29th Gillingham sent Agrizzi a copy of 
questions from City Press put to the Department about the 
Bosasa contracts the leak documents show.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  It continues in the next paragraph. 
“On December, the 9th 2005 Bosasa landed a R487 million 
prisons contract for security fencing through a small Cape Town 
10 
firm Phezulu Fencing it had purchased.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is that a reference to the evidence you have given earlier 
this morning? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Exactly that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The article continues to read: 
“There is double proof that the company had privileged 
information long before the tender was advertised.” 
You have told the Chair of that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think I explained it in detail. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “Three months earlier on September, the 25th 
Agrizzi emailed Mansell a voluminous document containing bid 
specifications.  “Please verify and check.  We can sit tomorrow 
am” Agrizzi wrote.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I …[intervenes]. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 138 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did that occur? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall that specific date, but if it is in the document it 
occurred. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Well do you have any independent recollection of 
…[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Communications with Mansell containing or in relation to 
a document containing bid specifications? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would have responded to him if he had sent me an email and 
I would have responded in that manner. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But that is all you can say about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot, I cannot recall it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  It continues the article that is to read: 
“On October, the 3rd Agrizzi sent a longer version headed 
“Fence Doc Final” to the Chief Executives of Bekaert, B-E-K-A-
E-R-T Bastion and SA Fence and Gate Michael Rodenburg, R-
O-D-E-N-B-U-R-G and Geoff Greyling respectively.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “…under the subject line “Fence Doc 
Final…Very Confidential…”.” 
20 
What do you recall of the report in that respect? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I recall that I would have been sent that document, because I 
did not have time to do it as I mentioned in my statement.  I would have been sent that 
document by Danny Mansell or perhaps one of the team that were working on the 
actual document itself. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 139 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what would you have done or what do you recall 
doing with that document 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would have literally sped read it and I would just forward it 
back to the team. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the executives mentioned here of Behaert Bastion 
and SA Fence and Gate Michael Rodenburg and Geoff Greyling, do you know them? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the same person that you referred to earlier in 
your statement Rodenburg? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is exactly the same gentleman. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And what would the purpose of – did you recall or 
do you recall sending that longer version Fence Doc Final to the gentlemen referred to 
here? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes you must remember that Mansell had emailed it to me and 
I was the responsible party.  He would want to say he said in his email on the 25 
September we said there that we would sit and we would go through it.  I then would 
have passed that document on to the relevant parties to look at it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And were the persons mentioned in the paragraph we 
have just referred the relevant parties? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It goes on to read that article that is “this contained the 
full bid conditions and specifications published by the department on October14 that is 
eleven days later” is that correct that statement? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall that specific date. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But do you know whether you had in your possession at 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 140 of 194 
 
some stage and you transmitted to relevant parties a document containing the full bid 
conditions and specifications which were later published by the department? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If you have a look at – if you have a look at the sequential flow 
yes that happened. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you have testified to these facts albeit in 
different words this morning? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then that paragraph continues to read “Bekaert Bastion 
supplied cladding material and SA Fence and Gate was contract to do part of the 
installation.”  Are those facts correct? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well they un – incomplete I would say.  Because the – if you 
look at it we testified this morning that the cladding material was actually the fencing, 
the actual mesh and SA Fence and Gate was not the only person that was sub-
contracted to do the fence.  There was a lot of others. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you mentioned. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry I interrupted you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You mentioned those other companies involved this 
morning? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Corrrect. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It goes on to read “This week Greyling categorically 
denied seeing a copy of the bid document before it was published.”  He said “it should 
be recorded that the tender was based on the standard public works of Correctional 
Services specification with which we are all well acquainted from previous bids.  The 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 141 of 194 
 
prior possession of the tender document by anyone would therefore be of no specific 
advantage to such person.”  Now I am not sure that you were privy to what Mr Greyling 
might have said? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot comment Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But there Mr Greyling says “does it matter if you have 
got prior possession of tender documents because it would be useless these matters 
are consistent or these – this information is consistent with standard public works 
Correctional Services specifications and it is of no use to anybody.”  What do you say to 
that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not entirely true. The standard installation process might be 
10 
exactly the same as reflected in the tender specifications of public works or any other 
department but the actual mesh was mentioned was different.  We had made the 
opening and closing mechanisms different so it was not just a normal gate opener it 
was an electro-magnetic slider.  So that was different and there were some other 
changes made as well.  So that paragraph is not entirely true. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So is it correct to say specifically the prior possession of 
the tender document by anyone would therefore be of no specific advantage to such 
person? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it would be definitely of an advantage. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Interestingly in that paragraph although the report said 
20 
Mr Greyling denied seeing a copy of the bid document before it was published his 
explanation seems to indicate that not that he had not seen it but that if he had seen it 
would be of no use to anybody.  But I just make that remark in passing it is not 
necessary to comment.  Let us continue then on page 354 the report continues to read 
“Collett Stofberg of Bekaert Bastion now called Beta Fence replied that years before 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 142 of 194 
 
this contract Beta Fence provided technical specifications to the Department of Public 
Works that were used in this tender.  Do you know anything about that allegation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No I am not aware of the truthfulness of that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right the third paragraph reads “according to an industry 
inside of the big advantage lies in knowing the quantities required for the tender weeks 
before your competitors”. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is fact. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It continues in the next paragraph to read “on October 10 
2005 Agrizzi sent Gillingham a six page document titled Equipment Specifications and 
Guidelines the same section featured in a tender for a comprehensive television system 
10 
comprising six thousand TV’s for communal cells published four days later.”  Is that 
correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On November 28 Agrizzi emailed Mansell the 
confidential evaluation sheet the department used to adjudicate the TV tender which 
Sondolo IT won on March 17 2006.  Is that fact correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That fact is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then in – the article continues on page 354 under a new 
heading reading 2006 Spies In The House.  Paragraph – the first paragraph under that 
head reads:  “on February 9 Agrizzi sent Gillingham a document headed Quote Tender 
20 
Evaluation Criteria New Waterval” contained in comments on bid specificaitons for a 
contract for catering services at seven prisons in the Waterval management area Kwa 
Zulu Natal.”  Do you recall that fact? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is – I recall it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did it occur as stated? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 143 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes it did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It continues.  “The tender was officially advertised on 
May 19.  Seven days earlier Gillingham sent Agrizzi the confidential evaluation sheet 
for the Waterval tender with a message “Hi attached please find the reworked 
evaluation sheet for your comments.  You will notice the evaluation sheet for sites visits 
cannot be published and will not form part of this document.  Regards Patrick.”  Do you 
recall that having occurred? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Not only does it seem that you were provided with a 
confidential evaluation sheet you even asked for your comments? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes he did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you provide comments? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not think I did if I recall correctly.  I cannot recall that 
specifically. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The report continues: “On September 15 Bosasa 
Operations was awarded the Waterval catering tender worth R123 million over five 
years.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On April 24 2006 Agrizzi sent Gillingham a letter in which 
an anonymous writer asks the chairperson of Parliaments Correctional Services Dennis 
20 
Bloom to “sort out” the attack on the department by “international capitalists and 
activists Afrikaner companies”.  This week Bloom confirmed receiving such a letter.”  Do 
you recall that having occurred? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I recall it vividly it was always conspiracy theories created by 
certain individuals. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 144 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So attacks on Bosasa it appears were 
characterised by what is referred to as an anonymous writer as attacks by international 
capitalists and activist Afrikaner companies do I understand that references here 
correctly? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair if I can just add for completeness.  Every time there is 
an attack on Bosasa or anybody of – anybody there it gets blamed on racism, it gets 
blamed on international espionage.  It is all these conspiracy theories so that statement 
there is one hundred and ten percent correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The article continues in the next paragraph to read “on 
June 21 Agrizzi sent Gillingham a surveillance report of a prisons department security 
10 
workshop? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At a Drakensberg Hotel in June 2006.  The 25 page 
report makes it clear that the agent was asked to spy on the department’s Chief Deputy 
Commissioner Of Security Willem Damons, D-a-m-o-n-s and his subordinate Tonie, T-o-
n-i-e Venter.  The report also contains pictures of people and cars at the hotel as well 
as the inside of the conference room.  You spoke earlier this afternoon Mr Agrizzi of the 
spying operation that you were involved in, is this the same operation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is exactly the same operation. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And is it correct that someone was asked to spy on the 
20 
departments Chief Deputy Commissioner of Security and his subordinate? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The article …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those or – I am sorry those on whom Bosasa decided should be 
spied on well was it those that were seen as having a negative attitude towards Bosasa 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 145 of 194 
 
or what? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes anybody who was negative or problematic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Would be spied on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who instigated this spying operation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The actual instigator behind the scenes? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Was Gavin Watson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the purpose of the spy operation? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Was to try and confirm a conspiracy theory that was – I used 
to – may I add for completeness?  I used to have to draw up organograms that were 
fictitious in nature to try and show the conspiracy of the Afrikaner Broederbond from 
Stellenbosch and then it was not the Stellenbosch it was another crowd from wherever.  
It was always conspiracy so I cannot confirm you know that they were true because I 
never saw them.  Does that answer your question? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes in short these were conspiracies that were created 
or sort to be established in order to undermine the good work that Bosasa was doing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Of course it was always a conspiracy to undermine and it was 
from the devil. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if the two of you may have spoken at cross purposes 
just now but the conspiracy theories that you are talking about. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were intended to defend/protect the image of Bosasa.  I thought you 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 146 of 194 
 
– it was within Bosasa that somebody came up with the theories? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a response to some – to negative publicity about Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I am not sure but let us try and clarify it Chair because it 
may be relevant to other evidence that will be lead before you Chair.  Bosasa continued 
with what you have said are its unlawful activities? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There were attacks on Bosasa from amongst others 
10 
media sources? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And Bosasa was attacked for doing what it had done? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In response to those attacks Bosasa said there is no 
merit to these attacks they are merely  
CHAIRPERSON:   Conspiracy theories. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Attacks by international capitalists and activists Afrikaner 
companies for their own conspiratorial purposes? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The article continues “in his message to Gillingham 
Agrizzi wrote I did not see the reason need to email you the rest nothing actually 
happened.  Gillingham replied the next day “hi thanks for the report and it seems as if 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 147 of 194 
 
they behaved well during their session.  Regards.”  Do you recall that exchange 
between yourself and Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Vividly. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Is there anything to add to that that might interest the 
Chair? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I actually said to him that I was uncomfortable doing it 
because nothing actually happened.  There is no – there was no conspiracy theory 
there at all.  These guys were doing their job and they were at a function. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right it continues that is the article continues “Bosasa’s 
lawyer Brian Biebuyck advised his client not to answer the Mail and Guardians’ 
10 
questions.  He warned the Mail and Guardian to publish “at your peril” and said Bosasa 
would pursue charges of criminal deformation if defamatory material were printed.”  We 
know that material was printed because we see it here, reference to it here in these 
pages, was any criminal defamation action ever instituted resulting from this article? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair we did take action against Adriaan Basson at one stage 
but we did – we were not successful at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the action that you are talking about delaying of criminal 
complaint with the police? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it was – we had taken it to the press ombudsman I think 
the press ombudsman was Mr Joe Thloloe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the funny thing was he had made a mistake he must be 
getting on in years and responded he sent a message to Ferial Haffajee and said how 
should I respond to this email. So I – and by accident he had actually sent it to my 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 148 of 194 
 
email address as well.  So that was – and then we took them to court and nothing really 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The final paragraph of the article reads:  “the 
department’s Manelisi M-a-n-e-l-i-s-i  Wolela W-o-l-e-l-a responded that the Mail and 
Guardians questions “are part of a broader brief given to the SIU” and urged the 
newspaper to provide the unit with proof of impropriety.  Gillingham did not respond to 
the Mail Guardians queries.  And then the article continues to refer to pictures which 
are not referred to.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it is a – I do not know if you are taking a break this 
afternoon? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be a good idea to take a short break. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Very good idea Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe of ten minutes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you suggesting we take it now? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will take a ten minutes break and we will resume at ten to 
four. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
HEARING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 149 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Let us move then to paragraph 30.2 of 
your statement you refer to the use of Blakes Travel.  Tell the Chair about that please 
just very briefly? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Briefly you know Chair flights, travel, accommodation and on 
occasion quite frequently there would also be booked by me on the Bosasa VIP 
account at Blakes Travel for Mti, his wife and his family and I have provided the 
supporting documentation and all the flights in a box to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Paragraph 30.3 you relate an incident 
concerning the records at Blakes Travel.  How did this matter arise? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it arose when they started publishing information with 
regards to Blakes Travel.  What actually happened at that stage was that we had to go 
and fetch all the computers from Blakes Travel as well as the invoicing books because 
they had copies and we had to make sure that they were all destroyed.  He obliged and 
handed everything to us. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who gave the instruction? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Instruction came from Mr Watson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And who – to whom was the instruction given? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To both myself and Andries Van Tonder. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the instruction once again. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Was to go to Blakes Travel, collect the computers, collect the 
documents, take them to Luiperds Vlei, destroy them. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  More or less when was this? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This was just after the media report that you read just earlier. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  2009? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 150 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Blakes Travel was going to co-operate with this? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they did? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He did because most of his business came from Bosasa.  We 
spent about R1,7 to R2.2 million a month with them and we were going to replace 
everything.  He took it further if I may clarify for completeness and he then issued us 
with blank invoice books.  Because remember Chair when the invoice has been 
captured on the computer it refers to an invoice number so the invoice number was a 
10 
paper document which had to be replicated and put in the file for the auditors to see.  
But also the names were changed on the document itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what you – you destroyed in terms of this instruction what you 
ultimately destroyed was not just the paperwork it is the computers as well? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how many computers did you destroy? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think there were about three that were being used 
specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So we replaced them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say Bosasa was a big client of Blakes Travel? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We would spend between R1,7 and R2.2 million per month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  With them. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 151 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they knew exactly what you were going to do with the computers 
and why you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No we told him, we told him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they knew why you wanted to destroy the computers and they co-
operated? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right pursuant to this instruction from Gavin Watson did 
you then meet with Brian Blake of Blakes Travel? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did you tell him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I told him that we were instructed to collect all the documents 
and to have them destroyed.  He obliged and he gave it to us. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did he give to you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The documents and the computers. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and after collecting the computers and documents 
what did you and I presume Andries Van Tonder do? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right we drove to a hostel which we were busy 
developing at that stage and there was a big hole there and I – we threw them in there 
and asked someone go and fetch us some petrol, a gentleman by the name of Ryno 
20 
Rhoode who was responsible for various gardening and maintenance and oversight 
over the – like a groundsman type person and tasked him to go get us some petrol.  He 
brought the petrol and we poured it over the items, lit it and burnt everything, burnt all 
the evidence.  We had been instructed to do it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Ryno is spelt R-y-n-o is that correct? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 152 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and the name of the hostel to which you have 
referred? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Luiperds Vlei. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Luipeerds Vlei right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is directly opposite – parallel to the Bosasa offices in the 
same street. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was that a property which belonged to Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what was the condition of the site? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it is a const – it was a construction site at that stage. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And you say in your statement exactly that it was being 
revamped and was a construction site? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did you dig a hole? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes we used a backakter.  There was actually – sorry there 
was actually a hole there.  Gert Van Der Bunk was the guy who drove the TLB. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What is a TLB? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Front end loader I do not know what – all I know is it is yellow 
metal I have never really looked into it. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway there was a hole, what did you do then?  You 
threw the documents and computer in the hole, you set it alight? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Threw everything in there, poured petrol over it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us – one at a time please.  There was a hole, you 
threw the computer and documents in the hole, you set it alight as you said? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 153 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Was anything further done to conceal the operation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was covered up. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Literally. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Okay that is the cover up? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was covered up Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And thereafter in relation to the travel orders that 
subsequently occurred, what was the arrangement? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We have gone into that already in terms of the JJ Venter 
10 
account and basically what happened was that account would be any VIP travel would 
be booked under that account.  And that account then would be reconciled and given to 
Doctor Jurgen Smith at the end of the month who was running Concilium Business 
Consultants Chair and he would then reimburse me through Concilium for the actual 
travel.  So he would take all the travel documentation let us say maybe perhaps I 
booked my family or my children somewhere to go somewhere.  He would go through 
each and every invoice, have a look at it.  If there was personal stuff he would book it to 
me personally and deduct it from the amount, the total amount and give me the balance 
that was used for the individuals. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right that was in relation to travel after the cover up of 
20 
the documents? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was done in relation to the records that were 
destroyed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Could you just explain yourself? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 154 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well now we have a travel company with no records? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think I explained it earlier that there was a certain computer 
that was used for Bosasa or certain computers that were used for the Bosasa account.  
So it was not that they had no records.  They had records but they had just the total 
figure as an opening which would be an opening balance when they start the next 
month. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes then I do not understand the allegation in paragraph 
30.5.  Would you explain that please to the Chair? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  No that was not to do with the – that is to do with the 
Bosasa records not with regards to Blakes records. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Not with regard to? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Blakes records to do with Bosasa’s records of travel.  Let me 
clarify. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Will you tell what happened there? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So what happened is there was a certain employee that was 
instructed because Great Planes would refer you to an amount.  The auditors might 
very well come and say can we pull that invoice please?  So what would happen is this 
lady was instructed by Gavin to rewrite every single travel invoice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In Bosasa because unfortunately Blakes Travel would use a 
carbonised invoice book so they would write accommodation for Mti at the Paxton Hotel 
on this date.  This was his extras, that is their commission ten percent and that is the 
total.  Then that would be transferred onto a statement.  So you had to now rewrite that 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 155 of 194 
 
invoice you could not really scratch it out because there were three copies.  So Matel 
Wils – sorry I just want to correct that because I had slipped out the name.  This person 
would and – sorry I did not want to mention her name for fear of safety. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay they do have the name of the person.  The person would 
write out the invoice but instead of now putting Mti they would write there Agrizzi and 
they would put it in my name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Or they would put it in someone else’s name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then that invoice would be attached and be given back to 
Blakes Travel, their copy, the other copy would be retained in their accounts folder.  
Does that explain the question Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was in relation to the period preceding the destruction of 
evidence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That pre – no it was not preceding the destruction of evidence 
it was post the destruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I understand that the writing up afresh of information. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was post the destruction? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I want you to confirm whether the – the information that was 
being written up now related to what had happened prior to the destruction? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 156 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So just in summary then after revelations in the media 
concerning the activities of Bosasa in relation to favours concerning travel and 
accommodation Blakes records were destroyed and Bosasa’s records were recreated? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you do say that what had prompted or this or at least in part 
was that a journalist it appeared had copies of documents from Blakes Travel which 
showed that Bosasa used Blakes Travel to facilitate travel arrangements of amongst 
others government officials.  Now you had – you destroyed the records, Blakes records 
relating to travel arrangements made at the request of Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  For a certain period.  Now what was the plan as to how the 
information that this journalist seemed to have was going to be dealt with?  Was it that 
it was going to be suggested that it was authentic? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Information? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  On the basis that – on the basis that anybody who went to 
Blakes Travel records would find something different? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It would be a conspiracy theory from Stellenbosch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course at the destruction of – of the evidence was a true 
conspiracy? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 157 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was you are right. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  I must point out, Chair, and to you Mr Agrizzi that in 
paragraph 30.1 you refer to Annexure M as the media release containing information 
from Blake′s.  The portion and it appears to be a portion of Annexure M which we have 
just dealt with in your evidence does not appear to refer to Blake Travel.  I stand to be 
corrected, but it does appear that, that media report attached is not complete, but we 
will check it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I can just add there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I recall, Chair, there was actually pictures of Photostatted 
invoices, handwritten ones that appeared with that.  So there should be more there.  I 
think that was the only Annexure I had at this stage, but I am sure if we ask the paper 
concerned they will provide it to us. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, in fact if we go back to Annexure M – if we go back 
to page 351 where we see the article and turn to page 354. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At the bottom of the page we have pictures from a 
confidential surveillance report of a senior department of and then the document says 
no more, but it appears that there is further content to this Annexure. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well we will check that and revert if necessary. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, correct.  Thank you, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 30.6 then you say what the position was 
after the destruction of the Blake′s Travel documents and the arrangement that was 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 158 of 194 
 
made in relation to travel for very important clients of Bosasa, correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  They were fictitiously recorded in the books of 
Black′s Travel, is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 30.7 you say that Mr Blake was 
subpoenaed to testify in a matter instituted by the SIU in the Pretoria High Court.  Very 
briefly what was that matter? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The SIU wanted information, records, documentation and hard 
drives in terms of any dealings with the Bosasa group of companies and that is what it 
10 
was about. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what happened in relation to that subpoena? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the subpoena was…[intervenes] 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  To your knowledge? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To my knowledge, I know, because I was integrally involved, 
Chair.  The subpoena was postponed and postponed.  There were numerous 
arguments and excuses given and basically ended up with a meeting that took place at 
Brian Blake′s attorney′s office one morning with Brown Biebuyck present, myself 
present in Randfontein where we tried to intimate to their attorney that he must start to 
postpone and play for time with the SIU. 
20 
 
His attorney was not happy, because he said you know you people are trying 
to and he told Brown Biebuyck he actually said to him that you are playing with fire, 
because you are trying to interfere with witnesses. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Were you to your knowledge successful in your 
endeavour to prevent the subpoena being carried out? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 159 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, I do not think, no, I do not know at all, no. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know whether Blake ever testified in court? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am not aware. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 31 you go on to deal with information 
received by Gavin Watson arising out of the SIU investigation.  Would you tell the, 
Chair, what happened in respect of the SIU investigation and the records of Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you deal with that question Mr Agrizzi, I am looking for the 
paragraph here and I do not see – yes I think it is paragraph 30.7 that Mr Pretorius 
referred to a few minutes ago.  You say Blake was subpoenaed to testify in a matter 
10 
instituted by the SIU in the Pretoria High Court.  Gavin Watson instructed me to a 
meeting with Blake and his attorney to ensure that Blake would not implicate Bosasa in 
his evidence. 
 
You might not be able to answer this but if you can please do.  Do you know 
– you know the idea that an attorney must go and have a meeting with somebody to 
ensure that they do not, that person does not implicate somebody else seems strange.  
It is different if he is going there to listen and note whether what his evidence is.  What 
was your understanding of what Mr Biebuyck′s role was really going to be there?  Was 
it just to go and listen to what was being said or was it much more than that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No the role that was played and you must remember, Chair, as 
20 
I mentioned right in the beginning of my testimony if an instruction was given to you and 
you did not follow it out there was a dustbin with your name on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but this was – was this not an independent attorney? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It does not matter.  The instruction would be do not use him 
anymore.  And who was his biggest client?  It was us. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 160 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he would do whatever he had to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying to me that from what you knew in terms of his role 
and the interactions between himself, that is now the attorney and yourselves and 
Mr Gavin Watson with him, all of them, he knew that his role was to prevent Mr Blake 
telling the truth? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was to stymie the investigation.  That was his role.  He went 
out there to stymie the investigation and there is a second occurrence with different 
people as well, Chair, so it is not just one isolated occurrence, but the fact is and this is 
what I try to get across right in the beginning, that even I cannot say a Judge, I do not 
10 
want to take that chance, but even the dear Pope would probably be corrupted if they 
had to deal with the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what you are saying is quite serious. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Very. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Particularly in respect of an attorney. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just want you to make sure that you are quite clear that what 
you are saying is really true. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, I would not lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I did not spend fortunes to get to this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And my time and my effort to lie to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I will come and tell you the truth. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 161 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the fact of the matter is he had to stymie the appearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Of both Mr Brian Blake and also…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Which he did very successfully.  He stymied it for I think close 
to two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us just understand your evidence in that respect.  
You 
understand 
as 
we 
said 
in 
opening 
before 
you 
gave 
evidence 
10 
Mr Agrizzi…[intervenes] 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That we are not presenting a case to the, Chair, we are 
presenting ongoing investigations. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  They will be tested in due course. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  By further investigations and they will obviously be 
tested in due course by cross-examination of you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the submission to the, Chair, of different versions. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Only thereafter will the, Chair, make up his mind and 
only thereafter will we make any submissions in regard to the truth or otherwise and the 
reliability of your evidence. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 162 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am well aware of that, Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So we are in an investigation process at the moment.  
Let me just say in relation to this, if the attorney concerned was briefed by Bosasa to 
protect Bosasa′s interest there may have been a legitimate interest in finding out 
whether Blake′s Travel a client of Bosasa had any information that might implicate or 
prejudice Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would not know what the legal ramifications are.  I will just 
put it to the, Chair, as it happened and this is what happened and this is what I am 
putting to the, Chair.  In terms of the legal ramifications of that it really does not worry 
me in the sense that I would rather just tell you the truth.  Hopefully you can prove 
10 
through this all that the justice system in South Africa actually works. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well it may be that your understanding of the meeting is 
a gloss that you put on the contents of the meeting, which is your own perspective and 
that the facts of the meeting were really Mr Biebuyck making legitimate enquiries of the 
attorney of Blake′s Travel. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The attorney was quite annoyed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which attorney? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Which attorney? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Blake′s attorney.  So I will leave it up to the investigators as 
was suggested by adv Pretorius that the investigators do the investigation and they 
20 
make their own conclusion rather. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go on then.  In paragraph 31.1 you say that 
Gavin Watson received information in respect of the progress of the SIU′s 
investigation? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 163 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We will refer in more detail later in your evidence to the 
receipt of information by Bosasa and its representatives concerning the SIU 
investigation, but I want to ask you please about the contents of paragraph 31.1 where 
you say that an instruction was given to an IT specialist.  Let us start, who gave the 
instruction referred to here? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Every single instruction came from Gavin Watson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the IT specialist referred to, was that an employee 
of Bosasa group or an external specialist? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was an internal person in the company that worked in IT. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And were you present when the instruction was given? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I was. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was the instruction? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The instruction was to fake a crash, server crash and destroy 
files. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Which files? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Any files that could implicate the company, before the 
investigators could gather evidence. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, at this stage had the SIU investigators searched 
the premises of Bosasa? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Before the instruction was carried out was any process 
undertaken? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There was a disaster log created on the server and I 
circulated a memo in this regard, but unfortunately I could not find the memo, so I have 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 164 of 194 
 
what is known as the disaster log reflected in Annexure N. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, I am referring to the information which you say 
was ultimately destroyed. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Apart from the destruction was the information preserved 
in another form? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  How? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was preserved in  - before the destruction of evidence I 
requested that it be preserved on two hard drives or three hard drives that I have made 
10 
available to the Commission and made available to the HAWKS. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The document at page 356 what is that 
document? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, I just need to get to it.  Annexure N refers to a data log 
which is called the disaster data log for 8 November 2007. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right this is the cover page of a document. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The document at page 357 is that part of this disaster 
log? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Where do we find the scope of disaster and its 
classification referred to in the contents list on page 356? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well – sorry are you asking me where do we find the extent of 
the data that was damaged or lost? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No.  Sorry.  Let me be clear. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 165 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On page 356 there is a document headed Bosasa IT 
disaster log 8 November 2007. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Under the head contents…[intervenes] 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  There is a list presumably of those contents, one, 
background, two, scope of disaster, three, disaster classification, four, and recovery 
strategy. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Can you help us please, because I am not an expert, 
and I presume the, Chair, is also not an expert.  Where do we find in this document or 
the document on the following page the scope of the disaster, the disaster classification 
and the recovery strategy? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, I cannot answer this.  I definitely probably less versed 
in computers than you are. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In any event on page 257 there is a paragraph which 
reads: 
″Dear Johan.  It is with regret that I have to inform you that we 
cannot perform a data recovery on your raid 5 set due to two 
20 
hard drives having failed simultaneously.  According to our data 
recovery specialists it is impossible to rebuild the raid set if two 
drives fail.″ 
 
And then there is some more technical language which follows, but perhaps 
an expert can explain that to the Commission or whoever might be interested in the 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 166 of 194 
 
future. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  Sorry, I cannot help there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 31.2 you refer to a telephone call that you 
received from Gavin Watson as you say on a Sunday afternoon. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was at a hotel.  I was actually entertaining guests, Americans 
that had been working with us on the PPP project and I received a call, it was on a 
Sunday, yes, it was a Sunday afternoon and I was told that the offices were going to be 
raided the next Monday.  I was only supposed to come back on the Tuesday, because 
these were Americans and they were on a game safari drive and that type of thing.  I 
10 
had to leave them.  I was instructed to come back. 
 
I had to leave them there, arrange transport for them back and drive back to 
the office. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did Mr Watson tell you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He told me that he got information from Mr Seopela that the 
HAWKS were going to be raiding, someone was going to be raiding the office.  I cannot 
remember if it was the HAWKS or the Scorpions, I do not know who it was, but we were 
told to meet him at the office, so I met him at the office. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did Mr Watson tell you whether Mr Seopela told 
him in turn when this raid as you describe it would take place? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was apparently Monday, the Monday. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, the day following the telephone call from Watson to 
yourself? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did Mr Seopela tell Mr Watson anything else that 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 167 of 194 
 
Mr Watson related to you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He said they were looking for specific documents and specific 
transactions. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I was just told to be at the office. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you go to the office? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And when you arrived there did you find Mr Watson 
there? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As a matter – I found him in his office. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who else was there? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Andries van Tonder was with him. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did you receive any instructions? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, the instructions were, they gave at that stage -  I cannot 
even remember, but at that stage Andries was ahead of me, we were instructed to go 
through all the offices to have a look at anything possibly incriminating evidence, the 
information that Gavin received from Mr Seopela was that they were looking for the sale 
of shares agreement in respect of Phezulu Fencing as well as the agreement between 
Gavin Watson and Mti for the payment of money in return for an undertaking from him, 
they were not sure that Bosasa would be given preference in the awarding of tenders 
20 
with Correctional Services. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did such a document exist? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, it did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  How do you know that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because I saw the document and I actually made a Photostat 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 168 of 194 
 
of that document. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And do you have that Photostat? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Unfortunately I do not have that Photostat. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So if I understand you correctly you saw a document? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Being an agreement between Gavin Watson and Mr Mti 
for the payment of money in return for an undertaking to favour Bosasa in relation to 
the awarding of tenders? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was a three page document and it was very specific. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did it say what you have said in paragraph 31.3? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is exactly. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And were you instructed to look for any particular 
documents? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, we were instructed to look for them. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Those documents to which you have just referred? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did you find those documents? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We found those documents. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What did you do in respect of those documents? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well in terms of – are you referring me back now to 31.3?  
20 
Because you are asking me if we found them? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No I am dealing with 31.4.  What did you – you found the 
document and then what did you do with them? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We removed the documents, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am sorry, I am sorry Mr Pretorius, before you proceed.  Just to 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 169 of 194 
 
go back to 31.3. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say you found a document that appeared to be an agreement 
between Mr Gavin Watson and Mr Mti about that Mr Mti would ensure that Bosasa was 
favoured in terms of contracts from Correctional Services and he would be paid by 
Mr Gavin Watson that is what you say? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said you made a photocopy of that agreement, did I 
understand you correctly? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you proceeded and said that you do not have it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it get lost in the meantime or? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, they were all packed together and they were stored. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you saw it, you had it for some time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had had a chance to read it properly? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you.  It was signed by both? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was not signed, it was only signed by Gavin Watson.  I 
20 
cannot recall if it was signed by Mti.  I know that it was signed by Tony Perry as a 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall seeing Mti′s signature.  I would be lying if I told 
you that I had seen it, I cannot recall it. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 170 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It seems improbable if not very strange that such an 
arrangement would be recorded in writing and signed. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was done. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have any comment? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was done.  It was recorded in writing. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And what is also a matter of some concern in relation to 
your evidence Mr Agrizzi is that yesterday and previous days you have testified not 
once but I think more than once that it was Gavin Watson′s affirmed practice never to 
reduce things to writing and never to sign anything.  If this was an exception it is a very 
10 
unusual exception. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think that Mr Richmond Mti perhaps knew Gavin better than 
all of us and he insisted that there be a signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Mti too would know that this was a wrong agreement what 
they were agreeing to do was wrong and he probably would not like there to be a 
written record of what he was a party to. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, you will see later on that the agreement was actually 
found much later on and it was actually the – it was then shown not only to myself but 
to somebody else as well and then handed back to Mr Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you are not sure about Mr Mti′s signature on the 
20 
document, but you are sure about Mr Gavin Watson′s signature? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, I can guarantee you that the signatures that were on 
the document were very noticeable signatures.  They were Gavin Watson and 
Tony Perry and there were other signatures.  I do not know if it was Richmond Mti′s 
signature, I cannot recall.  I have seen his signature on one other document and that 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 171 of 194 
 
was post the fact when we got him to sign the acknowledgement of debt and that is why 
I cannot comment.  I cannot say that was his signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  His name was there, but whether it was his signature or not I 
cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps that evidence Mr Agrizzi will be tested in due 
course under cross-examination, but for the present it seems that even on your own 
evidence Gavin Watson would no sign documents, because as you say he did not want 
to be held accountable for any evidence that appeared in writing. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am sure as my colleagues start presenting you will see that 
he did maybe sign one or two documents that were important. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But if that was his practice…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius he has not finished.  Mr Agrizzi has not 
finished, so say what you wanted to say? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So there are the odd occasion when he would slip up and he 
would sign something and if you recall this started off in 2003/2004 at that stage it was 
very bullish in the company and I can tell you what I saw and I saw the signature.  
Other people will testify as well and then yes we are welcoming, I am welcoming the 
cross-questioning. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just to put the perhaps obvious follow up question if 
Mr Watson signed only when he slipped up or only on the odd occasion in other words 
in the exceptional circumstance…[intervenes] 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 172 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It is rather remarkable that the recording of an unlawful 
transaction would be such an exceptional circumstance? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was a major deal for the company.  I think, Chair, I can only 
attest to what I saw. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, obviously you can understand why Mr Pretorius is 
asking you the questions that he is asking you and I am asking you the questions I am 
asking you.  Simply because the question would be what would be the value of that 
agreement to both Mr Mti and Mr Watson.  They could not go to court and use it if they 
did not comply with their obligations. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, I know that, and you know that.  It seems to me that 
10 
they did not know that.  It is as good as having the side agreements in terms of fronting 
and giving somebody shares, it is the same thing.  It is illegal you cannot do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, you say then that in relation to these documents 
that you were asked to look for and remove that you in fact removed the documents? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, we did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What do you mean by removed the documents, is that 
the putting in storage that you referred to now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, what we happened was that we put them into storage, we 
just packed them into the boot of my car, because he wanted them out of there and we 
20 
took them and we stored them on a farm. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, and then did something later happen in relation 
to these documents? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was that? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 173 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There were newspaper reports coming out that were 
rehashing the whole SIU investigation.  Gavin Watson approached not me, but 
Andries van Tonder and myself only at a later stage to say to us we need to go and 
destroy the documents.  So what I am trying to say is Andries came to me and said to 
me that we have to go and destroy the documents.  I then phoned Gavin up and 
checked with him are you right and he said I want you to go and destroy documents. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you do that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He asked us to look specifically for the document he was 
concerned, because he had not seen the document yet that he had signed between 
himself and Mti. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is the document you refer to in your evidence now. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  31.6.  That was the only document that we had to hold back 
for him. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We want that document. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So you did not destroy that document.  What did you do 
with it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No.  As I said to you earlier I had made a copy of it.  So the 
copy that I made was not then, my correction.  I got a bit confused.  It was 31.7.  Then 
what happened there was we took the document to him and he was very relieved, 
20 
visibly relieved, because he thought that would be the end of his life.  He then put it, he 
shredded it by hand.  He put it in a ziplock bag.  You know the sandwich bags that you 
get and he put lots of water with it and just kept making like a papier-mâché and then 
flushed it down the toilet and he was very relieved. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We are going to now get onto matters relevant to the SIU 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 174 of 194 
 
Report and you introduced a topic at paragraph 32 of your affidavit on page 6 of 
EXHIBIT S1. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before Mr Pretorius asks you questions on that, did the raid happen? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair no, nothing happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not happen? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The only thing was that we had reached an agreement with 
the SIU that they could come and copy the servers, but there was no raid. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well not that nothing happened.  Something did 
happen. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But it could not be described in your mind as a raid. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not at all. There were not blue lights and flashy cars like you 
see on TV with the, when the Scorpions used to go and arrest and raid.  There was 
nothing like that. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We will refer in due course to detailed evidence in regard 
to what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On 6 January 2009, I am not sure it is in dispute, the 
Department of Correctional Services apparently awarded Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd 
a new catering contract. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the number of that contract, which becomes relevant 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 175 of 194 
 
later, apparently HK14/2008. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  For what period was this contract? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This was a three year contract. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the documentation used for the prior catering 
contract tender was that same documentation again used for the second catering 
contract awarded to Bosasa. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well in terms of the specifications, correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now in paragraph 32.2 you refer to a meeting.  
Let us tell the Chair about that meeting please.  Between who was this meeting? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well in terms of that period of time a meeting was arranged 
between the representatives of the SIU.  So we had heard all these rumours that they 
were investigating Bosasa and all that.  So the suggestion was made have a meeting 
whit them and find out.  So we had a meeting with the SIU. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who is we? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Myself, Andries van Tonder, Gavin Watson was not there.  He 
would not attend that.  He was, he was rather be away from that.  Frans Vorster was 
there, 
Brian Biebuyck 
was 
there 
and 
if 
I 
remember 
correctly 
Advocate Lourens …[indistinct] was there and basically we had the meeting with the 
SIU.  There was Zuid Jacobs I think that was there, Clint Oellerman was there and 
20 
there were various other people from the SIU.  Those were the people who were there. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Oellerman? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Can you spell that, Clint? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oellerman. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 176 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Oellerman. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is like a school test.  O-E-L-L-E-R-M-A-N. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well I am sure that name appears in documents. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, it was. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That we will refer to in due course, but this meeting did it 
take place subsequent to another communication between? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  That was …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Bosasa on the one hand and the SIU on the other? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was that communication? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the meeting, the, the other meeting was sorry we cannot 
have the servers checked now, because we are busy with month end and year end.  So 
we tried to postpone it.  So it was a letter of postponement. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You refer in paragraph 32.2 in the second sentence to a 
communication. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That preceded the meeting. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was that communication? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That communication was to say that we have heard via the 
20 
press that we are being investigated and we would like to have information regarding 
that so that we can tender our assistance. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Going forward. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the meeting then took place.  Was any; what was 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 177 of 194 
 
the outcome of that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well a date was arranged for the investigation and for the 
mirroring of laptops and that type of thing. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So do I understand you correctly, it was agreed with the 
SIU precisely when they would come to image the hard drives and laptops at Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The date that was arranged in that meeting with 
the SIU did it remain or was it changed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was changed Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Why? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it was changed because it was postponed on instruction, 
because we needed to give enough time to the IT Specialist to actually remove 
potentially damaging information. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who instructed the postponement? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the postponement was instructed by myself and 
obviously I was instructed by Gavin Watson. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and did representatives of the SIU eventually 
make mirror images of hard drives and laptops? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  In paragraph 32.5 you talk about interaction 
20 
between two Bosasa servers. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Please explain to the Chair what you are saying there. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So for redundancy purposes you would have two servers.  
The one being a Bosasa main server.  The other one was linked to another server.  
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 178 of 194 
 
That is how I understand.  I am not an IT Specialist, but when something is done on the 
one you can actually monitor it on the other one.  So it is a mirror image.  You have to 
arrange with a chap by the name of William Brandon and Max Leeson and those two 
youngsters have actually studied with one of the nephews and they were very trusted.  
So he, Gavin, personally arranged with them as he had a relationship with them to 
monitor what the representatives of the SIU, I think it was a Mr Jacques Malan who was 
to check up on what he was looking at and what he was doing and …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, we will hear of Mr Malan later, but. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  To simplify things whilst Mr Malan or other 
10 
representatives of the SIU were copying the data on the server that activity was being 
monitored on a connected server by the two gentlemen referred to in your affidavit? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Were the two gentlemen you refer to entrusted with any 
other task? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot; yes they had to delete potentially harmful information 
that was on the, on the server.  I think we actually mention it here. 
“They had to ensure that they removed information which might 
damage or implicate Bosasa prior to the mirror image being 
made.” 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us deal with paragraph 33.1 then.  Did you 
ever see a copy of the SIU Report? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When did you see it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 179 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  When did you see it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was sent a copy by Biebuyck. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right, when? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was actually in Paris at the time with Andries van Tonder, 
Gavin and we were on a holiday trip. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Can you recall more or less when you saw it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was in 2009.  I cannot remember.  Well let us think, it was 
summer in Paris. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And in paragraph 33 you list some of the contents of the 
report. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Containing information that you say you were indeed 
previously aware of and then you list a number of items in paragraph 33.  Just please 
read those out for the… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I will… 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I will read them out. 
1. 
Furniture bought for Gillingham and Mti. 
2. 
Architectural fees. 
3. 
Certain holiday trips paid for. 
20 
4. 
Certain cash deposits. 
5. 
Certain vehicles purchased. 
6. 
Certain sponsorships for children’s varsity fees and/or tuition. 
7. 
Provision of Forex for travel allowance. 
8. 
Certain repairs and maintenance on houses. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 180 of 194 
 
9. 
Construction of houses. 
10. 
Purchasing of imported kitchens. 
11. 
A retirement village concession for Gillingham’s father. 
12. 
Numerous other favours such as rugby season tickets, computers, printers 
and even a Matric dance dress for Megan Gillingham. 
13. 
Trading of certain vehicles where the person could not obtain a lucrative 
settlement.  These were bought by individuals and subsided by Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Now you have given evidence about some of these 
issues in this list that you saw. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  On, in the report. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you yourself give any evidence or information to the 
SUI investigators? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I did not. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So the information that they gleaned and placed in their 
report must have come from sources other than yourself? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair because the SIU Report then may well constitute 
particularly on further evidence corroborating evidence it is our intention to go through 
20 
it, but will take some time, but before we go there perhaps we can just deal with 33.2 
and 33.3 and then I am going to take Mr Watson.  I am sorry Chair, it is late.  Mr Agrizzi 
through the contents of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did you discuss the content of this report with 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 181 of 194 
 
Mr Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, we did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  What was his attitude at the time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, his attitude was he blamed everybody else.  He marked 
Mark Taverner.  He blamed Danny Mansell.  He blamed Tony Perry for not taking 
precautionary measures. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did he give you any assurance? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He told me everything is under control. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Did he give you any advice? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He said I had to stick to him. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  [Intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He told we had to stick to him otherwise the future is very 
bleak. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Subsequent to the release of the report were any 
subpoenas issued? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Amongst others to Mark and Sharon Taverner? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And did you receive any instruction in relation to those 
subpoenas? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was to meet them and to take steps to delay their 
appearance as much as possible. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have anything further to add and again please 
…[intervenes]? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was to attend every single meeting with them and 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 182 of 194 
 
Brian Biebuyck and make sure that Brian Biebuyck was the attorney on record for them.  
They were not allowed to use anybody but whoever Brian Biebuyck agreed to if he did 
not do it himself and I had to make sure that Bosasa was not compromised in all of this 
and I had to assist that I saw their statements.  Before they were submitted I did this 
and eventually they appeared in compliance to the subpoenas after about, if I am not 
mistaken, it was about 18 months. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  A period of 18 months you say elapsed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I am not mistaken.  I might be mistaken. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But along period from …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Very long. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  From the issue of the subpoena to the execution of the 
subpoena? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But eventually you say the subpoenas were complied 
with? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The SIU Report appears at page 279 of Bundle 
S1. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just want to clarify.  You asked me a question. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If they complied with the subpoena Chair.  If they complied 
with the subpoena? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They complied in terms of appearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 183 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But what was put into the subpoena was not necessarily the 
whole truth.  So you …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was put in response to; what they said in response the 
subpoena? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In response to the questions. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And in terms of your instructions you ensured that this 
occurred? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  Well not me directly, but yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair you are aware that the document at page 279 is 
incomplete.  The complete and by complete I mean basic report as opposed to the 
report plus all annexures is later on in Annexure S2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  EXHIBIT S2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But because our preparations took place and my notes 
are in this document were put on this document in preparation for the evidence before 
the fuller one was put in the bundles.  Would you bear with me please if we go through 
20 
the document at page 279 and then when necessary go to the document, the full 
document for the subsequent pages? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Otherwise I have to transfer all my notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 184 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  This report is preceded by an 
executive summary which appears on page 279 and in paragraph 1 of the executive 
summary it appears that the SIU’s intervention was authorised by a presidential 
proclamation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Which was gazetted on 28 November 2007. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Reference is made to: 
“The surfacing in 2006 of various allegations in the media 
relating to the allegedly irregular awarding of contracts by the 
10 
Department of Correctional Services to Bosasa Operations 
(Pty) Ltd and its affiliated companies.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  That is what the executive summary says.  So as we will 
discover this SIU investigation deals only with contracts between the Department of 
Correctional Services on the one hand and Bosasa or Bosasa related companies on the 
other, right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And it deals only with four contracts, what is referred to 
here as the Kitchens Contract, what we referred to in your evidence as the Catering 
20 
Contract. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Or contracts.  The second contract is the Access Control 
Contract.  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 185 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The third is the Televisions or CCTV Contract. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And the fourth is the Fencing Contract. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So it is only those four contracts between those two 
parties or sets of parties that are dealt with in this report. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In this report, you are right. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We know of course that there are many other contracts 
tainted with the type of evidence that you have given.  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The allegations that were investigated which 
came from the Public Service Commission and the Office of the Auditor-General are 
listed in the middle of paragraph or in the middle or page 279.  One of the more serious 
allegations referred to and those are the words in the executive summary are: 
1. 
Firstly an irregular relationship existed between Bosasa or members of the 
Bosasa Group of Companies and secondly DCS, Department of 
Correctional Service Officials namely the former Commissioner of 
Correctional Services Mr L Mti, Commissioner Mti, and the DCS Chief 
Financial Officer, Mr P Gillingham. 
2. 
The second allegation is that Commissioner Mti and Gillingham may have 
20 
unduly received benefits as a result of the award of some of the contracts 
awarded by DCS to Bosasa and its affiliates. 
3. 
The third allegation are two tenders namely the Kitchens tender and the 
Access Control tender were irregularly extended, and 
4. 
Bosasa and its affiliates were responsible for drafting the bid specifications 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 186 of 194 
 
for these tenders. 
Now in respect of all these issues you have given detailed evidence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The same issues were the subject of the investigations 
by the SIU. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do think mine is a bit comprehensive though. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Well in some respects you are correct and in 
others not. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The SIU Report contains other information and some of 
10 
the evidence you have given is not contained in the report. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But the purpose Chair of leading this evidence and 
taking the witness through is again to see what in the report this witness knows from his 
own knowledge and also to understand what evidence the SIU investigation produced.  
We have that evidence in a series of affidavits and it will be impossible for this 
commission to call each and every witness, but those affidavits will be placed before 
you in their proper form and will be summarised and presented to you, but in short the 
evidence that this witness has given and will give appears at least to some extent to be 
corroborated by the outcome of the investigations of the SIU and the detail will follow. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And so the executive summary continues Mr Agrizzi to 
say shortly: 
“After the publication of the proclamation the SUI commenced 
with the investigation of the contracts awarded to Bosasa and 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 187 of 194 
 
its affiliates namely the Kitchens, Access Control, Fencing and 
Television Contracts.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  In the executive summary the findings in respect of the 
Kitchens Tender HK2/2004 are set out.  Now you have given evidence of what you refer 
to as a Catering Contract or Catering Contracts.  Do you recall that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Are those; is that evidence in fact the same relating to 
the same tender as is referred to here the Kitchens Tender? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am sure it is identical. 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Right and do you recognise that number HK2/2004? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And is that one of the contracts about what you have 
testified? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is one of them. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  According to the SIU investigation it was awarded to 
Bosasa on 20 July 2004. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Evidence that you had not given and this may be given 
later Chair is referred to here in the SIU Report the summary of the executive summary 
20 
reads: 
“The evidence gathered by the SIU shows that there were clear 
deviations from the National Treasury Supply Chain 
Management a Guide for Accounting Officers Authorities 
Supply Chain Management Guide for Accounting Officers more 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 188 of 194 
 
particularly in that the end user departments were not included 
in the bid process.  There was also no proper financial planning 
for this tender in that there was no feasibility study nor needs 
analysis conducted.” 
I do not need to ask you to comment on that, but will ask you to comment on the next 
paragraph which reads: 
“The evidence clearly shows that Gillingham outside the course 
of his normal duties played an integral role from the outset in 
the procurement process and was irregularly instrumental in 
developing the tender specifications.” 
10 
Now in relation to that do you know whether Mr Gillingham played a role on the various 
Bid Committees or otherwise in the procurement process relevant to this contract? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, he did. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  So we know that you paid the money.  We know why you 
say you paid the money.  According to your evidence of course still to be tested and we 
know that according to the SIU investigation as confirmed by you the recipient of that 
money played an integral role in the procurement process. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And as described here was irregularly instrumental in 
developing the tender specifications.  You have given that evidence. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And that appears to be confirmed now by the SIU 
investigation.  Then interestingly the following is set out: 
“During the course of a search and seizure operation 
conducted at Gillingham’s residence a document containing the 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 189 of 194 
 
bid evaluation criteria and guidelines for evaluating the 
Kitchens Tender was found in the form of electronic data.” 
You obviously cannot confirm what the SIU found. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But you do know and you have told the Chair that there 
was an exchange of information between yourself and Mr Gillingham. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And Mr Mansell, correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And Mr Mansell.  You have also told the Chair that this, 
well I am not sure that you have, but did this exchange of information take place over a 
computer? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Exchange between electronic devices? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  The report goes on to read: 
“Mr J Malan…” 
Is that the Mr Malan you have referred to? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think it is the same gentleman, yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “...the SIU Cyber Forensic Expert 
determined that this document originated from the computer of 
Mr Agrizzi, 
Bosasa’s 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer/Managing 
20 
Director.” 
Leave aside the description of the post, but you have testified that documents were 
exchanged in relation to the bids between yourself and others and Mr Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well I think Mr Malan’s comments are incorrect. 
1. 
I was never ever the Chief Executive Officer. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 190 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was an Operations Coordinator and according to Mr Malan 
the document was saved on my computer on 28 June 2004.  I cannot say that I actually 
created that document.  It says that the same day the DCS comments, it was screening 
of the bids received in respect of the Kitchen Tender.  So I just want to clarify because it 
says there …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Let us take it step by step because you have gone 
ahead. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sure. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us deal with the first sentence. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Relevant to what we are discussing now.  It reads: 
“Mr J Malan…” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “…the SIU Cyber Forensic Expert…” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  “…determined that the particular document 
referred to originated from the computer of Mr Agrizzi.” 
What do you say about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If you read it in context it says it originated and this is where I 
20 
am having an issue.  It says it originated from a computer.  You are talking about 
Bosasa’s Chief Executive Officer according to Malan, the document was last saved, I 
am reading something totally different.  Sorry, on what paragraph are you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Here he is on the second paragraph from the end of or bottom of 
page 280 and he is on line three. 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 191 of 194 
 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  You see the fifth paragraph. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  It reads: 
“Mr J Malan, the SIU Cyber Forensic Expert.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.   
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Just a second. 
“Determined that the particular document that he is referring to 
originated from your computer.” 
Now let us just stop there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has he found the paragraph? 
10 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Have you found that paragraph? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, I am still looking for it. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Okay.  I am lost. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has been a long day.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Are you on page 280? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am on page 280. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me tell him Mr Pretorius.  It has been a long day  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I still cannot find it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you on page 280? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   You see if you go to the bottom of the page. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a paragraph that has three lines only.  Can you see that? 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 192 of 194 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is another paragraph above that.  It is a big 
paragraph. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It starts on the evidence of the whistle-blower. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That starts with during the course of …[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, yes I have got that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A search and seizure yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go to line three then. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Well perhaps Chair if I may interrupt.  I apologise, 
10 
perhaps we should give the witness an opportunity to read the whole paragraph. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I just want to get …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He must find it first. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I have found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you found it now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I have found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I did not read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but is, but is it necessary for him to read the whole of it? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, I think so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think I need two days there is something …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There is one section that says Chair that it was, could not 
determine the date of the first creation and that is where I am getting confused.  So if I 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 193 of 194 
 
could just read in context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, I think Mr Pretorius would like you to read the whole 
paragraph. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, go ahead. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Take your time.  We are over time, but perhaps we 
should finish this part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, just this part, ja.  You start; did you want him to read silently or 
aloud Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No, he can read it silently to acquaint himself 
10 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright, okay. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Every allegation in context.  Perhaps I am being unfair 
this late in the day by picking and choosing the sentences that I want to refer to. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is why I am getting confused, because we are hopping 
and it confuses me. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Contrary …[indistinct] I was going in sequence, but I do 
not want to argue with you about that.  That is futile.  Just read the paragraph. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sure.  I would like to ask the Chair a question to explain to me 
it says there determine… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, well I am sorry.  Mr Pretorius if the witness has questions after 
reading it I think we better adjourn.  Let him have time to look at it properly and then we 
can continue tomorrow.  How is that Mr Agrizzi? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes.  In fact it is not going to make much difference a few 
22 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 38 
 
Page 194 of 194 
 
minutes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We cannot answer questions unfortunately, because we, 
it is your evidence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I understand. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  But I would advise, you have legal representation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Read it carefully, discuss it and we will discuss it 
tomorrow. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am happy with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we adjourn at this stage Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the affidavit we finished at, at what page or paragraph?  Just need 
to note it where we; Mr Pretorius are you …[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  About to answer your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  We were on page 70. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja.  Ja, okay.  No that is good enough. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  At the end of paragraph 33.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  We are going to adjourn until tomorrow at 10 o’ 
clock.  We adjourn. 
MEETING ADJOURNS TO 23 NOVEMBER 2019
