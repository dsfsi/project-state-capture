PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 8 MARCH 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka, good morning everybody.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning Chair.  Today we will be presenting the 
evidence of Mr Opperman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Should we finish in time we will immediately get to the 
evidence of the next witness who is Mr Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair before I ask Mr Bester to take the oath may I 
indicate what documentation we will utilise to present his evidence? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The first is the bundle comprising his statement which is 
marked U8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  U? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  U8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  U8? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes it is the very bundle before you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR GERT OPPERMAN:  I have put my [indistinct] because it has… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that the eight is not there.  There is File 9. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well I am not too sure why mine is marked U8 yours is 
marked 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja mine is not – it is marked Volume U File 9 of. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 3 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  It is File 9 but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is Exhibit U. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But U. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit U8. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair if I may quickly orientate you and other interested 
persons about the contents of that file.  You will see that it begins with an index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the first part of the index is the statement of Mr 
10 
Opperman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It runs from page 1 to page 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The statement is fairly short by size only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But it is extremely voluminous in terms of content and 
substance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So we will take a bit time to canvass the contents of the 
20 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And what follows thereafter are annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Described through acronyms GJ01 up to GJ039.  They 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 4 of 167 
 
begin from page 19 up to the end of page 440.  What we asked the administration of 
the commission to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is to separate each annexure with reference to the file 
divider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that it will be easier for you to simply jump into… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The divided annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Conveniently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we asked your Registrar to bring along two 
additional files because there may be some elementary … 
CHAIRPERSON:  U got 5? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The first one Chair if I may remind you is the 
statement of Mr Clinton Ephron who testified on behalf of Glencore.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The files which are here do not appear to show on their spines that 
any of them includes Mr Ephron’s statement.  There is one which is – which contains 
the statements of Mr Mashego and Mr Bester. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there is Exhibit U2.  It does not – oh then it shows that the 
statement inside is that of Mr Naga. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is Exhibit U4 it just says File 5 of on the spine.  Then 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 5 of 167 
 
there is Exhibit U4 that has got the statements of Van Der Riet. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Magwaza that us all. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All of those files except the statement and annexures to 
Mr Naga? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which is U2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Will be used later by Ms Hofmeyr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you just to lift up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  U2 and put it conveniently next to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  U2? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  U2 yes that is the statement of Mr Naga.   
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will refer to that file and we will do so when we deal 
with Mr Opperman’s evidence relating to calculation of penalties. Because you would 
recall that Mr Mokoena took you through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The various calculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you asked a number of questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Mr Opperman for his sins. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 6 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Fundamentally differs with that calculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And he will begin to answer some of the questions 
raised with Mr Naga and Mokoena about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But is this a simple problem of miscalculations or under 
calculations  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And where is the correct intent on that score. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Ja.  Okay, okay.  No thank you.  Now is Mr Ephron’s statement 
included in the same bundle where we have got Mr Naga’s statement or have we not 
find it – found it? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is not.  Ja but you should not be concerned by… 
CHAIRPERSON:  About it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Its absence for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because what we are going to do is to cross-reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERT OPPERMAN:  Some of the annexures as in Mr Opperman’s statement to 
20 
those of Mr Ephron’s annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ephron – yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But we will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We might not need… 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We might not need it.   
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 7 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I may have to read them out to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And indicate where the cross-references would take 
place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair subject to any further introductory remarks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Or queries you may have I would ask your registrar to 
administer the oath. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From Mr Opperman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Gert Jacobus Opperman. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you give will be the truth; the whole 
20 
truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So help me God 3 in 1 Father, Ghost and – Holy 
Ghost and Son. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 8 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman good morning and welcome. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Good morning Advocate Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You like me speak a bit softly can you make sure that 
your voice radiates through the microphone so that all of us can hear you. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I will do that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I just begin with formalities?  Before you there 
is a file which has been submitted to the Chair as Exhibit U8.  And that file begins with 
your typed statement which you made under oath correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you to go to that statement and go to page 18.   
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you confirm that the signature at the top end of that 
statement is yours? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I can. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is – your statement bear a signature of a 
commission of oath which you took on the 27 February 2019? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I can confirm that yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And where did you take that oath? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  In Emalahlene, Witbank. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Witbank? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Emalahlene? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Opperman you have had an occasion to read 
and re-read the contents of that statement, correct? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 9 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you confirm that they reflect the truth as far as you 
are concerned and to the best of your knowledge? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is there any aspect of the statement you would like to 
reflect on, change or modify before we start with the substance of your evidence? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes Mr Maleka it is the statement – the area that 
refers to the penalty provision and the amounts.  As per my annexure 18. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright can you take us first to the body of the statement 
which deals with penalties as far as … 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So this is point number 47. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  On page number 9. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Page 9 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say you want to make a modification with 
reference to paragraph 47 and you have drawn our attention to Annexure GJ18.  Chair 
you will find that from page 252.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is that spreadsheet which has different colour codes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What in that annexure would you like to reflect on? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Maleka the calculation that reflects on 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 10 of 167 
 
Glencore’s penalty as plus minus 18 million if one reference annexure GJ018 that 
amount was 13.8 million. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It might not be that significant but that is the 
correction to be made.  The other amount is 720 that I am making… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Mr Opperman let – let me get first to where you want 
to make the first amendment or correction.  I am at page 253 on the spreadsheet and 
maybe would help me by telling me in relation to which month – against which month 
that item is? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair it is the total on the third – the fourth column 
10 
at the bottom.  The total that reads 13.833 million.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So it is sum total on the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That is the sum total of the penalties as calculated and 
contended for by Glencore at the time? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When there was a debate between it and Eskom about 
the quantum of the penalties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  How much do you want to change amount? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  To the 13.8. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  13.8? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do we – do we cross out 33692?  Just tell us once again Mr 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 11 of 167 
 
Opperman.   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  YEs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the number that should be reflected there instead of 
13833692,75? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That – Chair that amount stays as it is we need to 
change in my affidavit. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Statement. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  In my statement point number 47.  I made 
reference to the calculation as plus minus 16 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that 16 needs to reflect 13.8 Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So Chair if you can go to page 9 of the statement and 
go to paragraph 47.  The second last sentence of that paragraph refers to plus minus 
16 million.  So Mr Opperman you want us to strike out that amount and replace it with 
13.833 million? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want us to say 13.3 million I see you have got plus minus 
before that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am comfortable if we make it 14 million plus 
20 
minus something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh plus minus 14 million. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am changing to say plus minus 14 million.  
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And then Mr Maleka with your leave I will leave 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 12 of 167 
 
the plus minus 720 million which is pretty much in line in – to the amount 723 million 
that is reported in that spreadsheet. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So I am comfortable with that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well we will get to it in due course but you correct it is 
plus minus.  We will not hold you to the precise or exact figures.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the first correction that you wanted to make?  I thought you 
wanted to make another correction as well Mr Opperman? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correctly so Sir.  Point number 16 on my 
statement which is page number 3 refers to Eskom imposing penalties based on the 
10 
supply of non-conforming coal and I think maybe… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry let me just get there.  What paragraph, what page? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Page number 3.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Point number 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that paragraph 16? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of – at page 3 of your statement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright what should be changed there? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Okay it currently reads that Eskom imposed 
penalties based on the supply of non-confirming coal.  I need to clarify this that these 
penalties were not imposed in 2008 and 2009 but they were recorded and it was not for 
non-conforming coal but it was for undersupply.   
CHAIRPERSON:  For undersupply? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 13 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the first sentence should read:   
“Eskom imposed penalties based on the undersupply of coal.” 
Is that what it should read? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I would prefer if we say that Eskom recorded 
penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Eskom.  So imposed becomes recorded 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Recorded penalties based on the undersupply of coal? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Based on the undersupply of coal.  Okay I have got that.  Is there 
another correction you want to make in the statement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No that is all thank you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is all okay thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright Mr Opperman the second part of the formalities I 
would like to deal with is your confirmation that you are currently employed at Eskom? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You confirm in your statement that you have a long 
history of employment at Eskom and that you started at Eskom fairly early.  When did 
you start at Eskom? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I started in Eskom in 1992 as a bursar but I was 
appointed in Eskom on 1 February 1996 as a plant operator at Kendal Power Station. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At Kendal? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  And you rose through the ranks to become a 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 14 of 167 
 
plant manager? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When was it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It was around 2007, 2008. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And which plant were you managing at the time? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It was the auxiliary plants areas looking after all 
the material handlings components on the power station. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Was it still at Kendal? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  You then mention that at some point you moved 
10 
to Hendrina Power Station? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No that is not correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I was responsible for the management of coal 
supply to Hendrina but I never worked at Hendrina physically.  That was in my capacity 
that I am appointed currently as – in the primary energy division. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh I see I misunderstood your statement then.  So you 
say you worked in the primary energy division of Eskom? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As what? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  As the coal supply unit manager, the same 
position that I still occupy. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in that position what do you do in relation to the 
various power stations owned by Eskom? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  We are a team of individuals that is allocated to 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 15 of 167 
 
certain power stations.  So for most of the close to ten years that I worked as a coal 
supply unit manager I have managed between one and two stations – power stations at 
a time.  So my responsibility as towards that station is to make sure that their coal 
supply that they get confirms to their requirements at the power station and is also 
delivered as cost effectively as possible. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you mention those power stations by name that you 
were responsible for? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes it was Majuba Power Station, Kumati Power 
Station, Hendrina Power Station and Arnot Power Station and at no particular time all 
four of them it has just happened that it was at certain times two of the stations but 
10 
those were the four that I was responsible for. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The two power stations that you must have managed 
that I will deal with in detail in the course of your evidence are Hendrina and Arnot.  In 
relation to Hendrina when did you begin your management responsibilities particular 
insofar as they relate to the management of coal supply? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall the exact date but it must have 
been around September 2012 when I started managing the Optimum Contract. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And my understanding is that Hendrina procured 
coal from Optimum Coal Mine? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that your commencement of the management 
responsibilities would have coincided with the appointment of Mr Clifton Ephron as the 
Chief Executive Officer of Optimum Coal Holdings which at the time owned Optimum 
Coal Mine.  Do you know Mr Clifton Ephron? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    I do know him yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 16 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Have you come across him in the course of your 
functions and duties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright. Chair we will get to the interface between the 
two of them in due course.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in relation to Arnot when did you commence your 
management functions and duties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall that date. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  More or less. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do remember that I was responsible for the 
management to the supply to Arnot Power Station at the time when the coal was 
contracted from Tegeta in January 2016. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  2016? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes ja.  So by that time I was there already. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to how Tegeta was contracted to supply coal 
to Arnot and we will do so in detail.  But from your perspective and from the moment 
you became involved in the management of coal supply from Tegeta can you give us a 
snapshot of how Tegeta supplied coal to Arnot Power Station?  We will get to the details 
but just to give us some snapshot of how the relationship worked? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The coal supply started with a short term 
agreement initially I think it was for a once off volume of 100 000 tonnes which was 
then extended with a three months contract and again extended with a five months 
contract.  At that moment in time Tegeta procured the coal from the Optimum Operation 
and sold it to Eskom.  But the contracting party was with Tegeta and not with Glencore 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 17 of 167 
 
at that moment in time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I have read your statement and it becomes clear when 
one reads it that there was not a long term supplier coal agreement which before the 
Chairperson have often been described as the Coal Supply Agreement.  In other words 
there was no long term coal supply between Eskom and Tegeta for the supply of coal to 
Arnot Power Station, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  DO you know anything about Brakfontein which 
was supplying coal to Eskom? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I know of Brakfontein very well I managed that 
contract from inception until it went into business rescue also in February 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair Mr Hofmeyr will deal with the evidence of Mr 
Opperman insofar as it relates to Brakfontein. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Brakfontein ja okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  She has assumed the title of responsibility in relation to 
that contract involving Tegeta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see it is quite – seems to be quite a nice division of work. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  I wonder how you are able to cope with so 
much files, so much information when we have divided a team – our team across 
20 
different topics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is because of your assistance. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Opperman can I then take you 
back to your statement in the context of what you have just told us about your 
management responsibilities.  I would like to highlight some of them beginning from 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 18 of 167 
 
page 1 of your statement, paragraph 4.  I am going to skip paragraphs 1 to 3 but you 
are welcome to deal with them if you think I have omitted something of significance to 
your evidence.  Are you there? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am there.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you happy that we should go to paragraph 4? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Hundred percent. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Now I would like to highlight some of these 
functions and duties.  And the first that I would like to pick up is from the first bullet 
point.  You say part of your duties is to determine and get approval for short, medium 
and long term coal supply.  First thing first what period do you describe as a short term 
10 
supply? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Short term will be a supply over three months 
typically something like that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So anything less than three months would be short 
term? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja it could even go up to five months but I will not 
say it is less than a year. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  And then what do you cover in that medium term 
period?  How should we understand it in terms of months? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Medium term contracts is anything from a year 
20 
and we have had medium term contracts for even up as long as ten years. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As ten years.  So anything from one year to ten years 
would be a medium term, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct.  It is not clearly defined like that but I 
think if one needs to put a time line to it that is [indistinct]. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 19 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Oh ja no we working with your experience.   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because you are the one who describes your 
responsibilities in that way.  I am not suggesting that there is a rule book we just 
working from your experience.  And long term supply would be generally the CSA that 
we have looked at? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja we do get CSA’s for medium term contracts as 
well so the medium term contracts also does have a CSA and equally so the short term 
contracts as well but the long term contracts will typically exceed ten years so that 
could be something as long as twenty years or thirty years. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The one that we have the longest period for is the 
thirty years contract relating to Hendrina. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja if I – I think if it is correct it is going for thirty-five 
years now. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And then you say that in regard to those periods 
type of supply contracts you have to get approval.  Where do you get the approval 
from? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  This function that is part of my Portfolio in terms 
of approval is facilitated by the Fuel Sourcing Department.  So we have got a 
department in our division which is termed Fuel Sourcing and they will negotiate and 
20 
facilitate the process of getting approvals.  So my function in this regard is to make sure 
that coal supply agreements is approved by the time that it reaches our desk to execute 
it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Or my desk to execute it. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 20 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair you have heard the evidence of Mr Nada I 
am going to repeat it but I would just like you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman to inform us about your role in that 
approval process.  What do you do to get that approval as the coal supply manager of 
these power stations what do you do?  What physical do you do in order to facilitate 
that approval process? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot really say how we are – how I am 
involved in the approval of it other than assisting the Fuel Sourcing Department with 
technical support or contract management experience through that facilitation process.  
10 
But the submissions that will go to the various authorising committees that gets 
compiled by the Fuel Sourcing Division or Department and occasionally we will have 
inputs into it bringing our experience to the table. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I suppose what I want to establish from you is this that 
there will always be a need identified by a power station about its requirements relating 
to coal supply, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That need for coal supply will actually be 
identified through our integrated planning department. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  YEs. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Which is also one of the departments within the 
20 
Primary Energy Division.  So that department is responsible to look at burn requirement 
of the coal within the fleet and they will then based on that determine the shortage of 
coal at a specific power station and based on that that need will arise. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Do you play any role in the identification of a 
need? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 21 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Not really, not really. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright and once the need has been identified and 
quantified then there will be a process for giving effect to it through a process of either 
procurement of coal from different coal suppliers or through some short term 
agreements.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you play any role in the process? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  To give effect to the agreement? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To give effect to the procurement before the agreement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No, I do not play any role in it. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright and once the formal procurement process has 
been completed there will be an execution of an agreement between Eskom and a 
supplier? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you play any role in that regard? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No, nothing. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well look at what you say in the second bullet point.  
You say that one of your responsibilities is to manage commercial and legal aspects of 
existing Coal Supply Agreements. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct.  So in an existing Coal Supply 
20 
Agreement meaning it went through the procurement process.  It has been signed by all 
parties and it is in execution phase.  Commercial aspects might include or will include 
payments for goods delivered, coal delivered and legal aspects will typically be when 
there are aspects that needs to be interpreted in the contract and I will liaise with the 
Legal Team on those. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 22 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  That is a short hand for compliance obligations by 
suppliers? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Eskom and that is a heavy responsibility, because 
often than not there is always a continuing dispute between Eskom and its suppliers 
relating to coal quality and coal quantity supply issues.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That does happen, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Just take us through what happens on the ground 
about how these disputes arise and how do you yourself become involved in trying to 
resolve these disputes. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think one needs to narrow down a certain aspect 
be it either on quantity or on a quality, those disputes.  So let us deal with the quantity 
one which is maybe the easier one.  So a Coal Supply Agreement will have provisions 
on how the quantity in the Coal Supply Agreement needs to be managed.  We term it in 
the contract when one looks at the quantity tables there is a nominal minimum and 
maximum.  So it gives you an opportunity to do some phasing with volumes mainly to 
compensate for seasonal changes, but also to accommodate challenges be it at a 
power station or in the mining section.  Certain contracts have provisions for an 
undersupply.  I think most of the contracts have a provision for undersupply.  These 
undersupply provisions in the contracts are very harsh.  It is a very harsh penalty and 
20 
that is the way that we deal with it.  So the moment that the supplier will deliver less 
than minimum.  So you will have the contracted nominal.  When he goes below 
minimum for a certain period depending what is noted in the contract a request for a 
rectification plan will be submitted.  That is an official request to provide a plan on how 
it will be recovered.  Within fairness that plan needs to be considered and ultimately we 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 23 of 167 
 
are in the business of buying the coal.  That is what we need.  So we will liaise with the 
supplier and see how we can get around to actually get those volumes to materialise 
failing which the short supply penalty will then be applied. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You have given us a bit of detail there.  I would like 
to understand where do you fit in, in that detail, you as Mr Opperman. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I fit in all that, in that whole area.  That is my 
responsibility. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you manage that whole scheme of detecting short 
supply and imposition of penalties arising from short supply? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct.  So I will be the person who will be 
10 
able to identify if there is a short supply.  From that short supply my finance team will 
assist me with the calculation of a short supply penalty if it goes to that point.  I will be 
the person who will issue the request for rectification plan to the respective supplier to 
engage them on a recovery plan. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and the same thing will be the case and it will be 
your responsibility when it comes to coal quality supply concerns that require imposition 
of penalties by Eskom?  In other words you will play the same role? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do play the same role.  However on coal 
qualities there is a process, a dispute process that can be followed.  So the moment 
that quality is out of specification there is a process that you can go through disputing 
20 
those qualities which is again dependent on the method of contracting and then after 
those qualities have been disputed and the results become available those results then 
become final and binding.  If those qualities then still require a penalty to be imposed I 
will be responsible for the imposition of that penalty and the penalty will be calculated 
with the support from the Finance Team. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 24 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  So you take responsibility for identifying the 
nature and extent of coal quality problems and you take responsibility for the calculation 
of penalties that Eskom will impose and I understand that although you yourself may 
not do the mathematics you take final responsibility for the numbers arising from the 
mathematics? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think that is fair to say.  There are teams 
available or supporting me on the technical point as well on the quality determination, 
but that is a fair deduction, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I understand.  There will be what do you call, coal 
scientists from Eskom who would go through the coal quality problems.  There may well 
10 
be even your Finance Division who will look at the numbers and come to you with some 
number and you agree to implement the number? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Other than yourself doing all of those things 
relating to the two mines that you manage and we know that one of them is Optimum 
Coal Mine would there be any other person who would do the calculations relating to 
penalties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes.  We have had an instance especially on the 
Optimum Coal Supply Agreement where there was a lot of contention around the way 
that the calculation needed to be done where we have or I have consulted our internal 
20 
legal people and we then consulted external legal firms to assist us with the calculation 
of penalties as well as the interpretation thereof. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Opperman let me give you some indication of 
why I have asked you these questions and your responsibilities.  The Chairperson has 
said a lot about the calculation and imposition of penalties relating to Optimum Coal 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 25 of 167 
 
Mine which ultimately led to the declaration of hardship and business rescue of 
Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd.  You are aware of that history.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And ultimately the amount that was sought to be 
imposed in the beginning.  I am talking about June 2015 was in the order of 2.5 billion.  
Are you aware of that amount? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It was in that order, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and finally when Optimum Coal Mine was taken 
over by Tegeta the amount reduced to 255 million cash payment.  Are you aware of that 
history? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am aware of that settlement amount. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Those are the two points or the penalties.  In your 
statement you make it quite clear that you disagreed with the first leg of the penalties.  
We will get to that part of your evidence, but you confirm for now that you disagreed 
with the calculation of the penalties of R2.1 billion.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I did not disagree with the calculation.  I fully 
agree with the 2.1 billion.  What is important is to understand the different reference 
points. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And if I am afforded the opportunity I will explain 
20 
it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I take it that what you mean is you arrive at the same 
outcome? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 26 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Total but the method or the means by which you arrive at it might 
differ in some way from the method that may have been used by those who calculated 
and came to the same amount, 2.1 billion.  Is that right? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair there is not a different interpretation.  I 
think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Even the interpretation is the same, because. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  We work from the same spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So there is no difference in that.  I think 
Mr Maleka refers to the 720 million that I refer to in my statement and my statement to 
the 720 million only including the sizing penalty up until end of April, I think, 2013 when 
Optimum issued a notice where they wanted to renegotiate the sizing penalty.  
Whereas the 2.1 billion penalty considers the whole period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to the details on how the calculation was 
done, but as far as you are aware you came to the conclusion that a justifiable amount 
of the penalties that Eskom could lawfully impose on your interpretation of the 
agreement was in the order of 720 million? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That deduction that I made as I said was only for 
the period as consideration the sizing penalty up until 23 April 2013. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So I only considered, in my statement I only 
considered the sizing penalty up until the period when Optimum came to the table and 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 27 of 167 
 
they said to us Eskom we want to renegotiate the sizing specification. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  They are entitled according to the first addendum 
to request that to be done.  There is a whole process that followed after that with 
multiple communications up and down for additional information and it never got to 
agreeing to a different sizing specification, but that was my interpretation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So the whole time when I was referencing a 
penalty against this contract it considered the quality parameters, it excluded AA 
because the AA was levied at that moment in any case, but it only included the sizing 
10 
penalty up until April 2013. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Up until April 2013? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And on that calculation you came to that number of 
R720-odd million.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja, there was some interpretation done to it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And me not being a mathematician, but use some 
averages and. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And things like that and I got to the 723.  I did a 
similar calculation on Mr Nagar’s spreadsheet. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And on that spreadsheet it came to 719 million.  
So the 720 ballpark figure is that. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 28 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is really the point of the questions.  That you do 
one calculation give your role and official responsibilities in Eskom.  You arrive at one 
figure.  Someone else does a calculation, arrive at a totally different figure.  I would like 
you when we get to that point of your evidence to give some explanation of the 
differences, if any. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja, I do not think there has been any differences. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am confirming that it was the same figure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It was the same figure? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, thank you.  Then I can take you back to your 
statement and reflect on some of the responsibilities that you outline on page 2?  You 
say and I am reading from the second bullet point at the top of page 2 that you manage 
coal quality in terms of the CSA.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And so in that debate around coal quality issues that will 
be your management responsibility? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright and then in the fourth bullet point from the top 
you say, you also identify and manage coal supply and cost risk.  Can I ask you to 
20 
explain to us precisely what do you do in that regard and I am interested in the 
management of the cost risk? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So what we will do is in certain instances when 
coal gets delivered not via conveyor where it is a fixed mode of delivery, but coal gets 
delivered via road we will consider that coal supply risk in that manner in terms of 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 29 of 167 
 
considering different routes that a vehicle can take.  The shorter the route the lower the 
Rand per ton that we pay for the logistics cost.  It could be that.  I immediately cannot 
think really of anything else. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and to re-orientate you on the facts in this case 
relating to that official responsibility you are aware that coal supplied to Arnot from 
Optimum Coal Mine by Tegeta was transported by road? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that would have been part and parcel of managing 
that risk of delivery from Optimum Coal Mine to Arnot? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From your memory or experience what is the distance 
between Optimum Coal Mine and Arnot Power Station? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall, but it must be in the region of 
around 60/64 kilometres.  Somewhere around there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and so Eskom would pay not only for the actual 
price of the coal per ton, but it will also pay transport costs? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Are you able to recall off hand what would have 
been the average of the transport costs relating to the Short Term Supply Agreement 
between Tegeta and Eskom to supply coal to Arnot? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall a; you are referring to the Rand per 
ton for the transportation? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall exact figures, but it must be in the 
region if I think around R140 or so. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 30 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  The next responsibility I would like you to 
explain to is I think the fifth from the bottom where you say, you manage CSA Accounts.  
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What do you do in that regard? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Sorry, can I just, can you just repeat that? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you see the fifth bullet point from the bottom on page 
2 of your statement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Okay, yes, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You say part of your responsibilities include the 
10 
management of Coal Supply Agreement Accounts. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Would that be invoices from the suppliers? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And if there are queries you will query them? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I suppose if there are no queries you will certify 
them for payment? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the last responsibility I would like you to explain for 
20 
us is the one that follows thereafter.  You say you liaise with power station 
management, internal supply personnel, other Eskom clients and Industry Committees.  
You see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Insofar as liaison with the power station 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 31 of 167 
 
management is concerned can you explain to us what do you do? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  We will have monthly liaison meetings with the 
Power Station Coal Management Team.  It will occasionally also be attended by the 
General Manager or the Coal Supply Unit Manager and the function of that is to really 
report on the previous month’s performance and look at suppliers, try and align the burn 
requirements with the supply from the power station.  We will also revisit qualities.  So, 
ja that is what we do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that if there are problems in relation to the power 
stations regarding their requirement you will be someone who is informed about them 
and you will be someone who would be able to deal would them in general terms? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja, I will be informed with it, about it and will 
action it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and insofar as your interface with Eskom’s clients 
and Industry Committees are concerned what do you do?  Who are these clients more 
or less?  Just categorisation of them quite quickly. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  In this aspect Eskom’s clients are referred to as 
our suppliers.  So I also have monthly engagements with the suppliers where we will 
meet and look at supply risks, quality risks.  We will discuss any operational matters, 
potential coal supply issues, things like that.  So it is mainly on that.  Industry 
Committees will include on occasion if we involve people who are specialists for 
20 
argument on sampling or coal accounting, things like that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  So is if fair if we were to strike out that word 
clients and replace it with suppliers? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja that is fair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  We have now. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 32 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the; is that what comes after the bullet point with liaise with 
power station? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After Eskom? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. After Eskom 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  After Eskom, clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should be suppliers? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because Eskom’s clients would generally municipalities 
and consumers of electricity, Mr Opperman? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  We have an appreciation of your rules and 
responsibilities and you confirm in paragraph 5 that you report to Mr Petros Mazibuko, 
who is the General Manager of Coal Operations.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And all of these reporting lines are within the Primary 
Energy Division of Eskom? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and Mr Mashigo leads that division as I recall? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Now in paragraph 6 you explain the nature and 
extent of the evidence you have conversed in your statement.  I am not going to deal 
with it unless you want to reflect on any part of it.  For my part I confirm that I am 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 33 of 167 
 
interested in your evidence insofar as it relates to Hendrina Power Station and Arnot 
Power Station and you have explained when you started your management 
responsibilities in relation to the two.  Unless there is anything that you would like to 
raise I will skip that paragraph and go to paragraph 9.  You mentioned the name of 
Mr George van der Merwe who was the Chief Operating Officer of Optimum Coal Mine.  
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I see it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The Chairperson has not heard the evidence of 
Mr van der Merwe who is the COO of that mine, but has heard the evidence of 
Mr Ephron and Mr Ephron mentioned your name in the context of negotiations that 
10 
followed the Cooperation Agreement.  That you were part and parcel of the Negotiation 
Team for Eskom.  Do you confirm that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did Mr van der Merwe take part in those negotiations as 
far as you are aware? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No, Mr van der Merwe did not.  Mr van der Merwe 
was the Chief Operating Officer for Optimum Coal Mine and the management and 
control of Tegeta. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Of Tegeta? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, I see.  Alright. I was a bit confused.  Can I take you 
to page 3 of your statement?  Under the heading background to Hendrina you give us 
some historical detail.  Most of that has been dealt with by other witnesses.  I will move 
quite quickly through the paragraphs if you do not mind, but again the qualification is 
that if you want to say something more please do.  At paragraph 11 and you confirm 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 34 of 167 
 
that that mine that is the mine which was supplying Hendrina it began on a specific 
pricing structure.  It was a Cost Plus Mine Supply Structure.  Do you confirm that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know when it changed? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It changed in 1993 with the signing of the next 
agreement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and it became a Fixed Price type of structure for the 
supply of coal? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Chair I think they have explained the difference 
10 
to you.  I am not going to ask Mr Opperman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To deal with the differences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Mr Opperman you explain in paragraph 15 
something relating to the coal quality that was procured from Optimum Coal Mine.  Do 
you see that/ 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You say that: 
“The coal sold and delivered to Eskom by Optimum Coal Mine 
20 
had an excessively high abrasive index.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Chair you have heard enough of the evidence 
about what abrasive index is.  I am not going to. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 35 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will everybody please switch off their cell phones.  Okay.  Yes 
Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  I think we have a fair understanding 
Mr Opperman of what abrasive index is.  So you can assume that we understand 
something about what it means, but what I would like you to explain to us is what is the 
typical implication to the operation of the mine, sorry the power station when coal has 
this high abrasive index?  How does it affect the power station? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So the abrasive index in coal that we measure is 
a determination of a certain chemical characteristic that coal has that impacts wear and 
wear rates.  So what typically will happen with a coal with a high wear rate, wherever it 
10 
gets into contact with any metal surface it will wear away that metal surface.  So this 
will typically impact the areas of your milling plant, the classifier plant, your PF ducting, 
your pulverised fuel ducting that feeds the coal to the furnace, the burner mouse.  The 
burners that goes into the furnace and then what also happens is that the moment that 
coal is then combust it also has an impact on the ash characteristics with relevance to 
the pyrites and those chemical substances in the ash that then also have a wear impact 
on the boiler tubing, flue gas ducts, the air heaters in that stream even out on your ID 
fan impellers.  So basically everything that gets into contact with that that stream of 
coal or ash, gas stream once it is combusted.  So it is an indication of an impact on 
wear on plant.  So the higher the figure the higher your wear rate will be. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So the higher the abrasive index the greater and 
faster the wear and tear of the various parts of the power station takes place? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct relating to the areas that have contact to 
the coal. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 36 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So as the coal with high abrasive index moves through 
various parts during the combustion process those parts wear quickly? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And there is a need for maintenance or replacement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is the reason why you impose penalties/ 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Now I understand.  I am going to get to that issue 
10 
of the abrasive index with reference to an arbitration and settlement agreement that 
Eskom had with Optimum Coal Mine and you are aware of it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes, I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to that issue later on, because there are 
questions of penalties there.  You remember that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Now you have already dealt with paragraph 16.  
You have indicated how we should read it.  In its current form it says: 
“Eskom recorded penalties based on the undersupply of coal.” 
And you say: 
20 
“OCM disputed the penalties imposed by Eskom and the 
dispute was referred to arbitration.” 
You see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You say ultimately there was a settlement agreement 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 37 of 167 
 
and you refer to the settlement agreement in paragraph 17.  Do you confirm that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   I would like to take you to the settlement agreement if 
you don’t mind, it is from page 171 of U8.  Are you there Mr Opperman? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, you will see that the heading of that document is 
“Settlement of Arbitration and Second Addendum to the Hendriena Coal Supply 
Agreement”, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that the purpose of that settlement was not only to 
10 
settle the dispute relating to the short supply of coal by Hendriena at that point in time, 
but also to amend the CSA via the second addendum, do you agree with that 
interpretation?   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Okay now let’s look at Clause 1.3 on page 173, that 
clause it’s a definition clause making it quite clear that the document we are looking at 
it’s the second amendment to the SCA and that’s why it’s called the second addendum, 
correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Now you will see that paragraph 2.2 on page 174 
20 
records the history giving rise to the second addendum, and the amendment to the SCA 
begin at paragraph 3.1, do you confirm that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The first amendment related to the coal quantity so 
there is an amount of R5.5million per ton of coal that’s Optimum Coal Mine agreed to 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 38 of 167 
 
deliver to Eskom.  Mr Ephron explained to the Chairperson the implication of that 
amendment and I don’t want to take you through it but my recollection is that it was 
changing the maximum amount that was initially delivered under the SCA, do you agree 
with that?   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   That’s correct, it was previously 6.5. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes so there was a reduction of the amount and the 
oversimplification of it is that Optimum Coal Mine was quite satisfied that it could not 
deliver the previous maximum and therefore did not want to incur penalties relating to 
short supply? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes.  Then the next amendment of importance to your 
evidence begin from page 178.  I have skipped the rest but it’s up to you if you want to 
bring our attention to other parts of the second addendum. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   That’s fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   It’s paragraph 3.3, it talks about the topic of abrasive 
index, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And the amendments are now set out in detail in 
paragraph 3.3.2, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Now can I ask you to take us quickly if you can through 
these amendments because there is a stepladder like calculation of the abrasive index 
and the penalties depending on the degree of the calculated indexes, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Can I please ask you to explain to us how the penalty 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 39 of 167 
 
model will work under the second addendum. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Okay so I want to take you back to paragraph 
3.3.1, the paragraph just before that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Because there’s something of importance to note 
and it’s the last section of that paragraph that clarifies the method or the manner in 
what – in how these qualities will be determined.  So it says there that the target is to 
have AI less than 423mg iron on a seven day weighted rolling average basis.  Okay, so 
this is important when we talk later about penalty determination.  So this is the first time 
that the qualities on AI gets raised and it clarifies the method in how it will be calculated 
10 
and it is calculated on a seven day weighted rolling average basis. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So you look not only on a stockpile per day, you look at 
an average of the stockpiles over a period of seven days? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   You look at it over a period of seven days, it is 
rolling, so the seven days will consistently roll, so that’s correct, but you will also weight 
it according to the deliveries on that specific day. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, okay, for some of us we don’t understand how 
weighted average work, can you explain to us how do you do your weighting during this 
20 
period of seven days. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Okay so what you will do during the period of 
seven days you will take the total tons supplied over the seven days and you will take 
the tons that was supplied on that specific day, that will be worked out as a percentage 
to one another and you will multiply the AI on that specific day with that weighting, and 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 40 of 167 
 
that will roll the whole time, so the importance here is to understand that it’s weighted, 
firstly, and the second one is that it is not a seven day window, but it is a rolling 
average, so it does become quite a complex calculation when one does this. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright but we know that the importance or the objective 
of that calculation is to make sure that the index is less than 423. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   If it’s more the calculations of penalties begin. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   That’s correct.  And that takes us to point number 
332, so I can explain that, so what you find here is that there is five ranges, so the 
contract stipulates that it should be below 423 to not attract any penalties.  The moment 
10 
that it is greater than 423 but less than 500 or up to 500 the – Optimum will pay a 
penalty of R1.23 per ton, so where I get to this Optimum pay a penalty it’s described 
just in the paragraph above where it says in the event that the AI level is greater than 
423mg iron Optimum Coal Colliery will be liable to pay a penalty to Eskom calculated 
based on the following basis. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   So what it will mean is that Optimum will invoice 
us and then they will pay that, so what we have done in reality is that this penalty on a 
monthly basis where it was applicable this penalty was offset against the invoice 
amount on a monthly  basis, okay and so it goes on. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Can I stop you there? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   I think it’s important to make sure that your evidence is 
understood by us.  You say that if there is a need to impose penalties, then the 
penalties will be calculated and it will be levied on a monthly basis. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 41 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And the process of levying that penalty is you will do a 
set-off against invoices. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  For that specific month yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, so – and that’s important and I would like to make 
sure that your evidence is clear on that score.  So every month Optimum will send out 
an invoice for the stockpile delivered and you will look at it and you will say but they are 
liable to pay a penalty, you will do your calculation and you will set off the amount of the 
calculated penalties against the invoices and you will pay the net between the invoiced 
amount and the penalty amount. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Okay and you say you do it on a monthly basis. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you actually do the – or effect the set-off would you have 
communicated to them your conclusion that penalties have to be imposed or they would 
only see when they see how much you are paying them that month? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair there will be a remittance advice submitted 
by the Finance Department to the mine so they become aware through that before the 
payment is effected.  At a later stage in the management of the contract I have started 
drafting a letter which was a letter formatted by Cliffe Dekker and Hofmeyr where they 
20 
advised us how to share this detail on a monthly basis and this letter made reference to 
the coal price at the time, the total invoiced amount, the amount deductible for coal 
quality CD as volatile sizing and then also the AI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair I am going to skip the rest because we 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 42 of 167 
 
can see how the amount increases as the AI goes up.  Unless you want to make any 
comment on it, but what I would like to take you to, of relevance to the penalty, is 
paragraph 3.3.3, do you see it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you what is the implication of that paragraph 
to the penalties Eskom would be entitled to impose? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So Chair these amounts, and if we just take the 
first range, the R1.23 per ton that is payable by Optimum for AI between 423 and 500 
this R1.23 was as on the base date 1 April 2011 and this amount of R1.23 will then be 
adjusted with the escalation matrix in this contract on an annual basis as the escalation 
10 
happened. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it’s possible that although the baseline for calculation 
is R1.23 per ton that Rand amount may be escalated higher depending on the 
methodology set out in the CSA? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, now Mr Opperman I am going to take you to 
paragraph 3.4.3 on page 179 and it talks to the question that the Chairperson has 
posed to you, on my reading of that paragraph it is quite clear that there is an obligation 
for Eskom to advise Optimum Colliery on a month to month basis about the nature and 
extent of the penalties it intends to impose correct? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you do so with reference to providing details 
including the calculation of those penalties, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Including the laboratory tests that you have at your 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 43 of 167 
 
disposal concerning the level of the AI that you may have picked up from the stockpile 
supplied, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It’s an elaborate process, and it seems to me that you 
are at the front line of making sure that this process is complied with, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Given this elaborate process and the need for a monthly 
imposition, sorry firstly monthly calculation and monthly communication of the funds 
imposed to the relevant mine why would there be a debate in due course as between 
Optimum and Eskom about these penalties, because it seems to me that this clause is 
10 
designed to anticipate those debates and resolve them as and when they happen, do 
you agree? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I agree. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But why would then be such a historical debates of two 
years worth penalties, in the light of this matrix of dispute resolution? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Throughout this contract there has been various 
attempts in terms of the interpretation of the penalty provisions of this contract and I 
think this was just again one other example where the parties fail to agree on the 
method of calculation of this penalty and that is why there was that discontent around 
the penalty amount and there has been a lot of engagements around that with Glencore 
20 
on a frequent basis where calculations were shared.  The laboratory results is shared in 
real time on a daily basis so that is something that is available to either party at any 
given time.  The calculations were shared at intervals, I would not say that it was 
consistently shared every month but if you draw up a spreadsheet and you say well this 
is the way that we calculate it then it implies every month you just plug in the actual 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 44 of 167 
 
quality parameter that’s relevant to that seven day rolling period and it should yield the 
result, but yet there was a difference of interpretation around this calculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you have advised, when you would have advised them of 
the imposition of a penalty in a particular month and they didn’t agree with you and 
therefore there was some issue would you go ahead and effect the set-off in regard to 
that month or would the implementation of the set-off wait until there is some resolution 
in regard to that particular month? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chairperson on the AI we did offset that amount 
every month, irrespective of ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of a dispute. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Of a dispute yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the dispute could be handled in due course but you would have 
effected that set-off in the meantime? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct, we felt from Eskom that the second 
addendum was very clear on how the AI should be calculated and that amount was 
deducted every month, reason being that the month that that AI was  high we incurred 
the additional wear at our power plant and that was a material cost and that was all 
determined through a recent study that informed these penalty parameters in the 
second addendum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess it follows that if you had effected a set-off in a particular 
20 
month but a dispute arose or was still going on and later on you were persuaded that 
you were wrong you would then reverse that. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  We could do that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  There are two other additional points I 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 45 of 167 
 
would like to draw your attention to relating to this second addendum, the first is at 
page 179 paragraph 3.5.1 do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It’s about the base price for the coal supplied, or to be 
supplied, you see that it changes now to become 115, R115 per ton. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and it will begin from 11 April 2011, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Now it only meant that this is the base price for 
that specific date and that the escalation will be made on the indexes from that date 
going forward.  
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, no I understand that, from that date going forward 
you will obviously apply whatever escalation. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But there’s a base price, alright.  The next part relates to 
paragraph 3.6.1 and it’s going to become important as we explore your evidence in two 
ways, firstly it seems to me when I read this clause and others that support the 
philosophy of it, that the parties were well aware and were concerned about the 
abrasive index of the coal stock from that mine, from Optimum Coal Mine, and they 
wanted to do their best efforts to see what were the reasons for it, and how they can 
resolve it, do you agree with that? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and the parties committed themselves to how they 
will deal with it, in fact they formed the Sterling Committee, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s  correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Were you part of it or were you not there at the time? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 46 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No I was not there at the time, I only started 
managing this contract in September the following year, 2012. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, from anecdotal evidence you could have obtained 
do you know whether the process to investigate this problem about coal from Optimum 
was taken further as between the parties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do recall that there was a study done by an 
independent expert company, in short I can just refer it to the Turgess Study, I am not 
exactly sure over what period it fell but I would like to believe that it coincided with the 
actions from this Steercom where it was done. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, Chair I am going to leave paragraph 4.1 and 4.2 
10 
on page 181 because it will become relevant when we deal with the third addendum, so 
may I ask you to note that there is still that part of 4.1 and 4.2 but it becomes relevant 
when we deal with the third addendum.  And the last part Mr Opperman is the lawyer’s 
clause where the parties agree to abandon whatever disputes or contentions they may 
have had and that is paragraph 6.1, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Subject to any other issue you would like to bring 
to our attention I would like to go back to your statement and pick up your evidence 
from paragraph 18, are you there?  Page 4 paragraph 18 of your statement. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I’m there. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You talk about the fact that Glencore acquired Optimum 
in 2012, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And as a result of that acquisition the parties signed a 
third addendum, correct? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 47 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say the purpose of the third addendum was to 
delete paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the second addendum, correct?  
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair it’s in that context and it was for that reason that I 
skipped paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the second addendum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you don’t mind I would like to go back to it to see 
precisely what is the effect of the third addendum on those two paragraphs of the 
second addendum.  Chair you will find the third addendum on ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it 131, or not really? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No I think it comes after 171, it will be at 187. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It begins from page 188, do you see that, Mr Opperman 
are you at page 188? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, can you confirm that that is the third addendum 
that you referred to in paragraph 18 of your statement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes it is. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You see that it was signed by Mr – or Ms Kirin 
20 
Maharajah on the 11th of February 2013 on behalf of Eskom if you go to page 190, 
correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know who signed it on behalf of Optimum Coal 
Holdings and Optimum Coal Mine Pty Limited seems to be the same signature.   
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 48 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think it’s Mr Ephron signature but I’m under 
correction. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You think it’s Mr? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ephron, Clinton Ephron. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ephron, okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The substance of that third addendum you will find it on 
page 189, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And paragraph 3.1.1 can you read it for us? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  “The parties hereby amend the second addendum 
by deleting  
the provision of clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of the second addendum.” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So Chair what we did for our part is to go back to 
paragraphs 4.1.1, sorry 4.1 and 4.2 which are on page 181. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we simply ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Crossed out ...(intervention)  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Crossed – a red line across those two clauses Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I’m just making a note amended by the 3rd Addendum, is that 
right? 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja, we will say deleted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will suggest that you delete it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes delete it, not amend it, delete it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, in terms of 3.1.1 of the 3rd Addendum. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 49 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the importance of this Mr Opperman if you would 
recall is to make sure that the original coal supply agreement, as amended by the 
second – sorry the first and second addenda would continue to operate as they were, 
correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because the deleted 4.1 and 4.2 impose the obligations 
on the parties to relook at those clauses of the original CSA and to see how they can 
restate them, do you agree? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes Mr Maleka, maybe I can clarify it, so at this 
10 
moment in time one needs to appreciate that this was a contract that was signed 
around 1983 that has already undergone ownership and it also has now undergone two 
addendums, so at this moment in time the intention of these clauses was to consolidate 
the 1983 contract, the 1993 contract, the first addendum and the second addendum 
into coal supply agreement and let’s call it a more modern practical executable 
contract, and at this moment in time at the signing of the 3rd Addendum both parties 
have had several workshops, several engagements and attempts to achieve that and 
we could not reach consensus. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And  hence the decision to say we are not going 
20 
to consolidate this, we will leave it as it is, that’s basically what the third addendum 
does. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and the parties, you were under obligation as 
Eskom to produce the first draft? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 50 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you did not? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  We could not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And this is the reason why these clauses were deleted, 
alright. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, so we’re now operating in that world of CSA 
original, first and second addendum. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   That’s correct yes.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And third addendum of course. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN: I need to just make it clear we say that Eskom did 
not provide a draft, there was several attempts to get this draft but there was not 
something that both parties could agree to, to say this is the first draft revision that both 
parties could take to their legal teams and get a validation on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does that mean that Eskom did produce a draft but it was not the 
two parties did not reach agreement on the draft?  
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I don’t even think it came to the compilation of a 
draft document sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So you didn’t produce draft. 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I thought you sought to qualify that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I think Mr Opperman it was along answer to a simple 
question which you had previously answered.  Mr Opperman you begin to tell us what 
problems Eskom experienced one Glencore took over the mine.  You do so from 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 51 of 167 
 
paragraph 19.  I am at page 4 of your statement. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you at page 4 of your statement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In paragraph 9 you say: “After the purchase of the mine 
by Glencore all CM’s started to supply coal to Hendrina Power Station that did not meet 
the size specifications.”  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Of course you can talk about your knowledge of the coal 
quality on size from Optimum Coal Mine when you took over the management 
10 
responsibility relating to Hendrina Power Station, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Should we read that paragraph to say that you 
beginning to talk about coal quality sizing issues from the date you took over the 
management of Hendrina Mine? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes it was there and there about although at that 
moment in time there has already been a first notice issued by the previous contract 
manager to Optimum putting it on record that the size grading is out so I am not the first 
person to raise it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes.  And you begin to issue compliance or non-
20 
compliant notices of your own immediately after you took over management of the 
mine? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would like to refer to one of two of them and the first 
one is the one that you refer to in paragraph 20.  Chair it is Annex GJ5.  You will find it 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 52 of 167 
 
from page 191 if I am correct.  Are you there Mr Opperman? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The date of that letter is 7 August 2012, do you see 
that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it is written by someone called H Mokoena. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know that person? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I know of him, I do not know if I can say I know 
him. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay subject to your guidance I am merely going to 
draw your attention to the second last paragraph.  Can I ask you to read it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   
“In terms of Clause 3.44 of the first addendum of the Hendrina 
Coal Supply agreement Eskom hereby request a meeting with 
Optimum Coal Mine to assess the extent of our risk as well as 
the plans that Optimum has implemented to reduce the minus 
0.81 millimetre material delivered to Hendrina Power Station.” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know what happened after this letter was sent 
by Eskom?  Did the meeting that is contemplated in the paragraph you have just read 
20 
ever take place? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot say. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Anyway you refer to your working group and you say 
there was a report issued by that working group.  Chair I am at paragraph 22 of Mr 
Opperman’s statement on page 4. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 53 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you confirm in paragraph 22 Mr Opperman that 
there was a report produced by the working group and you annex a copy of that report 
from page 198.  Are you there? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am afraid I have looked at this report and I cannot 
understand precisely what it is supposed to convey because it conveys sampling 
results I am not too sure what they mean.  Maybe you would be able to help us on how 
we should approach the results recorded in this report?  Does it suggest or does it not 
suggest that there was some solution to the coal sizing problem from Optimum Coal 
10 
Mine?  Are you able to help us in that regard? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I can Sir.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Please do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the report at 198? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see Chair that it gives you a background which I 
do not understand and on page 199 it gives you the planting – the sampling results 
through all sorts of graphs and numbers that I do not understand. Are you able to help 
us how we should approach this document? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I can. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Please do. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair I – for a moment just want to take you 
back to the previous Annexure GJ05 and not the first page but on page 193 because 
this is what guided this work group that was established in September on what initial 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 54 of 167 
 
action to take.  So around the middle of – so this is an email response from Mr Riaan 
De Plooy which at that moment in time I think was the Chief Operation Officer at 
Optimum Mine.  So he responds to the Eskom team following this letter or following the 
initial email that was sent to Mr Doug Gain and around the middle of that print I am 
going to start reading there where it says: 
“The coal from the KN and KN abbreviation is for Kwagga North 
which is the mining area stream contains more finds than the 
coal from Pullenshope and Pullenshope was an underground 
operation for three primary reasons.” 
So the first reason that gets shared there is to say that this coal comes over a conveyer 
10 
belt that is 35 kilometres long and it has 18 transfer points where the coal falls from one 
transfer point to another transfer point.  So the indication is to say that because of all 
these drops at the transfer point this coal is breaking and it is adding to the size fraction 
breaking down.  Now maybe at this time also I need to just clarify something. In the 
contract we will often refer to the size grading as finds so I might in my explanation talk 
about finds.  So finds in this terminology in the contract does not refer to a punitive 
amount or anything it refers to the size grading.  So if I do use that word but I will try 
and refrain from it.  So the bullet refers to that – that this degradation of this coal is 
added to because of all this transfer points.  The second one talks about the fact that 
this coal in the open cast is actually more friable from nature – by nature just by the 
20 
deposition that is there.  And then the last bullet talks about the Bosmanspoort so PMP 
is another underground operation, Bosmanspoort which also generates some more 
finds.  So at the hand of this explanation from Mr Du Plooy we undertook the exercise 
of which this report reports on where we identified the different transfer points along this 
conveyer and at each transfer point we started doing sampling to see what is the 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 55 of 167 
 
degradation of this coal along the way.  So that is basically how we got to this.  So there 
was this high percentage of finds.  It was abnormally high.  The contract specification 
for this quality parameter has a limit of 15%, 15 and there was instances where it was 
as high as 30 to 35%.  So it was double the normal.  So this asked for something to be 
done and we needed to investigate it and this is where we started at the hand of the 
advice from Mr Du Plooy from his experience being in the mining environment.  So 
what these – what this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes before you proceed Mr Opperman if you go back to that first 
bullet point at page 193 where he explains how all the coal gets degraded is degraded 
the correct word? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If what he was saying was correct would that have meant that there 
should be no penalty if that was correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Not necessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Because the measuring point for this quality 
parameter remained at the sampling station at the power plant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  But what it would have done, it would have 
provided some background for the origin of this high size fraction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And one first need to know in what area to focus 
in order to correct what went wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So at this moment in time we saw from the 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 56 of 167 
 
analysis that around April, May 2012 the size fraction started increasing and we needed 
to understand why.  There is some other background as well in the top paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Where Mr Du Plooy refers to a drag line that has 
moved to a new area and all of that might have contributed and he actually deals with it 
under point number 2 where he says:  “the area where this drag line is now positioned 
actually the coal is more friable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair can I follow up on the question that you have 
posed? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes sure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now Mr Opperman we now have a study which explains 
the reasons why there is this degradation of coal quality on sizing at least.  You now 
know the reasons as Eskom, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do not understand the statements. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You now have the reason, you have an explanation 
about this coal quality problems. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You cannot speculate about what the reasons are you 
have established them through this study, correct? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What happened after this study?  Was there any 
improvement or did matters get worse? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  There was no improvement.  I cannot say that it 
got worse or that it got better but the size specification did not come back in line with 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 57 of 167 
 
the contract specification.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It remained high.  We were not too much 
convinced that this test really concluded the whole exercise.  And what we have done 
after this is subsequent exercises as well where we had independent specialists from 
the industry to come and have a look at the sampling station because that was the next 
point that we needed to sit and say:  Maybe there is a problem at the sampling station.  
Because what we also became aware of at this moment in time that was around March, 
April that area there was a modification done to the sampling system that is used to 
analyse this coal.  So the next point was to then go to the sampler and try and identify it 
10 
there.  So this exercise that we did on the degradation of the coal did indicate some 
degradation but not to the extent to contribute to these high finds that we were seeing.  
So yes it did apportion some reason but it did not answer the full question for us. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well can I ask you to go to page 205 because the 
explanation that you give does not explain to me why Eskom wrote the letter on page 
205.  That letter suggest that Eskom was still concerned about the coal quality. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Eskom called upon Optimum Coal Mine at that point 
in time to take remedial measures. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it did not do so. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. And if I may ask you lead – to read the second last 
paragraph. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The one that starts with Eskom wishes? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 58 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   
“Eskom wishes to place on record that this is a transgression of the coal – of the quality 
specification of the first addendum of the coal supply agreement and calls upon OCM to 
rectify this transgression.” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that letter was written by Pam Pillay on the 23 April 
2013.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The 22nd yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  22nd April 2013.  And that is more or less eight or so 
months after you had received that email from Mr Riaan Du Plooy. So there was this 
10 
grey spirit of eight months where Eskom was told about the reasons for the degradation 
and Eskom called for remedial action and Glencore did not do that. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Sorry Optimum did not do that at that point in time, 
correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Now before we go to lunch – sorry to tea can I ask 
you to see the reply of Optimum Coal Mine to that letter of Pillay.  Chair you will find the 
reply on page 207 and 208.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I guess you – this might be the convenient time? 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you wanted one last question? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  One last question.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you confirm that the letter beginning at page 207 is 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 59 of 167 
 
the reply by Optimum Coal Mine to the notice given by Eskom on page 205? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In fact it comes a day later. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair that will be a convenient stage to take the 
tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the tea adjournment until half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Mr Maleka. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Opperman we were at page 207 
which is the response of Optimum Coal Mine.  You see it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would like you to deal with paragraph 3 of that letter. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Can I cite it? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  “OCM has now reached the 
conclusion that the sizing specification set out in Clause 3.4.3 
of the first addendum is no longer realistically representative of 
the coal which OCM can reasonably be expected to achieve 
20 
from the exploitation of the coal deposits constituting the 
Optimum Colliery.  It being OCM’s view that OCM is conducting 
its operation in a proper manner and in accordance with best 
industry standards.” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  That part of the letter was also dealt with by 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 60 of 167 
 
Mr Clinton Ephron and he made it quite clear that there was no way Optimum Coal 
Mine could meet the sizing specification in the Coal Supply Agreement.  They were not 
realistic.  That was his evidence and then he also dealt with paragraph 4 on page 208 
and you will see that that paragraph calls for renegotiation of the specifications of the 
coal quality sizing in terms of those clauses of the first addendum.  Now it is quite clear 
and I would like your comment on this that at least as at April 2013 the coal coming 
from Optimum Coal Mine was no longer suitable in terms of sizing at least for Hendrina 
Power Station and therefore the supplier took the view that there was a need to 
renegotiate questions of sizing.  Do you accept that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I accept that that was OCM’s view. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  What was Eskom’s response to OCM’s view that 
they were conducting operations according to best practice?  They could no longer 
meet the specifications under the agreement and they called for a renegotiation to see 
whether or not new specifications can be agreed.  How did you respond to that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So Mr Chair Eskom responded to inform OCM 
that we are prepared to engage with the discussions to renegotiate in good faith as 
guided in the first addendum.  As part of the process we also engaged our Centre of 
Excellence, CEO, which is an Engineering Department within Generation which has 
materials handling specialists in that team to assist us with an assessment of the 
Hendrina Power Plant materials handling plant in order to determine if that plant could 
20 
handle the 20 percent -0.81 millimetre size fraction compared to the 15 percent.  
Numerous letters followed over the next couple of months which goes to the extent 
where Eskom requested from Optimum to provide details on their analysis as to why 
they say they cannot meet the quality parameter.  We were of the view that the exercise 
that was completed by 29 November did not conclusively provide a reason to say that is 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 61 of 167 
 
what it is.  So Eskom did not agree to the increase of the sizing although we said it is 
fine.  We will negotiate in good faith with them and in our view negotiations was to say 
we will get technical experts to come and provide advice.  We will most probably go on 
and do some more tests.  It will be a process.  So we did not tell Optimum we are not 
interested, we do not want to listen you.  We participated in the process and during this 
process this matter has even been escalated within the Eskom Organisation to my 
seniors.  So everybody was well aware of this and I am going to call it for now 
perceived sizing issue at Hendrina. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What was the upshot of those negotiations? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The negotiations were inconclusive. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  In the sense that we embarked on some 
inspections by independent specialists and that happened in November 2013 where we 
got a company or a specialist in from Intertek who this individual has vast knowledge 
around coal sampling, coal analysis Mr Erasmus.  He did an exercise on the sampling 
plant.  We also got the OEM, the Original Equipment Manufacturer which was Multotec.  
That was the company that installed the sampler in around 2012 the modified sampler.  
We even got them out.  They did an assessment on 3 December as well.  So 
throughout this process we were still trying to determine what the reason for this sizing 
is and we could not get to it.  It eventually got to a point where Eskom was requesting 
20 
information from Optimum to be made available in order to understand why they want 
to change the parameter and Optimum just never provided that information.  So I think 
it just went into a stalemate, but the issue with the sizing persisted.  So the sizing never 
improved.  Every month we sat and in fact that this moment in time it got to the extent 
where the sizing was out throughout the month and when in our interpretation one then 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 62 of 167 
 
applies the penalty this coal price was now defaulting down to R1 a ton, because of the 
penalty mechanism that we applied. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Rightly or wrongly, but that is how we determined 
it and maybe I can fast track, maybe I can fast track this to what happened on 
1 October 2015 where Mr Jan Voges who was a Glencore employee at the time, I am 
not 100 percent sure of his background, but I know he has got a very good background 
on coal, geology.  I do not know if he is a qualified metallurgist, but he has got vast 
knowledge.  He also participating in this process throughout, where he identified a 
problem on the sampling plant.  So this was the plant analysing the coal where there 
10 
was a crusher that he went and switched off and immediately on the following day there 
was a step change in the fine, the small size fraction reported by the sampler.  It did not 
correct itself 100 percent, but it significantly improved and this for me substantiated or 
supported this whole effort that we consistently were putting in to try and identify what 
is the real issue, because have we just admitted in the beginning that it is this coal that 
is friable and the transfer of the coal from Kwagga North we would have made the 
wrong decision.  We would have made the wrong decision. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So should the Chairperson approach your evidence on 
the basis that the sizing problems relating to Optimum Coal Mine was not resolved by 
the parties.  In fact it continued? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I am suggesting to you that it continued throughout 
the contractual relationship between Eskom and Optimum.  That issue about size 
continued? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It did continue up until October 2015 when that 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 63 of 167 
 
crusher was switched off.  After October 2015 there were instances where the sizing 
still did not meet the specification, but there was a significant improvement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What do you mean there was significant improvement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Meaning that beforehand the -0.81 millimetre size 
fraction that was reported on a daily basis by the laboratories were in the region of 
30/35 percent.  That then dropped to around 18 percent/19 percent and there was even 
instances where it dropped below 15 percent.  So it significantly reduced. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Thank you.  Can I then take you back to your 
statement at page 5?  You begin a new topic relating to the declaration of hardship by 
Optimum Coal.  Again the Chairperson has heard evidence relating to how Optimum 
10 
Coal Mine declared hardship and the result of it was that the parties decided to 
conclude a Cooperation Agreement.  You are aware of that development? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes, I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I ask you to deal with paragraph 25?  You 
may have dealt with parts of it when you testified about some significant improvement 
to the sizing problem, but just to complete your evidence can I ask you to deal with 
paragraph 25? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So this paragraph reports that: 
“The senior management team of PED…” 
That is the Primary Energy Division. 
20 
“…met with representatives of Glencore on 12 August 2013...” 
And I make note that I cannot recall that I was part of that meeting. 
“…to discuss and agree on the revision of the sizing 
requirements of the Coal Supply Agreement.  This meeting is 
recorded in a letter from OCM dated 21 August which is 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 64 of 167 
 
attached.  Eskom requested further information on OCM to 
negotiate the matter in good faith in a letter dated 18 October.” 
So I think this refer to my previous statement where Optimum responded to, pardon 
me.  Eskom responded to Optimum requesting additional information to substantiate 
this increase in the sizing specification. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and that letter of 21 August 2013 is on page 2010, 
but it seems to me when I read paragraph 4 of that letter that at best for the parties 
there was a mere proposal by Optimum Coal concerning the sizing issues and that is 
as far as matters went at that point in time.  In other words there was no agreement.  
There was a mere proposal between the parties? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Correct.  Alright, then you take the issue further from 
paragraph 26 when you talk about reference to arbitration.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But that arbitration to be clear is on a different matter.  It 
is on a hardship dispute declared by Optimum Coal.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And do you know what the reason for that hardship 
declared by Optimum Coal was? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall the exact reason of that hardship 
20 
claim, but I would like to believe that it related to the imposition of the sizing penalties 
that has been accrued over a long period of time which were placed on record over 
numerous, with numerous correspondence and also at the hand that at this point in 
time there has been several efforts to try and identify the original of the sizing and the 
teams have still failed to do it.  At this moment in time we in August 2013 or there 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 65 of 167 
 
around so it is still way before October 2015 when Mr Voges identified the issue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So the parties resolved to go to arbitration to 
resolve the sizing issue arising from declaration of hardship and you know 
Mr Opperman that that arbitration was not finally concluded through an award of the 
Arbitrator.  The parties agreed to settle the arbitration dispute.  You know that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I recall that the parties entered a cooperation 
agreement where the hardship was sort of set aside.  If I can [intervenes]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Was suspended? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Suspended. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is the correct word. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  In your statement you refer to the statement you 
refer to the Cooperation Agreement.  Chair we have looked at it.  I would simply want to 
direct the attention of Mr Opperman to parts of it, but we looked at it in detail when 
Glencore’s witness testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On Mr Opperman’s documentation you will find it at 
page 212. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman are you at page 213? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that that page records the basis of the 
Cooperation Agreement.  You will find it in paragraph 3 on page 213.  Are you there? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then if you go to the next page and I am referring to 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 66 of 167 
 
Clause 5.2 you will see that there is an agreement to suspend the hardship arbitration.  
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And if you go to paragraph 5.1 on the same page you 
will see that there is a constitution of the negotiating teams and your name comes up in 
paragraph 5.4.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And lastly if you go to page 216, I will skip the rest, you 
will see that there is a timetable on various matters that the parties had to negotiate 
and must agree by a certain specific date.  The one which is of importance to you would 
10 
be the date by which a new Coal Supply Agreement ought to be negotiated and if 
necessary concluded.  That would be the one March 2015.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman we know that you are part and parcel of 
the negotiating team.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  [No audible reply]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you just explain from your perspective whether the 
negotiations were successful or not? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think it is important to note what my function was 
in this Negotiation Team. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So this is a process that is facilitated by the Fuel 
Sourcing Department because it will be an addendum to a contract.  So it is not 
something that I can do.  So my function in this team at this moment in time was to be 
the liaison between the power station and this team.  So at this moment in time one of 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 67 of 167 
 
the provisions of this Cooperation Agreement was that there will be a change in the 
price.  There is a potential extension of this agreement and at that time because there 
was a change in the price there was an expectation from the power station to also 
realign the coal quality parameters on this contract that might not have been what they 
wanted it to be.  So my function during this period in time was to liaise with the power 
station and the technical specialist at the power station at the Centre of Excellence as 
well at the [indistinct] Department that has been reported on previously to identify or get 
to a point where we could get the best benefit going forward. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So we all realised it is going to be most probably 
10 
an increased price that is where the hardship related from.  So it will be an increased 
price but let us also have a look at the coal quality parameter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and your sounding board was the people who 
operated the power station? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you would go and talk to them about what the 
negotiations were all about and they will tell you their requirements? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you take those requirements back to the 
negotiations? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  We now know that as a result of that process of 
negotiations the parties decided to formulate a draft fourth addendum.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I want to confirm with you is to the extent that the 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 68 of 167 
 
draft fourth addendum dealt with questions of price for the supply of coal to Hendrina 
you would have received the import from those who operated Hendrina at that point in 
time about whether or not they were comfortable with that level of a proposed price? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes.  I think in a way although the main focus with 
the engagement at Hendrina was to look at the coal quality parameters. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  One need to appreciate that those parameters 
and the price walks hand in hand. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  [Intervenes]. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So I cannot say no. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  But the price primarily was driven by the 
negotiations. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand.  The price is the other side of the coin 
relating to coal quality? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I mean the two go. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Hand in hand and what I want to understand from you is 
on both scores that is price and quality you always had a sounding board from the 
20 
mines? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The power stations. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The power stations? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes, sorry. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The power stations, yes.  Correct. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 69 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So whatever was reflected on the draft fourth addendum 
reflected the level of comfort by those who operated the mine? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  100 percent. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So Mr Chair maybe just to get back to answer the 
previous question in full.  The question was what aspects did the fourth addendum 
address that I was responsible for and I think if one goes to the fourth addendum there 
was a couple of matters that needed clarification.  Some that included the interpretation 
and the implementation of this penalty, because there was clearly still not alignment 
10 
around that.  The second aspect the implementation and the execution of the sampling 
process, because we are now at the point where we started questioning the sample 
process.  We are not in October 2015 yet, but at this moment in time we are saying that 
modification that was done in 2012 did we do the right thing.  Are we in a position 
where we might need to something different?  Then there was the continuing failure 
from Optimum to supply the right size grade in coal.  So the issue was still there.  
Optimum still had the belief that it originates from their mining and we were not too sure 
about that.  There was also an issue that just before the Cooperation Agreement also 
came to light and that was or came to the table and that was a reduced availability of 
conveyor belts.  So because Optimum had to give this coal over a conveyor belt to 
20 
Hendrina and Hendrina Power Station had some breakdowns on these belts.  Optimum 
was of the view that they could not supply the coal.  So we were issuing them or I was 
issuing them with short supply notifications but they were contesting that they were not 
able to supply the coal and then I think the last one was the whole price adjustment on 
the size fraction which we still did not know how to do the sizing and maybe I can 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 70 of 167 
 
expand on it.  When one gets to the sizing parameter in the coal supply agreement that 
supplied it talks about measuring the coal sizing on a monthly average, but yet there is 
no penalty mechanism that talks to this monthly average. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The only big penalty mechanism that exists on 
this contract is this three day, four day, five day, six day and seven day rolling period. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And there was this disconnect on how to align it.  
So even though all this time we have been accruing this sizing penalty that was 
calculated there was this very strong disconnection between the two parties on how to 
10 
really calculate this, the sizing penalty.  So that was also something that we wanted to 
try and attempt and [indistinct] off with the fourth addendum.  So maybe in a way the 
fourth addendum was doing a bit what the third addendum should have done. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You explain a lot about the negotiation process.  I 
am not going to take you through them, because that is not the point.  The point is that 
the negotiations resulted in some kind of an understanding as between the Negotiating 
Teams and that is to formulate a draft fourth addendum? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to it in due course hopefully, but for now after 
the fourth addendum was presented in draft form those who were negotiating sought to 
20 
get a mandate from decision makers in Eskom in order to authorise the execution of the 
fourth addendum? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in your bundle of documents you enclose a 
submission that was made to the Board of Directors.  You will find it Chair on page 231. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 71 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before I take you to that Board’s submission I would like 
you to explain something to us in your statement.  It is in paragraph 35 on page 8. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I am there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you there? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You will see there you introduce a discussion you 
had with the Hawks? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  About two letters.  Can you indicate to us how the 
10 
Hawks sought to interview you about these two letters?  What were so important about 
these two letters that the Hawks decided to interview you about them?  If you want to 
look at those two letters you will find them from page 226 of your bundle.  I have looked 
at those letters from page 226.  I must confess I do not know why these documents 
would be so serious and of interest to the Hawks that they would want to interview you 
on them. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot comment on the reason why the Hawks 
made reference to the letters.  I merely included them at the time because I thought 
maybe it might be referenced in some way at some stage, but I think these two letters 
were let5ters that were signed by Mr Ncube my senior at the time putting on record the 
20 
coal supply commitment and the relation to the sizing penalty that was still at this stage 
sought of put on hold if I can say it like that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman you like me have looked at these two 
letters.  They merely record failure by Optimum Coal to meet its contractual obligations 
relating to the supply… 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 72 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Ja, Mr Opperman you, like me, have looked at these 
two letters, they merely record failure by Optimum Coal to meet its contractual 
obligations relating to the supply of coal, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes that’s correct sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    These letters set out what has always been Eskom’s 
position? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    What was so unique about them? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    I can’t say. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    You can’t say.  Alright, can you go to the Board 
10 
submission on page 31, 231, you have read this Board submission before, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Did you make any input to this submission? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    I was party to the negotiation team so I would 
like to believe that I did make inputs, I was not party to the drafting of this document, 
but surely my involvement in the negotiation team would have meant that there is 
comments in here that related to my involvement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Yes, in other words parts of this document reflects your 
input in the negotiations. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Right, I’m going to reflect on two parts of this, maybe 
more but for now I would like you to go to page 232, and I am going to read the 
paragraph beginning with PED. 
“Primary Energy Division now requires a mandate to conclude negotiations 
with Optimum to ensure security of supply to Hendriena.” 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 73 of 167 
 
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    From your perspective that must have been a 
legitimate reason why you sought a mandate to conclude the negotiations, because the 
security of supply for coal to your power station is a very vital part of your business 
operations. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes it is. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Yes, and I continue. 
“Hence it is requested that the Board of Directors resolves that Primary 
Energy Division is mandated to conclude negotiations with Optimum Coal 
10 
Mine, to ensure security of supply for Hendriena Power Station ...” 
And you put something in brackets  
“...February 2015 money values for a CV of 23.5 [I don’t know what that 
means] dry basis from 1 April 2015 to 31st December 2018 and to include 
this new coal supply agreement the following available rights to be exercised 
by  31st December 2015.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    There’s a price point that you reflect there of R442 per 
ton, do you see that? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    It seems to me that a request for mandate in regard to 
that price point was something that you as negotiator supported. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    You were quite comfortable with that price? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 74 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Ja, that was the price at the time that we were 
talking about. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Yes.  Can I take you to page 233, and ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page, I’m sorry? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    233. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    The first bullet point there, and let me read it out to you 
and ask for your comment.   
“Primary Energy Division is mandated to negotiate with Optimum for the full 
Optimum reserve/resource and production for Eskom supplied by Hendriena 
10 
and for other Eskom power stations including but not limited to Tutuka and 
Arnot Power Stations should it be possible to achieve an average cost per 
ton at or below 500 per ton from one 1 April 2015 to 31st December 2018 and 
at a cost below R527 per ton from 1 January 2019 up to 31 December 2035.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    What I would like you to help us with is that this point 
at which you seek this mandate reflects on two things, the one is the supply to 
Hendriena during the lifetime of the existing CSA which we know was going to come to 
an end around 31 December 2018. 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    But you were also looking for a mandate to look 
beyond that period, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    And you said the second leg of the future period you’re 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 75 of 167 
 
looking would begin from 1 January 2019 to 31st December 2035, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    More or less 15 years going forward. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    I read this to mean that you were so concerned about 
the security of supply concerning coal from Optimum Mine that you wanted to make 
sure that you secure it for the lifetime of that mine, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Yes.  And your security of supply concerns also went 
beyond Hendriena, you also wanted to secure supply to other mines, correct? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    To other power stations, correct? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Yes, yes.  You know by now that that did not happen, 
correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    You are someone who is in charge of the management 
of mining operations and you are part and parcel of this recommendation, and this 
recommendation is not endorsed by decision makers in Eskom.  How did that impact on 
your responsibility as to properly manage Arnot and Hendriena? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Firstly it significantly impacted on the future 
supply, post December 2018, plus at the time when we were looking at this coal supply 
20 
there must have been a need for coal at the Tutuka and Arnot power stations as well, 
so it most definitely was not a very well received decision to say now we’re not going 
ahead and we’re losing these volumes.  That is on the second part of it.  On the first 
part of it what was said about it is that this coal supply would have been a coal supply 
over a conveyer belt to Hendriena Power Station and in hindsight where we are sitting 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 76 of 167 
 
today we are now trucking in all the coal to this power station, and at that moment in 
time because there was this hardship that was there, there was all these issues that 
was there we realised that there is the potential of losing this coal supply completely to 
Hendriena Power Station and we felt very strong about it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    And with the greatest of respect it is not in hindsight, it 
was clearly foreseeable that if you lose volumes from Hendriena which was transporting 
stockpile via a conveyer belt you would have to procure them elsewhere. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    Most certainly yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    And that will be increased logistical transportation 
costs.  It was so foreseeable that either you have this, if you don’t have this you are 
10 
going to have the worst, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  100% and Mr Chair I think that partly also 
contributed to this price where we – how we got to this price.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  It’s common knowledge, or public knowledge at 
this moment that we know that the Optimum price at this moment in time was around 
R200 a ton, so to sit and look at an amount of R442 a ton that’s a significant jump, but 
the coin side to this is exactly what you’re saying, it was contracting coal from another 
source and bringing by a truck most probably landing it at this cost or slightly more. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and I know that you are not a Board member of 
20 
Eskom and I know that you are not a member of the Senior Executives of Eskom, but 
on your evidence, on your approach I suggest to you that it is reckless in the extreme 
for decision makers not to adopt this recommendation unless they have something 
much better that can compete with this recommendation.  What is your comment to that 
proposition? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 77 of 167 
 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  I agree the much better could have been to just 
default to the original coal supply agreement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, anyway you know now that this mine as we speak 
today it is no longer operational, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Hendriena is no longer sourcing its coal from 
Optimum Coal Mine. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that mine is just like a scrap yard, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So as we speak Hendriena would be sourcing its coal 
from elsewhere? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know where is it getting its coal? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  It’s most probably currently getting its coal from 
three or four different other sources, and it’s not all directly close to Hendriena Power 
Station, it is in the Witbank area but it’s multiple deliveries from multiple sources. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair through you can I ask Mr Opperman to do a 
calculation for us, to see precisely what is the cost implication for procuring coal from 
other sources to Hendriena, I would like you to do that calculation for us to see whether 
20 
or not there was value for money for Eskom to reject this proposal and to find itself as 
we speak in a totally different set of circumstances for procuring coal far away from the 
power station.  Are you able to do that for us? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes, I do have some amounts with me and if I try 
and relate it Mr Chair to the period which was around June 2013 – so – June 2015, and 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 78 of 167 
 
I just go back to the cost of coal delivered over that period at that moment in time the 
Hendriena cost was around R159 a ton, and the landed cost for coal delivered via road 
trucks was around R450 a ton. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  For now I will work with that figure of R450 per ton, 
going forward, alright.  I will come back to this figure at some point, because we know 
that this request for a mandate was not given by the Board of Eskom.  I am going to 
jump ahead to the next development that happened after this draft 4th Addendum was 
not approved by the Board.   You will get that next development at page 249.  Chair you 
would recall that Mr Ephron dealt with this in the context of his evidence to the effect 
that when he was told that the 4th Addendum was not approved by the Board he then 
10 
approached Mr Malefe to try and understand why and thereafter when he was told that 
Eskom was not happy with the 4th addendum and in fact they were not going to sign it 
he decided to renegotiate by relooking at the cost that was quoted in the 4th Addendum 
and reduced it by means of the proposal set at page 249, and I would like to deal with 
that proposal from your perspective Mr Opperman, you attached this proposal in your 
bundle of documents, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now I take it therefore that you are aware of this 
proposal? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  How did you become aware of it? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  I would like to think that it was shared with the 
negotiation team at that moment in time, this proposal was addressed to Mr Johann 
Bester, as the General in Fuel Sourcing, which was part of the negotiation team at that 
stage, so I can’t recall exactly how I got hold of it but I would like to think that it was 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 79 of 167 
 
shared in a forum where as a negotiation team on the Eskom side met to say well 
there’s a revised proposal on the table because ultimately this was something different 
to the previous mandate that was compiled for submission to the Board. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, so it’s fair to approach your evidence on the basis 
that you received it at a point in time when Mr Ephron revived the negotiations, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The date is 30 June 2015, I am going to skip it, and the 
introductory paragraph says the following: 
“We refer to the meeting held at Eskom on 11 June 2015 between your Mr 
Malefe and Mr Mbuwene and our Mr Ivan Glassenbergh and Clinton Ephron.  
10 
As discussed at the meeting Optimum is willing to consider a compromise 
deal in relation to the negotiation and extension of the Hendriena supply 
agreement.  We have given consideration as to what sort of compromise 
would be feasible in the circumstances and accordingly we hereby submit 
this revised offer for Eskom’s consideration.  The proposed new agreement 
would supersede the existing Hendriena Coal Supply agreement and be in 
full and final settlement of all pending disputes and claims.” 
I would like to take you to the question of price first, it’s up to you if you want to 
highlight any issue relating to commencement and duration, but for me the important 
issue relates to price.  The offered price is for the period 1 July 2015 to 31 December 
20 
2018, which is described as the first period.  The base price as at 1 July 2015 is R300 
per ton, do you see that?  
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That’s a significant revision from the price proposed in 
the 4th Addendum, do you see that? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 80 of 167 
 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:   That is correct Mr Chair, what is of importance 
to note as well is that this quality parameter also now again defaulted to the original 
contract qualities and not the higher qualities as what was negotiated.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed and we will get to that.  But for now insofar as 
price is concerned there is a proposed reduction on my calculation of something in the 
order of R142 per ton. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Compared to the previous price proposed in the 4th 
Addendum.  On price alone that reduction is almost a third of the price previously 
agreed, do you agree with it? 
10 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  I agree with it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  We will come to the core quality parameters 
because I would like you to help us.  And then you will see that there is a second price 
proposed for what is called the second period, you will find it in the second bullet under 
the heading or column “price”.  From 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2023 in the 
second period the base price as at the base date will be R570 per ton, do you see that? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  This of course as a second period is the one that comes 
after the initial period of the CSA comes to an end, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it’s again a futuristic view that Glencore adopts that 
we would like to supply to secure a security of supply beyond the existing CSA, 
correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That is correct, I think Mr Chair what is important 
to just also note if we’re trying to compare apples with apples because we’re relating 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 81 of 167 
 
this to the mandated document is to note that the original mandated document for this 
period was R500 a ton. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  So the price is now higher. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Again it is still at the original contract qualities 
not at the higher qualities that we negotiated. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  So most probably at this moment in time this 
coal will not be suitable for Arnot so one is losing some alternative but I agree if the 
10 
strategy was to secure for the long term this does deal with that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, then there’s another part of this offer which is 
quite interesting, and I would like you to comment on it.  If you go to page 2050 I will 
skip the coal quantity which is expressed in the first bullet point, I will go to the second 
bullet point.  It says Eskom shall be entitled by no later than 31 December 2015 to 
implement and conclude a tender process to obtain a bona fide written offers from third 
party suppliers, do you see that?  
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It seems to me that the implication of this clause Mr 
Opperman is to offer an opportunity to Eskom to go and test the market. 
20 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On whether they can get a better offer, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That is correct ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And normally that’s how public entities such as Eskom 
operate, you go out to the market to test whether or not there is a competitive cost 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 82 of 167 
 
effective and transparent deal, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you were part of the negotiations would you have 
supported this part of the offer, to go out to the market to test it? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes I will because I would like to confirm that the 
price is reasonable. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And then the third bullet point tells us what will 
happen if Eskom had gone out to the market and had received a better offer, Optimum 
would be obliged to – or will be entitled to match that offer, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That’s correct yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, subject to the question of coal quality what is your 
view of this offer? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  I think it was reasonable, one needs to consider 
that at this moment in time the price of coal at the Hendriena Power Station was maybe 
around R175 a ton, so R300 a ton for the same quality might seem like a lot of money, 
but obviously this opens up that extended 15 year window with some security, so I think 
it’s reasonable, considering the mandated document that was drafted this is a good 
proposal. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, you know that this proposal was not accepted by 
the decision makers in Eskom? 
20 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Were you told why it was not accepted? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  No I was not told. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As you sit there in the witness box with hindsight, 
because I believe that’s a term that you used before, were you able to get the reasons 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 83 of 167 
 
why this offer was not accepted by the decision makers in Eskom? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  No I was not able. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You see what troubles me is this, that this offer 
contemplated a genuine procurement and competitive proposal, out there in the market, 
what happened later is something else, Eskom agrees to cede the shares in Optimum 
Coal Pty Limited to a third party who is Tegeta, without any competitive bidding process 
to supply coal to that mine, to that power station. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I’m sure when those who made the decision come 
before this commission will ask questions around how they decided to implement a 
10 
different strategy of cession, from your perspective did things change in relation to 
Optimum Coal Mine after this offer was rejected?  When I say things changed I refer to 
coal quality, did that  change? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:   Not really what I could recall.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The price remained the same? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that was about less than 200 per ton? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I’d like to take you back to your statement, and Chair I 
am at page 8, you deal with the question of the rejection of both the 4 th Addendum and 
20 
the subsequent offer that we have deal with a moment ago, from paragraph 39 of your 
statement, correct? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in paragraph 42 you say I do not know why Mr Brian 
Malefe made this decision to stop the settlement process as I did not have any personal 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 84 of 167 
 
discussion with him regarding the matter prior to this decision.  You see that?  From 
your perspective did anyone ever consult with you to tell you that they are going to 
reject the 4th Addendum proposal and the proposal from Mr Clinton Ephron of June 
2015?  Were you consulted on this score? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  No I was never consulted. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then in paragraph 43 you say that the cancellation 
of the cooperation agreement reinstated the hardship arbitration, dated 23 June 2015, 
do you see that? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, before I get to paragraph 44 can I ask you this, 
10 
do you know what was the upshot of that arbitration on hardship? 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  I’m not sure if I understand the question? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What happened to that arbitration which was reinstated 
after the cancellation of the cooperation agreement?  Remember the 4 th Addendum is 
not approved. 
MR GERT JOHANNES OPPERMAN:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Remember the arbitration was suspended.  Because of 
the lack of approval of the fourth addendum and the cancellation of the cooperation 
agreement the arbitration is revived. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Clinton told us a lot about it.  Mr Ephron rather told 
us a lot about it.  What I want to understand from you is do you know what ultimately 
happened to that arbitration? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do not happen with that arbitration other than 
Glencore going into business rescue in August two months later. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 85 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  In – from paragraph – so let me go to paragraph 
44 which I skipped.  There you said there was a meeting between Mr Molefe, Mr 
Mobweni and Mr Glassenberg and Mr Ephron on 11 June 2015.  Following this meeting 
OCM made a revised offer which was sent to Eskom on 30 June 2015 and that is the 
offer we have looked at, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright so we can comfortably go to the next topic you 
deal with which is your topic on the imposition of penalties, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  YEs. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You start with the topic from paragraph 45.  In paragraph 
10 
46 you refer to a Mr Christo Kruger of the Primary Energy Division as someone who 
made the calculation of the penalties imposed, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I find interesting with that part of your statement 
you say “I do not know how Mr Christo Kruger calculated the penalty amount and or 
how it was applied to the CSA and or the relevant addendums to the CSA.”  Do you see 
that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you some few questions around that?  We 
have looked at your mandate.  We have looked at your job description and you have 
20 
explained to us how they work.  And the sum total of what you explained to us is that 
you were someone who was responsible for the calculation of penalties including the 
input from the scientists and the input from the financial division, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why would Mr Christo Kruger take it upon himself to do 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 86 of 167 
 
the calculation on penalties that ultimately were imposed? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Kruger he is supporting me on a finance point 
of view and they will do this calculations.  Maybe for clarification point number 46 what I 
meant by this is that at the moment when Mr Kruger did this calculation I did not 
understand the method that this calculation was – this penalty was derived to how it 
was got  - how he got to that amount.  And the reason was because of this continued 
difference in interpretation on like for instance the application of the sizing.  Where the 
sizing is measured on a monthly average but applied on a three, four, three to seven 
day rolling period.  I am not trying to say that I do not agree to the 2.1 million but it was 
merely the way that it was calculated at that moment in time there was not a common 
10 
understanding between Glencore and Eskom this is how we are going to determine the 
qualities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  {Coughing} excuse me.  Well you might have to just clarify the 
position with regard to your position with regard to this R2.1 billion because when you 
talked about it for the first time earlier this morning the first answer that I think you gave 
to Mr Maleka’s question or his question may have been based on the understanding 
that you did not agree with that amount.  But you subsequently said as I understood 
you that you had no problem with the amount of R2.1 billion but there was some other 
issue and I cannot remember whether it was the method of calculation.  I think I did ask 
you whether your issue related to the method of calculation or the means by which they 
20 
had arrived at that amount.  You gave a certain answer and now I hear that you say you 
do not have a problem with that amount. I think you say now again but I saw something 
here also – ja in paragraph 47. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You specifically – well the first line of paragraph 27 you say: “I was 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 87 of 167 
 
later informed that the penalty amount calculated by Mr Christo Kruger came to about 
R2.1 billion.”  And in the next sentence you say:  “I was not in agreement with the 
amount since.”  And then you proceed.  So right now I am not sure exactly whether you 
agreed at the time with the amount of R2.1 billion but you do not agree now or whether 
you agree now with that amount but you did not agree with it then and if you did not 
agree what the basis was for your not agreeing with it I am not sure.  Do you want to 
take your time and try and explain to me what your position was then in regard to the 
amount and what your position is now with regard to that amount and to the extent that 
there may have been differences of how that amount was – how you arrived at that 
amount or the basis of your disagreement please just explain it making a distinction 
10 
between what your position was then and what your position is now to the extent that 
there may be a difference between the two positions? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Good thank you Mr Chair.  What I tried to explain 
this morning was to say that at the time of this calculation being done to 2.1 million in 
this moment in time Mr Kruger’s reference point and the reference point that myself and 
Mr Needham from Glencore did was different.  In the sense that the Glencore view and 
the reference point that I used was to only account for the sizing penalty from May 2012 
up until April 2013 which was the date when Optimum issued the letter indicating that 
they want to renegotiate the sizing penalty.  So I only considered the sizing penalty up 
until that period and if you consider that period it gave me this amount of around 720 
20 
million.  If I consider Mr Kruger’s point of reference where he looked at the penalty 
period the sizing penalty for the full period it gets to 2.2 million. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no, no.  Look at your statement.  We now know that 
for the – when the penalty is imposed for the first time it is in the amount of 2.1 million. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Million correct. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 88 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we know that it is around June, July, August when 
the penalties were imposed? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In the order of 2.1 billion. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Correct.  At that point in time your view is you do not 
agree with Mr Christo Kruger’s calculation because you took a view that on the 
interpretation of the agreement that amount was too high in 2015 because that 
reference point of 2015 is the last point at which the penalties are calculated in the 
order of 2.1 billion, correct? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you take that reference point you came to a totally 
different conclusion that the calculation of 2.1 billion was too excessive.  In fact you 
came to the conclusion that the appropriate amount was something in the order of 
R720 million give or take rands and cents, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct based on my interpretation of the 
contract. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed, indeed. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  So to answer the Chairperson’s point and this 
20 
is the reason why we called your evidence here is to tell us that as far as Eskom is 
concerned there was not a consistency of position and that point in time about the 
nature and extent of the penalty it ought to impose? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I would not say that.  If I can take you to Annexure 
18 which is my calculation sheet that I attached to my statement. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 89 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I read this and ask you to confirm before we go 
there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before it is read let me ask this question Mr Opperman.  Let 
us go back to the position when you either heard or saw for the first time that Mr Christo 
Kruger had reached the total amount of R 2.1 billion in his calculations. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I take it that at a certain stage you familiarised yourself with 
how he came to that amount, is that right? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in doing so you got to understand that he interpreted the 
10 
agreement in a certain way, is that right? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I interpreted it in the same way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You interpreted the – you agreed with his interpretation? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  One hundred percent yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay at that stage what was your attitude to the outcome of that 
calculation namely R2.1 billion?  Did you take the view that his outcome was correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The calculation to get to the R2.1 billion was 
correct and I supported.  My interpretation of the coal supply agreement from a contract 
management point of view said that I should not apportion the sizing penalty after 
Optimum issued a letter to ask can we please renegotiate the sizing which was in April 
20 
2013.  So if you take the same calculation that Mr Kruger did and the same calculation 
that I have in my annexure and you remove – and you add the sizing penalties from 
April, May 2013 until 2015 in fact I get to a value of R2.27 million.  So we are there and 
there about on the same volume 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So if you were the one who had been asked to make the 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 90 of 167 
 
calculation instead of Mr Kruger being the one who was asked what is the total that you 
would have arrived at on your own understanding of what was to be taken into account 
and what was not to be taken into account in calculating the amount?  What was the 
amount that you have come to?\ 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  R723 million and it is based on the fact that I did 
not include the sizing penalty post the date that Optimum request the renegotiation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So and did Mr Kruger do something different in regard to that item? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  He included the sizing post April 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you excluded it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I excluded it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have excluded it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you calculated you excluded it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now as far as you are concerned was he wrong to include it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  We do not have – we do not have that advice on 
what it should be.  Was the sizing penalty out at that post April 2013?  Yes it was out.  
Should they have been penalised?  Maybe they should have been penalised.  From a 
20 
contract management point of view there was just this let me call it this peg in the 
ground where we said well the penalties – because you did not contest the penalties it 
sensed that you – my sense was that you accepted it.  So up until April 2013 you did 
not contest the penalties so in my mind you accepted it but in April 2013 you asked, can 
we please renegotiate it?   And in my view that is a period where the sizing penalty 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 91 of 167 
 
should have been dealt with differently.  If a decision was to say what is the total 
penalty at this moment in time that needs to be levied most probably it would have been 
R2.1 billion.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But from what you say it seems clear to me that you took a view that 
I cannot remember what you said it was that should be excluded in the calculation, 
what was that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja the sizing penalty post 2013 – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the sliding penalties. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Sizing penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sizing penalties. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you took the view that they should be excluded from the 
calculation? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Post April 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but Mr Kruger took the view that they should be included. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that – because of the different views that you both took you did 
not come to the same conclusion – outcome, is that right?  He came to R2.1 billion, you 
came to about 700 and something million rand? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So now I do not understand why you would then in the light of this 
still say you agreed with his amount of R2.1 billion when your view was there was 
something he took into account which took him to that amount, that total which in your 
view should not be taken into account.  Why do you say – why do you say you agreed 
with his total of R2.1 billion then? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 92 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The method of calculating the R2.1 billion penalty 
I agree with.  So the total of R2.1… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it includes what you think should be excluded, is it not? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Exactly but the fact that I am including or 
excluding a portion that is an interpretation of the relationship or the communication 
that has happened under this contract.  So if you – if you consider the quality 
parameters and the penalty provisions against this contract and you do a calculation 
the calculation is R2.1 billion.  If you now go and look at what has happened in this life 
of the power station it means that somewhere in this life and that happened in April 
2013 there was an engagement which said we contest this sizing penalty and we want 
10 
to renegotiate it.  And yes there was a process that followed after that that then 
conclude at the time when even the corporation agreement was signed or the fourth 
addendum was signed and hence the reason why in the fourth addendum it was 
included to say that the parties need to agree on this historical penalty because there 
was no agreement.  There was no agreement between Glencore and Eskom at that 
moment in time on how it should be calculated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as I understand it and you must just tell me if there is something I 
misunderstand.  As I understand what was being calculated was the total amount of 
penalties. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That Eskom was entitled to. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now I take it Mr Kruger was asked please calculate for us 
what we are owed as Eskom in terms of the total penalties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 93 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He came to the amount of R2.1 billion? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By whatever method he came to that amount? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if you were asked or you asked or you decided to calculate the 
total penalties that Eskom was entitled to is that right on your own? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you arrived at R700 and something million, is that right? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The calculation that I did actually came to R2.2 
billion. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now let me ask this question before I allow Mr Maleka to continue.  
But what was your answer and maybe what is your answer now also as to what was 
Eskom – what penalties as a total was Eskom entitled to at that time in your view? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  In my view it should have been somewhere 
around R2 billion because the agreement to exclude the size or the decision to exclude 
the sizing penalty post April 2013 when the request was made to exclude it.  That 
portion of penalties that was excluded which is the balance between R720 million and 
the R2.1 billion will most probably be something that the parties would have negotiated 
and agreed to.  But the penalty that was due to Eskom is the R2.1 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure if I am any better – I am any wiser. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well can I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I let you continue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair that is important.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You know Mr Opperman I do not know what is the job 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 94 of 167 
 
description and official responsibilities of Mr Kruger but from your perspective I know 
that your job description includes the management of commercial and legal aspects 
relating to the CSA, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that the very issue relating to the calculation of the 
penalties, the very issue relating to the interpretation of a contract on how penalties 
must be calculated falls squarely within your responsibilities? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Whatever interpretation you place on the CSA is an 
interpretation which in all probabilities Eskom will be guided by you? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It would be guided by me it might not be the 
decision that is taken. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is a point of the enquiry that you come to the 
conclusion on the interpretation of the agreement. That the good estimate of the penalty 
is R720 odd million on your own interpretation of that agreement, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Someone we do not know on his own interpretation of 
the agreement comes to a totally different conclusion. 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On the interpretation of the agreement that Eskom 
should impose a penalty of R2.1 billion, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The point of the inquiry is this, did anyone consult with 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 95 of 167 
 
you before this R2.1 billion penalty was imposed? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No, nobody did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Someone does not consult with you to impose a penalty 
of R2.1 billion on a matter that falls squarely within your official responsibilities? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I appreciate – I hope that you understand why this 
line of inquiry is important. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No I understand. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because if it is Eskom’s position that penalties of R2.1 
billion must be imposed that position must maintain regardless of who owns the mine, 
10 
do you agree with that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Just repeat? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Despite your interpretation of the agreement and despite 
the fact that you contend on your interpretation for imposition of a lowered penalty 
Eskom goes ahead that I will impose a penalty of R2.1 billion.  That position must 
remain regardless of who owns the mine.   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  For sure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It does not matter whether it is owned by Glencore or by 
Tegeta? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  For sure yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Before we go to lunch can I ask you this for your 
comment?  Why questions of penalty suddenly become important and they reduce 
fundamentally to almost a hundredth when the mine is owned by Tegeta?  Why does 
the penalty amount changes and comes to R250 odd million when the mine is now 
owned by Tegeta? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 96 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot answer that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you consulted about the R250 million? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No.  In fact I only got to know about the 
settlement that was reached way, way after the settlement was done.  I only became 
aware of the settlement agreement for the first time on the 23 January 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You became aware of that settlement agreement when? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The 23 January 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Gee yes.  Chair before we go for lunch can I ask Mr 
Opperman to confirm some sure things? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They are common cause but they lead me to the next 
topic.  You confirm that as a result of the imposition of the penalties on Optimum Coal 
Mine it went under business rescue, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is a matter which ought to have been of 
concern to Eskom? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And to you as the operate – as the manager of the 
various mining holdings of Eskom – sorry power stations of Eskom? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. Chair is this a convenient time to go for a tea 
break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is.  Thank you we will take the lunch adjournment and resume 
at two.  We adjourn. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Opperman can I ask you to reflect 
on the following concluding remarks relating to your calculation of the penalties?  Do 
you know that Mr Nagar did his own calculation of the penalties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am not aware that he did his own calculations.  I 
would like to think it is the same schedule as what Christo used, but I cannot. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I am sure you were not aware that he testified 
about those calculations and the amount that he said he supported gave the 
10 
Chairperson some details.  Chair I believe that you do have Mr Nagar’s statement.  It is 
U2 and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would ask you to go to SN11B which is that A3 page 
set of documents Mr Mokoena gave to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the last part.  Would you? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  SN11B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SN, is that the spreadsheet? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is the spreadsheet, but I will just read around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I think my Registrar put it somewhere.  Zondi where is that 
20 
spreadsheet.  Did you put it in? 
REGISTRAR:  [Indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have got it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  If you could go to SN11B.  You do not 
have it Mr Opperman, but I am just going to read out a figure to you and ask you to 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 98 of 167 
 
reflect on some concluding remarks that I would like to make on this topic.  Chair would 
recall that what he did in relation to that figure he talked about two sets of dates.  The 
first you will see is the settlement agreement/Optimum letter/CDH Response Letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That is the history of the calculation which he tracked 
and traced from the letter of demand sent by CDH on behalf of Eskom and then he 
reflected on a date 2017/03/03 and he calls it updated penalty master. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then he said the amount that he was willing and 
prepared to support is R1.166 billion which is right at the bottom under the column 
10 
updated penalty master. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I remember the figure.  I cannot see it now, but I think you may 
proceed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will find it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And he said he was surprised that Eskom was willing to 
settle at R255 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In the light of this figure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that this is the amount which Eskom was willing to 
give up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In his own words, I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 99 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If I am not quoting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Certainly paraphrasing his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And for your purposes Mr Opperman your colleague 
Mr Nagar, I think you know him? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Was prepared to support a penalty amount of 1.166 
billion.  The concluding remark that I would like you to reflect on and comment about is 
this.  Did you know that Mr Nagar as at 2017, March had done this calculation and did 
10 
he share it with you? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No, he did not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you are not aware of this? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No, I am not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  The next concluding remark that I would like you 
to reflect on is based on your own interpretation of the agreement you arrived an 
amount of R720-off.  Did you convey that amount to anyone? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Million. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  R20 million, sorry.  My apologies.  Eskom will kill me.  
Did you convey that amount of R720-odd million to anyone in Eskom? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Not.  So what happened you kept it to your own? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I need to recall in January 2015 I wrote a letter to 
the Negotiation Team. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 100 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Giving a response on the discussion between 
myself and Mr Needham from Glencore around the penalty calculations. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall if I actually mentioned the amount 
in that letter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is that letter in your bundle? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do not think I referenced it, no. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  If you were to obtain a copy of it in due course 
could you make it available to us? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I will gladly do that? 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So what was the significance of that letter? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  As part of the Negotiation Team with the 
negotiations around the fourth addendum or Cooperation Agreement I was tasked to 
engage with Mr Needham to get alignment and the same understanding on the penalty 
calculations on this Coal Supply Agreement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And that memorandum was intended to just 
provide feedback to the Negotiation Team.  It did not conclude that there was alignment 
or agreement on the penalty calculation mechanism.  It merely provided feedback and 
an update on the discussion that I had with Mr Needham. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So do I then take it that your members that is the 
Eskom side of the Negotiation Team would have been aware of that letter? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So they would have been aware of the position that you 
took in relation to the calculation of the penalties? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 101 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  As I say I cannot recall if I put it into that 
document.  I will have to check. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and finally on this issue you have explained to the 
Chair how you arrived at that amount and Chair that is the document or the 
spreadsheet at 253. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that; are we back? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the other file? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To U8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, 253 you said? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  253. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would like to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have got it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  I would like to draws some 
conclusions on this, if you do not mind Mr Opperman.  This is your spreadsheet.  
Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did you prepare it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot say, but it must have been around that 
period, February 2015 up until when this document was updated. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright and what did you do with this spreadsheet after 
you had prepared it? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 102 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall that I did anything with it.  It was 
just a calculation that I did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  [Intervenes]. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I might have discussed it with Mr Kruger.  I 
cannot. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, the point is you were not doing anything other than 
fulfilling your official functions and duties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and so it would have been a document that on the 
face of it in your view a reflection of the outcome of your functions and duties? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  During the negotiations period?  I take it that you did not 
prepare it and simply put it in your own file.  You must have done something to execute 
those functions and duties. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I will have to go and check if I shared it with 
somebody.  I cannot recall.  I cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you say yes and so on or no Mr Opperman just make sure that 
the mic can catch your words so that it is recorded. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  100 percent sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Again I would like you to reflect on that issue 
and come back to us even if it is by way of a formal affidavit.  I am interested in finding 
out what did you do with the spreadsheet after you had prepared it around 2015.  Chair 
I have dealt with the question of penalties and subject to your direction I will move on to 
the next topic. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 103 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that begins Mr Opperman from page 9 paragraph 
48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wanted to say I am still not sure about the issue that we 
discussed earlier about where Mr Opperman stands with regard to the R2.1 billion 
versus 700 and something million, but I guess we have spent more than enough time 
on it.  I will. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Read the transcript and see. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the position is, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair we are clear about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The evidence.  In other words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It matters not whether he is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It matters not whether his. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Calculations were based on a proper interpretation of 
20 
the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The point that we sought to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Through him is that he was not consulted on a matter 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 104 of 167 
 
that clearly falls within his portfolio. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well of course I guess the other point you may have been 
seeking to make is also that if he had been consulted and assuming that the relevant 
authorities sought to give due weight to his view on the amount maybe it is unlikely that 
they would have settled at the low amount on which they settled. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair and. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they might not have insisted on 2.1 billion, but at least maybe 
they would have insisted on his figure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair the [indistinct] we understand for those who will be 
called to explain to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is this that if they go for 2.1 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In July/August 2015 without even consulting with 
20 
Mr Opperman then it means that they did not do their job properly.  The result of that 
failure of duty is that you have placed Optimum into business rescue with the drastic 
consequences that that carried.  On that approach what happened to the arbitration for 
that 2.1 billion when Tegeta takes over, because once Tegeta takes over we hear 
nothing about 2.1 billion. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 105 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At the arbitration on that score. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because the only explanation they can give is that 
business rescue suspended the arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But we know that the business rescue ended in 
September 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The arbitration for 2.1 billion would have sat there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And still continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But instead of the arbitration on 2.1 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What happens is the reduction of the penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And those are the inexplicable sets of circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which we would like people to explain. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is for that reason we call Mr Opperman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We call him to interrogate that issue.  We have his 
version. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 106 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is why Chair we would simply suggest that 
there is something more than a mere miscalculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There is something more than a mere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Advancement of a claim which is not well founded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman I am going to ask you to go to page 9 and 
paragraph 48 of your statement.  You do confirm that there was a commencement of 
10 
business rescue proceedings and you know that Mr Pierce Marsden and his colleague 
were appointed as joint Business Rescue Practitioners? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did you ever deal with them in their capacity as 
Business Rescue Practitioners? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I have dealt with them once or twice, but not on 
an ongoing basis and I once attended, I think it was a creditors meeting that they 
chaired. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And I think there was a letter that I sent to them 
20 
that was addressed to them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Something like that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you aware that one of the issues they had to 
confront as Business Rescue Practitioners is the fact that Eskom withheld payment of 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 107 of 167 
 
two invoices in June and August 2016?  I mean that is a matter that falls within your 
portfolio.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The processing and payment of invoices? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you aware of that fact? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I can recall it yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Do you know why Eskom withheld that payment, 
those two payments? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  At that moment time there was a consultation with 
10 
Mr Nagar and the view was that that monies be withheld to compensate for the accrued 
penalties up to that moment in time, because Eskom’s view was that if Optimum goes 
in business rescue we will not get any monies. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So again Eskom was insisting on payment of penalties 
at that point in time? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Are you also aware that the Business Rescue 
Practitioners suspended a supply of coal to Hendrina? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes.  That happened in August, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In August 2015? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Did you deal with the Business Rescue 
Practitioners around the suspension of coal? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall exactly.  There must have been 
some engagement.  I know that the suppliers were suspended around 3 August for 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 108 of 167 
 
about three/four days. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And then it was again suspended I think around 
21 August and that continued to 3 September when they recommenced with. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  With deliveries. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All I want to understand is that this is the matter that 
also fell within your portfolio.  Did you ever deal with them on that issue? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall how we dealt with it at that moment 
in time.  It might have been communication through our legal team with them.  Surely 
10 
there was an engagement on my side to have an engagement with Optimum.  I cannot 
recall exactly if I communicated directly with them or if it was through our internal legal 
team. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  You conclude that topic around the business 
rescue status of OCM by referring to an event which I cannot locate in the evolution of 
the relation between Optimum Coal Mine and business rescue and Eskom.  I direct 
your attention to paragraph 50 on page 10 of your statement.  You say there: 
“On 17 September 2015 OCM sent a settlement proposal to 
Eskom on all outstanding matters.  I do not have a record of the 
proposal and on 19 September 2015 CDH issued a notice to 
20 
OCM that relaxed the sizing specification and suspended 
penalties on qualities.  I do not have a record of the notice 
issued by CDH.  This agreement was backdated to commence 
4 September 2015 and was only for 60 days.” 
Do you see that? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 109 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What was the effect of this arrangement, because my 
understanding is that Eskom had always insisted on compliance with coal quality, sizing 
specifications?  You have just also indicated that it insisted on withholding payment 
because of all those coal quality specification deficiencies? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why in September 2015 there is a notice from the 
attorneys of Eskom to suspend sizing specifications and penalties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I can only thing that the discussion was around 
the reinstatement of the supply.  It coincides with 4 September when the supply 
10 
reconvened.  I; and that Optimum agreed at that moment in time to say we will 
reconvene with the coal supply, but then you need to suspend these penalties.  As this 
proposal or this letter came from Cliffe Dekker and Hofmeyr which was our legal 
advisors there was obviously consultation between them and the Business Rescue 
Practitioners and they were talking and there was an agreement around this.  I think at 
that moment in time the most critical thing for us was to get the coal supply to Optimum, 
to Hendrina Power Station reinstated. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I suppose you were not consulted on this 
proposal? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall it, no. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, but if you were you would have recalled? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  For sure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And if you were consulted you would have given us 
copies of these letters? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  For sure. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 110 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So the bottom line is you were not consulted at all? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You move to the next topic and I will be fairly quick 
there, because we now understand the process for certification of coal compliance 
when it is delivered on the one hand through a conveyor belt or when it is delivered on 
the other hand through rail.  You explained that process from paragraph 51 on page 10 
and you conclude that insofar as coal from Hendrina is concerned it was delivered by a 
conveyor belt and the process for coal certification for compliance will be through 
sample testing.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja, the sample was collected through a sampler 
10 
yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  There is nothing that turns on your explanation.  
From paragraph 56 you deal with that issue and there is nothing that arises for 
purposes of asking you further questions on it unless you want to raise anything.  In 
that regard I would ask you to go to page 12 paragraph 59.  In paragraph 59 you say: 
“In hindsight it became clear that soon after 2012 refurbishment 
of the sampling plant the recorded sizing parameters of the 
coal supplied via conveyor did not meet the contract 
specification.” 
Do you see that? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did you pick up for the first time that as a matter 
of hindsight the coal delivered did not comply with sizing specifications? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It became evident at the time on 1 October when 
the crusher was switched off in the sampling plant that the issue all the time was 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 111 of 167 
 
actually related to the upgrade and the work that was done on the sampler around 2012 
that introduced these increased fines that was reported. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I just need a time that I can work it.  Is that the time you 
refer in paragraph 62? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes.  61 and 62, correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  61 and 62.  So it is around October? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  My recollection of your evidence on this score 
earlier on when we anticipated these two paragraphs was that the problem was not 
resolved fully.  You said that there was some significant improvement.  Correct? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that the problems of sizing still remained? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So that the coal quality which was delivered after 
this period still had some problem of some sort related to sizing.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I am asking you this question because we know 
that after the new owner took over it continued to deliver coal to Hendrina from the 
same mine.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and they would all things been equal still be coal 
quality problems related to sizing? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN: Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I want to understand is after the new owner took 
over did you guys look at the question of penalties coming from the same coal mine?  I 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 112 of 167 
 
am talking about the period April.  In fact let me become more precise.  I am talking 
about the period to September 2016 going forward. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes we did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And did you impose those penalties? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes we did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  I would like you to take me to your 
documentation where that happened.  I am distinguishing between two things. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Historic penalties of 2.1 billion and future penalties that 
began to apply from September 2016.  Your evidence is that you did impose penalties? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Chair I will explore that issue when we come to 
September 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I cannot pick it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I confess that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I may have been drowned in documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And forgot the bigger picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Opperman I have now concluded anything 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 113 of 167 
 
before the question of cession which is a new topic.  You deal with from page 12 
paragraph 63.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In that paragraph you talk about an internal memo dated 
29 October 2015.  Chair you will find that memo on page 258 and I would like to take 
you there if you do not mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  258? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Come on.  Is it me again? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the correct page you gave me? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I think it is; I made a mistake, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  It is GJ? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it 19? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, I am sorry.  It is my understanding, because GJO19 
is 254. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman you included this memo in your 
documentation.  Do you see that? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it seems to me that this is a request for approval by 
the Group Executive for Generation for the supply of coal from Optimum Mine for a 
specific period.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 114 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you look at paragraph 2 on page 255.  Can I ask you 
to give us some background why in October 2015 approval is required from Mr Koko 
about a short term supply for coal from Optimum Mine?  I would have thought that by 
that time there always existed a CSA between Eskom and Optimum to supply coal. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair at this moment in time I can take you to 
page 254. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The table under point number C.  What is of 
relevance is that this table chances the sizing parameters under the existing CSA for 
this period.  So one can see that the size fraction for the 0.81 where the previous 
10 
contract specification was 15 percent it is now increased to 20 percent. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Where are you reading from?  I am sorry.  I missed you. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Page 256. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  256. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  In that table. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Under quality if you go right to the bottom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It refers to the size specification on the smaller 
size 0.81 millimetre. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And it says: 
“No more than 20 percent of the coal supply will be small than 
the 0.81 millimetre.” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 115 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The existing contract specification at this moment 
in time that was 15 percent.  So in essence this memo is requesting a change in the 
quality parameters on the existing CSA for this period. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was – was it making things easier in terms of quality and to the 
detriment of Eskom. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     I think it was dealing Chair with the size fraction 
that was consistently high and above the 15% and attracting sizing penalties on an 
ongoing basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     So at this moment in time there must have been 
some engagement to say if we can change it to 20% that is something that the mine 
can achieve, because that’s the only thing that I can see that was changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So previously it was 15%? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     One five correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  15 so in which case under that regime the penalties would start 
accumulating earlier, quicker. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now no penalties will accumulate until 20% at least has been 
exceeded. 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     You know at this point what is surprising about this, 
and don’t misunderstand me or the tone of my question, I’m not blaming you but what is 
surprising about this request for approval at that point in time, is that Glencore had 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 116 of 167 
 
been requesting this shift in change of the penalty level from 15 to even 20, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     And that was rejected? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Having rejected that historic request you’re now going 
to – Eskom is seeking an approval to change that very same position it had rejected 
previous, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Why the sudden change of heart? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why the inconsistency? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Pardon me Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I’m saying Mr Maleka is asking why the inconsistency, why are 
Glencore and Tegeta treated differently by Eskom in regard to this issue? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     I cannot answer that question Chair, the 
requestor of this Ms Ayanda Nteta and I think that is the person to answer it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Alright, and this request was supported by a number of 
people and there are names are here on page 257, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     What happened to this request, was it approved? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     By the look of the signatures it was approved, 
20 
yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The final approval was Mr Koko, according to the last page of the 
memo, Ms Nteta was the requestor and Neo Cholanco was a supporter, Nkosi 
Simbuweni was a supporter, Mr Matshella Koko was the approver, okay? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 117 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     So we know that they’ve approved it and it’s for a 
short period of time and we know it was during the time when this entity was still under 
business rescue, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     I am going back to your statement, in paragraph 63 
you refer to Annexure GJ20, Chair it’s a report by a consultancy that has Eskom 
engaged I’ve read it and maybe Mr Opperman will help us about the importance of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Because it simply talks about the market analysis of 
coal all over the world and here and what could be the possible reason why Glencore 
sought a renegotiation, but I’m not too sure if it adds anything to the debate.  Mr 
Opperman how do you want us to consider this document?  
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Mr Chair I cannot recall requesting this 
document and I thought that it was of relevance to include it since this came at the 
hand of this sizing adjustment.  A similar document was requested in December 2013, a 
similar exercise was undertaken by a different company and in reality it basically made 
the same conclusion where it just talked to the impact of the markets and the different 
movements around it. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Ja, in terms of cash to cost if this document is relevant 
at all you will find the analysis done by the consultants on page 280 about the different 
mines owned by Glencore supplying coal to Eskom and what was the cash to cost 
implication of the supply to Eskom.  The bottom line is that Optimum was not the most 
expensive, correct? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 118 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     The most expensive was Spring Lake, do you see 
that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Chair I can’t take it further, I mean I will leave it and 
this you ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     I would like to take you back to your statement and 
ask you to go to paragraph 64 on page 13, you refer to Annexure GJ21 and Chair you 
will find it at page 285. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  285? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, but the real document begins at 286, I’d ask you 
to go there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Mr Opperman you will see that that’s the change of 
ownership. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     And it takes place through a cession of shares in the 
operating company that owns the mine, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes.  I want to focus on paragraph 1.2 on page 286, 
paragraph 1.2 of the approval given by the BTC consent to that change of ownership 
provides that there will be a release of the guarantee given by OCH to Eskom, you 
would know as the manager of the various power stations, especially in relation to 
Hendriena that a guarantee of performance given by a supplier it’s a useful collateral 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 119 of 167 
 
for Eskom, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     If you release the supplier from that guarantee then 
there’s a risk posed to Eskom about the performance by the supplier of his contractual 
obligations, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     So make sure that the change of ownership does not 
impact adversely on Eskom you would insist that the new owner provide a guarantee 
correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     So what paragraph 3 records and Chair I’m at page 
286, is that the condition for that cession is that Tegeta had to provide a guarantee of 
its own, is that correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, the question is – well before I put the question, 
that change of ownership was contractually recorded as between Eskom and Tegeta by 
means of an amendment to the existing CSA, and remember when the CSA was in 
operation the last of the amendments we have looked at was the third addendum. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     The addendum which constituted the amendment to 
20 
reflect the change of ownership is now called the 4th addendum, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     To be distinguished from the draft 4th addendum which 
the Board had rejected and that 4th addendum you will find it Chair from page 288. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 120 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     And for the purposes of the question that I had 
intimated but I had not yet put to you can I ask you to go to page 291, you will see 
paragraph 2.1.5.2 it says Eskom being issued with a guarantee by Tegeta on the same 
terms as the Eskom guarantee to Eskom’s satisfaction, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     So that it is part and parcel of this 4th Addendum that 
Eskom had to be given a guarantee by Tegeta to Eskom’s satisfaction, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     The Board had required that addendum be given the 
4th Addendum we have looked at provide for the contractual obligation to provide for the 
10 
guarantee and the question is was that guarantee given by Tegeta? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     According to my understand no it has not been 
given, something that I also want to mention is that I only became aware of this 4 th 
Addendum on the 8th of June 2017. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     June 20? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     17. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Okay. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   I only saw the addendum for the first time on the 
24th of July 2017, so on the 8th of June 2017 I became aware that there is a 4th 
addendum, it was in the process where we stated with the drafting of what was now the 
20 
5th addendum and in that draft document we called it the 4th addendum and then we 
were told but there already a 4th addendum, you can’t draft a 4th addendum, so that 
happened around the 8th of June 2017 and as I say the first time that I saw this 
document was on the 24th of July 2017.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, we will come back to the significance of that 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 121 of 167 
 
evidence and you do confirm, so if you can go to page 13 paragraph 67 you do confirm 
in paragraph 67 that the first time the 4th addendum was made known to you was on 
the 8th of June 2017, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     There are several issues that I would like to explore 
with you, you are aware that the 4th addendum was signed by the parties 14 months 
earlier than the date when you yourself became aware of it, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     And Mr Opperman I mean the questions relating to the 
4th addendum, the amendment of the CSA by way of a 4th addendum are matters that 
10 
fall within your portfolio. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes.  From all events it seems as if people were doing 
something about your portfolio without even telling you.     
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Why would that be the case, I mean can you think of 
any reason why you being the person in charge of whether the 4th addendum should, - 
well whether the CSA should be amended and if so whether it should be on the terms 
formulated by the addendum, what is any plausible reason that people in Eskom would 
avoid and not talk to you on that issue? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     I can only speculate Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Please do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Opperman the way he looks at me it’s as if he is saying well come 
to my rescue, why must I speculate.  I think Mr Maleka don’t force him to speculate. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Chair I – in fairness I thought I should put that 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 122 of 167 
 
question, but we have our own reasons and we don’t want to be accused of unfair 
speculation when the witness who could have helped us has come and again, but 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I think let him not speculate. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Let us not speculate but it is surprising is it not? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Very surprising. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     You are ignored on a matter falling within your 
portfolio. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Very much yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     And you say you became aware of the 4th addendum a 
10 
year and two months later, but you now confirmed that the guarantee contemplated in 
the 4th addendum was not given? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes.  Even by the time when Optimum went into a 
second business rescue, that guarantee had not been given? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     As we speak today that guarantee is not in place? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that’s when I say articulate your answers so the microphone can 
catch and record your answer Mr Opperman, I know it’s been a long day, but when you 
20 
nod the answer is not recorded. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     You are correct Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Thank you.  So Eskom has been on risk the day 
Glencore divested ownership of this mine and the day Tegeta took over this mine. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That is correct yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 123 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     I won’t ask you to speculate why. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you were kept in the dark about the 4th addendum for a long 
time, when you say this guarantee was never provided to Eskom what are the chances 
that you might not know the true position, it might be there but you have been kept in 
the dark about it as well also. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Mr Chair that is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Mr Chair that is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm, but in terms of chances you would say probably the position is 
10 
that it’s not there or you are not able to indicate in terms of what’s possible or what’s 
probable? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     I do not 100% know it is there or it is not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but in terms of your work chances are that if it was there you 
would have seen it or you are not able to go that far? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     I will not necessarily have seen it, it will be 
something that will be submitted to the fuel sourcing department because they are 
contracting these new agreements and transition things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but if you wanted to know whether it’s there you would have a 
way of finding out wouldn’t you? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     I could yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Maleka I don’t know whether you want to do anything about 
that? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you may have your other ways. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 124 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     I have ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have, okay no that’s alright. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     I will – otherwise I am going to go to that world of 
speculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     We have our own views Chair, but I think in fairness to 
Mr Opperman we will interrogate those views with other witness who was supposed to 
explain these anomalies.  Mr Opperman I would like to move then to the next phase of 
your statement which is the declaration of business rescue.  You start with the topic 
from paragraph 68, on page 13, okay, you talk about Section 54 notice, we have dealt 
10 
with Section 54 notices during the evidence of Mr Ephron, I am not going to ask you to 
repeat it.  It’s up to you, you may want to give us more information we are not aware of.  
You then move to the question of the declaration of impossibility by Eskom at page 69 
because of strike issues. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Ja, I would like to move away from it unless you think 
that is important. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    That’s fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Then you begin with the topic of an interim agreement 
at the request of Werksmans Attorneys who we know at the time they were acting for 
20 
business rescue practitioners, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   That’s correct.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Chair you will find that letter on page 300.  Mr 
Opperman that letter records the extension of the interim agreement, I assume that 
that’s the short term supply agreement that you said was recommended by Ms Nteta. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 125 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry is that the one on 302 because I don’t have a letter on 300, 
I’ve got a divider and then Annexure JG026 and then a letter at 302. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Chair do you not have JG025 which is on page 300? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, no I’m sorry I do have thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I do.      
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     So it’s a request by the lawyers of the business rescue 
practitioners to extend further that short term agreement. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, and just as a matter of clarity it is the same 
10 
agreement that was recommended by Ms Nteta? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, then you refer to JG26, Chair you will find it from 
page 301. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think that’s the one. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, and that is notice by the business rescue 
practitioner to the creditors, shareholders, and all other interested parties of Optimum to 
tell them that they are now out of business rescue.  Are you there at page 302? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes so that seems to me that that’s the end of the 
20 
commercially limping status of Optimum as a company in financial distress. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     By the look of it yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Yes, so it can trade on its own financial muscle.  Now 
what I want to ask you is this, and we will clear this with the Business Rescue 
Practitioners when they come in on  Tuesday Chair.  Do you know whether or not they 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 126 of 167 
 
had filed a Business Rescue Plan? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:    I would not know the Business Rescue Plan 
would have been shared with Cliffe Dekker & Hofmeyr at that moment in time but I 
would not know. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     You yourself would not know. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Fair enough.  They sent the same letter to other 
people of course and one of them is Mr Petrus Mazibuko who was your superior as I 
recall? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That is correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     You reported to him? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     Chair you will find that letter on page 308. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     And in it – in fact I made a mistake, I thought that it 
was sent by the Business Rescue Practitioners, far from it, that letter was sent by the 
new Chief Operating Officer of Optimum after it was taken out of business rescue. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:     Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:     It is Mr van der Merwe. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair you will find his name on page 310. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So this is a company under new management, it sends 
a letter to Mr Mazuduko confirming that it is out of business rescue, but of importance is 
what Mr van der Merwe says in the paragraph just before the escalation matrix, do you 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 127 of 167 
 
see it Mr Opperman? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do see the paragraph. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, he says in it: 
“As proposed last time we met we would like to propose the following 
modification to the pricing mechanism.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then he starts explaining the pricing mechanism 
that he proposes which is effectively an escalation to the Rand per ton of the price that 
Optimum was providing coal to Eskom, correct? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, Chair you will find the explanation of the matrix 
relating to the escalation on page 309. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’ve got it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman when you look at the table of the 
escalation Glencore when it owned this mine it made and requested Eskom to agree to 
this matrix of a price escalation, are you aware of that fact? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Eskom rejected that request. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think it was rejected Chair as part of the 4th 
20 
Addendum that was drafted at that moment in time, so yes the answer is it was rejected 
because that was terminated. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes.  Chair can I ask you to cross-reference the 
pricing mechanism requested by Mr van der Merwe on behalf of Tegeta to the request 
made by Glencore through Mr Ephron via the 4th Addendum at page 148 of Mr Ephron’s 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 128 of 167 
 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  108? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  148. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’ve got it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I’m sure you don’t have it but you are aware of it, it is 
the same cost component of running an operation, it is labour, it is diesel, it is 
electricity, other materials including engineering and electrical materials.  Those are the 
normal cost items to run a mine and Glencore requested the same adjustments in 
terms of price escalation and you do confirm that they were rejected? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, what happened to this request by Mr van der 
Merwe, did Eskom approve it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It was eventually approved as part of the 5th 
addendum yes in – I think in January 2018. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  In fact it was earlier than that, if you go to page 
312, you will see that Mr Mazibuko responds to that letter of Mr van der Merwe. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And he tells me that as far as he is concerned he agrees 
to it but he will refer to the Board for approval.  And then the approval comes via the 5 th 
addendum, correct? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I do recall that I saw the 5th addendum in your 
documentation.  Chair you will find the 5th addendum on page 327. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Mr Opperman I would like to take you to page 330.  
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 129 of 167 
 
You will see that there is a rebasing of the price to R201.46 per tonne that is a revised 
price structure? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct.  In order to apply this price 
adjusted mechanism this escalation mechanism it needs to refer to a base price and at 
this moment in time the base price on this contract still moved back to the price that 
was in the second addendum which R115.00, 115.  So in order for that price to be 
current an assessment was done and it was calculated that that is a – the most 
representative price of what the coal price would have been at that moment in time not 
escalated and then being escalated going forward based on this matrix. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it is – it is a new price but it was really setting a base 
price. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Alright thank you for that clarity.  We now know 
that there is a fifth addendum that regulates the new price arrangements.  I am now at 
page 14, paragraph 72 of your statement.  This is a memorandum sent to the 
executives of Eskom.  Can you give us some background to this memorandum?  It is on 
page 314 Chair going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  314. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you give us some background why this 
memorandum was sent to the senior executives of Eskom? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So Mr Chair at this moment in time I am taking 
you to page 315 paragraph number 7.  What was of significance is that the Hendrina 
stock days by this time has significantly reduced and were down at 25.2 days.  We 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 130 of 167 
 
were sitting in October it is just before the rainy season.  The December festive break is 
on its way when we traditionally have a road embargo period where we do not haul coal 
on the road.  And we were concerned that the stock days will drop below 20 days.  20 
Days is of significance in terms of grid code compliance within generation where power 
stations stock days need to be maintained at and the intent of this document was to 
seek approval to increase deliveries via road to Hendrina Power Station.  At this 
moment in time it was evident that Optimum could not sustain or could not meet the 
burn requirement of the power station and we realised that we – we needed to get 
some additional coal in.  At this moment in time of drafting this note Eskom were in 
financial constraints and because of this significant cost impact as the coal operations 
10 
team we felt that it is necessary to seek approval for this additional expenditure and the 
typical cost implication is listed under point number 8 where the typical cost for the coal 
that was then contracted to Hendrina on road is noted against the cost of coal at that 
moment in time from Optimum via conveyer.  Bullet point number 9 then reflects the 
additional coal cost and then the recommendation on the next page then seeks the 
support in order to bring in additional coal to Hendrina Power Station to recover the 
stock days back to around 30 days. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright Mr Opperman all you saying in short is that you 
were going to request an approval to buy coal from elsewhere than from Optimum Coal 
Mine? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja Liketh, the Liketh contract, the Liketh KK Pit 5 
contract that is mentioned here is a contract that what – at that moment was contracted 
for Hendrina.  So historically they did deliver coal to Hendrina but just in lower volumes 
because the makeup volumes was low and at this moment in time we had to 
significantly increase which were not budgeted for. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 131 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No I understand but you were going to buy from a third 
party supplier? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  But is was an already existing contract. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I see. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you are going incur substantial additional costs? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And the cost component which is an additional 
10 
cost for Eskom was in the order of R494,00 per tonne? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No Mr Maleka to – the additional cost under point 
number 9 and it is around R312,00 per tonne. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh.  Just explain to me how do you get to the figure? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So under point number  it is explained what the 
Liketh cost component is at that moment in time R494,99 per tonne that was delivered 
cost. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So that is coal and transportation included and 
then the coal cost from Optimum Hendrina at that moment in time was R182,89 so … 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you minus the one [indistinct]. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The variance is the additional part correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So the additional cost is the variance. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which is R312,00? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 132 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Now can I ask you this?  Was that approval given 
to your recollection? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes it was given the – on the next page, page 316 
the document was signed and it was signed by Mr Edward Mabolane on behalf of 
Matshela Koko as group executive generation.  So most probably at that time he was 
acting in that position.  Well he however do limit the volume. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And that is – there is this handwritten comment 
where he says that he does improve – he does approve to only import 100 kilo tonnes 
10 
and he also gives the date by when it can be done. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you read that handwritten manuscript for us I 
cannot make head or tail of it, it you could that will be great. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I will try my best. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So Mr Mabolane makes a *with a footnote where 
he said: “Approved to import a 100 kilo tonne that is a hundred thousand tonne still 
15.11.26 so that is 15 November 2016 to afford – okay I cannot decipher that but it says 
to afford and it looks like the station opportunity to either recover full supply from the 
mine or increase reclaim capacity by deploying additional plant.” 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So if I read it his approval is granted for 100 kilo 
tonnes at a certain date and then the station need to perform on two aspects which is 
either to recover the supply from the mine.  So meaning that there is something that 
gets corrected there or alternatively to get additional reclaiming infrastructure to move 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 133 of 167 
 
the coal from their coal reserves that they have. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So at that point in time we are sitting with a 
position where there is an existing CSA. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In terms of which Optimum Coal is obliged to supply 
certain maximum tonnage to Hendrina, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you request for a purchase of a shortfall to cover 
the December holiday problem.  Had you at that point in time made an analysis that 
what was supplied to Hendrina at that point in time were tonnages that were consistent 
10 
with the contractual volume that the mine had to supply.  What I want to understand is 
the shortage in the stock pile at that point in time was it because Optimum did not 
comply with its obligation to provide the tonnages under the contract?  What was the 
reason for the short? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The reason for the shortfall was the fact that 
Optimum just came out of business rescue and during the business rescue period 
Optimum basically delivered whatever they could deliver.  So even though the contract 
was 458.3 kilo tonnes per month if one goes back the actually deliveries were more 
often than not ranging between 300 and 400.  So over a period of time while Optimum 
were in business rescue the stock levels slowly depleted and at this moment in time the 
20 
significance of the risk was the upcoming rainy season as well as the December festive 
break.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No I understand.  So the short supply is attributable to 
business rescue situation of Eskom – of Optimum? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mainly yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 134 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay thank you for that.  Then you go to the next topic 
about the suspension of penalties and a second business rescue situation.  You deal 
with that topic from paragraph 73.  And I would like to take you to Annexure GJ30.  
Chair you will find Annexure GJ30 on page 317.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you see that that again it is a letter addressed to 
Mazibuko to Mr – from Mr George Van Der Merwe.  So it is Optimum Coal under new 
management speaking to Eskom.  I am going to read the second unnumbered 
paragraph on page 318 and ask you for your comments.  It reads as follows Mr 
Opperman: 
10 
“As we are all well aware that the current agreement is an onerous agreement.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What is new about this?  Glencore had already told 
Eskom about the onerous nature of this agreement. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So what has suddenly changed?  This is an old historic 
problem the mine had nothing is new.   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think the only thing that was new at this moment 
is the new management at the mine but that is it. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  And that is the point.  That Eskom is now willing 
to entertain old problems because they are raised by a new manager or a new owner.  
Anyway let us read on.   
“Due to this Glencore went into business rescue by August 
2015”. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 135 of 167 
 
That we know.  
“The factors surrounding the hardship clause in the agreement 
has not changed.” 
That we know. 
“Since the signing of the cooperation agreement inflation has 
increased two consecutive years by more than 6% even though 
the mine inflation is well documented to be more in the region of 
10 to 12% per year.  This shows that the hardship had increased 
significantly.” 
Let me read it again Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Opperman will have to come to our rescue.  Did you see that Mr 
Opperman. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like Eskom is threatening to let us stop – make us stop. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair unfortunately I cannot be in two places 
at once. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Chair we still have some time I think we should 
continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no, no we should continue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Stop and go would be the order of the day if Eskom 
20 
does not help us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No we must continue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Opperman I was reading the last sentence. 
“This shows that the hardship has increased significantly since 
then.” 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 136 of 167 
 
Alright.  Can I stop there and ask you the following questions?  We heard from the 
evidence of Mr Clinton Ephron that before Glencore accepted the final offer that was 
made by Tegeta to acquire this mine it did a due diligence you aware of that fact? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So anyone who does a DD about an asset to be 
acquired would know about these problems? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So this is nothing new you agree with that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  But what is important and I would like you to ask 
10 
us even if you go back to your records we now know that when Glencore – when 
Tegeta bought this mine the hardship arbitration was still there, it had not been 
concluded? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So what they raise here is the progression of 
hardship in the middle of an existing or subsisting arbitration. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On the very same issue of hardship, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Optimum is threatening and let me interrupt myself 
20 
– Optimum under a new management is threatening the second round of business 
rescue based on the same set and circumstances that gave rise to the first round of 
business rescue, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  What was the response of Mr Mazibuko to this 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 137 of 167 
 
letter of Mr Van Der Merwe? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I do not recall the response to that letter 
specifically and I can go and check on the records if there is something but I think the 
next annexure refers to a memo that Mr Mazibuko then sent to the Chief Procurement 
Officer on this same matter.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that memo begins at page 321.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct yes Sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see Chair that has been signed by Mr Mazibuko 
on page 324.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It was compiled and signed by him and two others also signed. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it was approved amongst others by Mr Edwin 
Mabelane and Mr Koko.   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair that signature is not Mr Koko’s signature 
that was Mr Willie Majola’s signature. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes but he signs on his behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  On his behalf. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The bottom line is that that memorandum by Mr 
20 
Mazibuko was signed. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct it is supported. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Now I would like to get your assistance on aspects 
of this document.  The subject matter is Optimum Request for Cooperation Agreement, 
you see that? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 138 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do Sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  More or less what Glencore did during its days when it 
requested for a cooperation agreement in order to look into and resolve the hardship 
clause claims and arbitration, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 1 says: 
“This memorandum aims to provide a summary on the proposals 
that Optimum shared with Eskom to consider in order to keep 
Optimum from evoking hardship provision in the contract.” 
I am sure the verb there was intended to be from invoking the hardship clause correct? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The background is given in paragraph 2, 
paragraph 3 and the financial implication of the proposal is set out in paragraph 7 on 
page 22, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And there Mr Mazibuko says to his seniors: 
“Currently the shortfall coal is delivered at approximately 500 tonne versus the 
approximate 200 tonne currently paid to Optimum.” 
I suppose this is the shortfall that you have talked about from a third party supplier? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct so at this moment in time the 
20 
additional coal that was delivered via road to make up for the balance is referred to 
here as R500 a tonne delivered cost. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  There are recommendations which are made from 
paragraph 9.1 and I am just going to ask you to go to paragraph 10. Can I ask you to 
read it out for us please? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 139 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   
“Should Eskom consider decide to implement the existing 
agreement Eskom would have to change Optimum’s shortfall to 
supply penalties in the region of R585 million.  It is Eskom’s view 
that this will probably cripple the company and put it into 
liquidation.  The next best alternative option for Eskom would 
exceed the cost of Hendrina Coal Supply.  It therefore makes 
business sense to keep Optimum afloat and supplying Eskom at 
the current terms and conditions of the contract even if the 
supply is reduced.” 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What does that mean Mr Opperman? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair I cannot really understand the first 
sentence that talks about the short supply and it talks about short supply penalties of 
the region of R585 million.  But I think the paragraph continues to say that these 
penalties need to be waived I think it is implied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Opperman.  Let us go back to the first 
sentence and see if there is a problem understanding it.  Forget about the fact that 
there are two verbs that follow each other in there, consider and decide.  Probably one 
should read it like this.  Should Eskom decide to implement the existing agreement 
Eskom would have to charge Optimum shortfall coal supply penalties in the region 
20 
R585 million.  Does that assist at all? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That does help thank you Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So I – what my deduction is at this moment in 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 140 of 167 
 
time is that if the existing agreement just carries on there is a penalty that is due for 
short supply in the region of R585 million.  It then carries on to say that – that it is 
Eskom’s view that if this penalty is applied that it will cripple the company, put it in 
liquidation and that will imply that Hendrina will not get coal supply from Optimum and 
that will have an even worst effect if I can say it like that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  In fact if you go to paragraph 9.3 on the same 
page.  You will see that the recommendation by Mr Mazibuko is that Eskom should 
reserve its right on – reserve its rights on all penalties and not deduct the same. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Correct.  In other words you say look I know there are 
10 
penalties that are accumulating but I am not going to impose them. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the idea is if you impose them then there is 
liquidation coming. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And I think it is in line Chair with the request that 
was originally made that detailed point number 5.3 of the cooperation agreement the 
then cooperation agreement with Glencore that refers to the suspension of penalties. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.   
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But the difference is this.  There Eskom said I will 
suspend the penalties pending the outcome of the negotiations. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When negotiations failed Eskom imposed those 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 141 of 167 
 
penalties. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The difference here is that Eskom at least from Mr 
Mazibuko’s recommendation as accepted amongst others by Mr Mabalane is that you 
are going to give a favourable treatment to Tegeta under new management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see you nod. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Ja if I read this point number 9.3 it does says that 
Eskom to reserve its rights on penalties so yes, correctly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It means that the penalties will not be levied. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed.  That is a favourable treatment of the same – 
arising from the same mine from the same condition simply because there is a new 
owner. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I take you to the next document which is the 
Temporary Relief Agreement you talk about it.  From paragraph 75 on page 14.  Chair 
as I have it that document will be from page 325.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got it at 326. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You see in that document Mr Mabalane records the 
extent of the relief measures extended to Optimum Coal under new management.  And 
20 
they are set out from paragraphs 1 to 3 on page 326.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do see it yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The penalties are not deducted.  The monthly supply is 
reduced to 375 tonnes, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 142 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you know that under the CSA if you short supply 
you incur the short supply penalties. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So another form of penalty which is now almost 
abandoned? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And the number one measure that I have skipped 
related to the inflation matrix which has now been escalated.  The point of clarity there 
is, is it the same escalation matrix that we have previously looked at? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes Mr Chair it is the same. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Or just a new one.  It is the same one. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It is the same. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Alright.  Were you consulted about these 
measures before they were formally communicated to the new management of 
Optimum? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I do recall being engaged by Mr Mazibuko around 
the coal burn requirements for Hendrina Power Station at that moment in time.  So, yes 
I was involved in that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Opperman I know that from paragraph 78 on 
page 14 you deal with a number of developments.  From my part I am not going to deal 
20 
with them because you have already dealt with the history of the fifth addendum as you 
reflect on it in paragraph 78 page 15.  With your permission and that of the Chair I 
would like to jump to the next event from paragraph 79 of your statement and there you 
deal with the second round of business rescue by Optimum which was initiated on 
19 February 2018.  Correct? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 143 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You refer to the relevant CIPC Documents from page 
345.  Chair you will see the documentation that is required by the Commissioner of 
Intellectual Property from page 345 and this is your voluntary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have I got it? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is a voluntary business rescue proceedings initiated by 
the Directors of Optimum Coal.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  By their resolution.  You will see the resolution appear 
on page 346 and the explanatory sworn statement Chair begins at page 348. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What begins at 348? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The explanatory grounds for the resolution to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Initiate voluntary business rescue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the contention of financial distress is explained from 
page 350.  Mr Opperman I am sure you have looked at the grounds for initiating 
business rescue proceedings as set out in this explanatory sworn statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it Mr Opperman? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you there? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I am here, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I have looked at this and the grounds for initiating 
business rescue proceedings are unrelated to the hardship that was brought to your 
attention by Optimum Coal.  In fact they relate to the fact that several banking 
institutions had closed the accounts of Tegeta? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 144 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know whether Optimum Coal Mine had its own 
account separate from the accounts of Tegeta, Oakbay and other associated 
companies? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair I know that the banking details had to be 
cancelled on the transition of the sale between Glencore and Tegeta and that went into 
a Bank of Baroda account initially and then I think at some stage it changed to a 
Nedbank account.  So my interpretation from that was that it is not an Optimum 
account.  It was a Tegeta account. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It was a Tegeta account? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  So for that reason this company went into 
business rescue and new Business Rescue Practitioners were appointed? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Do you know them?  Have you dealt with them 
before? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I have met them and I have dealt with them a 
couple of times. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  I am now going to go to the new topic, but 
before I go there I would like to put some concluding proposition to you and ask for your 
20 
reaction if the Chair would permit me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are permitted Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman it is quite clear from what we have 
discussed.  It is quite clear from the change of ownership that once set of owners were 
treated fundamentally different to another set of owners by Eskom.  Do you agree? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 145 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I agree. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You also agree that because of that difference of 
treatment the one set of owners which is Glencore was forced to take the radical 
decision of declaring a hardship which led to an arbitration.  Do you also agree that as 
a result of that difference in treatment Glencore had to put Optimum Coal Mine into a 
business rescue? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I agree Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and do you also agree that in regard to the new 
owner Eskom extended favourable treatment totally different to that of Glencore.  In 
that context I would like you to comment on the following.  One, do you agree that 
10 
Eskom accommodated the financial and operating difficulties that Optimum experienced 
after Tegeta took over? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Definitely yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All of these difficulties which related to Optimum Coal 
Mine were clearly foreseeable when Tegeta took over that mine.  They were not new.  
In fact they were a continuation of the old problem. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I would like to go to the next topic which is Arnot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I hope to be quick, because they provide a useful 
20 
context to the prepayment, the R659 million prepayment that Mr Nagar talked about in 
detail on Tuesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You begin with the topic from paragraph 80 and in 
paragraph 81 you record that: 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 146 of 167 
 
“The primary supplier of coal to Arnot was Exxaro.” 
Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and it did so in terms of a long term Coal Supply 
Agreement which was a Cost Plus type of agreement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Do you know when then the agreement between 
Eskom and Exxaro came to an end? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I am not 100 percent sure but it was in 
December 2015.  I am not sure of the exact date. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  It seems to me that it was because of the 
termination of that Exxaro Agreement that Eskom decided to go into short term supply 
agreement with Tegeta and you begin to explore the first agreement from paragraph 82 
on page 16.  That short supply agreement came into being from 16 January 2016.  
Correct?  Chair you will find it on page 353. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I have it that it came into existence on 
13 January and that it is as per paragraph 2 on page 354. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I found it.  Mr Opperman you were making some point while I 
was looking for page 35. 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair Mr Maleka indicated that it commenced on 
16 January and I just clarified to say that based on point number two it seems that it 
commenced on13 January. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 147 of 167 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Alright.  The coal which Tegeta was going to 
supply to Arnot comes from Optimum Coal Mine.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I do not know the coal specifications of Arnot, but did 
that coal meet the specifications of Arnot? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair the coal that came from Optimum? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes it had. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and it was going to be delivered via 
transportation? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes, via road trucks. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in paragraph 7.1 on page 356 you will see that the 
prices is expressed in terms of gigajoules as R20,41 per gigajoules.  Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  If you use your expertise what will be the Rand per ton 
conversion of that price? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The conversion from Rand per gigajoule to Rand 
per ton one simply just multiplies it by the calorific value.  So it will be that value of 
24,01 multiplied by 20.41. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What does it give you? 
20 
MS KATE HOFMEYR:  [Indistinct]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  [Indistinct]. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I need to clarify that the calorific value recorded in 
that quality table at the top. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 148 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Is on air freight basis.  It is not as received basis 
and normally the price is recorded in as received.  So if one just continues reading that 
paragraph it will say: 
“It is R20,41 per gigajoules on an as received basis excluding 
VAT.” 
So that 24.01 which is air freight that figure needs to reduce slightly, but I think one is 
just looking for a ballpark figure.  So if we call it 23.95 or something like that times 
20.41 will give a Rand per ton. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Price. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The mathematics that Ms Hofmeyr comes down to on 
that method of calculation suggests that it is R488,58 per ton. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That sounds more or less correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Maleka it looks Ms Hofmeyr is very good with figures. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS KATE HOFMEYR:  I calculate it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That same coal if it were to be supplied to Hendrina it 
will be far less in terms of price per tonnage.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes Chair it will be.  What needs to be noted 
20 
however is that it is a different quality parameter which does make a difference and 
then I just looked in my records the January 2016 price was actually R469,50. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  400? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  469,50. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you for that detail.  We know that that agreement 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 149 of 167 
 
was extended later on for a further period of five months.  Correct?  You will find the 
extension in Annexure GJ36 and Chair you will find GJ36 on page 361. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I found it. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair can I just clarify something? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think this initial extension was only for three 
months.  It was only for February, March and April not five months. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, it was for three months.  You mean the extension at 
GJ36? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct.  If one goes to page 382 it has got 
the contract coal supply schedule and in there one can see that the volumes were 
planned for February 2016, March and April 2016 for a total of 500 000 tons and 11.5 
million gigajoules. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Then there is something wrong about your 
statement. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I notice that as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So can we change five months in paragraph 83 to 
three months? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Please. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the paragraph in the statement again? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Page 16 paragraph 83. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:   
CHAIRPERSON:  So we cross out three and insert five? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 150 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair can I maybe just assist?  Paragraph 83. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Reads that the contract with Tegeta was extended 
for a further three months in February.  So in February it was extended for three 
months.  It was February, March, April and then again it was extended for another five 
months in May. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  For May, June, July, August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, we should simply add. 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So it reads fine.  It reads fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we do not change anything in paragraph 83? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So we do not change anything? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No we do not need to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Chair nothing much turns on the terms of the 
extension.  I have looked at them.  Again subject to further guidance from Mr Opperman 
the price is the same?  Do you confirm? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and then you say something in paragraph 85 on 
page 16.  If I may read it aloud?  You say: 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 151 of 167 
 
“My concern at the time and as the Contract Manager 
responsible for Hendrina Power Station was that OCM could 
not supply sufficient coal to Hendrina Power Station as was 
required, but it is supplying coal to Arnot Power Station through 
a contract with Tegeta during the period January 2016 to 
September 2016.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you refer to GJ37 which is at page 414. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that the term of that further extension 
Mr Opperman is set out on page 417 paragraph 8.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So your concern as far as I understand it articulated in 
paragraph 85 is that there were these short term agreements extended from time to 
time by [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are referring to paragraph 4 of this agreement under which there 
is a reference to Clause 8? 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So Chair the [indistinct] from January 2016 to at least 
September 2016 there were short term supply agreements concluded between Tegeta 
and Eskom to lift coal from Optimum Coal Mine to supply Arnot.  When at the same 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 152 of 167 
 
time for that period Optimum could not supply sufficient coal to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To Hendrina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hendrina. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Mr Opperman says he had some concerns in that 
regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He articulates the concern in paragraph 85.  Do you see 
10 
that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman there must be a reason why you were 
concerned and I suggest to you that one of the reasons related to the price of coal 
which Tegeta would fetch by supplying to Arnot instead of supplying to Hendrina? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So Eskom allows the same supplier who has a 
contractual obligation on a long term agreement to choose where it will get higher 
prices for the same coal.  Do you agree? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes that is correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually would it be correct Mr Opperman to say in regard to exactly 
that point that Eskom ought not to have allowed Tegeta to supply coal to Arnot when it 
could supply coal sufficiently to Hendrina? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I think I need to put context to it. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 153 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, do. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  And I want to make reference just too where 
Hendrina was at that moment in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So if we go back to February 2016 the Hendrina 
stock base was very high.  The stock base was around 52 days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Which is abnormally high for Hendrina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  However during that period in time if one looked 
10 
at the burn that the station was burning and for February itself it was fine, but from 
March onwards we see that the volumes that Optimum delivered versus what the 
station is burning there is a slight shortfall which in principle is not a big problem if you 
have high inventory levels which we had at this moment in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  But what we have, what I have seen is that where 
we started at 52 days in January at the end of this period in September when these 
short term agreement ended to Arnot the Hendrina stock based ended a 29 days.  So it 
was very clear that the coal that was supposed to go to Hendrina did not go to 
Hendrina, because we had to use our inventory.  So the 29 days is still not that of a big 
20 
concern.  It is manageable, but what I wanted to try and bring across with this 
statement was to say that during this period when Optimum was supplying coal to Arnot 
it was clear that the coal supply to Hendrina Power Station reduced. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that last statement. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 154 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was clear. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It was clear that the coal supply to Hendrina 
Power Station reduced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  So they did not meet the burn requirement on a 
month to month basis from January to September 2016.  We; it was not a huge risk, 
because we had high inventory levels, but I just wanted to bring that across that the 
Arnot deliveries were made at the cost of coal supply going to Hendrina.  I think the 
more important is what Mr Maleka has touched on was the one end you are sitting with 
10 
a cost, with Rand per ton around R470 versus a price on the other hand which was 
around R200.  So that is a huge difference.  So one could argue why not take the 
additional coal under the Hendrina Agreement at the Hendrina price. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed and my understanding of your CSA with 
Optimum allowed you to take even stock more than the minimum or the maximum in 
that case.  You had the option to over buy and that option if you exercised it would have 
helped Eskom to reduce the cost of buying directly from Tegeta to supply to Arnot. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It could have been possible Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  However what is important to note is that the coal 
20 
that went to Arnot was of a higher grade than the coal that went to Hendrina Power 
Station.  So just buying the Hendrina speckle at R200 a ton will most probably not, 
would have been accepted by Arnot as a delivery, because the coal that went from 
Optimum Colliery to Arnot was the portion of the coal that they actually allocated to their 
export business.  So they were making that export coal available to actually take that to 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 155 of 167 
 
Arnot. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, let us not go there.  Please I am sorry to interrupt 
you.  We have undisputed evidence of Mr Ephron about when they closed the export 
market.  You are aware of that date? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So there was no export market for Hendrina at that 
point in time? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  In fact what was existing is that at that point in time 
when this supply directly by Tegeta from Optimum Coal Mine to Arnot you had relaxed 
10 
the sizing specifications for the benefit of Tegeta.  Correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  At Hendrina? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So it is the same coal with a relaxed specification 
going to a different mine at a higher price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you answer Mr Opperman you were saying something 
and Mr Maleka said let us not go there.  Now some evidence had been heard by this 
Commission from other witnesses you mentioned that does not that is not intended to 
suppress your evidence in case you have knowledge of something that might be in 
20 
conflict with what another witness says.  So if it is something that you have personal 
knowledge on and you are able to say it even if another witness has said something 
else you can say it.  So I just do not want. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You to have any perception that maybe you are not allowed to say 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 156 of 167 
 
something just because another witness said something else.  He did intend to say that. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you can go back to his question.  Mr Maleka I think you did put a 
question. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am looking at the statement of Mr Ephron and Chair for 
your notes you can record that it is at page 5 paragraph 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And he elaborated on this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When explained how they close an open [indistinct] 
because of the decline in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The spot price of coal in the export market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  I just wanted to make sure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And again Mr Opperman that is not new information to 
you, because you have referenced that report by what is the name of that consulting 
20 
company again?  Meridian. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Meridian. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  They talk about the export market. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The decline and when Glencore stopped exporting in 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 157 of 167 
 
regard to at least this mine, Optimum Coal Mine.  The undisputed evidence, you can 
dispute it if you want to but as far as we know the owners of the mine have told the 
Chairperson that they closed the export market around 2012.  Is your information 
different? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I would rather reserve my comment on that 
since the owner of the mine made a comment on it I will just be talking around my 
understanding on the processing plant and how it works, which in my view afforded an 
opportunity to get a higher grade coal spec out of that same plant, the plant that was 
currently in operation, but let me rather not talk about it, let the specialists talk about it 
around their own mine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There’s a last topic that I would like to explore with you 
and it begins at page 86, sorry paragraph 86 on page 16.  You say in that paragraph 
during my interview with the Hawks I was shown a Primary Energy Division Supplier 
Payment Control form issued to Tegeta for prepayment in the amount of R578.5million 
for Arnot and supported by invoices, so you mention them there, do you see that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It seems to me that you acquired knowledge of these 
things for the first time when the Hawks show you these documents, is that a fair 
reading of your statement? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair that is not so, I do not keep records of these 
payment control sheets, just in my line of work these control sheets I do sign them, it 
was not the first time that I see it, but I do not keep record of them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No I understand, so when did you get to know that there 
was this prepayment made by Eskom to Tegeta? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 158 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I got to know about it on the 3rd of May Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  3rd of May which year? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  2016. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  2016? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, we know that the prepayment was made around 
the 13th of April 2016, correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I think it was made on the 18th of April. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Of April? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Let’s work with the date that you have. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I’m just reading from the payment sheet so I’m 
just reading the date that’s on it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair we will for now just work with the date of Mr 
Opperman, our date is totally different for obvious reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But let’s work with the 18th of April.  So you become 
aware of that prepayment a month after it had been made. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and again the basis of that prepayment was a 
20 
prepayment agreement concluded between Eskom and Tegeta for the supply of coal to 
Arnot which Tegeta gets from Optimum Coal Mine. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So effectively this was an extension of the 
previous short-term agreement we have talked about? 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 159 of 167 
 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Were you aware of the prepayment agreement that 
sought to establish the legal basis for this prepayment? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Not at all Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did you become aware for the first time of that 
prepayment agreement? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I first became aware of it Chair on the 5th of May 
when I was handed the payment sheet for signature, for my signature and in my view 
payment processing and on that date I requested supporting documentation.  Initially 
when the management accountant brought me the payment back I immediately went to 
10 
Mr Mazibuko and I said to him that I don’t carry any knowledge of this, how do we need 
to deal with it, we had a look at it and we agreed that we need supporting 
documentation.  The supporting documentation was provided, after which we signed it 
off and basically my signing on that control sheet was basically as Mr Nagar, as 
indicated to move the funds from the then purchase order that was used under the 
Brakfontein contract to the purchase order under the Optimum order to get the Arnot 
contract. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair the same problems that arose with Mr Nagar, I 
think they are now unravelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From a different perspective, but the simple point is this 
that someone again usurp your functions and duties to go and execute a prepayment 
agreement without even talking to you. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is there any reason why or any reason that you can 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 160 of 167 
 
favour to the Chairperson why someone would take over your functions and duties 
without talking to you on such a fundamental matter relating to prepayment, advance 
payment for coal stock which you have not yet received. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Maleka, Chair, I can’t provide an answer for it, 
I will just speculate, I ... 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But is it not a matter of concern to you? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  It is a matter of concern. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did you ask Mr Nagar, did you ask Mr Mazibuko when 
they come to you a month later in May and say please authorise payment, did you ask 
them but why are you taking over my line function and duty? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I did not ask them that, what I did ask them 
is at the time when I had to sign the transfer of these funds between two different 
accounts I was extremely reluctant to sign this document and that’s why I immediately 
went to Mr Mazibuko and said to him that we need to get supporting documents.  It was 
at that point in time that the Minutes of the Board decision was provided and I think the 
position just is that if the Board made the decision then surely I can’t stand in their way.  
At least by that time we also realised that the payment were done, the accountant told 
me that the payment was done, so ... 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So you are formulating paperwork to cover your tracks 
after the fact of payment? 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Not covering my tracks sir, with respect. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, well explain it to me, why are you doing things after 
the fact? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The reason why I signed this document was 
because the monies had to be transferred out of the Brakfontein account into the 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 161 of 167 
 
Optimum account and that is the reason why this was signed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that’s the point Mr Opperman, that you used a 
totally different contract number to rectify at best for you a prepayment for a totally 
different contract. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Sir with all respect Chair I never used that 
different contract number to process the payment, the payment was processed by 
somebody else, without my knowledge again an order number that I created, that I 
need to admit, because the order numbers gets created quarterly, so I did create that 
order number but I never used the wrong order number to process that payment. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   No, no, no I am asking you this because you are the 
10 
best person to help us now.  At that point in time when you begin the paperwork the 
payment had been made on your version? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The paperwork repeats the mistake which Mr Nagar has 
told us about, you use the Brakfontein contract in order to do the paperwork? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No that is wrong. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, explain that? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  At this moment in time when I did this transaction 
there was no order number for this activity, there was a payment made under the 
Brakfontein contract, so that payment, the incorrect account was used to make that 
20 
prepayment so at this moment in time when this document came to me and I had to 
transfer the funds under the correct contract I had to go into our accounting system, 
into our SAP system and create a purchase order in order for this to take effect and that 
is also the document that’s attached, that’s one my annexures. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand and so I go back to my question, payment 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 162 of 167 
 
had been done under a wrong contract number. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You now do the paperwork to rectify the situation.  
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is after the fact? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair I think I have explored all the questions that I 
wanted to put to Mr Opperman.  Mr Opperman the rest of the things they talk about, a 
new CSA, I’m not going to raise those issues with you, unless you want to talk to them, 
these are the matters that begin at page 88, sorry paragraph 88 on page 17 up to the 
10 
end of your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he is asking whether you have anything that you want to say 
in regard to those paragraphs because from his side he doesn’t think he wants to ask 
you any questions about what you say in those paragraphs. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I’m fine, thank you very much. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   You are fine.  Last question Mr Opperman, what is the 
lesson that you yourself have learnt from all of this, that you can share with us so that 
the Chairperson has the comfort of your evidence when he considers making 
recommendations.  You can think carefully on that question and if you decide to answer 
it please answer it on a considered basis via a supplementary affidavit. 
20 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said Mr Opperman when you were required to sign in regard to 
this payment, this prepayment, you were reluctant, why were you reluctant?  What 
made you reluctant? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair I was initially only handed a cover, a front 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 163 of 167 
 
page with an invoice and had to sign that, when I sign invoices it always has supporting 
documentation.  The fact that this was a prepayment amount obviously made it different 
so you will not have quality sheets and payment calculation sheets and maybe 
supporting documentation out of the contract and so, but for me signing of this 
significant big amount on two documents made me very reluctant and it was at that 
point then that the Board Minutes were presented and all those approving and 
supporting documents and once that was attached and Mr Mazibuko and myself read 
through it we decided that we will sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what was before you at that time was there any reference 
to this payment being a pre-payment, in other words the documentation that you had in 
10 
front of you at that time did it reflect that this was a prepayment? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair no it did not reflect that it was a 
prepayment, if one look at the invoice it’s a normal invoice with volumes on it, but me 
being responsible for this contract I knew that there was not such payment like this due, 
so I knew that this payment is out of the ordinary, that I did not know yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, is that part of what made you reluctant or not really? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so you knew that there were no services or there was no coal 
that had been provided for which this was payment? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is correct yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that worried you. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the documentation that was given to you after you asked for 
more documentation what documentation was it again? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair it’s the documentation that’s currently 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 164 of 167 
 
attached to this document so it was an extract of the shareholders and Tegeta 
exploration meeting that was held where the decision was made for this prepayment 
and how the coal will be supplied to recover it as well as the minutes or the extract from 
the minutes that was from Board teleconference that was held on the 11 th of April 
approving this prepayment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And up to that point or rather was it – or how often did you at Eskom 
within your portfolio did you have to deal with prepayments, how regular was that, or 
how regular is, in the sense of how often would it happen that you come across a 
situation where prepayment had to be made? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Chair in my nine and a half years in this capacity 
10 
this was the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was the first time? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And after that has there been another one? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And obviously you were concerned that there was something 
irregular about this, or not really?   
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  The moment that I ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there were no services that had been granted, that had 
been given to Eskom and there were no, there was no coal grant given to Eskom for 
20 
which this was payment and this is something that had never happened in your entire 
time when you were working at Eskom that should have worried you as this is 
something that is probably not regular and not correct? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Definitely, it is not regular and it did worry me, but 
as I say I sign multiple payments like this on a monthly basis, this was the first time that 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 165 of 167 
 
I had and it really did make me feel very uncomfortable, that’s why I immediately went 
and engaged my senior on it and consulted with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you were provided with further documentation that further 
documentation did not remove the fact that no goods or services had been provided to 
Eskom for which this was payment isn’t it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That remained to be the – that remained the position? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And still it was a first time after many years that you are working at 
Eskom that this was, you had been asked to do this? 
10 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you concerned in any way that you might by signing you might 
be allowing yourself to be party to something irregular? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Chair when I read the agreement that was 
attached to the payment pack I could see that Eskom will get the value for that 
prepayment, it was obviously something that I would have to manage because it now 
meant that there was a payment made up front and we will now get the coal delivered 
and I sort of will work on a rebate account the whole time until the whole money has 
been recovered, so it was definitely doing things back to front, but when I read the 
agreement I felt comfortable that we will get the value for what was paid.  Yes it is 
20 
putting trust in people delivering, and maybe one could question that, but ja, that’s it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you gave, if you were party to a transaction in terms of which a 
supplier was to be given a prepayment of this size and something happened and then 
Eskom didn’t get any value then there would be a problem isn’t it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Yes I think there would have been yes. 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 166 of 167 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  There would be a problem and as a manager it would be part of your 
duties to look after the interest of Eskom in that kind of situation to say you don’t want 
Eskom to be put at great risk for that kind of situation isn’t it? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  For sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but did you raise with your – the person senior to you that you 
talked about it to say but why should I sign this thing because there seems to be 
something irregular here and so on, did you put your concern at that level? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I did, I definitely did it, I did it the moment that I 
got the payment pack for approval, normally I will just sit at my desk, I will work through 
the normal documentation, sign it, it will go to my senior and he will sign it, and this day 
10 
when it happened I immediately took the whole pack and I went to his office and I 
immediately discussed it with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did he say about this concern? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  I cannot recall what he said, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can’t recall, and what was is name again? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mr Petros Mazibuko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, Mazibuko? 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  Mazibuko yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair thank you, Chair it is almost half past.  Mr 
20 
Opperman is not done yet.  Ms Hofmeyr will deal with the rest of his evidence relating 
to Brakfontein on Monday.   
CHAIRPERSON:  On Monday, okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, we propose to start at nine thirty again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think on – except on Wednesday when we will start at nine every 
08 MARCH 2019 – DAY 62 
 
Page 167 of 167 
 
day next week we will start at nine thirty and we will finish at four thirty.  Going forward 
we might increase that time to starting at nine and finishing at five because there is still 
a lot of work to be done. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so Mr Opperman we will come back on Monday. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Opperman you are aware that you have to finish the 
Brakfontein leg of your testimony. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it’s on Monday. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  That is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay on Monday we will start at nine thirty. 
MR GERT JACOBUS OPPERMAN:  100%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, so we are going to adjourn for today and we will resume on
