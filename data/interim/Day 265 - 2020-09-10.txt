PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 10 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning – morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am wondering why I have all the four 
files at the same time so – yes are you ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson we are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We starting a little late we will try and 
make up for the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairperson the witness for this 
morning is Ms Venete Klein.  She has indicated that she is 
comfortable taking the oath as opposed to the affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS KLEIN:  Venete Klein. 
REGISTRAR:  Any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
20 
MS KLEIN:  None at all. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 4 of 240 
 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MS KLEIN:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Seleka the … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Should I explain to the DC – to the 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no the – the arrangements with the 
files does cause some confusion so I looked at Ms Klein’s 
statement in front of me in the file that was put up and I 
10 
realised it was very clean. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it could not be the one that I had read 
because. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one I had read I had made some 
notes on it.  So I had to ask them to give me the file that 
has got the one on which I made notes.  So it turns out 
that that one is in Mr Tsotsi’s bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – but it is okay.  I just wanted to 
have the one which has got my notes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I beg your pardon Chair. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 5 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you may proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson Ms Klein 
will be touching mainly on the aspect regarding the 
suspension of the executives, the exit negotiations with the 
executives.  There is a portion relating to the secondment 
of Mr Molefe.  The extension of that secondment.  The 
permanent placement of Mr Molefe that also features the – 
or rather in which he also features and hopefully we will 
touch on that as well.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Klein thank you for assisting the 
commission. It is a fact finding inquiry.  There are no 
findings of guilt or not guilt.  I will ask you to please 
address the Chairperson when you are – answer to the 
questions and you have the bundle before you.  Let me just 
confirm.  Chairperson the bundles we are using to place it 
on record is Eskom Bundle 02.  Exhibit… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Eskom Bundle 02. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is the bundle we will be using. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Exhibit  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Klein you have that bundle in front 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 6 of 240 
 
of you.  It will have an index that indicates the – what is 
contained in the file.  The first of those documents is your 
affidavit to this commission and attached to the affidavit is 
your statement to the Hawks wherein you deal I believe 
with 
the 
secondment 
of 
Mr 
Molefe 
and 
permanent 
placement.  In the interest of time Ms Klein if you may go 
to page 2 of the documents in the bundle with the page 
numbering, I will be referring to are the page numbers in 
red the top right hand corner.  Do you confirm to the 
Chairperson that you were one of the Board Members 
10 
appointed in December 2014.  Will you confirm? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes Chair I confirm that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  And that you were serving 
on Eskom Board for the first time in – in respect of that 
appointment? 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Ms Klein try and raise your voice 
please. 
MS KLEIN:  Alright I will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or – ja – speak closer to the microphone. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you – if you speak softly Ms Klein Mr 
Seleka speaks very softly so I will be the only one 
speaking aloud in this hall. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 7 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  I hear you Chair I will try.  Is that better? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He is a gentleman Chair.  Ms Klein the 
affidavit then deals with your – the introduction, your 
profession in paragraph 3.  That you are – is it a 
profession or is it a career?   
“I was a Chartered Director CDSA and have 
graduated 
from 
various 
international 
executive 
programs 
including 
senior 
executive programs at Harvard University 
10 
and 
executive 
development 
program.  
Executive development program at the New 
York School in New York.  In addition, I hold 
several 
international 
qualifications 
from 
MIT, INSEAD, IMD and Wits.” 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that correct?  And you have served 
as an executive director, a non-executive director of 
various boards.  Until recently – well various boards 
including Barclays Group LTD, the Reserve Bank and Old 
20 
Mutual Health.  Until recently you served as Chairperson of 
the Institute of Directors South Africa. 
MS KLEIN:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that the – you know you are one of 
the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants is it 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 8 of 240 
 
the equivalent of such body? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes it is.  Look Chair we have many directors 
in South Africa and the Institute of Directors does all of the 
training for directors in South Africa.  Not everybody is a 
member but obviously most directors choose to become 
members so that they can get some form of qualification 
and certainly the training in order to serve. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Does it deal with ethical issues relating 
to directors? 
MS KLEIN:  Very definitely that is one of the biggest things 
10 
it is focused on as a director. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you would be au fait on issues 
relating to ethics and professionalism of directors. 
MS KLEIN:  Correct Sir.  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That would be both in the private and 
the public sector? 
MS KLEIN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes – ja you carry on on other aspects 
of your achievements which I will not go into.  Let us deal 
with – tell the Chairperson about how your appointment on 
20 
the Eskom Board came about? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson there was an advert run in the 
paper for various of the departments companies.  SAA I 
remember was one.  Eskom was one etcetera.  And I was 
then asked or nominated – I was asked whether I would 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 9 of 240 
 
serve and I then agreed that I would serve and I know my 
nomination was signed off by Mr Lionel Adendorf.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who asked you? 
MS KLEIN:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who asked you if you would be… 
MS KLEIN:  Lionel Adendorf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr? 
MS KLEIN:  Lionel Adendorf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KLEIN:  Who I had known from – he was the Head of 
10 
Communications for the first Minister of Women’s Children 
and Disabled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes he was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was within government. 
MS KLEIN:    I knew him from there. Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was within government? 
MS KLEIN:  He was but I think at the time when he asked 
me he was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  He was not in government at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did you know whether he had any 
connections with the – with Eskom or anybody connected 
with Eskom?  Why was he interested in… 
MS KLEIN:  No not to my knowledge.  I remember 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 10 of 240 
 
Chairperson that I had also seen the advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  You know and I had actually oddly enough 
always said in private sector because that is where I used 
to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS 
KLEIN:  That I would never 
want to serve in 
government 
because 
of 
what 
I 
imagined 
was 
the 
complexity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  And it was in a discussion that he just said to 
me you know is this not something because remember – I – 
what maybe did not come out here I had actually retired 
from running the Retail Bank of ABSA a couple of years 
prior.  So I had a bit of capacity.  I had time on my hands 
and that is when the discussion came up.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  And I had seen it and I had no objection at the 
time.  I thought that may be a good idea for me to serve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson the name appears on page 
3 paragraph 6 of Mr Lionel Ricardo Adendorf.  Ms Klein if – 
if this – if there was an advert does the advert call for 
people to be nominated or for people to apply? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 11 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson to the best of my understanding it 
calls for people to be nominated.  I think it is put out in the 
public space to see who are – you know who interest – who 
may be interested.  And then I think if you are interested 
you got to online and get a nomination form.  I think that is 
how it worked if I – if my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is fine. 
MS KLEIN:  Serves me well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So did you follow that process? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To go online. 
MS KLEIN:  Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And completed the nomination form? 
MS KLEIN:  Ja.  Yes Chairperson sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now you were here yesterday because 
you were scheduled to testify yesterday but you could not. 
MS KLEIN:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We had Mr Tsotsi here yesterday.  You 
saw the reference made to the Fundudzi Report. 
MS KLEIN:  Correct yes Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh Chairperson I got a note that the 
transcribers are unable to hear Ms Klein. 
MS KLEIN:  Okay I got to speak either louder or sit closer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I think just drop the microphone. 
MS KLEIN:  Oh okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 12 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  A little bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I am surprised they cannot hear 
her but they do hear you.  But I think I have come to 
accept that you have a soft voice and it is difficult.  I think 
for the whole week I have been saying please raise your 
voice but I think that is just how your voice is – it is soft.  
You – but obviously they do hear you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a sign of change Chair that I have 
listened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  No that is fine.  Let us all 
10 
try to – well I guess I do not have to try to be loud enough 
for everybody to hear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Ms Klein you saw the reference 
being made to the Fundudzi Report. 
MS KLEIN:  I did Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And how an email address infoportal1 
was used to circulate a list of names for people to be 
appointed on the board and sub-committees in particular.  
20 
Do you have any knowledge of your name having formed 
part of that list? 
MS KLEIN:  I would have been very surprised.  I do not 
know who infoportal is and if you tell me my name was on 
it I would be surprised because that was not the process 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 13 of 240 
 
that I understood that the department followed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What would be your response you 
would have been aware that the December 2014 Board of 
Eskom has been referred to as the Gupta Board.  What 
would you tell the Chairperson? 
MS KLEIN:  Very uncomfortable to have my name there 
that is all I can say to you Chairperson.  Can I maybe just 
add on something? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Please do. 
MS KLEIN:  In fact, more uncomfortable because I think in 
10 
Mr Tsotsi’s response to the Chair yesterday I think Chair 
you gave him a little bit of latitude to express how he felt.  
And Mr Tsotsi then alluded to some organogram that had 
appeared 
in 
the 
paper 
some 
years 
ago 
connecting 
everybody to everybody else.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
MS KLEIN:  You know to the Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think it… 
20 
MS KLEIN:  So specifically you know who was connected 
to the Gupta’s? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS KLEIN:  And I think what was uncomfortable for me 
specifically is that on that organogram I am connected to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 14 of 240 
 
the then Minister of – I am not sure what Minister it was 
but it was Minister Van Rooyen who I had never met.  I do 
not know him, never met Minister Van Rooyen.  I think the 
– the closest that you want to come in terms of looking at 
the organogram I felt a little more insulted than anything 
else was that somebody who works for – who worked as an 
advisor for Minister Van Rooyen at the time was a 
gentleman by the name of Ian Whitley who worked for me 
at the bank a couple of levels down and here I was being 
put down as somebody connected to Minister Van Rooyen 
10 
and he has got an advisor – I was very uncomfortable by – 
so your question about being put in as a Gupta Board 
Member really did not feel good for me at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MS KLEIN:  I am sorry to bring that in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  But are you saying 
that you – you are aware of the – of the report or article 
that Mr Tsotsi was talking about where as you say there 
was enough [00:18:54]. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: You knew – you had been aware of that? 
MS KLEIN:  No, no absolutely and I am just expressing a 
discomfort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  To add onto how do I feel about being – I do 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 15 of 240 
 
not know if it is called the Gupta – did you say Gupta 
appointee Sir I am not sure? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Gupta Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KLEIN:  Gupta Board.  Okay.  Sorry I kind of went both 
ways with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we understand the board was 
appointed that the board on which you served in – at 
10 
Eskom was appointed effective 11 December 2014. 
MS KLEIN:  I think that is correct yes Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think you say that. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At paragraph 7 of your affidavit. 
MS KLEIN:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you then go through an induction 
which you deal with it on page 6, paragraph 23 of your 
affidavit.  A Board Induction Meeting held on 16 January 
2015.  You see that? 
20 
MS KLEIN:  Yes Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is in January 2015. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now tell the Chairperson you would 
have heard the evidence about the first board meeting 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 16 of 240 
 
scheduled for the 26 February 2015 and that that board 
meeting did not take place.  What reasons – were you 
aware of that? 
MS KLEIN:  I was aware that it was not taking place and I 
think I even put into evidence my discomfort at the time but 
Chair if I may just – can I just step back from there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  Chair I keep on hearing that this was the first 
board meeting in fact I heard yesterday too that there was 
the first board meeting in – in March the 11 t h and I have 
10 
heard quite a lot about you know we did not know the 
executives and how could we make decisions etcetera.  
Chair that is not true.  The first meeting was in January 
and we had the board induction which was another two 
days and these things can be verified.  In fact, you asked 
and Chair I was supposed to speak yesterday so I suppose 
it was good I was here to listen to Mr Tsotsi’s evidence.  
Mr Tsotsi shared with me on the 16 January at the first 
board meeting which sub-committees we were going to be 
on.  I remember you asked him the question, so when did 
20 
you – we?  I found out on the 16 January at the first board 
meeting.  Then we had the induction Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the – so I thought the 16 t h was for the 
induction? 
MS KLEIN:  No. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 17 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the first board meeting? 
MS KLEIN:  Ja.  We need to just go and check those dates 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KLEIN:  Because I actually stepped away from here 
Chairperson and I went to go and look at it yesterday.  
There was a full board meeting on the 16 January which is 
where Mr Tsotsi shared with me about my – you asked 
questions about when people were made aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  Mr Tsotsi told me at that particular meeting 
that I am going to be Chairperson of Social and – Social 
and Ethics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  But I guess the point I want to make Chair is 
that to say that the very first meeting that this board had 
with management on the 11 March is not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  Because in the meeting of the 16 January I 
was told I was going to chair People and Governance – not 
20 
People and Governance – Social and Ethics.  I was also 
told that I was going to be serving on People and 
Governance as well as Finance Investment and Finance 
committee.  Now in that time from the 16 January until the 
11 March Chairperson we can check the dates. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 18 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MS KLEIN:  Obviously it is not in my statement because at 
the time I was not – you know I was responding to what 
questions were asked yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  We had at least two of each of those meetings.  
Two 
meetings 
of 
– 
two 
meetings 
of 
People 
and 
Governance.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  Two meetings of IFC. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Investment and Finance and two meetings of – 
what 
was 
the 
third 
one 
I 
said. 
 
IFC, 
People 
and 
Governance and Sustainability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  And I know that for a fact because on the 8 
February was my son’s birthday and I will never forget I 
chaired that meeting and it just – you know I just – I just 
was such a long meeting so I – the reason I raise this 
Chairperson it is not true to say we had our first meeting 
20 
on the 11 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I just wanted Chair to hear that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it is important you should – you 
should clear that.  It certainly put your… 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 19 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your perspective and your understanding 
of what … 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Position is.  So you say that the first 
board meeting was on the 16 January? 
MS KLEIN:  On the 16 January.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the induction would have come 
when? 
MS KLEIN:  Correct.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The following day or when? 
MS KLEIN:  I think if I get the dates correct it was – I think 
we were 16 and then it was either 14 t h and 15 t h or a few 
days later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KLEIN:  But it was thereabouts.  We can just confirm 
those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But the – it was consecutive 
days? 
MS KLEIN:  It was consecutive days. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KLEIN:  But this was a full board meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes.  Now at the board meeting – at 
the first board meeting do you have a recollection of what 
types of issues were discussed or was it just a meeting for 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 20 of 240 
 
everybody to get to know one another and so on? 
MS KLEIN:  I actually think that I referred to it in my 
affidavit.  Let me just – if you do not mind Chair I just want 
to have a look. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can look if there is something that 
can help refresh your memory.   
MS KLEIN:  I do not see it here Chairperson but I know 
that given your question yesterday I specifically went to go 
and look at when exactly was I told that I was going to be 
Chairperson of Sustainability. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  And that is when I saw it was – and in that – in 
that board meeting Chairperson the CEO Tshediso Matona 
gave the board an overview of – there was a Chairperson’s 
Report I remember seeing there and then there was the 
CEO’s Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  But I do not have all the details on it right 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the first board meeting? 
20 
MS KLEIN:  At the first board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS KLEIN:  Sir which was as well as on the second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Which was on the 11 January – 11 March.  But 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 21 of 240 
 
the point I was trying to make is that the meetings in-
between. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  It is not true to say that this board never 
interacted with executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Because there were a number of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you have the first board meeting. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have induction. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  Induction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you – you what you – one of the 
points you are making is that between or rather after the 
induction. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between that date and the 9 March – the 
11 March there were certain meetings of committees where 
committees – at the least the ones you served on. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where they began to do some work and 
20 
also interacted with executives or not? 
MS KLEIN:  Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Because remember the executives were 
responsible and the CEO in most cases. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 22 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Would have attended those meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And you were a member of 
what – two committees? 
MS KLEIN:  No Chairperson three.  I was the Chairperson 
of Social and Ethics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I was on the People and Governance and then 
I also was on the – I find I am having a sixties moment 
now.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it the Investment and Finance? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes IFC. Sorry Chairperson that was the third 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS KLEIN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who… 
MS KLEIN:  But we had a number of meetings in-between. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have a recollection of about how 
many committee meetings you may have attended between 
the induction and the meeting of the 9 or 11 March roughly 
20 
in different committees? 
MS KLEIN:  In the committees including the induction and 
the board… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No excluding induction and the board. 
MS KLEIN:  I would – Chairperson sorry – sorry to cut in 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 23 of 240 
 
but I think there was at least two of each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.   
MS KLEIN:  We need to confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We need to then make it about six at 
least six. 
MS KLEIN:  At least six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Besides induction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  And two board meetings. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
MS KLEIN:  Sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I wanted to answer Mr Seleka’s question 
about the meeting of the 26 February.  That was the 
question Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes.  There was a meeting scheduled and the 
20 
night before the meeting we got given a notice I think it 
was – I am not even sure I think it came on mail to say that 
this meeting has been cancelled.  And I had a big problem 
with that Chairperson because I remember writing to the 
Chairperson and saying to the Chairperson how is it even 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 24 of 240 
 
possible that we can cancel a meeting at such short notice 
number 1.  Also, I referred the Chairperson to Section 52 
or Rule 52 of the PFMA where we needed to get the 
corporate plans signed off within 30 days of a certain 
period and we were going to be in breach of the PFMA if 
we did not have that meeting.  If I remember correctly 
there was another board member, I am not sure but I think 
it may have been Mr Pamensky who also asked questions 
around governance.  So I had a particular problem with 
that.  I must also say Chairperson I did not get a response 
10 
to my email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes that is so and I know Chairperson we have 
agreed that I will keep my responses short but I think it is 
important to point out to you that you know in listening to 
recordings – obviously remember these are five years ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  And some of us do not remember as well as 
others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
.MS KLEIN:  So I have had to go back to listen to 
recordings.  In the meeting of the 11 March before the 
Minister arrived the Chairperson took extreme umbrage 
with board members directly interacting with executives.  
And 
at 
that 
stage 
Chairperson 
I 
then 
asked 
the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 25 of 240 
 
Chairperson he could give me an opportunity to just 
address it from a governance perspective.  And I said, 
Chairperson I understand that you would prefer for board 
members to work through you only the problem that I have 
is given the – given the complexity of the business, given – 
we were on a burning platform and I am sure we will talk 
about that more.  Was that I had written to the Chairperson 
on numerous occasions about big matters including the 26 
and I had received no response.  And I actually put it to 
the Chairperson, I said, Chairperson I do not think it is fair 
10 
for you to ask us not to engage with executives if you 
yourself are not responding the critical matters that the 
board would need that I would need an answer on.  And the 
Chairperson’s response and in fairness to him you know he 
just said, look people understand I get more than 200 
emails a day so I apologise.  And between him and the – 
and the Company Secretary they were going to try and do 
better.  But it was – I found it very difficult that here were 
huge matters being raised in the media and all over and – 
and even issues coming out of sub-committee meetings 
20 
that I needed input from the Chair on and I was not getting 
any 
response. 
 
So 
I 
am 
sorry 
to 
have 
digressed 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  It is important 
that you – from your side be able to articulate what you 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 26 of 240 
 
believe is important to give me a complete picture of what 
the situation was.  So – so that is fine. 
MS KLEIN:  Thank you Chair.  I hope I have answered the 
question on the 26 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The 26 February. 
MS KLEIN:  Which was the question, I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but now I did not get your answer 
clearly to the Chairperson’s question because let me start 
with this.  The affidavit in the paragraph we have referred 
to says: 
10 
“The board induction meeting was held on 
16 January 2015 and it was arranged by the 
Company Secretary.” 
MS KLEIN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You then have the agenda items 
specified. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From there you go to paragraph 24 – 
well let me carry on with paragraph 23 where you conclude 
by saying: 
20 
“I recall having left this meeting which is 
the induction feeling rather concerned both 
by the enormity of the challenges which had 
correctly been highlighted by the Minister.” 
That says the Minister was present in that meeting – the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 27 of 240 
 
induction.  You see where I am?  On page 7. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes can I just reread quickly so that I am clear 
Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  I recall having left this meeting feeling rather 
concerned – sorry.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will read it on record for you. 
MS KLEIN:  No, no I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh. 
MS KLEIN:  I have got it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What paragraph are you both on?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 7, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am at ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The top paragraph.  The very top. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  What paragraph on page 7? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The very top. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It starts from the previous batch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Now I see.  I recall.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
“I recall has he left this meeting feeling rather 
concerned both by the enormity of the challenges 
which had been correctly been highlighted by the 
minister and by the fact he did not appear to have 
concrete 
strategies 
in 
place 
to 
address 
his 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 28 of 240 
 
concerns.” 
 
The next paragraph is about a meeting having been 
called by Mr Phukubje to take place on 26 February 2015 but 
was later cancelled and did not take place.” 
 
Now that would have been a board meeting.  Is that 
correct? 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  What we do not see in your 
affidavit 
is 
reference 
to 
any 
board 
meeting 
prior 
to 
26 February 2015 apart from the induction meeting. 
10 
MS 
KLEIN: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
to 
answer 
the 
question.  
Remember, I sat here yesterday and I heard various things 
and that obviously made me go back and look at my notes.   
 
So if it is that part of this incorrect based on dates, then 
I want to acknowledge that it was incorrect.  What I would 
like Chairperson though is, can I have a copy of that 
particular board meeting?  We should have it on file 
because... Do we have a copy of that board meeting of the 
16 January 2015? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean the minutes? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry, I mean the minutes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Because what I am wanting to look at 
Chairperson is, I do not believe the minister was at that 
induction.  I think what I am referring to there is a meeting 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 29 of 240 
 
with the minister previously which she highlighted all of our 
problems in the organisation.   
 
But I just want to be clear that we are talking about the 
same thing because at the time of writing this affidavit, that 
is my understanding sitting here yesterday, I went back and 
it looks like we had two additional days of induction, not just 
this one.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   So what I would like is, if we do have it on 
record, is the minutes of the meeting of the 16 January , 
10 
please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That... well, I do not know ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Is it possible? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...if it was an induction, I do not have the 
minutes because remember what Mr Seleka is saying, you 
have said you went back after hearing Mr Tsotsi’s evidence 
to check. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said the first board meeting on 
the 16 January. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he is pointing out that in your 
statement that is reflected as having been an induction. 
MS KLEIN:   As an induction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think what could be done is... well, I 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 30 of 240 
 
do not know if Mr Seleka you do know whether you have any 
minutes for the 16 January  or not because if you do, then 
they can be given but if we – if you do not, Ms Klein might 
need to – we have to move – go on with your evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But during the breaks or in lunch break or 
tea break if she is able to talk to somebody to try and obtain 
information that could help recall – have her remember 
exactly what the position is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be fine.  And later on, we can 
come back to the point. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And if she ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   I will do that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and if she needs more time than today, 
she could come back later on.  She could put up her 
supplementary affidavit to say:  I have since had the 
opportunity to look at A, B, C, D. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I wish to correct my statement in the 
following way or wish to supplement it in the following way.  
This is the position.  And if necessary, she can come back 
and deal with that on another day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 31 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That will be in order, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS KLEIN:   Thank you, Chair.  If I may just add?  I would 
like to do that as you have said, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Because I went to go and read it last night and 
there definitely are – there is a definitely a set of minutes for 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   In fact, we may even get it for you at the tea 
break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Ms Klein.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course Mr Klein, it will be something 
that would be interesting to see how it get resolved as to 
whether there was a board meeting on the 16t h as opposed 
to the induction.  Because as things stand, it looks like both 
20 
you and Mr Tsotsi say the same thing with regard to when 
the induction was.   
MS KLEIN:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in terms of the statements, Mr Tsotsi 
says there was a board meeting on the 16t h.  But of course, 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 32 of 240 
 
as you say, after you have head his evidence, you went 
ahead and checked and you think there was... 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will see how that is sorted out.   
MS KLEIN:   Thank you, Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, might I add?  The top executives 
say the same as well as Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That the 26t h of February was the first 
10 
board meeting scheduled for 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Ms Klein, the – you said you – when 
the meeting of 26t h  of February 2015 was cancelled, you 
raised an objection.   
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And your objection, was it to have the 
meeting take place specifically? 
MS KLEIN:   Chair, I was more concerned at the time, you 
know, looking through my paperwork of the fact that we are 
20 
going to be missing a deadline because that board meeting 
was also going to be looking at the approval of the corporate 
plan.   
 
And in terms of Section 52 of the PMFA, we only had 30-
days in which to get to corporate planning and I was 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 33 of 240 
 
concerned that we would miss.  That was the one thing.   
 
But I think on a personal level from a governance 
perspective, you do not send a mail to people the night 
before the time to say the meeting is cancelled.  I had a 
problem with that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, depending on what time the 
meeting was going to be on the 26 t h.  If somebody was to 
travel from another province, they might have already arrived 
there in Gauteng to spend the night so that they are in time 
10 
for the meeting on the following day.  And then they get a 
message saying, the meeting is not – it is cancelled. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein... sorry, I just want to go back 
to something.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, I guess the... part of the 
problem with the cancellation is, you were not given any 
reasons. 
MS KLEIN:   Not at that time.  There were reasons 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Not at that time? 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, at that time, there were no reasons given.  
We heard about reasons afterwards.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but were you ever given reasons – 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 34 of 240 
 
you say not at that time? 
MS KLEIN:   Not at that time.  Afterwards, we were told that 
the minister cancelled it.  And I mean, sitting here, listening 
to Mr Tsotsi, I heard that the president cancelled it.  All I 
knew was, you know, it could not be right from a governance 
perspective for a cancellation to take place to a scheduled 
board meeting where the company was in crisis.  And you 
know, how do you cancel this?  And then we also had the 
corporate plan that needed signing off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but my question is whether You were 
10 
given reasons at any stage why the meeting off the 26 of 
February was cancelled because Mr Tsotsi he asked the 
acting DG who called what the reasons were and the acting 
DG said. I am not the minister, he did not give me any 
reasons.  
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when he was giving evidence, I was 
concerned that here is a board meeting.  somebody outside 
of the boat, whether it is the president or the minister, 
seemed to want it cancelled.  They are not scheduled to 
20 
appear and to attend this meeting.  it is not the meeting.  
What other reasons?  And then it gets cancelled even though 
he didn't know the reasons.  
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, that was part of my concern.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 35 of 240 
 
So when you say that you were not given reasons at that 
time, I am interested to find out whether you were given 
reasons later as to why it was cancelled.  
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair we were told the minister cancelled 
it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that is not a reason.  That is just 
to cancel it.  
MS KLEIN:   That I accept.  I accept that but when you are 
told buy your cheapest in that that was the only reason, I 
can give you.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   and it was after the fact. After raising the 
objection.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So what I'm saying is, that explains 
the origin off the idea of cancelling the meeting that it came 
from the minister or the president. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it doesn't explain why it was 
necessary to cancel the meeting.  That you were never told 
at any stage even after to say, here are the reasons why that 
20 
meeting had to be cancelled. You will never be told that?  
MS KLEIN:   No, Chairperson We were never told.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, your – you 
made a statement to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 36 of 240 
 
submitted a written statement.  Do you recall that? 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, Chair.  Yes, I did.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  A copy of that statement is 
contained in that bundle on page 347.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, is there room for that mic to 
come closer to you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  I am struggling more and more 
to hear you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair I got that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You got that? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On page 347, it is Ms Venete Klein’s 
statement to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 347, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ms Klein, that statement is dated 
19 October 2017 which appears on page 395.   
20 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 395. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Now on paragraph 6 of that 
statement, which you find on page 349.  You see that 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 37 of 240 
 
paragraph deals with what you referred to: 
“As the first board meeting following my appointment 
took place ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...on 16 January 2015. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, Chair.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you deal with the agenda items 
included, amongst others, a War Room, updates, selective 
demands, financial status updates, consideration of board 
committee handover and so on.  Do you see that? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then you have that paragraph – that 
sentence again: 
“I 
recall 
having 
left 
this 
meeting 
feeling 
rather 
concerned, both by the enormity of the challenges 
which had correctly been highlighted by the minister 
and by the fact that Eskom did not appear to have 
concrete 
strategies 
in 
place 
to 
address 
these 
concerns.” 
 
Which is a replica of... which is replicated ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ... in your affidavit to this commission. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, if you go back to your affidavit – 
go back to the end of it which is page ...[intervenes]  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 38 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am so sorry.  Ms Klein, in this statement 
that you made, you speak of a meeting you had with the 
minister on the 12t h of December 2014 and you say there 
were – the meeting was attended by a number of new board 
members as well as two members of the previous board, Ms 
Mabude and Mr Tsotsi.   
 
And then you indicate the important points which you 
noted which came out of that meeting.  And then you refer to 
the first board meeting be on the 16 January  which is 
consisted with what you just said earlier on.   
10 
 
And then you talk about a report you received on the 
29 t h of January on one performance.  And let us see.  You 
talk about what happened on the 29t h of January.   
 
Mr Seleka, I just note that Mr Tsotsi did not deal with 
some of these things which appear to be important.   
 
Now I am saying that simple in this context that Ms Klein 
made the point earlier that prior to the 11t h of March, prior to 
the meeting of the 11 t h of March, there was quite some 
activity that had been going on which – by which I think she 
meant to say:  Some of us as board members or members of 
20 
various committees have had quite some engagement with 
the work, with our work and with some of the executives.   
 
So one would have thought that Mr Tsotsi also would 
have also told about some of these things, particularly, when 
I raise the question of how the new board members would 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 39 of 240 
 
have known what was happening at Eskom.   
 
And also, I think I said to him:  As Chairperson, I will 
take it that you would know if members of the board, you 
know, had been – were in a position or had been doing any 
work, you know.   
 
So I am just surprised that he did not mention these 
things.  But we can deal with... I think the part what I am 
talking about seems to address the point that Ms Klein was 
making, namely, between the induction and the 11t h March, 
there was a lot of activity that some of the board members 
10 
were involved in in terms of the work.   
 
And I see that she refers to some reports that they 
received on plant performance and so on.  which may mean 
that they had began to do quite some work.  At least in terms 
of familiarising themselves with what was going on at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  May I put ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You might have a better picture.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let me ask Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein, we have an affidavit by Dr 
20 
Ngubane.  Because of this issue, then I will have to refer you 
to that affidavit which is in a separate bundle.  Dr Ngubane... 
let me read his affidavit so that...   
CHAIRPERSON:   Or should we take the tea adjournment 
now?  It is quarter past eleven.  And then when we come 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 40 of 240 
 
back, you can read it Ms Klein. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have it here, Chair.  If I may just... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...just dispose of that quickly? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Will you please provide Ms Klein with Dr 
Ngubane’s affidavit?  Because none of the persons who have 
given us the affidavit, Mr Tsotsi, the executives, including Dr 
Ngubane, allude to... well, let me say specifically Dr 
Ngubane as a new member similarly in your position by 
10 
means to the engagement with the executives that you are 
referring to.  The affidavit, I believe, has been placed before 
you.   
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It may be contained also in – in fact in 
your file.  Chairperson, for your purposes.  That is page 593.  
That will be in bundle, Eskom Bundle 03. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, do I go to... do you want me to go 
to that as well or...? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, they can assist you.   
MS KLEIN:   They will assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Go ahead even if I got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Even if you ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Okay I got it. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 41 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS KLEIN:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is page 8 in the bundle that you 
have before you, Ms Klein. 
MS KLEIN:   8?  Is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 8, yes.   
MS KLEIN:   Are we talking about 8 or 51, Chairperson? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eight at the top of that page.  Eight... 
MS KLEIN:   I have got 593. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before... have you told you about the red 
10 
numbers and black numbers? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, she might be having... which number 
does she have?   
COUNSEL:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   This one of her?

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, DCJ.  DCJ there are two 
aspects which I will put to Ms Klein and she can respond 
the DCJ.  So that is, Ms Klein – well, going into those two 
aspects, the first one is that Mr Matona himself testified 
that he did not have an interaction of the board, the new 
board members prior to the meeting on the 9 March 2015.  
So we are asking specifically this question and in regard to 
whether issues relating to the war room, which I see then 
10 
you touched on that aspect, whether they were raised with 
him and he said no.  So that is one, so you can tell the 
Chairperson, I will go to the other two. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I cannot agree with that because 
we have had interactions with Mr Matona hence my 
statement where I express a view, not on Mr Matona as a 
person, but my view as a business person coming onto a 
government board for the first time of how I felt about 
certain things that was being said.  So, Chairperson, to 
you, I cannot agree with that, there were various meetings 
20 
held in between. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second one, Ms Klein, and you can 
also comment to the Chairperson and that is the audio 
which I would like to play, that is the board’s in-committee 
meeting after having met with the Minister on the 11 March 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 43 of 240 
 
2015.  Time stamp – or the page reference in the 
transcript, you will have the transcript there with you, it is 
page 893.  I believe you have been given that file.  
Chairperson, we will use, with your permission, the file of 
Mr Tsotsi that we used yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine, what page in that file? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is page 893. 
CHAIRPERSON:   893? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Time stamp 40 – let us start at 00. 
10 
AUDIO PLAYED – INAUDIBLE 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you recognise the voice of the two 
persons talking? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, that is Mr Tsotsi and Norman Baloyi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what was the answer? 
MS KLEIN:   It was Norman Baloyi, one of the board 
members and the Chairperson Zola Tsotsi asking the 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Ms Klein. 
20 
AUDIO PLAYED – INAUDIBLE 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you hear what he says there? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That secondly – you can read it if you 
see it there.  Just read it on record? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 44 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Oh, alright, it says: 
“And secondly that the issues from the war room...” 
Is that the one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
MS KLEIN:    “...the information has never been sent to the  
 
 
board.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your comment to the Chairperson? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, yes, you want me to respond? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Comment on that, yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, no absolutely.  The board had a big 
10 
problem – or let me speak for myself – that there was a 
war room established by the President at the time.  The 
war room is running on the one side.  You have got a new 
board with – who has now got all the challenges, as I have 
outline in my affidavit and parliament, we have got a 
Chairperson coming and telling us that there is certain 
things that must happen and you have got the Minister on 
the other side and I talk for myself, Chairperson, it is – we 
never get anything that is congruent.  So here what Mr 
Baloyi is saying, we are never getting  - to read it again: 
20 
“Secondly that the issue of...” 
Let me just read it correct. 
“I can see what is combined in that report and then 
secondly I said that the issues from the war room 
the information has never been sent to the board.” 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 45 of 240 
 
The context of that, Chairperson, the context of that is, 
there is not a formal report coming to the board of what is 
happening in the war room but what is coming at various 
pieces the war room is saying – as an example, one of the 
things that was discussed, which is why I am so adamant 
that there were board meetings before, one of the things 
that was discussed was that we were going to be able to 
do some severance packages allowing people to leave.  
The war room in one of their minutes – so we see this in a 
minute now – says the board cannot do that.  And as a 
10 
board member, I am sitting here thinking, I have a fiduciary 
responsibility.  We are making decisions based on what we 
believe to be right, the war room is giving us one version, 
Mr Baloyi is correct, it is not in a formal report but you are 
forever hearing you can and you cannot from those who 
have been there.  That is the context. 
 
Now I want to go beyond that, Chair, if you allow 
me.  The report that he is referring to here is the report 
that Mr Tsotsi told us when we were pushing back and forth 
about the suspensions, Mr Tsotsi said a lot of work has 
20 
already been done and there is a thick report that – so Mr 
Tsotsi was saying to us, guys, a lot of work has been done 
on this, do not slow us down here.  And I can for the record 
tell you, Chairperson, I actually supported Mr Tsotsi at the 
time because it is a lot of work that has been done by way 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 46 of 240 
 
of investigations, Mr Tsotsi is coming and recommending to 
us this is the way to move forward.  I had no – I am a 
business person.  In fact I am not sure how much of this 
recording we are going to play but I can tell you if you play 
to the end of it you will hear me, as a banker, saying that 
the CFO had told us earlier in this particular meeting, one 
of the challenges that we faced that we were running short 
of – we were seriously cash constrained.  There was a 
going-concern problem that we were facing and I want to 
understand what does that mean.   
10 
So she said typically you would have a buffer of R4 
billion for Eskom.  So I said what did that mean?  And she 
then said it meant we had cover for the cost of Eskom for 
the running for four months.   
So at the end of this recording, if you are still going 
to go there, I am not sure, Chair, but assuming you do, you 
will hear me say if I take what the CFO has told us, that we 
have got – we should have a buffer of 4 billion, at this 
stage we only have 4.9 bill which means they have not 
even got enough in the bank to carry us for one month and 
20 
then I went a step further to the board.  I said board 
members, understand, running this operation costs of R50 
million a day.  We cannot – we are sitting here where the 
Chairperson has given us input and has asked us – the 
Chairperson guided us with the suspensions and we will go 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 47 of 240 
 
through that, you have asked me, I will go through that. 
And I am saying I support the Chairperson because 
the toing and froing about something where it is costing 
this amount of money and it is money we do not have. 
So in a long way, the report that Mr Baloyi is 
referring to is a report that the Chairperson says had been 
done and I supported the Chairperson - if all this work has 
been done and you are saying that this is a way forward, I 
support you, Chairperson, and I have quantified it in terms 
of numbers. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Ms Klein.  You see 
what Mr Baloyi was saying there – I see you are trying to 
qualify what he said, but he plainly said the information 
from the war room has never been shared with us and that 
is really – but you have given your comment.  I will move 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what Ms Klein is saying – and you 
must just tell me if I misunderstood what you are saying, 
Ms Klein.  I think part of what she was saying is yes, it is 
true that certain information was not being given to the 
20 
board but clearly relating to the war room, as I understand 
the position, or request for information from the war room 
on an official basis but it could be that board members 
become aware unofficially of information.  That is what I 
thought you were saying.  Is that correct, is that not 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 48 of 240 
 
correct? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, that is exactly correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Remember just prior to this meeting, if you go 
and listen to the recording, the Minister comes out and 
tells us what has come out of the war room which the 
Minister also did in the meeting the first time she met 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, so …[intervenes] 
MS KLEIN:   Because…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So information  might be bought or 
different 
board 
members 
might 
be 
aware 
of 
certain 
information but it is not official or it is not formal, that is 
not what you are saying. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, that is exactly what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   And further along you will even find where 
board members are even asking is it not possible that one 
or two of us even become part of the war room so we can 
somehow align what the President has put together in the 
20 
form of a war room, which is being led by our current 
President. President Ramaphosa was leading that war 
room but none of the board members were there and the 
Minister was coming to give us information about how 
things are going wrong. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 49 of 240 
 
 
What Mr – my understanding of listening to the 
recording here is that what he is saying is we, the board, 
are getting bits and pieces of what is coming out of the war 
room and it does not help us at the board to make proper 
decisions, as we would understand it to be proper, if you 
will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  So just to take 
further the Chair ’s trying to understand what you are 
saying, Ms Klein, would what you refer to in your statement 
10 
as a meeting with the Minister in I think you say 12 
December 2014 and you give a list of the items there which 
includes the war room which has been run by the Deputy 
President of the Republic, would that not have been a 
formal information to you as opposed to hearing informally 
about issues pertaining to the war room? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, we are talking about two 
different time streams here.  We are talking about the 
Minister telling us on the – I think it is 14 t h, Chairperson, 
14 December or 12 December. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   12 December 2014. 
MS KLEIN:   Right.  And then you are talking about the 11 
March which the couple of months later where the Minister 
again talks about the war room.  I think what the board was 
grappling with in that time is bits and pieces coming at us 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 50 of 240 
 
but no formal representation of what is happening in the 
war room.  We are constantly hearing about the problems 
as identified by the war room.   
 
And I cannot talk for Mr Baloyi, I can talk for myself 
and at the time of sitting there, I must tell you, I am sitting 
then typically in board you have been given information 
and based on the information you would make decisions, 
Chairperson.  That is in a typical boardroom. 
 
Here you are sitting in a boardroom, you consider 
all the documents in front of you, you make decisions and 
10 
then you get told but the war room says that you cannot do 
it.  So that is on the one hand. 
 
Then you have got a Chairperson and I am sure we 
will get to it, the evidence leader I am sure will take us 
there.  A Chairperson who comes at us as the board and 
says in a meeting with the President and then we have got 
to call the Minister and somehow in between all of us, as a 
board member, you have got to try and make sense.   
 
So the point from Mr Baloyi is, I personally had 
never seen a formal war room report but we were given 
20 
extensive input in terms of what came out of it.  And the 
question by the board, is it not possible that one of us can 
sit on the committee was discussed more than once 
because of the divergent pieces of input with which this 
board was trying to make sense and trying to move forward 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 51 of 240 
 
in the best interest of a very complex situation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I would not want to belabour it 
but we can see he says it has never come to us and not to 
him personally.  So he seems to refer to the corporate as 
opposed to the individual.  Anyway, but your point, 
according to you there would have been interactions prior 
to the meeting of – is it 11 March or is it 9 March? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, there were two interactions.  
The one interaction was on the 9 March and the second 
interaction was on the 11 t h. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am talking prior to those 
meetings of 11 March, prior to the meeting of 11 March or 
the 9 March.  Your interaction with, as you say, the 
executives would – it would have taken place before those 
dates. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct.  Correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now let us see how you then 
respond to this aspect, again arising from the minutes of 
the 9 March 2015.  Chairperson, it is Eskom bundle 02.  
The minutes of the 9 March are found on page 62.  Six two, 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then I will refer to the relevant 
page where I wish to read, I think it is page – yes, page 
64.  Are you there, Ms Klein? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 52 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Page 62, Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:     Yes, it is the minutes of the 9 March. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    2015.  Then please go to page 64.  
Just for you to comment on this through the Chairperson.  
Paragraph, from the top one, two, three, four, five, it starts 
with the words “Another member”. 
“Another member stated the board should meet with 
the Minister of Public Enterprise as to understand 
what her expectations were from this inquiry.  It was 
10 
agreed further that ...[indistinct 19.21] she was 
required as to whether the board would continue 
with 
its 
normal 
duties 
while 
the 
inquiry 
was 
underway as to date no reason had been given as 
to why the board meeting of 26 February 2015 had 
been cancelled by the Minister of PE.  Clarity was 
also required in respect of the board’s obligation to 
the war room.” 
Then the next paragraph: 
“It was reported that the audit and risk committee 
20 
had emphasised that the board needed to review 
the sitting process of the war room as there was no 
alliance or alignment between the board and the 
war room.  Members wanted to ascertain the 
shareholders’ view around this issue because at 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 53 of 240 
 
present the board has still not held a board meeting 
and would need to understand the scope of work 
and how the committee would function.  A concern 
was raised at the committee, could usurp the 
board’s powers.” 
Your comment on those two paragraphs?  You can you see 
two issues arise there.  One is that the board has not held 
a meeting but the other seems to be uncertainty about the 
war room.  Your comment to the Chairperson? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chairperson.  As I said, you know, I 
10 
cannot – first of all, I was not at the meeting of the 9 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   Let us start with that.  My comments around it 
being the first meeting of the board, like I said, the 16 t h – 
in fact, Chairperson, what I did get, you know, in the break, 
was the full minutes of the board meeting of the 16 
January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you got those? 
MS KLEIN:   I got them.  Now whether that is what then is 
referred as to the induction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I think is probably where the – what do you 
call it – maybe the confusion is coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Because I got two packs at my home, 14 t h and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 54 of 240 
 
15 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   And 16 t h.  So it is possible, I mean, like I said 
I just cannot remember that far back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   But I do not have a minute for the 14 t h and 
the 15 t h.  I do have a minute for the 16 t h and I also have an 
in-committee minute for later on on that evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   And in-committee where we get told who sits 
10 
on which committee, etcetera, etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS KLEIN:   So I hope that that clarifies maybe my own I 
misunderstanding of whether it was an induction then or – 
that is to do with the dates.  Is that your first question, 
Chairperson? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think what will be important is to 
look at the content. 
MS KLEIN:   Agreed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the discussions because an induction 
meeting and an ordinary meeting should be different. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, correct, that is important, Ms 
Klein, because when I was also doing the comparison 
between your statement at the parliamentary Portfolio 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 55 of 240 
 
Committee, there where you used the word “meeting” the 
first board meeting.  Which is in 2017 you wrote that 
statement but your affidavit here was in March 2020, that 
is changed to induction meeting as opposed to first 
meeting of the board. 
MS KLEIN:   I see that, Chairperson, I am happy to say 
that I could have made a mistake as well.  I am happy to 
concede that the dates were – so, you know…  And I think I 
was guided by going through all my documents after I met 
with the team from the Commission.  Having gone back and 
10 
having looked at all my documents, I saw 14.50 and no 
[indistinct 23.27].  So then I said well, but okay then it is 
an induction.   
But listening to Mr Tsotsi yesterday made me go 
and read it again and then I thought but hold on, how do 
you at an induction take board resolutions?  So I think it is 
something that maybe the Commission wants to explore a 
bit further. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think it ought to be possible to 
look at the content, talk to those who attended and see 
20 
what was an induction meeting, maybe if you want to call it 
that, and what was an ordinary board meeting – well, 
maybe I should not say ordinary because of the different 
categories but basically a board meeting.  So the content 
of the discussion should indicate.  Okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 56 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein, I think that will then resolve. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We could move on. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not have that meeting of the 
26 t h which is cancelled.  The understanding there was a 
meeting called for the 9 March.  You say you did not attend 
that meeting. 
MS KLEIN:   No, Chairperson, I could not.  We got that on 
the evening of the 8 t h and I unfortunately had had an 
10 
engagement for the next day but I once again questioned 
the governance around how we did things.  You know,  you 
cannot just call meetings at the eleventh hour.  I mean, I 
think my biggest concern always around the financial 
status of Eskom.   
The running cost of Eskom was around 30 million a 
day and I was not convinced that if you get a resolution on 
the 8 t h and say you must be there the 9 t h that everybody is 
going to be there so that was my …(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also, if there was a scheduled 
20 
meeting for the 11 t h you wonder why it was necessary to 
have the meeting on the 9 t h because even though the 
meeting of the 11 t h may have been there for certain items, 
if the board thought that there was something that was not 
on the agenda for the 11 t h but that was quite urgent they 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 57 of 240 
 
could, you know, change their agenda to include that. 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, Chairperson.  I speak under 
correct now but I am not sure that there was a meeting 
scheduled for the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr – I am going according to Mr 
Tsotsi’s evidence. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
His 
evidence 
was 
that 
after 
the 
cancellation of the meeting of the 26 February a meeting 
was scheduled for the 11 t h and my understanding of his 
10 
evidence – or I may have I misunderstood him, my 
understanding was that by the 9 t h there was a meeting 
scheduled for the 11 t h but I may have I misunderstood him. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe it was only arranged for – it 
was only fixed on the 9 t h after the meeting.  But my 
impression was that it had been scheduled earlier. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but that might not be correct. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, that may very well be so, I 
20 
cannot confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MS KLEIN:   I just want to, if it is okay with you, I thought 
Mr Seleka had asked a second question around this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 58 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   About the war room.  Was there a second 
point or did he cover that?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I think will be clarified. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   By what the Chairperson has proposed 
to be the way forward. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein, I want to show you your 
email in regard to the meeting of the 9 t h because I hear 
you say to the Chairperson that again you raised concerns 
10 
about issues of governance.  Chairperson, that email is 
contained in the bundle we used yesterday from Mr Tsotsi, 
I think the witness will be – it is an email on page 1092, 
Eskom bundle 07(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom bundle 02? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   07(B). Okay.  (B) page 1092.  
Chairperson could use my bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Registrar please take the one that Mr 
Seleka is offering.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein, you recognise that email? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is your email sent on Sunday 8 
March 2015 at 22.49, it is sent to Zola Tsotsi and Malesela 
Phukubje, subject Urgent Meeting 9/3. 
“Dear Chairperson, please accept my apologies for  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 59 of 240 
 
tomorrow’s meeting as I will be out of town in the 
morning.  Should you, however, not be quorate, I 
am back in Johannesburg at 18.00 and would be 
available for a meeting in the evening given the 
significance of this gathering.  Having read the 
proposed discussion and resolution being sought, I 
would like to be included in the working committee 
to deal with the issues as articulated… document, 
the reason for this is as Chair as statuary body, 
sub-committee I feel that I will add value in helping 
10 
the process.  Kind regards.” 
I – maybe you could come in because I do not see your 
concern regarding governance issues. 
MS KLEIN:   I think you are right Chair, it is not there, I 
think I have sufficiently raised it at other times where I 
thought that I had raised it here as well.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just to put context to this so that the 
Chairperson could follow.  This is a meeting that was 
called as we heard yesterday and the day before by notice 
sent Sunday evening that is according to Mr Tsotsi after he 
20 
had a meeting in Durban at the President’s residence.  So 
he sent a meeting with a memorandum attached and a 
resolution attached and I think that is what you are 
referring to the proposed discussion and the resolution.   
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 60 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you expressed your interest to 
serve on the committee, the sub-committee that according 
to the resolutions given to be set up.  Is that correct?    
MS KLEIN:   Obviously after a meeting and a deliberation 
that was now going to take place at a particular meeting.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no all I am saying is that you 
expressed interest here to serve on that.   
MS KLEIN:   Oh absolutely and may – you want me to 
respond that why would I have done that or not necessary 
Chair? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Chairperson, will allow.  
MS KLEIN:   Okay I looked at this and I looked at the 
gravity of what was being proposed and at the time I felt 
that you know there was two people if I remember the 
committee that was being proposed and you can help me.  
It was Mr Tsotsi himself, it was Zithemba Khoza as the 
Chairperson of People and Governance, it was Kweita who 
was – I am not sure what she was Chairperson of I think 
Audit and Risk at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
20 
MS KLEIN:   And I just – I think it was audit and risk and I 
just felt if there was going to be any significant pieces of 
work done that social and ethics which I was Chair of at 
the time needed to be a part of.  The granular detail of the 
enquiry was obviously not understood at that stage and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 61 of 240 
 
that was going to be unpacked my understanding at the 
meeting of the 9 t h.  So if there was going to be a 
committee, I just felt that it would be significant to be part 
of it to understand what it was particular given some of the 
resolutions it sort when I looked at it that was what that 
was about.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ms Klein okay that you did 
not – you were not able to attend the meeting of the 9 t h the 
next was the meeting of the 11 t h of March.  So let us ask 
you this and you could tell the Chairperson whether you 
10 
were aware or not at the time prior to the meeting of the 
11 t h of March that Mr Tsotsi had had a meeting with 
President 
Jacob 
Zuma 
and 
Ms 
Dudu 
Myeni 
at 
the 
President’s residence in Durban?   
MS KLEIN:   Prior to the meeting of the 9 t h or prior to the 
meeting of the 11 t h?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prior to the meeting of – let us start 
with the meeting of the 9 t h.  
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I would not have had any knowledge of 
that, I was not close to either the Chairperson at the time 
20 
who was Mr Zola Tsotsi, I was not a confidant of his.  I 
have never met Ms Myeni and I have certainly – I have met 
the President but that was in my role as deputy not deputy 
as a board member of the reserve bank.  I have met the 
President.  So the answer would be no I would not have 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 62 of 240 
 
been aware.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Would you have been aware of the 
meeting between Mr Tsotsi, the President and Ms Dudu 
Myeni before the meeting of the 11 March 2015?   
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chairperson because...[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You had done…[intervene] 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you did not attend the meeting of the 
9 t h so you might not have had.  
MS KLEIN:   Exactly, I was not at the meeting of the 9 t h but 
10 
obviously you know lots of things were discussed and 
deliberated and obviously people gave me feedback and 
that is when I became aware of what had been discussed 
at that meeting.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Yes, because I have seen in 
your affidavit you say you did not attend and you rely, you 
relied solely on the minutes of that meeting.  
MS KLEIN:   I have to agree that that would be it Chair but 
if you think about it I mean people were getting very 
excited about the meeting of the 9 t h and there were people 
20 
who were phoning each other.  If you ask me now who said 
what I probably would not know but I could only rely on 
what was being written and I mean I am not going to go as 
far as saying to you that nobody phoned me and nobody 
spoke to me I mean people were becoming very excited 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 63 of 240 
 
about what they had heard here at the meeting.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you would have become aware - or 
rather let me ask you.  How would you have then become 
aware that there was a meeting between Mr Tsotsi, the 
President and Ms Dudu Myeni? 
MS KLEIN:   If memory serves me well Chairperson that is 
what Mr Tsotsi had shared at the meeting of the 9 t h and 
that is where after that meeting, I would have become 
aware of how exactly the resolution itself found its way into 
the Eskom board.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to the 11 t h of March, prior to the 
meeting of the 11 t h of March did you receive minutes of the 
meeting of the 9 t h?    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not sure.   
MS KLEIN:   I really I am not sure.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But what you do say is that after that 
meeting you became aware of at least some of the matters 
that were discussed through talking to one or others, some 
or other members of the board.   
20 
MS KLEIN:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because people were phoning one 
another to talk about that meeting.  
MS KLEIN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 64 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   I mean I will go as far as saying my 
understanding 
was 
that 
at 
the 
meeting 
people 
were 
uncomfortable with certain things and this is why they have 
asked that the Minister come and represent them.  In fact, 
if I think of my own words at the time as this is just me 
saying what I felt what I can remember feeling.  Is why 
would 
the 
President 
have 
a 
meeting 
with 
anybody 
regarding Eskom.  It was just these were thoughts that I 
had, let alone Ms Myeni because I mean she was not a part 
of it and in my own mind and I think I may even have said 
10 
it because remember in parliament Chairperson you have 
got your affidavit and then you have got being cross 
questioned.  So you have got the transcripts as well.  I 
think somewhere in between somebody actually asks the 
question and I remember thinking or feeling that I want to 
hear from my shareholder representative who as a board 
member I report into what she saw as the issues and what 
she would like us to do.  I could not quite understand why 
a sitting President would be involved but those were my 
thoughts.      
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ja, I think you did say in 
parliament that you were surprised why the President was 
involved in trying to look for – because we have the 
transcript of your testimony there we will get the reference 
page.   
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 65 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Of course.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But then you were able to attend the 
meeting of the 11 t h? 
MS KLEIN:   Correct Chairperson.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the Minister arrives at some point 
to address the board on that occasion.  Correct?   
MS KLEIN:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were present when the Minister 
was there?  
MS KLEIN:   That is right Chairperson.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could you tell the Chairperson what in 
your recollection was the Ministers message to the board? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well before that Mr Seleka do you not 
want her to talk about the meeting of the board that 
happened before the Minister came.  I think so that if there 
is any difference between what Mr Tsotsi said what 
happened at that meeting and what she says we can know 
where the differences are…[intervene]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thereafter she can talk about the part 
20 
where the Minister came and thereafter when the board 
met after the Minister.   
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so just talk about the meeting of 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 66 of 240 
 
the board before the Minister came on the 11 t h.  What was 
discussed and so on and so on?  
MS KLEIN:   Thank you Chairperson.  One or two of the 
things I remember specifically was something I addressed 
with you earlier.  We had a set agenda that I remember Mr 
Tsotsi starting the meeting telling the board that he found 
it rather unacceptable that board members were interacting 
on a regular basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were interacting?   
MS KLEIN:   Interacting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Among themselves? 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, so a board member would phone let us 
say…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Another board member? 
MS KLEIN:   No, no a board member would phone an 
executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh a board members interacting with the 
executives?  
MS KLEIN:   With the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   
20 
MS KLEIN:   And Mr Tsotsi was saying and I think I 
understood why he was saying it because you know there 
was just you know I am loathed to say this but I am going 
to say what I feel and then Chair you can decide how you 
want to take this.  There was so many stories you know 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 67 of 240 
 
everybody you would walk into had a different story about 
a different issue.  No board that I have ever sat on made 
me as tired as Eskom.   
          You yourself raised something yesterday about 
there was one meeting we had left at 12 o’clock that was a 
regular occasion.  I mean my family never saw me so in 
any event one of the things I remember raising with Mr 
Tsotsi which I said to you earlier was the whole issue 
around critical matters being raised by board members and 
I actually want to give you an example if you may I am 
10 
going to step slight out of it.  And I am not sure 
Chairperson whether you have or dealt with TNA or 
whether you are still going to deal with TNA, I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have dealt with TNA.       
MS KLEIN:   You have? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS 
KLEIN: 
 
 
If 
you 
would 
just 
indulge 
me 
just 
to…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have dealt with TNA but if you have 
knowledge of some things that you would like to share with 
20 
the Commission on TNA you can arrange to give us an 
affidavit where you can share more.  But if in regard to the 
TNA you have something that is relevant to what you want 
to say you can refer to it.   
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair it is something that is relevant to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 68 of 240 
 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   I remember Mr Tsotsi giving evidence and 
saying because the question I think you posed at the time 
was why do you – why did somebody, I mean what 
happened when the resolutions went out.  I was the board 
member who refused to sign it very simply.  I come out of 
corporate and if there is any wrong doing of any kind you 
suspend people and maybe a little bit more ruthlessly than 
in public sector but that is how it worked.  You suspend 
10 
people, you do the investigation and then you have a 
disciplinary and you bring the people back or you dismiss 
them.  So when I get asked in a resolution to sign 
something on TNA, I am the one board member who 
refused and I wrote to Mr Tsotsi, I got no response.  That 
is what I was referring to, that was one example of you 
asked what we discussed on that day.  It was issues of 
governance me saying Chair you do not want me to speak 
to the executive but you are my Chairperson these are 
critical matters that we are talking about I need you to 
20 
respond and in that meeting Mr Tsotsi I want to give him 
credit for that like I said earlier he apologised and he made 
sure with the secretary that they would in future not handle 
it in a particular way.   
          If board members had critical matters they needed it 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 69 of 240 
 
to be dealt with that was one issue.  Then I know that Mr 
Matona went through the DD, CEO report to the board.  
Now I have also then in preparation for today in listening 
to evidence being led by other people and one thing I know 
that Mr Matona said was that he had done a turnaround 
plan and I remember hearing your concern about how could 
you not have not considered the turnaround plan or how 
could we I mean – Chairperson I must tell you I never saw 
a turnaround plan or maybe let me qualify it.   
          I am a banker if you did a job for six months and 
10 
you have given me a turnaround plan I expect you to say to 
me that it was we were standing at zero profit; I have given 
the board a plan which said we were going to get to 
R60million in one year we are now in month six so month 
six I am on track we got R30millon banked that for me is a 
turnaround.  But what Mr Matona did say in the particular 
meeting that you referring to on the 11 t h the minute is clear 
where Mr Matona says I am busy developing a turnaround 
plan.  A turnaround plan had not been developed if you 
read the minutes.  It says I am busy developing a 
20 
turnaround plan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.             
MS KLEIN:   That is the first, so we spoke about 
it...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which suggests that it did not exist as 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 70 of 240 
 
yet.    
MS KLEIN:   As yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   And in the minute it goes further of the 11 t h 
because I went to go and listen to it again in preparation 
for today.  Mr Matona says as part of the induction I have 
raised issues of the turnaround with the board.  So 
understand I think it is not that one person is lying and 
another 
person 
is 
not 
lying 
it 
is 
more 
a 
case 
of 
interpretation and how people saw things.   
10 
          Maybe in government the turnaround plan is good 
enough if I give you an update of where I am.  The world I 
came from does not work like that.  Then the next thing is 
at that stage Mr Zola, the Chairperson walks out of the 
meeting and puts me in the Chair said Ms Klein would you 
mind chairing.  I then chair it and Mr Matona goes through 
granular 
detail 
you 
know 
the 
suspension 
not 
the 
suspensions the people he had moved around, the liquidity 
problems that they were having I have got it listed.  And I 
remember in – and I do not know that I am helping myself 
20 
here Chairperson I am talking maybe more than what 
evidence that you wanted me to.  Maybe you – let me be 
guided by you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we asked you or I asked you what 
was discussed at the meeting so that is what you are 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 71 of 240 
 
telling me.       
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously you are looking at important 
things that you can remember.   
MS KLEIN:   So one of the things that was very evident 
though is that the board apparently had not engaged on the 
turnaround 
plan 
and 
did 
not 
ask 
questions 
on 
it.  
Chairperson that is not true.  I have had my sat and 
listened to ten questions the board asked around it.  So 
what I am saying is if the turnaround plan was the CEO 
10 
update that we received there were ten questions asked on 
it.  So and that is what happened prior to the Ministers 
arrival I was chairing that part of the meeting Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then we come to the meeting when 
the Minister...[intervene]        
MS KLEIN:   Arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Arrived ja I think then you can tell us 
about that one.   
MS KLEIN:   And I know I am on national television so I do 
not want to give away my age but I was about to say thank 
20 
you for reminding me Chairperson.  Chairperson the 
Minister arrived and to the best of my recollection because 
there was no, there was no recording of that I think we 
switched of the recording if remember correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to the Minister arriving what was 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 72 of 240 
 
your understanding of what the purpose of her visit to the 
board was?  
MS KLEIN:   My understanding was that the Minister was 
going to give clarity on the meeting of the 9 t h where based 
on what I had heard and I do not think the minutes was out 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the suspensions and the enquiry.   
MS KLEIN:   About the enquiry which may lead to 
suspensions because of the problems that the company 
had. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so she came and then what 
happened?   
MS KLEIN:   She came in and she gave us - if memory 
serves me correctly and I think I have got it in my affidavit 
some of the stuff that I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can have a look if you want to 
refresh your memory.   
MS KLEIN:   Can we just look at that please, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Seleka can...[intervene]  
MS KLEIN:   Look at my affidavit.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In your affidavit.  
MS KLEIN:   Ja, where I am referring to what happened 
when the Minister arrived.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is on page it starts on page 8 
paragraph 29. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 73 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, and Chairperson if I may I think I have 
dealt with what was discussed at the meeting.  Mr Matona 
took us and outlined the problems facing Eskom at the time 
and I list those.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair I see it you are going to 
answer the Chairperson but may I make a comment on this 
because I hope you do not forget because I am concerned 
that Ms Klein some of the things you mentioned about the 
CEO are not contained in your affidavit.  You mentioned to 
the Chairperson that he said he is developing a plan so he 
10 
did not have a plan but nowhere in your affidavit do we see 
that as a concern on your part on what you said to the 
Chairperson because it becomes difficult for us to put that 
to him so that he can answer if we do not have that version 
from your side.      
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson and let me apologise to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   Remember as I said to you I sat here 
yesterday and I was listening to what Mr Tsotsi was saying 
in exactly the same form I mean sorry Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, I think I understand your 
situation you deposed your affidavit at a certain time and 
you dealt with issues that you dealt with but you are saying 
that yesterday you listened to Mr Tsotsi’s evidence and I 
think you said you also have listened to the recording of 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 74 of 240 
 
the evidence of other witnesses relevant to Eskom I think.   
          And part of what you are doing is when you are 
aware that Mr Tsotsi also Mr Matona has said something 
that you do not agree with you are now responding to that 
which you might not have done in your affidavit.  That is 
what you are saying.      
MS KLEIN:   That is exactly Chairperson you have 
summarised it correctly and I apologise to you if it 
complicates matters.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes no, no but it is fine it is important.  
10 
If you are aware that somebody has said something about 
a certain meeting which is not true or which is not your 
understanding of what happened, it is right that you should 
say I heard so and so said this but that is not my 
recollection or that is certainly did not happen.  So it is in 
order it is just that Mr Seleka was saying it is not in your 
affidavit but I think that – this would be your explanation. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In so far as you may be responding to 
something that you became aware of after the affidavit.          
20 
MS KLEIN:   Thanks for understanding Chairperson it is 
just I take the Commission very seriously which is why I am 
trying to shed as much light but I do understand what it 
creates.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 75 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  So you were taking 
us to what the Minister said.    
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That will be on the next page.   
MS KLEIN:   Thank you Chairperson.  The Minister she 
said she was aware that the board may have been feeling 
that they have been falling by the wayside because of the 
War Room and I think there was like I said lots of noises 
particularly the board is saying but we getting all this, so 
that was the one thing.   
10 
          There was concern regarding the interest rate which 
Eskom had negotiated and agreed in the market for some 
monies raised so some bonds that they had gone out and 
raised.  Okay the inequality of cold price, price purchases 
with 
some 
companies 
being 
paid 
more 
than 
others.  
Mismanagement 
of 
the 
load 
shedding 
process, 
the 
purchasing of diesel on the roof it was a big issue for us at 
the time.  The appointment of the board did not bring about 
any problems and the process ran smoothly.  I must say I 
extracted this Chairperson from the minutes so then there 
20 
must have been minutes.  I am just thinking now I said 
there was not a recording but there definitely was minutes. 
I have actually also listed and drafted from the draft that 
was there and that after may procure the services of an 
independent credible forensic investigator to undertake the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 76 of 240 
 
enquiry proposed by Mr Tsotsi and not someone who had 
previously dealings with Eskom.         
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry where were you reading that 
from? 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry I am reading on – still on page 9.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well 31G.  
MS KLEIN:   I am not sure what you call it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no the paragraph 31?  
MS KLEIN:   Oh sorry yes, yes that is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You said the ARC they procured the 
10 
services of an independent credible forensic investigator to 
undertake the enquiry proposed by Mr Tsotsi and not 
someone who had previous dealings with Eskom of whose 
independence may be in doubt.  So all this is what the 
Minister said?   
MS KLEIN:   My best recollection between what I said and 
what I have seen in minutes and what I have seen in notes 
but I was taking notes of my own. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, well let us look at paragraph 30 to 
start with it says the Minister also addressed the board 
20 
that day.  Once again expressing her concern around the 
board, getting a handle on the business.  The Minister 
conceded that he had no right to instruct the board on any 
matter regarding the conduct of Eskom’s business.  Do you 
see that?   
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 77 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do Chairperson.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did – it is a startling statement and I 
hope you will be able to explain it to the Chairperson why 
would this statement have been made by the Minister?  
MS KLEIN:   Obviously Chairperson I am not the Minister 
but this is what I am hearing and that is what I have 
recorded.  That the Minister – my understanding at the time 
was that she is saying I cannot instruct you what to do.  
You have been given a challenge, a big challenge so you 
need to find the best way in which to resolve this big 
10 
challenge being obviously load shedding at that stage we 
were at stage 3, so we…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she is saying I may have views but 
you must make up your own minds.     
MS KLEIN:   I think that is what I meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   But I worded it in a particular way.  I did not 
get the impression that she was there to instruct us on 
anything but more than ever remember the meeting the way 
I understood it was based on the meeting of also of the 9 t h. 
20 
Where from my recollection is that the board members 
expressed concern that they are not getting from the 
shareholder representative as Mr Tsotsi was outlining it.  
That was my understanding but I guess what I meant there 
is not I guess, I read is the Minister is not here to instruct 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 78 of 240 
 
us she is here to give guidance and maybe ask questions 
that is my understanding.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well recall that the meeting of the 9 t h 
had one agenda item and that agenda item entailed the two 
documentation referred to in your email.  The proposed 
resolution and the memorandum.  So the meeting of the – 
and the board members at the time as you also confirmed 
they say to the Chairperson well why does not the 
shareholder representative come and address us on it.   
          Let her come and address us so that we understand 
10 
what is going on.  Then the meeting of the 9 t h is scheduled.  
Is that not the Minister comes to that meeting knowing that 
I am going to be engaged on this aspect the enquiry and 
the suspension of the executives.  Could that be the 
reason why you write in there that that is what she said?       
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson that sounds fair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so because she will come there 
informed as Mr Tsotsi says about the purpose why you 
want to see the Minister.  But you would have heard 
yesterday that when we played the audio that portion which 
20 
says we must protect our leaders Mr Tsotsi said that was 
Ms Mabude saying that do not mention the name of the 
President in this room, do not mention the name of the 
Minister in this room we own this decision.  Seems to go 
contrary to what you write there about the Minister.    
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 79 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson understand in answering the 
question that I have my views on this thing, I have my 
views.  What Ms Mabude’s said there is what ...said, I 
mean this was not the first time that I sat on a public sector 
board but it certainly was the first time I sat on a board the 
size of Eskom.  So – and I mean much as I am – I believe 
not necessarily a novice to governance sitting and listening 
to Ms Mabude remember she – Ms Mabude had been on the 
board before.  Ms Mabude  - Ms Mabude was in the second 
term as was Mr Tsotsi.   
10 
So I would be taking guidance on how things are 
done on a board the size of Eskom.  So yes I say the 
Minister also addressed the board once again expressing her 
concerns.  The Minister conceded that she had no rights.   
So if the question Chairperson is my view between 
what Ms Mabude said and what the Minister is doing, I do 
not know that I really have an opinion.  Remember I knew 
not as a board member but new in public sector and the 
person making the statement who was Ms Mabude yesterday 
when I listened to it maybe previously they had had 
20 
interaction with where they had been told you know it is a 
board decision.  Go to the Minister and do not pull the – I do 
not know – I cannot talk to that.   
I typically the share – my view the shareholder 
representative is the person who would come and speak to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 80 of 240 
 
us which was the right thing.  I hope I am making myself 
clear and I hope I am not – because I mean I listened to Ms 
Mabude and you would even hear I think your question even 
was so – why did nobody say anything?   
The real question is, having not served on a 
government board this size maybe this was how it was being 
done.  This is the – it is Ms Mabude has not come here 
yesterday she has been here before.   
So I am not sure where she is coming from.  Maybe 
there has been challenges around that particular point 
10 
before I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Well Ms Klein what – what we are – 
the proposition if it is a proposition even but look at it this 
way.  We – we are outside the meeting third parties, we are 
not in the meeting.   
The board members are there in the meeting.  They 
have just met with the Minister and after the Minister they 
are talking about the suspension of the executives.  And Mr 
Tsotsi has said this was an instruction from the President.  
The President wants this to be done.  And the Minister was 
20 
also here.   
You heard on the audio that the Minister had given 
guidance.  And I asked Mr Tsotsi what was the guidance.  He 
said it was proceed with the inquiry, proceed with the 
suspension.  In that context with the group in the board room 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 81 of 240 
 
one of the members says, we should not.  He is warning all 
of you.  We should not use – mention the name of the 
President.  We should not mention the name of the Minister.  
We must protect our leaders.   
It is in that context I am saying this statement does 
not seem to be a correct reflection of what the Minister might 
have said to the board.  In fact if you listened to Mr Tsotsi 
and read his affidavit, he says exactly the opposite of what 
you are saying.  That the Minister did say we must initiate 
the inquiry.   
10 
You seem to touch on that in paragraph 31.G that he 
goes on to further say the Minister did say we must suspend 
an executive and added the Financial Director.  So there is a 
discrepancy there. 
MS KLEIN:  I hear that Chair but please understand from my 
side.  Mr Tsotsi went out to meet the Minister.  I am not sure 
if these things were discussed outside of the meeting or not.  
I can only talk to what I remember and what I saw in minutes 
or what I remember seeing.  I mean when I said the Minister 
conceded that she had no right to instruct the board.  That is 
20 
what I believe that I heard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think what Mr Seleka is doing is to 
give you an opportunity to reflect on what you have said 
happened at the meeting or what the Minister – what you 
have said the Minister said.  Reflect on it in the light of what 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 82 of 240 
 
he is telling you about what Mr Tsotsi said for example.  And 
see whether you say no, what Mr Tsotsi says insofar as it is 
inconsistent with what I am saying here is not true or 
whether you are saying well I believe that this is what was 
said but I am not going to say definitely what Mr Tsotsi says 
was said was did not happen.  But on my recollection, this 
was said.  So it is just to see where the differences are 
between your version of what happened and Mr Tsotsi’s 
version and be able to say, here I have – here are the things 
that I remember quite well.  This did happen. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This I think did happen but I am not sure. 
That did not happen.  That is the kind of .. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the opportunity – that is what he is 
– he wants you to do – to say.  How much of this can we take 
as definite in terms of your recollection? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson this is how I recall it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I heard Mr Tsotsi yesterday and I am not sure 
20 
that what Mr Tsotsi spoke about yesterday definitely was not 
discussed in my… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KLEIN:  That much I can say.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 83 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  Whether it was or actually did not happen I 
cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS KLEIN:  But this is my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KLEIN:   But then just to – I do not think I have 
answered Chair on the point of Ms Mabude saying that we 
have got to protect our leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Protect. 
MS KLEIN:  She did say that and I have given you my 
10 
answer to how I saw it at the time.  Remember I have never 
come into any board and said because I am new I am not 
going to take the position. Because you listen to all those 
tapes.  I – my voice is heard.  I had many ideas because I 
normally am quite vocal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  But I cannot – I mean I still believe that the 
Minister said she is not here to instruct us.  Whether there 
was another discussion where that was direct or whether 
there is a recording which you can say to me, but hold on 
20 
here we have got it the Minister said it.  Sir I do not – I do 
not perceive – I do not recollect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  So – but you cannot 
say well just to be clear on it you cannot say that Mr Tsotsi 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 84 of 240 
 
does not give a correct version of what the Minister said.  
Because you cannot recall exactly what the Minister said. 
MS KLEIN:  No.  I cannot – I cannot recall but you know 
stood out for me yesterday when we – when we speaking.  I 
mean when I was sitting here listening.  The one thing I 
cannot remember and this is – so I am not sure that I am 
hurting anybody but this is inquisitorial you asking me.  I do 
not 
remember 
the 
Minister 
talking 
about 
the 
Finance 
Director.  That part I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  Because you – you read in my affidavit which I 
am sure you are going to come to later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  My recollection of how we got to the fore is very 
different to Mr Tsotsi saying that the Minister added to the 
list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that would be important so Mr 
Seleka will know whether he will invite you to tell us now 
your recollection or later.  But we ought to hear what your 
own recollection of how the Financial Director got added to 
20 
the list. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  So but the three 
were mentioned. 
MS KLEIN:  Are you talking about is the Minister taking. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because you say you do not recall the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 85 of 240 
 
Minister mentioning the FD the Financial Director. 
MS KLEIN:  Chair remember the question if I understood it 
correctly was that is it correct that the Minister spoke about 
the three and added the Finance Director and I am saying to 
you my recollection was that the Minister said she would 
support whatever the board decided was necessary to do.  
That is how I remember it.  Okay.  The – my recollection of 
who and why is not at all as Mr Tsotsi. That is not my 
recollection.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So what is your recollection of how it 
10 
came about the Financial Director was – Director’s name 
was added? 
MS KLEIN:  Can I maybe talk to the suspensions in its – and 
then show you where for me I maybe am struggling with my 
own recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Or maybe we leave… 
MS KLEIN:  We jumping. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We leave that you – you are going to deal 
with various matters when you come to that point of 
suspension. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you can … 
MS KLEIN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with that.   
MS KLEIN:  I will do. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 86 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Seleka can just guide you on the 
aspects you need to deal with. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. Thank you Chairperson.  Now 
Ms Klein I also want to refer you to Doctor Ngubane’s 
affidavit.   
MS KLEIN:  Is that here too? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it is in your bundle.   
MS KLEIN:  Oh in my bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it is in your bundle.  But [00:10:44] 
to you earlier Bundle – Eskom Bundle 03. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  Okay I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson that on page 
601.  Page 601.  Thereto… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That cannot be 02? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  601. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I mean the bundle I thought you said 
the bundle is Eskom Bundle 02? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  03. 
CHAIRPERSON:  03 okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  03 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have it Ms Klein? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not have 03 here.  He is going to give 
me 03.  No, no I am sure they have got it here.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 601.   
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 87 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 4.16 Ms Klein.  So Mr 
Ngubane – Doctor Ngubane also deals with the meeting of 
the 11 March.  He writes: 
“The meeting adjourned to allow the Minister 
to address the Board on these matters.  The 
Minister came to address the Board on 11 
March 2015.  Minutes of this meeting are 
annexed.” 
And you turn the page to 602. 
10 
“Although the Minister did not direct the 
Board to suspend the four executives she 
raised concerns of her own against them.  
The concerns related to the War Room which 
she 
suggested 
complained 
it 
was 
not 
receiving 
consistent 
information 
from 
management 
and 
therefore 
it 
could 
not 
develop strategies to turn around Eskom and 
stop load shedding.  The Minister left – the 
Minister felt at the presence of the four 
20 
executives might hinder the investigation.” 
Do you recall that being said by the Minister? 
MS KLEIN:  I remember the discussion around the War 
Room. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Okay I will give you a chance. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 88 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But specifically about the Minister felt 
that the presence of the four executives might hinder the 
investigation. 
MS KLEIN:  I must say Chairperson I cannot recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  I cannot recall that specific event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have also recently received the 
affidavit from the Company Secretary which is not yet part of 
10 
the bundles. Chair we have copies I believe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Only one copy we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  That is fine but you can… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can make copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Read the relevant part or point out the 
points she makes or he makes to her for her to comment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To comment on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will hand you a copy because the 
20 
Company Secretary was also in that meeting with the 
Minister.   
“In the meeting the Minister – in the meeting with 
the Minister the following matters were discussed.   
1. The bargaining device. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 89 of 240 
 
2. The Minister stated that she had no right to 
instruct the Board on what to do and that the 
meeting was…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talk closer to the microphone.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And tell us what paragraph so that those 
who might wish to look at the relevant part later know which 
paragraph. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 13 of this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She mentioned that  
“She is aware that after the establishment of 
the War Room the Board had sought or fallen 
by the way side.  The Minister stated that the 
last War Room meeting had demonstrated 
that even information which comes from 
Eskom was not reliable.” 
And it goes on to the next page, paragraph 13.5  he writes? 
“The 
Minister 
said 
in 
order 
not 
to 
compromise the investigation the executives 
20 
who were involved must step aside for the 
duration of the investigation.  And a report by 
the forensic investigators may be given in 
three months’ time even if it was an interim 
report.” 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 90 of 240 
 
So that is the affidavit of Mr Malesela Phukubje.  He says 
two things you can hear.  The Minister instructs – said he will 
not instruct the Board but the Minister again also says in 
order not to compromise the investigation the executives who 
were involved must step aside for the duration of the 
investigation.  Any recollection on – or comment on your part 
in regard to that? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson like I said to you I remember the 
Minister saying she cannot instruct us.  I do not remember 
her saying – okay I remember her talking about the four 
10 
executives but the detail around it I just – I cannot remember 
after five years. Unless I go and listen to the recording.  But 
if that – look Malesela was the Chair – was the secretary I do 
not think he would get it wrong.  And he is saying it and it 
looks like Doctor Ben said it.  So then I have got to concede 
that that was then being said.  It is not covered in my – I did 
not remember it like that but then I have got to accept that 
that would be the right version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We not have the recordings of that 
meeting. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson even if you do not have the 
recording the fact that I do not remember this – and this is 
the best of my recollection but I doubt that Malesela would 
have gotten it wrong.  He was the Company Secretary and 
Doctor Ben clearly maybe made better notes than me I do 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 91 of 240 
 
not know.  I will concede Chairperson that that probably then 
was said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you support the establishment of the 
inquiry and the suspension of the executives? 
MS KLEIN:  I absolute supported the inquiry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The suspension? 
MS KLEIN:  I would be lying if I said to you I did not.  I 
supported it – sorry Chairperson.  I supported it for reasons 
that I have articulated in my affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What are the reasons? 
10 
MS KLEIN:  I remember that the Chairperson gave us 
reasons why he believed that the suspensions ought to 
happen.  And he gave us reasons for the FD which is the part 
– remember the earlier question about the Minister and the 
FD?  I could not remember that part.  I really – and listening 
to that I am not sure if it was three or four because so no I 
do not remember it.   
But I remember the Chairperson telling us that there 
are four people that needed to be – that in his view would be 
best if they were not there.  And the one person – there was 
20 
some 
– 
something 
the 
person 
had 
done 
which 
was 
inappropriate and that was the reason given.   
The second one was the FD he actually gave us a 
reason for the FD by saying she was involved with some – 
there was some tender and apparently, she had gotten 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 92 of 240 
 
involved with it.  I do not remember – I do not remember 
what exactly it was about Tshediso Matona and – but it was a 
lot of deliberation.   
There were four things the Chairperson gave us for 
the four people.  Then there was a whole lot of debate about 
– Chairperson how can we just take it on your say so?  You 
telling us these people have done what you say but we have 
got no evidence to prove any wrongdoing. Why would we 
based on what you saying just suspend people on it.  We 
cannot suspend people because you saying that there was – 
10 
let us say tender rigging or not tender rigging but you spoke 
to somebody about procurement.  I mean we do not have 
sufficient to suspend people based on that.   
There was a lot of toing and froing.  Eventually the 
agreement was to suspend people – I am going to take that 
back.  Not suspend but to ask them to step aside for the 
tenure of the – of the investigation because we were told you 
have three months which ended at the end of June.  This is 
what the Chairperson told us.   
And his view was that if the people were there, they 
20 
may slow down the investigation which by this time we told 
we had three months to do.  So if you ask me if I was going 
to support it I was going to support it not because of 
wrongdoing but because I believed that an inquiry of this 
nature which we were told was what it was going to be was 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 93 of 240 
 
for me the line in the sand that I would be able to then 
determine so what is real and what is not.  War Room is 
saying 
one 
thing. 
 
Executives 
saying 
another 
thing.  
Chairperson is saying another thing.  
 As a Board Member brought in and charged with 
turning this organisation around an inquiry would help us to 
get to what exactly we were dealing with.   
So I was left with supporting the suspensions on the 
basis that the people would step aside and there was even a 
– I think there was a meeting with the – with a legal person 
10 
Neil to say what does step aside mean?  Can we ask people 
to step aside so that they do not slow down this inquiry?  
Because we were – the one thing that was clear Chairperson 
is that it had to be done by the end of June.  And that was 
my reason.  The reason I supported it was very simply the 
complexity, the fact that this was falling apart and we did not 
have money.  And we needed to get a grip on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we are at one o’clock.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you said earlier on Ms Klein that the 
20 
board found itself in a position where it was not receiving 
information on a formal or official basis with regard to among 
other things the War Room and so on.   
But the more I think about what the picture that 
seems to emerge in relation to Eskom at the time it looks like 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 94 of 240 
 
it was quite a confusing picture.  Because you have the 
management of the entity of Eskom.  They are supposed to 
run the day to day operations of the company and the CEO 
must give you know strategic direction and all of that to the 
entity.  
You have got the board which is as I understand it the 
highest authority in the entity.  You know you have got the 
shareholder represented by the Minister and then the 
President appointed or set up the War Room.   
So the War Room was meant to grapple with the 
10 
challenges of Eskom relating to load shedding but of course 
doing that might mean you look at a lot that was happening 
at Eskom to answer the question why can load shedding not 
be sorted out?  What is preventing it from being sorted out?  
So there would be a question of who must the War Room 
interact with?  Must it interact with the Board and the Board 
interacts with the management, the executives?  Or must it 
interact with the executives; bypass the Board?   
What if the War Room says one thing and the Board 
says something else or what are the executives supposed to 
20 
do?  And then while you are looking at that there is another 
meeting taking place in Durban where the Chairperson of the 
Eskom Board is invited.   
And it seems that the person who is nominating the 
discussions in that meeting or is leading the discussion is 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 95 of 240 
 
somebody who has nothing to do with Eskom.  It is somebody 
who is Chairperson of another SOE.  The Minister who is the 
shareholder representative is also not there.   
So now you have the War Room that side.  You have 
got the Durban meeting.  You have got the Board.  It must 
have been tricky to know who does what?  Who – who is 
driving in which lane?  And it might – must have also been 
quite tough for the executives I would imagine.  But anyway. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it an opportune time Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it an opportune time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think it is.  Let us take the lunch 
break.  I do not know Mr Seleka I know that you announced 
yesterday that Doctor Ngubane would start his evidence this 
afternoon. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether we will get to him or 
not.  I am just saying you might with to assess the situation 
depending on how far you think you will go with Ms Klein. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course it is important to deal with all 
important issues properly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that if we can avoid her having to come 
back some or other time because some issues were not dealt 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 96 of 240 
 
with properly we can avoid that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I do not know what Doctor Ngubane’s 
situation is but from what you told me he appreciates that 
even if he started his evidence this afternoon, he will 
continue tomorrow 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but it fine it may well be that we will 
start with him even if we do one hour or two hours. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is something on which we can add 
tomorrow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair indeed.  I could approach the 
Chairperson as it were in chambers and then arrange with 
the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  After the Chair and I have considered the 
way forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja no that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then we can come and place it on 
20 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  Okay we will adjourn 
and we will resume at five past two.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 97 of 240 
 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us proceed.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, DCJ, Chair.  Ms Klein, are 
you ready? 
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you? 
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the – in your explanation to the DCJ 
10 
just before the adjournment, there are a couple of things you 
mentioned that the Chairperson, if I recall mentioned four 
things about the executives.  He mentioned some allegations 
been made against – been mentioned about some of the 
executives.  You cannot recall whether anything was said 
about.  Was that the CEO and Matona and...? 
MS KLEIN:   Mr Marokane.  They were definitely.  I just 
cannot remember what they were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Yes.  So.  And you were also 
explaining that Mr Koko... Ag, no Mr Koko.  I beg your 
20 
pardon.  Mr Tsotsi, the chairperson, was proposing a 
suspension of the four executives and this after the meeting 
with the minister.  Now how does the Commission deal with 
this?   
 
Because you have the version from at least two 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 98 of 240 
 
witnesses who say the minister said the four executives 
should step aside for the duration of the inquiry.  Do we still 
say as the Commission that that is the proposal of Mr Tsotsi?  
Or that that was the suggestion put to us by the minister? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, just so that I am clear.  I want to 
make sure that I get this right.  Is the question:  Was it the 
minister’s suggestion?  Or is the question:  Was it Mr 
Tsotsi’s?  I am just trying to understand the question.  Maybe 
I am not clear.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can ask her Mr Seleka to clarify 
what is not clear to you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes.  And I can repeat it for you, 
yes.  Remember, now the minister following the sequence of 
events, the minister has left.  You have had the meeting with 
the minister.  She has left.   
 
You say – you have the version of what the minister, you 
say you recall what the minister has said.  I have read to you 
the affidavits of the two other persons including Mr Tsotsi, 
which will be the third.   
20 
 
Who is saying this is what the minister said about the 
executives:  Step aside.  Let me use the lighter one.  Step 
aside for the duration of the inquiry.   
 
So after that, you were explaining to the Chairperson, 
then you went into an in-committee meeting as the board and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 99 of 240 
 
you were saying, as I recall and you can correct me as well, 
that Mr Tsotsi then proposed that the four executives should 
be suspended.   
 
So are we attributing that proposal still to him at this 
stage?  Or as the Commission – should the Chairperson find 
that it would be more to attribute that proposal to the 
shareholder representative who was there prior to the in-
committee meeting? 
MS KLEIN:   That is a fair question.  My recollection was the 
motivation came from Mr Tsotsi.  So I must say I am unsure 
10 
Chairperson how, you know, who attribute the motivation 
about the people and what they did and why came from Mr 
Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what counsel is asking, if I 
understand correctly, is that we need to establish whether 
this was Mr Tsotsi coming up with this suggestion or the 
position was that the minister said the four executives 
should step aside or whether each one was just saying their 
view. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is in the context of what you say the 
minister said in the meeting.   
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair.  And I want to go back to, you know, 
the point – I hear and I fully appreciate Mr Tsotsi’s view and 
I appreciate everybody else’s view.  Remember, I am here to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 100 of 240 
 
talk about what I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   And it would be wrong for me to comment on 
anybody else’s view, alright? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
MS KLEIN:   My recollection was that the minister said we 
needed to do what we needed to do to get the inquiry done.  
And she would not prescribe how we did it.   
 
Now I think I have heard Malesela saying that the 
minister said something about the four.  And I think I have 
10 
heard Chairperson something about Dr Ben saying it here as 
well.   
 
I do not remember exactly what it was.  My recollection 
was that the minister said we should – she is not going to 
interfere in what we need to do but we need to go and do 
that which we felt was the best to get the job done.   
 
Do I recall the minister saying he must tell the – or 
suspend four or three, I think was the question, plus if he... I 
do not recall that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It is possible that the minister may 
20 
have said:   
I have no right to instruct the board as to what it 
should do but that does not mean I cannot express 
my view as to what should happen.   
But if I express my view, it does not mean the board 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 101 of 240 
 
is bound by my view.  Therefore, if you ask me so to 
speak, before I should step aside, but you as the 
board do not need to go along with my view.   
I am just telling you what I think.  But you must 
make up your own mind.   
Do not later come – go around saying that I 
instructed you to suspend the executives.  Is it 
possible that that is what may have emerged? 
MS KLEIN:   I think it is more than possible, Chair.  In fact, I 
think, if I hear you articulating it that way, what that is I think 
10 
what I meant when I said what I did in paragraph 30.  I think 
the minister also addressed the board that day: 
“Once again expressing her concern around the 
board getting a handle on the business.  The 
minister conceded to have no right to instruct the 
board on any matters regarding the conduct of the 
Eskom business.” 
 
So it is possible, like you say, that she – but – and I 
hear you and I know how difficult it must be.  You have got 
these 15 views in order to come up with one view of it.  But 
20 
in coming, you know, having three or four views does not 
mean that it change my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   Unless, I have got a minute to say this is 
exactly what the minute says, you know, in which case I will 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 102 of 240 
 
have to... but my recollection ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, the idea is just to see how clear 
you are as to what happened or what was said. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because when you have been in a 
meeting, when somebody afterwards - whether it is one day 
later, a month later, years later - ask you what was 
discussed at that meeting, there may be things that you are 
quite clear about to say:  This I know very well.  It was said.   
 
And it was said by so and so.  And this is what he or she 
10 
said.  Then there may be things where you say:  You know, 
my memory on this is not so clear.  I think it was said.  But if 
somebody said:  No, it was not said.  I would not fight about 
that. 
MS KLEIN:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there will be things where you 
say:  I think that was never said.  If somebody else says it 
was said, you will say:  No, I am very clear.  It was never 
said.   
 
So we are trying to establish whereabouts in relation to 
20 
those issues you might be.  Those where you say:  Here I am 
quite clear.   
 
Those where you say:  Look, I might not be so sure.  
And those where you say:  Those were never said.  So that 
is the idea so that we know. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 103 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Chair, but I have been labouring the point.  The 
one thing I know is – and I think Malesela – and remember 
earlier I conceded that if anybody had a version who give 
you the truth, it would be the company secretary.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS KLEIN:   So if Malesela says that the minister said... 
Well, I cannot remember the exactly way about the four. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Step aside. 
MS KLEIN:   Step aside. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Then you know what, I would be if you ask 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You with ...[indistinct] with him? 
MS KLEIN:   I would probably enforce the latter because he 
was the company secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   He would know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It had to pay attention to what was being 
said. 
MS KLEIN:   He had to pay attention to it.  But if you were to 
20 
say to me did I hear the minister say add the FD.  I guess I 
would 
struggle 
with 
that 
because 
that 
I 
would 
have 
remembered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS KLEIN:   That specifically, I am sure I would have 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 104 of 240 
 
remembered.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, well, I suppose it is neither here nor 
there.  Whether she said add the FD because on Mr 
Phukubje’s affidavit, he says she said the four should step 
aside for the duration of the inquiry.  Well, I refer to the 
minister’s own affidavit in a short while. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe let me ask this question in 
relation to the financial director.  Is your recollection that 
when the minister was talking about the executives, she was 
10 
talking about four executives or three executives? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, categorically, four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was talking about four? 
MS KLEIN:   I... Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are quite clear about that? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, let me put it to you... the reason I 
am so confident about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   I have never heard ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of three. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Of three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS KLEIN:   There may have been... I know I was listening 
to recordings last night.  There was a lot of deliberation 
around this issues. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 105 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS KLEIN:   But I cannot remember ever... my recollection 
was that we were given four names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what would mean, if you... what that 
would mean is therefore, that at least as far as you know, 
when she was addressing the meeting, the discussion was 
about four executives.   
 
So in other words, if at some stage before that there had 
been only three executives that were being discussed for 
suspension, at least when she was addressing meeting, the 
10 
fourth name had been introduced already.  That is what you 
said.   
 
Because Mr Tsotsi’s evidence is that at the Durban 
meeting, three names – it were three executives that were – 
whose names were mentioned.  Now... Or Mr Seleka, did Mr 
Tsotsi say somebody added the – add his name at the 
Durban meeting?  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it was not at the Durban meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  At the ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said it was the minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He does say it was the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Which would be the meeting of the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 106 of 240 
 
11t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, we could put this to rest by 
via the audio. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Shall we do that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  That is fine.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ms Klein, we will play an 
audio.  It correspond with the transcripts on... now I am 
using again Mr Tsotsi’s bundles because our pagination of 
the summary was modelled after his bundle.  That is on page 
10 
873.  Time stamp 11:17.  Sorry, you have the relevant page? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair.  Thank you.  
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recognise... sorry.  Do you 
recognise that voice? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, that was Mark Pamensky.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Mark Pamensky.  Please play. 
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is before this one Chair.  Are 
you on the same page?  Does it read the same? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, Chair.  I was listening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Have a look.   
MS KLEIN:   Okay.   
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, can we make sure you are at the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 107 of 240 
 
right place? 
[No audible reply]  
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that still Mark Pamensky? 
MS KLEIN:   It is Mark Pamensky. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it still Mr Mark Pamensky? 
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Carry on. 
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you... can you pick it up from the 
10 
transcript there, Ms Klein? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, sir.  Ja, I am listening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you able to follow what the 
conversation is there? 
MS KLEIN:   I am ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can just read it from the transcript. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  So where you want – which one do you 
want me to read specifically? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where is ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Where Mr Pamensky? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja.  This one reads... remember, even 
yesterday mister ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but just read it.  I think he is asking 
whether can the FD put pressure on the people.  Is that 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 108 of 240 
 
right? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   [Indistinct] she says no she has got people 
working for her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja.  Okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Tsotsi goes on to say financial 
issues are quite different. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The point you wanted to settle Mr Seleka 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought it was whether the minister 
introduced the name of the financial director, is it not?  I 
thought that is what you wanted to say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, we do not... we do not have the 
audio for the minister.  What I wanted to settle is what I 
understood Ms Klein saying Mr Tsotsi suggested all four 
names, all four persons. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When you listen to the recording from 
here further he, in fact, motivates against the suspension of 
the FD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 109 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well... or in terms of ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which means, he would have given the 
board three names as given to him in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, may I respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What may have happened in terms of the 
audio.  It may be that what he was saying, he was 
expressing his opposition to the FD being suspended but 
10 
that might not mean that the FD’s name was not on the table 
at that stage.   
 
It might be that somebody already suggest it but he was 
saying:  Now should not suspend the FD.  And then there is 
the question of who then would have introduced it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me leave it to you how you deal with 
it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, may ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Sorry.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 110 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let me just assist the Chairperson.  
You will have that affidavits... it appears from your affidavit 
Ms Klein, page 10 of your affidavit, paragraph 34.  There Ms 
Klein writes... the preceding paragraph is: 
“After the minister left, the board conveyed in a 
board in-committee meeting when Mr Tsotsi again 
presented his memorandum proposing an inquiry 
into corporate governance.” 
 
At paragraph 34, she says: 
“Mr Tsotsi proposed that those executive committee 
10 
members who were heading up the divisions where 
the inquiry would take place, step down during such 
inquiry.  He assured the report that he had compiled 
a report that supported the establishment of the 
inquiry.” 
 
So what... Ms Klein, I think she is at this juncture in her 
explaining to you Chairperson that what Mr Tsotsi had then, 
at this stage was saying to the board is that the fourth 
should step aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I am told that we should look at 
paragraph 36 but that is what her testimony says.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 111 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What do you then... well, it comes... the 
board members, you come back to this question:  How many 
are you suspending?  And... I should find this... yes.  Please 
go to in the same transcript at page 882.   
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, please.  Time stamp 22:26.   
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.  Ja, the one spot. 
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 882 in the transcript, time stamp 
10 
on the audio 26:26.   
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just go ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it that one? 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, that is that on there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does it carry on? 
MS KLEIN:   It just looks like it if I am following here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you are following.  Oh, okay. 
MS KLEIN:   Just keep on. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just read for us Ms Klein. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay it says ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The audio people ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   “Executive and chief executive.  While we said 
the FD, the situation is different...[intervenes]  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 112 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   ...it is not.  Right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   And the chairperson... it reads:  No, not 
necessarily. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is... yes. 
MS KLEIN:   And then the females voice, which I am not sure 
who said it now, okay.   
“It is what you said it said.  You said that the 
financial 
situation 
is 
not 
based 
on... 
do 
you 
10 
understand? 
“Not based on...   
Obviously, the problem here that it is because of the 
turf. 
But you know some of the sub-committees that I am 
involved in here is just so much of budgets in 
millions, in billions.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who... can you recall who said that? 
MS KLEIN:   I do not remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not recall who is saying that? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted to say, maybe we should move 
on and not spend too much about who introduced the FD. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And it is apparent here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 113 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is apparent on this very spot 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
[Audio recording being played] 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who is talking there? 
MS KLEIN:   The chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the chairperson.  Can you rewind 
a little bit, please? 
10 
[Audio recording being played] 
MS KLEIN:   That is Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So he is mentioning three? 
MS KLEIN:   That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that correct? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that... are you following the 
transcripts? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
[Audio recording being played] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So two males voices. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, that is Mr Khosa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MS KLEIN:   He said not necessarily...[intervenes]  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 114 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He said:  Not necessarily different. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then I think there is another voice 
also saying not necessarily. 
MS KLEIN:   That was Mr Khosa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So Chair, if you follow, they are 
saying, Mr Tsotsi is saying:  We said the FD situation is 
different. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There they are saying:  Not necessarily 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am ahead of you.  I have moved straight 
away from this point.  [laughing]  I think let us move on 
really. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us move on Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will sort out some other time.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughing]   
MS KLEIN:   Chair, please indulge me? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Can I...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what do you want to say? 
MS KLEIN:   Chair, obviously having been here yesterday 
and listening to Mr Tsotsi’s evidence ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I went away last night and I go to listen to it. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 115 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please look this side.  I cannot hear you 
when you look at that side. 
MS KLEIN:   Oh, sorry.  Is that better? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MS KLEIN:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said you went away yesterday. 
MS KLEIN:   I went away and I go and listen to the script 
because I also needed to make sense of myself, you know, 
what exactly did who.  I could not follow. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So do you have these audios? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   These recordings? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  That one I have.  But I think 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What you... you resolved this issue for 
you? 
MS KLEIN:   Let me tell what I... what was...  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Let me tell you what was very, very missing in 
this.  This starts, if it is the same one and if... you may have 
a different version and maybe in the interest of time 
Chairperson, I may want to agree with you that we can move 
along.   
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 116 of 240 
 
 
But the recording I have got start with Mr Tsotsi talking, 
Mr Viroshini Naidoo agree with him and he is saying:  Guys, 
we got to take a hard call.  There is a big portion of that 
meeting that is not on these clips. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please provide us what you have.  
MS KLEIN:   No, no.  That is not going to help you.  I want to 
check with you if what you have got is the same as what I 
have got because what I am suggesting is there is a big 
portion of that conversation that is not on the clip. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   Which is why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it may be that there is some more 
behind the scenes that must happen to compare? 
MS KLEIN:   Chair, I am sorry.  I will have to agree with you 
on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You compare.  And then when that 
is... when the picture is clear then come back. 
MS KLEIN:   With pleasure, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   I am sorry to do that but... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, that is alright, Ms Klein.  That 
help us get that information. 
MS KLEIN:   Absolutely, ja. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 117 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it was very difficult for the 
investigators to obtain. 
MS KLEIN:   I can imagine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then the board – if we move on, the 
board, 
regardless 
of 
who 
proposed 
who 
should 
be 
suspended, the decision is of the board.  
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ultimately the board makes the 
decision that executives should be suspended. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct?  And you have articulated 
your reasons why you supported their suspension, correct?  
Now the reasons that you have articulated for supporting 
their suspensions.  Were they advanced to the executives?  
In other words, were the executives told these are the 
reasons why we are suspending you?  I think you – well, 
let me give you a chance. 
MS KLEIN:   Remember, I had reason, personal reasons. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Being part of a board does not mean that my 
20 
personal view stands, it is the collective that then kicks in.  
The collective had agreed that the reasons that we are 
going to be dealing with it in the way that we did by 
accepting that they step aside and not suspend them on 
the basis of what was – and that is the piece of the tape 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 118 of 240 
 
that is missing because there were reasons advanced to us 
as a board as to why these four should be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were those reasons not simply what Mr 
Tsotsi said here, and you must have heard him, because he 
said there was a concern that if these executives continued 
to be at work, that might hinder the investigation, that 
might mean that some employees might not feel free to say 
what they wish to say to the investigators.  He said the 
suspensions 
were 
not 
based 
on 
any 
accusation 
or 
allegation that the executives had done wrong.  That is 
10 
what he said.  Are you in agreement with that part of his 
version? 
MS KLEIN:   Inasmuch as that what the board had agreed 
after deliberating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   And the board had deliberated on the fact that 
we were requested to charge people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   And the board said we cannot charge people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what you are saying – or are you 
20 
saying Mr Tsotsi, when he talked about the need to 
suspend the executives, the reasons he gave related to 
allegations of misconduct. 
MS KLEIN:   There were other reasons given why these 
four people had to be suspended.  The board deliberated 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 119 of 240 
 
long and hard, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Which is why I am saying part of that clip is 
not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is not complete. 
MS KLEIN:   That clip, yes, that we are going to – we are 
fighting for the FD and I know that because Mark definitely 
did that, Mark was concerned about the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:    The reasons given and, like I said in my 
10 
affidavit, I remember specifically one person was – he was 
improper with another person and therefore he must be 
suspended, the FD was involved with – not tampering but 
had 
engaged 
with 
a 
tender 
procurement 
which 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS KLEIN:   So we were given four reasons.  I just cannot 
remember the rest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but basically what you are saying is, 
when 
Mr 
Tsotsi 
proposed 
that 
the 
executives 
be 
20 
suspended, whether at that stage he was talking about four 
executives or three, he gave – the reasons he gave in 
regard to the executives related to alleged misconduct. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was because the board was not happy 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 120 of 240 
 
to rely on that, on alleged misconduct, to suspend the 
executives that in the end the board said this has got 
nothing to do with any wrongdoing on their part, it is simply 
to ensure that the investigations will not be hampered in 
any way, is that right? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, that is exactly how I remember 
that happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is quite interesting because, as you 
will have heard Mr Tsotsi, when he gave evidence.  One, 
when he attended the Durban meeting, Ms Myeni made it 
10 
clear that the suspension of the executives was not going 
to be based on any wrongdoing on their part and they were 
to be told that they were not being suspended because of 
wrongdoing, 
it 
was 
simply 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
investigation could be conducted without any hindrance 
and he said when he talked to the board, he talked along 
the same lines.  Is that also your understanding of what he 
said to me? 
MS KLEIN:   What he said  - yes, that is what I heard him 
say. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you are saying that is not what 
he said at the meeting on the 11 t h. 
MS KLEIN:   No, Chair, that was not what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He wanted to have his reasons for 
proposing the suspension of the executives was based on 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 121 of 240 
 
alleged misconduct on the part of the executives. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the board was not happy to go that 
route. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To rely on that and they rather preferred 
to rely on something – on saying it is not wrongdoing but it 
is to allow the investigation to proceed unhindered. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, very definitely because by this 
time – sorry, by this time there was a level of mistrust that 
10 
was now starting to rear its head and the board was saying 
look, first of all, is the meeting with the President telling 
Ms Myeni was here or was involved?  We are an 
independent board, I mean, how come you did not tell any 
us that you were going to go and have this meeting in 
advance?  That was the first concern. 
 
Now you are coming and you are telling us that we 
are going to suspend four people and these are the 
reasons.  As a board we cannot accept your version 
because we do not know if that is true or not, he cannot 
20 
just suspend people unilaterally.  If we agree that we are 
going to have the inquiry which by this time I think there 
was a literal agreement, you have heard me saying, I want 
– I would have liked it because there is a line in the sand, 
we know exactly what is going on in the business.    
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 122 of 240 
 
 
Then we cannot suspend the people because we 
have not got evidence of what you are suggesting.  Then 
we – it is going to be best for us to ask them to step aside 
while the inquiry continues.  That is my recollection, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is quite interesting because – so 
we – I hope one or both recordings – audios would resolve 
that because, you see, on the face of it, it would make 
sense for Mr Tsotsi to say at the meeting of the 11 t h that 
the suspension of the executives had nothing to do with 
any wrongdoing on their part.  If at the Durban meeting 
10 
that is what he had been told, you see?  
 And, of course, he said and you would have heard 
him, that although he was in support of the idea that the 
executives should not continue to be at work while the 
investigation was going on, is that he was concerned about 
using the label of suspension because that could have – I 
mean, if it had a reputational effect on the executives he 
said he was thinking maybe they should – be said to have 
being recusing themselves or that kind of thing.   What do 
you say to that?  To what he said? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   I am sorry, Chairperson, I cannot support that 
version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   The board were the ones who pushed back.  
The board were the ones who then got the legal counsel in 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 123 of 240 
 
to see if we could not call the stepping aside something 
else, it was not Mr Tsotsi’s concern for the staff that was a 
problem, it was the board’s concern.  So we would need to 
get that recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Well that might be important – it 
might be important to know exactly who took which view 
when. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Ms Klein, so 
10 
when you – in which meeting does Mr Tsotsi articulate what 
you say he was articulating?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely that the suspensions would be 
based on alleged misconduct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it at the meeting of the 11 t h? 
MS KLEIN:   It would have had to been …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you were not at the 9 t h. 
MS KLEIN:   I was not there on the 9 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   So my recollection is only based on what 
happened on the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   So sometime on the 11 t h that would have been 
discussed.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 124 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes but what confuses us is that you 
say you supported the suspensions. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say you supported them for 
the reasons you could say something about the two but you 
could not recall what is the position in regard to the other 
two.  So maybe you should tell the Chairperson why you 
supported the suspensions. 
MS KLEIN:   Without – sorry, Chairperson, without the 
allegations, is that you are …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, what were your reasons for 
supporting the suspensions? 
MS KLEIN:   Very simply put, Chair, here is a company in 
distress, here is load shedding at the cost of R434 million 
to this country per day, here is a going-concern problem 
which we were told there is only enough money – not even 
enough money to pay one month of running.  I said it 
earlier, R30 million.  If people who could potentially flow 
down the opportunity that I would have to get a view of 
how to turn this company around is asked to step aside, I 
20 
would support that.  I believed in my heart of hearts that 
this country could not afford to continue the way that it was 
going at that point in time.  Number one. 
 
Number two, I supported the Chairperson in the 
inquiry because we needed, as a board, to have a 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 125 of 240 
 
baseline.  You had a war room telling you what you could 
and could not do, you had the Minister calling and telling 
us from day one – and she said it here again, you must 
turn this business around, you have got a Chairperson 
telling you that these people have done all these things 
wrong, we have now argued the fact that we are not going 
to suspend them because we cannot prove that they have 
done anything wrong but maybe moving them aside would 
give me an opportunity to have a much different view in 
quite a shorter space of time so we can start turning the 
10 
ship.  That was my motivation.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, the inquiry aside because 
you could do an inquiry without suspending the executives.  
We understand from Mr Matona, who testified before the 
Commission, that when he arrived for his suspension in 
that meeting, you specifically said you should give us 
reasons why we should not take the decision we are 
taking.  He was not given reasons for your decision, he 
was rather – the tables were turned around, as it were, he 
being asked what reasons can you advise for us not to take 
20 
a decision.  Do you have any recollection of that? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I do not have recollection but let 
me put into context what I believe happened and what I 
believe would happen in terms of labour law when you are 
running a big business …[intervenes] 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 126 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but let me – because it is going to 
take long, all I want to know is, did you ask Mr Tshediso 
Matona, give us reasons why we should not take the 
decision we are taking? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I want to, but I want to answer it 
fully and I do not want to take long.  I want to answer this 
by saying to you we would have said that to every single 
person who was suspended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   And the way that the wording would have 
10 
gone, if it is on recording, would simply be this.  We 
believe that you being present at the time of this inquiry 
may slow this inquiry down.  We are not suspending you for 
any wrongdoing, give us the reason that you believe that 
that decision would be wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says you specifically said give us 
reasons, not anybody else but you.  That is what he said. 
MS KLEIN:   And, Chairperson, that is what I am acceding, 
I would have said that.  If I was saying that to Mr Matona, I 
would said that to everyone or whoever – remember, Mr 
20 
Tsotsi was chairing that part of the meeting, so it is 
possible that Mr Tsotsi may have said to me will you handle 
that part of it?  I mean that is not unusual in meetings of 
that nature. 
 
The purpose of calling people in when you are 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 127 of 240 
 
going to be suspending them, asking them to step aside is 
very simple.  You have got to give them an opportunity to 
tell you why you believe – why they believe differently to 
what you believe. 
 
Remember the board has agreed that they – their 
presence would have slowed this inquiry down. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Can I ask you then, insofar as 
that is concerned, just explain to the Chairperson did you 
have evidence that will impact or slow the process down? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I have not got a shred of 
10 
evidence except to say that this is what our Chairperson 
told us could be a problem.  That was all I was responding 
to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No but you articulated it as a view you 
held and you needed to give them the opportunity to make 
representation to you why they should not be suspended. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I think I am a little bit lost 
simply because it is standard practice, if you are thinking 
of suspending someone, you put to them why you believe 
that they need to be separated from you at that time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think – what I think counsel is 
saying to you is, you believed that they should be 
suspended, you must have had grounds or reasons for 
believing they should be suspended, you have conceded 
that there was not a shred of evidence suggesting that if 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 128 of 240 
 
they continue to be at work they would interfere but you 
say nevertheless you believed they should be suspended 
because the Chairperson was the one who had said their 
presence, continued presence could interfere with the 
investigation.  So I think what he is saying is but do not 
rely on what the Chairperson says because this is your 
belief now, that they should be suspended, you should 
have your own view.   
If your view is based on the same thing as the 
Chairperson but if you are able to defend it, you defend it 
10 
yourself, you cannot say the Chairperson said… I think that 
is what counsel is saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is exactly so, Chairperson.  When 
remembering that, you are a non-executive director, you 
have fiduciary duties and you will recall that Mr Norman 
Baloyi in the recordings that we must be able to defend his 
decision and I think the Chairperson has articulated that 
position clearly. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I heard that but I think where we 
are probably not agreeing is Norman Baloyi gives an 
20 
opinion of how he is struggling with certain things.  The 
collective then agrees that this is the way you are going to 
deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I cannot be based on my personal opinion, go 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 129 of 240 
 
and sit and say something different when we go into a 
subcommittee than what the board had agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Seleka is saying this is not a 
situation where you say the board made this decision, I 
had a different view, this is a situation where you are 
saying I supported the idea that the executives should be 
suspended and he is saying well, if you supported it you 
must have had reasons.   And then, of course, he has 
asked you was there any evidence that suggested that the 
executives would interfere with the investigation, you say 
10 
no, there was no evidence.  So his next question, you 
know, after this one, was going to be so why did you 
support it because there was no evidence, you say so 
yourself, so you suggest that if these executives continued 
to work there was no evidence that they could interfere 
with the investigation. 
MS KLEIN:   Chair, …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So now personally because you said you 
supported the suspension. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That must mean that you can personally 
defend you own decision to support the suspension, that is 
where he is, ja. 
MS KLEIN:   And I absolutely support that because I had 
already agreed that I support the suspension. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 130 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MS KLEIN:   But, Chairperson, what I think I am hearing is 
that in Matona’s – what Mr Matona said in his affidavit was 
that I – when he was called in, I was the one who said to 
him give me a reason why you should not be suspended.  
So I am responding to that by saying that when a board 
has taken a decision, forget about individuals, once the 
board has made the decision, unless using minutes that 
can say I do not agree, alright?  Then, once the board has 
agreed, then you go out and you execute on what the 
10 
board had agreed.  Whether you had agreed in there or 
not, that is unfortunately the way that it works. 
 
I had agreed that I supported the suspensions for 
the reason I gave you but when we spoke to Mr Matona, as 
we did with every other executive that was suspended, 
they were all asked, they were all told that you will not be 
charged but the view of the board that your presence is 
going to hamper or slow down the investigation.  What do 
you say to that?  Give us your reasons why you do not 
think that that is correct.  And that …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, let us turn 
to page 14 of your affidavit, paragraph 47. 
MS KLEIN:   37? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   47.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 131 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry, page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page one four, 14. 
MS KLEIN:   One four, sorry, I have got it wrong.  Yes, 
Chair, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because there you write: 
“To my understanding, none of the suspended 
executives 
were 
given 
reasons 
for 
their 
suspensions.” 
They were not given reasons, instead they were simply told 
that they were required to step aside, in order for the 
10 
inquiry to be speedily concluded and that they were not 
being formally charged.  So there were no reasons for the 
suspension.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there could be a situation where 
there are reasons but they are not told and there could be 
a situation where there are no reasons and obviously there 
are no reasons, no reasons can be told to them and could 
a situation where there are reasons and those reasons are 
told to them. 
 
So what do you say – but what do you say about 
20 
what Mr Seleka says namely no - you say in your affidavit 
no reasons were given to the executives as to why they 
were suspended.  Is that true? 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct.  Okay, Mr Seleka? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 132 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Was there a reason why they were not 
told reasons? 
MS KLEIN:   Chair, because the board had deliberated long 
and hard and decided we could not charge them for what 
we were told they had done wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   Which is why eventually the board agreed that 
we could ask them to step aside because I was convinced 
by the Chair that their presence, which is – he told us their 
10 
presence could hamper the enquiry and at that meeting 
with them, they were told you are not being charged but we 
believe that your presence here could hamper the inquiry.  
Give us a reason why you believe that is not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if they were told that the board 
believes that your continued presence or your presence in 
the workplace during the investigation will hamper the 
investigation, was that not the board’s reasons for thinking 
that they should be suspended? 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   But in terms of process you cannot just get 
somebody to go, you have got to tell them this is what we 
are doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 133 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   You can give us – now you have got an 
opportunity to tell us why you do not believe what we are 
doing is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I accept that.  I am just linking 
this up with your evidence that the board – that the 
executives were not given reasons. 
MS KLEIN:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But certainly if what you have just said 
is correct, at least prior to them being told you are 
suspended, the board did say to them as things stand, 
10 
before we hear what you have to say, we think you should 
be suspended because we think if you are present at work 
during the investigation that may hamper the investigation.  
Is that right? 
MS KLEIN:   That is correct, in exactly that order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   And then you give them an opportunity to say 
you are completely wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but was the decision to suspend – 
when was the decision to suspend them taken? 
20 
MS KLEIN:   Prior to calling them in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was taken before they were called in? 
MS KLEIN:   Of course, of course. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 134 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So which means there was already a 
decision when they made the representations or said 
whatever they were invited to say. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   You do, however, need to give the person an 
opportunity to say look, you have not taken these five 
things into account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   That is all that we were trying to establish. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Of course, normally one would 
expect that opportunity would be given to them before a 
decision is taken. 
MS KLEIN:   Remember, the decision was made to 
suspend.  You then call the person in and say this is what 
we are planning to do.  Give them an opportunity to 
consider what you may not have considered before.  They 
then come with their these are my five reasons why I think 
what you are saying is incorrect.  The board then goes 
back and deliberates and says is that fair or is it not fair?  
20 
 
If the board then finds but hold on, we did not 
consider these things that this person has put on the table, 
the board can go back and say hold on, we are not 
suspending this person for this reason.  So the decision is 
made but you must still give the person opportunity first to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 135 of 240 
 
give their view before the final call is made to either then 
suspend. 
 
So your question is a good one, the actual decision 
to suspend only happens after that engagement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The final decision. 
MS KLEIN:   The final decision of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, when 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at about – we are at seven 
10 
minutes past three. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Ms Klein, in regard to your first 
reason, the finances of the company and so on, we have a 
transcript of you at a parliamentary portfolio committee 
where you accepted that Eskom was downgraded, it had its 
first downgrade as a result of the suspensions you 
effected, as the board.  Do you recall that? 
MS KLEIN:   I recall that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that questions the validity of the 
reasons advanced in regard to the finances as the reasons 
20 
valid to suspend the executives, as opposed to resolving 
the issues, if you understand what I am saying? 
MS KLEIN:   I hear you Chairperson.  Can I comment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you may. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 136 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly. 
MS KLEIN:   First of all I was under oath at Parliament, as 
I am here today.  I did make the comment that we had our 
first downgrade as a result…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the suspension. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, ja, thank you Chair.  The day in 
Parliament, obviously I was overwhelmed as well, actually 
that was not – so I will want to put it on record, that was 
not our first downgrade, our first downgrade happened in 
November of 2014.  The reason that we were having 
10 
financial difficulty is because after the first Moody’s 
downgrade in November of 2014, Eskom could no longer 
raise bonds.  People were dumping Eskom bonds a dime a 
dozen…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, if I may? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you saying then, as a result of the 
suspensions there was a second downgrade? 
MS KLEIN:   A second downgrade, that I’m going to 
concede. 
20 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Which 
was 
caused 
by 
the 
suspensions? 
MS KLEIN:   That is certainly something that was my view 
then, and it still is my view now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  You know of Mr Linnell? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 137 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you heard the audio clips being 
played yesterday. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That he was involved at the request of 
the President, to draft these proposals and the proposed 
resolutions, you are aware of that? 
MS KLEIN:   I’m aware of it now sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were not aware of it then? 
MS KLEIN:   At the time, we were not aware that Mr Linnell 
10 
had drafted anything, it only became public knowledge 
after. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Mr Tsotsi did say that, that he’s 
been instructed by the President to ask the Board to 
appoint Mr Linnell as the coordinator of the entire process. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay, Chairperson, I think where I may be a 
bit lost is, maybe we must just be more specific on when I 
became aware of what because at the time when I got the 
resolution or the overview on the evening of the 8 t h, 
nowhere there was Mr Linnell’s name mentioned. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it’s fine, let me accelerate it 
then…[intervenes]. 
MS KLEIN:   Please do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 11 t h of March Mr Linnell is 
present in the meeting after the Minister, the meeting you 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 138 of 240 
 
have as the Board after the Minister.  He’s present in your 
meeting as the PMG Committee where the suspensions of 
the executives take place, you recall that? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Linnell was said to have already 
done the groundwork in regard to the reasons to motivate 
for the initiation of this inquiry, do you recall that? 
MS KLEIN:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Tsotsi did say that the Board 
has been asked to appoint Mr Linnell to coordinate the 
10 
entire process.  You will recall, in the clip, he said, he has 
drafted the statement that the Board was debating about 
the wording for the media release, do you recall that? 
MS KLEIN:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I suppose that is also in your audio 
recordings that you had, correct? 
MS KLEIN:   Correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, Mr Tsotsi made it very clear to the 
Board, that, call it a request, call it an instruction to do the 
investigation 
to 
suspend 
executives, 
came 
from 
the 
20 
President. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes at that stage, yes, with the Minister 
having come and, you know, given us the confirmation as 
well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, this idea did not originate within 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 139 of 240 
 
the Board, it came from outside of the Board. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, I concede there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the executives are suspended, the 
executives are told the suspension will be for three months 
because the inquiry is envisaged to take a period of three 
months. Now, if they’re suspended on the 11 t h of March 
2015, you said it had been – the inquiry was required, you 
said earlier, it was required that it be done by the end of 
June. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who required that it be done by the 
end of June? 
MS KLEIN:   This is what our Chairperson told us on that 
clip, if you played that clip any longer, you will hear – and 
I’m sure if you’ve got a transcript, yes, this was being put 
to the Board by Mr Tsotsi to say, guys we’ve got to move 
this along we do not have a lot of time and the 30 t h – and I 
understand we’ve already done a whole lot of work, there’s 
a thick document of a lot of work that’s been done on 
Eskom and as a Board member that gave me comfort.  So, 
20 
it’s not like I’m sitting here today and this is the first time 
this is happening.  I think where I became a little bit – 
Chairperson, through you, a little bit disillusioned is, the 
Board was promised a copy of that works so that it would 
speed up our understanding. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 140 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but Ms Klein you will know from t 
the meeting that the Board agreed that, we don’t have a 
document, this is going to be our decision, we’re owning 
this decision, you will know that from that. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, this…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I can play the recording if you so wish. 
MS KLEIN:   I accept that but nowhere did I accept that I 
did no longer require the information that I was promised 
existed because as a Board member I believed in getting 
this process started and that this information, the work 
10 
that’s already been done, would help us as a Board.  Chair, 
you don’t need to play it again, I heard it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, and in fact, let the 
Chairperson now that, that was the concern of Mr Norman 
Baloyi, it was only Mr Norman Baloyi who was concerned 
that, Mr Chairperson, referring to Mr Tsotsi, you haven’t 
answered my question on the report, you recall that? 
MS KLEIN:   I do recall, I do accept. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that it was Mr – I mean not Mr but 
Dr Ben Ngubane who said, there may be a report or 
20 
document that’s not Eskom’s document it’s Government’s 
document, this is our decision and he proposed the 
resolution to which all the members agreed, do you recall 
that? 
MS KLEIN:   I do recall but that doesn’t take away from my 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 141 of 240 
 
point that we had been promised a document that the 
Chairperson said that we were going to get and that was 
going to help me understand the business.  So, I accept 
that Dr Ben said that, I accept that Norman Baloyi said 
that, I was still expecting a document that, I was told, had 
a lot of work that had been done on Eskom, previously. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But it became a Board resolution that 
we will forge ahead and make this our own decision without 
a document which was being referred to by Mr Tsotsi and 
that’s the point I’m making. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Chair, and I’m struggling to concede that a 
commitment made to a Board by a Chairperson, can 
unilaterally just move off the table because we’re agreeing 
to have an inquiry done.  There was a document that was 
promised to us and as Board members we followed up 
regularly.  Dr Ben is correct, Chairperson, you know but 
that doesn’t – nowhere in the minutes does it say, we 
decided we no longer require that because this Board was 
in a position where we were wanting to turn this company 
around, we were wanting to help turn the company around 
20 
and if there was work already done, that was also part of 
why we accepted Mr Linnell because we were told that Mr 
Linnell was involved with the whole lot of this work, that 
was my motivation Chair, I can’t talk for anybody else but I 
still wanted the document.  Mr Baloyi’s point, at that stage 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 142 of 240 
 
was, if you say all this work was done, can’t we wait to get 
the report before we suspend the people and I’ve already 
given you my reason for supporting the suspension and not 
waiting for the document but that doesn’t mean the 
document was never going to come. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, so, the suspensions are 
effected and we have learnt from the evidence that they 
didn’t last all three months, correct? 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry Chair, are we asking that the 
suspensions didn’t last for three months? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the suspensions didn’t last for 
three months. 
MS KLEIN:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, I see, in your affidavit,  you say 
that the – some of the executives asked for separation 
agreements or separation – or settlement agreements of 
Eskom but the executives have denied that they asked for 
settlement, separation of Eskom, they wanted to come back 
and I’m talking in particular the three executives, Ms 
Molefe, Mr Matona and Mr Dan Marokane.  So, let’s start 
20 
with Tshediso Matona, he takes Eskom to the Labour Court, 
he takes Eskom to the CCMA and he has said before the 
Chairperson, this Commission, that what he wanted was a 
declaration of unfairness of his suspension and that he 
goes back to work, you were, obviously aware of all that? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 143 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  Except for the piece that he wanted to come 
back to work.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, when he goes to the Labour Court, 
what did you understand him to be seeking? 
MS KLEIN:   No, I totally agree with you, any person going 
to the Labour Court wants their job back but what we were 
being given as a Board is that, you know, there are people 
talking to people, that’s the one thing Eskom has been 
very, very good at Chairperson.  A lot of people talking, 
voices coming from all over that says, I received a call 
10 
from this person and they actually just are tired of this, 
they feel their names have been besmudged by this and 
they just want to check out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, they do say that, that’s what they 
ultimately decided to do but that was not the position from 
the beginning.  Mr Tsotsi said, on reflection he believes 
that they were – the executives were being removed to 
make way for other people, is that what the Board did?   
MS KLEIN:   That’s certainly not, from my perspective, 
what we did Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So if there were no allegations of 
wrongdoing why was the Board not allowing the executives 
to come back?   
MS KLEIN:   Chair, you would remember my answer to that 
was that I had been told by a number of people inside and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 144 of 240 
 
outside of meetings that people were wanting to not wait 
for the three months, they wanted to leave. So, if there are 
other people saying something differently Chair, I don’t 
have any proof of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So – just by way of example, I’m 
looking for the passage in your affidavit wherein you 
explain that – ja page 16, paragraph 57 it reads, when you 
have got it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, did you say, 167? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 16 paragraph 57. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The top of the page, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is still on Bundle 02?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 02 Chair, yes, that’s 
where Ms Klein’s affidavit is. So, there it reads, if I may 
Chair, or should I give you a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I’m sorry, page 15? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, 16 paragraph 57. 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay, alright, I’m there.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says, 
20 
“With regards to Mr Koko, I was present at the 
meeting with him, he was the one executive who 
was not interested in leaving the employ of Eskom.  
He indicated that he wanted his job back.  Upon 
objecting to this, I was mandated with the Board to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 145 of 240 
 
engage with a senior partner of Dentons in order to 
establish whether or not Mr Koko had been, by way 
of the inquiry found guilty of any wrongdoing”. 
 
You see that Ms Klein? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read paragraph 56 – 58, 
“In this regard I contacted Mr Noor Kapdi of 
Dentons who indicated that they had not found any 
evidence of wrongdoing by any of the suspended 
executives. In order to address my discomfort, I 
10 
decided to engage with Mr Jerry Kaapu of Bowman 
Gilfillan who advised that Eskom could not keep 
someone on suspension if the inquiry did not find 
any evidence of wrongdoing.  Dentons also provided 
the letter confirming the above”. 
 
So, you confirm that, that’s what you did? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I did Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could you explain to the Chairperson, 
if Mr Koko said, I want my job back, you, as indicated here, 
took the trouble to engage, you say a senior partner at 
20 
Dentons in order to establish whether or not by Koko had 
been, 
by 
way 
of 
this 
inquiry, 
found 
guilty 
of 
any 
wrongdoing, why would you do that, why did you do that?  
Could you explain to the Chairperson, why did you go to 
find out whether there is a finding or not of wrongdoing in 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 146 of 240 
 
respect of Mr Koko? 
MS KLEIN:   I think it’s quite easy, Chairperson.  After 
about, I’d say a month or so into the inquiry, I as a Board 
member, and I think at that stage I was acting Chairperson 
of PMG, was told of various people making calls amongst – 
because I didn’t get any calls myself, making calls about, 
you know, we don’t want to wait this out, we are tired of 
this our names are being besmudged, we want to leave and 
because of that there was a special PMG meeting where it 
was discussed and a Committee was put together to meet 
10 
with individuals to find out, so where are they with this.  
We met with, I think it was with – I wasn’t part of the 
meeting with Mr Marokane, I was present with the meeting 
with Mr Matona after the CCMA meeting, after the CCMA 
hearing and I was present with the meeting with Mr Koko 
and that’s where I’m coming from.  Of the three people that 
I had been involved with in the meeting, Koko was the only 
one who said, I want to go back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, well I was asking a different 
question but now that you’ve said what you’ve said, Mr 
20 
Matona explicitly told the Chairperson that he was told, 
there’s no option of you returning, in the very first meeting. 
MS KLEIN:   Chair I cannot remember, I can’t remember 
saying that to Mr Matona.  The meeting that we had, had 
with the executives was to establish where they were 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 147 of 240 
 
based on the number of calls, we were getting for people 
not wanting to come back.  Mr Matona, I do concur had 
gone to the Labour Court and I think he said he met with 
Dr Ben and I think I was only part, Chairperson of the 
meeting when they started talking about settlement. So, 
you know, if you’re saying to me, Mr Matona said, 
specifically that – unless you tell me I was at that meeting, 
I don’t remember that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you were not one of the Eskom 
representatives who negotiated with him, or were you? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   No, I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were? 
MS KLEIN:   I was ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying that – or let me ask 
this question first.  He told me about two meetings, that he 
had with the representatives of the Board, he told me what 
happened on the first meeting, he told me what happened 
in the second meeting, did you attend both meetings? 
MS KLEIN:   I don’t recall Chair, I do remember meeting 
with him and talking settlement but I …[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
you 
don’t 
remember 
whether 
…[intervenes]. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, no I do remember that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t remember whether there were 
two meetings? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 148 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   Look if he says there were two…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether you attended them or not? 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, correct, if he says it was two, it clearly 
was two, then I’ll accept that but the point, I think, that is 
being made is that he was told his job is off the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no we’ll come to that. 
MS KLEIN:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, do you remember – is your 
recollection that you participated only in one meeting 
where you discussed his settlement with him, together with 
10 
whoever else from the Board? 
MS KLEIN:   I remember one Chair, if there was a second 
one I’ll have to go – I don’t remember it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
might 
not 
have 
attended…[intervenes]. 
MS KLEIN:   Or it’s possible that I may…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you may have just forgotten? 
MS KLEIN:   It could be either one of those. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that he said – ja he said, he 
was told, when he said he wanted to go back to his job 
20 
that, that was off the table. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I do not remember that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t remember? 
MS KLEIN:   I do not remember that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one can understand why that may 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 149 of 240 
 
have been his attitude because he had taken the trouble to 
take Eskom to Court and as I understand it, when he took 
Eskom to Court, he wanted his job back, isn’t it, yes? 
MS KLEIN:   I would conclude that also. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that would mean that, to the 
Board’s knowledge, Mr Matona wanted his job back then is 
it not – is it not probable that when he met with the 
representatives of the Board would it not be probable that 
he would say, I want my job back?  He has spent his money 
to go to Court, precisely to achieve that objective, would 
10 
you not accept that…[intervenes]. 
MS KLEIN:   No, I do accept that Chair, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it’s logical. 
MS KLEIN:   I do accept it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, obviously with the delay there might 
come a point where somebody who may have wanted his 
job back, might decide, I’m no longer interested from now 
on, so there is that but his evidence was clear, that he only 
abandoned the idea of going back to his job when – after 
he had been told by a member of the Board representatives 
20 
who were talking settlement to him – with him, that going 
back to his job was off the table.  He said he went away to 
reflect and then when he came back – came to the next 
meeting, he had accepted that he was not going to go back 
to his job because he realised that Eskom was not going to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 150 of 240 
 
allow that.  If he wanted to force Eskom to take him back 
to allow him back, he would have to spend a lot of money 
in Courts. 
MS KLEIN:   I accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand that ja? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, but my question, Ms 
Klein was, why did you have to go to Dentons to find out 
whether or not their – in order for you to establish whether 
10 
or not they had found Mr Koko guilty of any wrongdoing, 
why did you have to take that step? 
MS KLEIN:   I think if we were to put the date of these 
things into context, maybe I can answer the question more 
specifically.  By the time we go to, I think it was July – July 
1 s t or 2 n d, I remember I wasn’t Chairperson of People and 
Governance anymore, of the three people that I had seen 
which was – sorry two, I had seen – I’d been part of, like I 
said, sort of through deliberation or interaction even 
though I wasn’t there when final decisions was made, that 
20 
was the one thing.  The second thing is, I may have or may 
not have been part of two meetings with Mr Matona and 
both of those had, by now, agreed they wanted to leave.  
Remember, from my perspective, we were going to talk to 
people to find out where they were based on all these 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 151 of 240 
 
calls, but, I want to go, I want to go so I can’t even tell you 
exactly when that happened but regarding the Denton thing 
with Mr Koko, Mr Koko, when he walked in was wanting to 
talk about nothing else.  He said something like – when I 
walked in, I’ll never forget, he said something like, my 
blood is blue and I’m wanting to go back to my job, 
categorically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you said that the investigation was 
never aimed at establishing any wrongdoing on the part of 
the executives, so why did you want to find out from 
10 
Dentons if they had made any finding of wrongdoing on Mr 
Koko’s part? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson I think that was to give me more 
comfort as an individual, it wasn’t anybody else’s idea, I 
was uncomfortable at that time that there was only one 
person coming back and I wanted to be very, very sure that 
this person wasn’t found guilty of anything, bearing in mind 
as well, Chairperson, when the original names were put 
forward, Mr Koko’s name was put forward by the Chair, as 
having done something wrong. So, now I’m sitting here as 
20 
a Board member, in front of somebody who says, I want my 
job back and I want to know from Dentons, so what have 
you found here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Has there or has there not been any findings 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 152 of 240 
 
on this individual. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I was then – because I wasn’t Chairing People 
and Governance, Kwaito Mabude was Chairing People and 
Governance, she then told me, to give you comfort based 
on what you’ve just said, you phone Dentons, which I did 
and then Mr Noor Kapdi said there was no wrongdoing 
found in – in terms of any of the suspended executives.  I 
then said, okay well, that’s fine but then if this person 
wants to come back and everybody else has left, what do 
10 
we as a Board – what rights do we have or not have with 
something like this to help us in our decision making to 
bring you back or not bring you back. That’s when I went to 
Bowman Gilfillan’s to Jerry Kaapu to say, Jerry, how do I 
deal with this.  Here’s a staff member who’s done nothing 
wrong according to the investigation, who decides he 
wants to come back when everybody else has said they’re 
leaving, how do we deal with this and Jerry said, you can’t 
keep somebody on suspension if they’ve done nothing 
wrong, according to this, and your Board is saying bring 
20 
him back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you involved in the settlement 
negotiations relating to the financial director and Mr 
Marokane is it…[intervenes]. 
MS KLEIN:   Mr Matona? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 153 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, not Mr Matona. 
MS KLEIN:   Marokane? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
were 
you 
involved 
in 
those…[intervenes]. 
MS KLEIN:   No, I wasn’t, I wasn’t Chair, I wasn’t involved 
in Marokane at all and the settlement agreements with Ms 
Molefe, I also was not.  I was involved with one meeting 
and a discussion with her but the actual decision about 
what was done wasn’t defined. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was Mr Koko the only one of the 
10 
executives who had been suspended that you discussed the 
way forward with? 
MS KLEIN:  No we had discussed the way forward according 
to me was all of them in terms of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS KLEIN:  We had discussed the meetings I was part of – 
we had discussed the way forward with every single one of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja but that is what I was asking earlier 
on. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was saying were you involved in certain 
discussions in negotiations representing the Board with the 
Financial Director? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes I was. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 154 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Marokane  
MS KLEIN:  Marokane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Marokane ja. 
MS KLEIN:  No, no I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you know you… 
MS KLEIN:  I was not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  So you were involved in regard to Mr 
Matona. 
MS KLEIN:  Mr Matona. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Financial Director. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  And Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Koko. 
MS KLEIN:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And with regard to the Financial Director 
did you talk about her coming back? 
MS KLEIN:  I think at the time if I remember correctly by the 
time I was in the first meeting with her she had already 
decided I had heard via other Board Members she had 
already decided she does not want to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  That was what I heard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Whether or not that was true you will have to 
ask other directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 155 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  I can – okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  But Ma’am she says 
differently in her affidavit.  In the first meeting she meets 
with yourself, Doctor Ngubane, Mr Romeo Kumalo, Suzanne 
Daniels was there and even prior to that meeting she had 
written letters to find out what is happening in her affidavit 
which I will find for you and she wanted to come back.  That 
first meeting she says Mr Romeo Kumalo was doing most of 
the talking and there is a point where – and it is suggested 
10 
to her that can we not have an amicable separation?  That is 
her version.   
MS KLEIN:  I remember those words as you correctly say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I remember that.  But Chairperson what had 
happened prior to that meeting specifically with Ms Molefe.  I 
was told that she no longer wanted to be part of Eskom.  
That is what I was told.  So when I was in the meeting where 
she – where she had been asked about amicable settlement 
you would need to ask Mr Kumalo that.   
20 
Every single one of those meetings that we went to 
we went armed with settlement packages because that was 
what gave rise to a meeting where it was agreed that if 
people wanted to leave we have got their numbers.   
But I certainly did not start the discussion by saying, 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 156 of 240 
 
look you are going to leave.  I mean I do not remember that 
being the intent.  I at the time of the meeting had already 
heard that she had already asked to leave the organisation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if – I think Mr Matona or Mr Tsotsi one 
of them I think told me that the settlement agreements 
relating 
to 
the 
Financial 
Director 
Ms 
Molefe 
and 
Mr 
Marikane. 
MS KLEIN:  Kane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Were either exactly the same or 
10 
substantially the same as that of Mr Matona.  I would 
imagine save for maybe figures you know and besides their 
personal particulars certainly I understood what one of them 
said as meaning that just as Mr Matona was given a 
settlement of a years’ salary they were given the same.  That 
is how I understood what I was being told.  Do you whether 
that is so? 
MS KLEIN:  Chair without having the numbers in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  I can imagine it may have been correct.  The 
20 
mandate that the Board gave to the committee who was 
going to be engaging was to say that equivalent to a years’ 
salary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  But remember Mr Matona had only been there 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 157 of 240 
 
for a very short period and what other executives had which 
was due to them which was not the salary we are talking 
about benefits like their long term benefits, long term 
bonuses which was all due to them.  That would have had to 
have been paid out because I mean that was all they had 
worked for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  So I can imagine if without having the numbers 
in front of me I think that would have been the reason for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see you are saying that your 
10 
understanding was that Mr Marokane and Ms Molefe had 
expressed the wish to leave. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Koko wanted his job back. 
MS KLEIN:  That is my understanding yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now if indeed as I understand it to be 
the case Eskom paid them a years’ salary just like Mr 
Matona.  Why would Eskom pay somebody a years’ salary 
who leaves on their own when Eskom is happy to have them 
back?   
20 
Why does Eskom not say, well as far as we are 
concerned you should come back you have not been found 
guilty of anything.  If you want to leave then you resign and 
get whatever benefits you get.  We are not – we do not have 
a dispute with you.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 158 of 240 
 
We are not settling any dispute with you.  Why would 
– what would be the justification for paying so much money 
in circumstances where somebody must still do the job that 
they would have done for that year?   
In other words, if Eskom pays you a years’ salary and 
you leave, they will still pay somebody else for the same 
months so they will be paying two people for the job of one.  
What would be the justification?  Now I can understand if 
Eskom does not want them anymore. 
MS KLEIN:  Hm 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because then Eskom is buying their 
resignation to say if you resign this is what we will give you 
and you walk away – we walk away.  That I can understand.  
But I cannot understand it if Eskom has no issue with them 
coming back and they are the ones who just would want to 
leave.  That Eskom then says we will pay you a years’ 
salary. 
MS KLEIN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to explain that to me? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I think it is a very, very good point 
20 
that you make.  But do not forget that is why it was called 
settlement.  It was called settlement.  It was not them 
resigning.  It was them saying we are happy to leave but we 
want to settle with you.  We want a settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is the problem.  You do not settle 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 159 of 240 
 
if there is no dispute. 
MS KLEIN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You settle if there is a dispute. 
MS KLEIN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what dispute was there between Eskom 
and them?  Or between the Board and them? 
MS KLEIN:  Chair at the time they were – at the time they 
called for settlement.  I hear what you are saying it makes a 
whole lot of sense now with the benefit of everything that 
has happened.  At the time the Board felt that that was a 
10 
good decision which I supported as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – but I mean one of your duties as 
the Board is to act in the best interest of Eskom.  That is 
your overall duty.  Now an employee who wants to leave I 
take it as the Eskom Board if you as the Eskom Board have 
no reason not to want that employee to continue you will say, 
well we cannot force to work for Eskom but then if you want 
to leave you resign and you will get whatever benefits if any 
that somebody gets if they resign of their own.  We cannot 
take Eskom’s money for a year – I mean I think in the case 
20 
of Mr Matona it was quite a few million Rands. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would imagine it was the same with the 
other – other ones.  Why pay the – why are you paying that 
money if you have no issue with these employees and they 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 160 of 240 
 
have done nothing wrong. Why is it in the interest of Eskom 
for you to spend so money – so much money for an 
employee who decides that they do not want to continue 
working for Eskom to go? 
MS KLEIN:  I agree with you today Chair.  At the time that 
was the decision of the Board which I also agreed was the 
right decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see if I look at that conduct on 
the part of the Board in relation to the three directors.  The 
payment of so much money to them does not make sense if I 
10 
am told the Board actually had no problem with them 
continuing with their job.  It does not make sense.   
But if I am told the Board did not want these 
executives to continue or to come back then it makes sense.  
Then it makes sense.  Because it means the Board said look 
we do not have proper grounds to dismiss these – these 
executives and indeed Mr Matona had already gone to court 
to challenge the Board, to challenge his suspension.   
So in order for us to get rid of them we must give 
them call it a golden handshake or whatever.  We must 
20 
effectively buy their resignation.  We must say to them here 
is money; if you take this money you can resign and then we 
part ways.   
So when therefore Mr Matona says I was told by the 
representatives of the Board that going back to my job is off 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 161 of 240 
 
the table then that version seems very credible to me.  Not 
the one that says no the Board you know they are the ones 
who said they want to leave and then we paid them a years’ 
salary to leave when it was not what we wanted.  Can you 
see? 
MS KLEIN:  I do hear you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I see the difficulty with what you are saying.  I 
understand the difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  But I am saying to you that on my part as a 
director I was part of the decision that agreed to settle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Now if it was a wrong decision then it was a 
wrong decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I do understand what you say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see I do not know what – what 
conclusion I will reach when I have heard all the evidence. 
MS KLEIN:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is possible that there may have been 
a plan that was made somewhere outside of Eskom to get rid 
of these executives.  And this plan was sold to the Board.  
And it may well be that among the Board Members some 
knew the origin of the plan and knew a lot about the plan 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 162 of 240 
 
than others.  I do not know.   
And the plan was to get rid of these executives so 
that other people who may have been favoured by those who 
made the plan would be brought into Eskom into the key 
positions that these executives had occupied.  And it 
becomes quite interesting that of all these executives Mr 
Koko is the only one who is allowed back.  And there are 
allegations that Mr Koko had some association with either 
the Gupta’s or associates of the Gupta’s.  You understand 
what I mean? 
10 
MS KLEIN:  I hear what you saying Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in the end who was associated with the 
Gupta’s or not associated it is a decision one that I will take 
when I have heard all the evidence but one – one reads 
these things, one hears evidence and so on.  So there are 
those concerns.   
You know you will have one of these executives Mr 
Matona saying I wanted my job back.  I had even gone to 
court to try and force the Eskom board to give me my job 
back and they came and then they said that is off the table.  
20 
And I ended up realising that I did not have enough financial 
resources to fight a financial giant like Eskom.  I had to 
accept that I must just take money and go.    
And then you have Mr Koko seemingly just getting his 
job back very easily.  Okay.  You might be able to say 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 163 of 240 
 
something on this but I am just giving you an indication of 
some of the things that one is looking at and some of the 
analysis. 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I think – look I cannot argue with 
anything that you have said.  I hear you one hundred 
percent.  I am going to give you a personal view.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  This is my view.  This is not anybody else’s 
view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  I come from corporate South Africa where if I 
pay somebody R6 million I expect a certain level of 
performance.  Now this is not a discussion that has been 
held and it is – I do not even know that it is in my papers.  
That a personal view is if I pay you R6 million or whatever 
the number was that a CEO was being paid I expect results.  
One thing I did say [00:17:42] and I still maintain it so it 
does not take away negate what you have just said why 
settle and you will hear from others who they – you know 
who said to Matona he does not – his job is gone.  I cannot 
20 
comment on that.   
But one thing I will say is as the CEO I expect 
performance.  And I do not expect performance from six 
months from now I expect it literally you come in you study 
the company in advance.  You come in with all the strategies 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 164 of 240 
 
and after a month or two we start seeing a move.  That on 
the CEO.   
So I did not fight for Tshediso when – I mean nobody 
said to me that Tshediso wanted his job back.  That was not 
my understanding.  You asked me my question about how do 
I view it?  The FD great person as well but everything that 
came out of the War Room everything that we heard and we 
had heard that we did not get proper reports   
What we had heard from the Minister – there was 
numerous 
complaints 
about 
five 
versions 
of 
financial 
10 
numbers coming through.  So I am responding myself now.  
Okay.  In my own head are these people going to turn the 
business around?  I do not know.   
If I were the only shareholder, I can assure you I 
would not have kept people in a job that could not turn it 
around in the last six months or two years.  I am giving you a 
personal view.  And I am not negating anything that you have 
said Chairperson I am responding to what were my – what is 
going on in my head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes.  
20 
MS KLEIN:  I just want to also answer the question about – 
there may have been this grand scheme of get rid of people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I was not part of that.  I do not 
know anything about it. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 165 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No, no that is – I understand.  Mr 
Seleka I – I may have stepped your plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not at all.  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sure I have covered something 
you intended covering. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  No, no not at all Chair.  No 
disturbance at all.  Ms Klein you have repeatedly said this 
thing about Minister Brown that she raised concerns about 
the War Room.  Now I want to refer you to Mr – Ms Brown’s 
state – affidavit to this commission because she does not 
10 
say that to this commission.  She tells this commission about 
her meeting with President Jacob Zuma and that it was Mr 
President Jacob Zuma who raised concerns about the War 
Room.   
MS KLEIN:  About the? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About the War Room. 
MS KLEIN:  The War Room. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not herself.  I – I think we read this 
during Mr Tsotsi’s testimony and that is the file I have ja. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She writes: 
“I do recall having conversations with the 
then President Jacob Zuma about the dire 
situation of load shedding. He was concerned 
that 
the 
War 
Room 
was 
not 
receiving 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 166 of 240 
 
accurate information.” 
Now she does not ascribe that to herself i.e.  
“The executives were feeding their will or 
inaccurate 
– 
they 
left 
out 
the 
word 
information to the War Room.  He was also 
distressed by the impact of load shedding on 
the country and the economy.” 
Now that part of the War Room is attributed to the then Mr 
President Jacob Zuma.  The Minister does not say I was 
concerned.  I was part of the War Room.  We were receiving 
10 
inaccurate information.  Mr Matona was not performing let 
alone the FD.  So how does this commission deal with what 
you say were the concerns of the Minister that she herself 
does not say were her concerns? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I am not too sure how to answer 
that.  Short [00:22:05] I am not too sure how to respond to 
the evidence leader simply … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think what it calls for on your 
part. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is to reflect on what the Minister said and 
try and make up your mind whether she mentioned these 
complaints about the War Room not being given correct 
information as her concerns or whether you – she might have 
said the President has expressed concern about information 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 167 of 240 
 
being given to the War Room.  I think that is what it calls for. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might say I do not know she might 
have said the President has expressed concern to her or you 
might say no I am quite clear that she said she was – this 
was her concern – part of her concern. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes.  Chairperson I think that is very clear.  I do 
not recall the Minister ever saying the State President was 
concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  The Minister from what I am – from what I know 
because I had never been to the War Room was the 
representative in the War Room.   Because there were a lot  
of different departments represented.  But I do not remember 
the Minister ever saying in the board room – I mean she said 
to us on the day she met us.  She said it to us on the 13 – of 
the 11 March and there was also an induction session with 
us again telling us she has got a problem with the amount of 
information coming out of the War Room incorrectly.  I do not 
remember the President’s name being mentioned. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I interrupt you – do not forget your 
next question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will not Chair. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 168 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  [00:24:00] and step back to what we were 
discussing earlier. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to tell me what the Board’s 
attitude was to the executives before the negotiations took 
place?  Was the Board’s attitude that it did not want them 
back?  Was the Board’s attitude that it wanted them back?  
Was the Board’s attitude that it did not matter to them 
whether they came back or did not come back?  If they did 
not want to come back they – it had no problem?  And if they 
10 
wanted to come back that would be fine as well.  Individually 
and collectively.  What was the Board’s attitude towards the 
four executives? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I must say it is a bit difficult to say 
what the Board’s attitude was.  Maybe it is easier to say 
what my attitude was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – but I do want the Board’s attitude 
because in the end it was – it had to be the Board’s decision 
one way or another. 
MS KLEIN:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it may be that you – it was discussed; 
maybe that it was not – this attitude was not discussed.  It 
may be that you know it may be that you do not know.  And 
then you can – ja.  So I just want at the Board level whether 
to your knowledge what its position was to your knowledge? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 169 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:  To my knowledge Chair when we came in there 
we were working with people who had been at Eskom for a 
long time.  So obviously they – they had knowledge, they 
had more knowledge than any of us.  I mean we were new 
there as well.   
And I guess that had a lot to do with when you ask 
about the attitude of the Board why when the suspensions 
were first mooted the Board did not just jump up and say 
right just fire the lot of them.  There was a whole lot pushing 
back and forth about but we cannot discharge people.   
10 
We cannot just let people – we cannot just do these 
things.  It was not until we got to agreement that the best 
way if – Chairperson if you say that they are going to hold us 
back – they are going to hold us back, extend us or prolong 
the inquiry.  Okay can we agree?   
I cannot remember a time where the Board sat or 
certainly I was in any meeting where it was agreed just let 
them go; we will do better if we just bring other people in.  
The – I think the operation was much too complex for that 
decision to have been taken.  And I certainly never got that 
20 
at a Board level.  That was not the attitude of the Board.   
For me I had my personal views on things which I 
have already shared rightfully or wrongfully those were my 
views.  But I know the complexity of the business that we 
were running was huge and we needed experience.  However 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 170 of 240 
 
it was a business in distress.  When you look at a business 
in distress over a long period you cannot but look at the 
people who are running it.  But that is not a discussion that I 
have ever been a part of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And I guess if the position was that 
the Board – the Board’s attitude was we do not think the 
executives have done anything wrong but we do not think 
that they are up to the job that they have been given.   
One would imagine that then the Board would engage 
them on that issue. 
10 
MS KLEIN:  Hm.  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say that never happened? 
MS KLEIN:  That never happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That never happened? 
MS KLEIN:  No.  that never happened Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Mr Seleka I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not at all Chair.  Chair can I just refer to 
another point? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know Ms Klein … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at five past four let us take about – 
let us talk about the way forward. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that how long we are taking it is not 
just you it is me as well because … 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 171 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is the commission Chair.  We blame the 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to my own interventions how much 
time do you think you still need with her? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If we complete the suspension which is 
nearly done I think about thirty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then Chair we are left with the 
secondment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And perhaps we could deal with it some 
other time.  I will leave it up to you too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it looks like the two of you are having 
some communication that I know nothing about. 
MS KLEIN:  Sorry Chairperson.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what are your plans in terms of what 
she must cover again, cover this time around. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, we can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am available to work, to sit longer.   
MS KLEIN:   H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want us to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want us to have a common idea of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 172 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...how long we will go. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   Chair, if I may also with your leave?  Chair, I 
have not yet come on record.  I represent Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   I do intend to re-examine.  At this stage 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   At this stage quite briefly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ye 
10 
COUNSEL:   I would imagine about 20-minutes or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   Based on what the evidence which has 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is helpful to know, ja.  
COUNSEL:   We also found some documents which we have 
made available to you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   To the evidence leader? 
COUNSEL:   To the evidence leader. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine.  I was going to come 
20 
to the question of re-examination so that we have an idea.  
So leaving aside re-examination, how much time do you...?  I 
think...  
 
I mean, from my side if she is ready to deal with the 
secondment, I will be happy that we deal with that as well if 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 173 of 240 
 
the time permits.   
 
But of course, if she needs time to prepare to deal with 
that, that is different.  But I would like us to cover as much 
as we can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Subject to time constraints. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  We can complete the suspensions 
in the 30-minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The secondment... ja, it is a bit 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   An hour? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...winding and winding.  Maybe we could 
allocate an hour for it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So we could complete the 
suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Take a five or ten minute adjournment 
and then we get into the secondment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Ms Klein, would you be happy 
to ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Ja, I am comfortable Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So... well, if we go along 
with your assessments, that means about an hour and a 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 174 of 240 
 
half? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would take us to about... what? Half-
past ten.  Five, quarter to six or six o’clock.  Then there may 
be 20-minutes re-examination.  But of course what we can 
do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
MS KLEIN:   We can go up to where we can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may be that once you are done, we 
10 
could look at the time then.  If necessary, we could say the 
re-examination can happen on another day.  That would not 
be a problem to fit in.   
 
It could be that we could say tomorrow before the next 
witness, it could be that we find time next week.  I think that 
we could look at that... also look at that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think let us take some adjournment 
now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we come back, we will try and 
see if we can cover and finish evidence on the suspensions 
and then do the secondment and at the end of that, we look 
at the time and the situation and see where the re-
examination will happen today.  And see whether we arrange 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 175 of 240 
 
for another date.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is in order Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think everybody is still okay with 
that.  Ja. 
COUNSEL:   Yes, Chair.  Speaking from my side.  Given that 
we 
have 
made 
somewhat... 
quite 
a 
hefty 
bundle 
of 
documents available.  They are not yet part of the record.  
They will have to photocopied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
COUNSEL:   And that has not been done.  So. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So adjourning to another date for re-
examining might be more convenient? 
COUNSEL:   It is probably preferable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, that is fine.  That is fine.  
Okay let us take a short adjournment.  It is ten past or 
eleven minutes past.  We will resume at twenty-five past 
four. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that the discussion in y chambers 
suggest that we try and finish evidence relating to the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 176 of 240 
 
suspensions but the evidence relating to the secondment will 
have to be dealt with on another day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand, Ms Klein? 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Shall I 
proceed, Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Ms Klein, I had wanted to 
10 
refer you to an aspect of what Mr Dan Marokane also said.  
But I want to start with this.  Insofar as your concerns about 
the finances of the company where concerned and you were 
articulating the position of your background in banking.   
 
Well, that will deal with finances as well.  now if you 
look at what happened here, you mentioned one of these 
executives will give settlements.   
 
I saw one was in the region of six million.  Well, you see 
the... in your affidavit, you say that... page 14 paragraph 51 
and it starts on 50.  It says: 
20 
“The board considered the settlement request I'm 
delegating the acting chairman. Dr Ngubane and 
myself and Mr Khumalo to enter into negotiations 
with the four suspended executives around the exit 
from Eskom and in relation to their respective exit

packages.   
The authorization provided for the acting chairman 
and Dr Ngubane and myself and Mr Khumalo to 
enter into exit negotiations with each of Mr Matona, 
Ms Molefe, Mr Koko and Mr Marokane.” 
 
So we know that only three of them, you were able to 
achieve settlement agreements with three of the four.   
“But any settlement should be within the four 
parameters.  the final package to be negotiated 
shall not exceed a maximum amount of 12 months 
10 
package. 
 
Now you have mentioned... if somebody gets six million 
they must really perform their job.  So that view you hold and 
which you had partially expressed.   
 
The other view hold about this financial status of this 
company which were partially expressed.   
 
And then you are confronted with this situation which as 
the chairperson was saying but these people wanted to come 
back or if we accept in the situation that you didn't want to 
let them go. 
20 
 
But there is a settlement agreement where you part with 
three people at the maximum amount of 12 months.  If you 
paid each one of them - and we could look at the 
agreements... but you mentioned six million.  Can you recall 
whether the others also received in that region?  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 178 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   I was ...  Sorry, Chairperson, through you.  I 
was actually just using a number.  I do not know the numbers 
of hand.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But coincidentally, that is the number in 
Mr Matona’s settlement agreement.  
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  I think I probably used it cause because 
I remember Mr Matona’s.  I do not remember the rest of it.  
Let us put it that way.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But obviously I... at the time you would 
have wanted to know the exact figures in regard to each one.  
10 
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  Chairperson, remember as a board 
member, we would not have had access to any of what was 
the salary, or what the benefits that outstanding was.   
 
We 
would 
have 
been 
given 
that 
remunerations.  
Executive remuneration.  A gentleman by the name of Anton 
Minnaar would have provided all of that information to us.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  I am simple saying.  I 
take it that at the time you would have wanted to know what 
figures you were talking about. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Because you would want to enter into 
settlements where you do not know how much you were 
paying the people. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 179 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  In... this is all in Dr Ben Ngubane’s 
file.  But you know the settlement agreements.  For Mr 
Matona it is six million which equates to one year’s total 
annual cost to company remuneration package.   
 
So he departed with six million there who was merely 
there for five months.  You do not have to put somebody in 
his place preparing going forward.  That is Ms Molefe’s 
agreement.  That is also R 6 049 417,00.   
 
Except for, as set out in Clause 4.2, 4.4, 4.5.  
“Separation 
payment 
is 
fully 
inclusive 
of 
any 
10 
benefits, bonuses, notice day or any amount owed 
or that may be owing to Ms T B L Molefe.” 
 
So that is a little over 12 million.  And then you have Mr 
Ben Marokane.  His is 6.2 million.  R 6 237 634.33.  That 
takes it to a little over 18 million which Eskom parted with.   
 
It does not strike one as a board that is really concerned 
about the financial status of this company.  Your comment? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, once again, I am speaking for 
myself.  A company with a turnover of 375 million with the 
cost to run of 30 million per day.   
20 
 
I do not know how we conclude that this... I am sorry, 
Chairperson.  I have got to disagree that 18 million... I am 
not taking anything away from the point you raised earlier.   
 
If they wanted to resign, let them resign.  Alright.  I am 
not certainly not denying the point.  But in terms of so 18 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 180 of 240 
 
million for a company with 375 million turnover per annum.  
Those are not numbers... those are not even comparative.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, the point is this, as I understand 
it, you want to earn the company’s money properly.  As I said 
earlier on.  If the position is that the company does not want 
these people back, it is one thing.   
 
But if the company in his position is:  We do not mind 
them coming back or we actually want them back.  But they 
are the ones who say they want to leave.   
 
Then you say:  Fine, leave.  We will look for somebody 
10 
else.  We do not have to make a deal with you.  Resign like 
everybody does when they want to leave a company.   
 
And if there any benefits that by law you are entitled to, 
you will get those benefits.  But you are not going to get 
R 6 million when you decide you are leaving.   
 
So you keep the company money.  But it is different if 
the position is we do not want this person back.  Therefore, 
in order to buy their departure, we are prepared to spend so 
much because we are going to get them to leave and maybe 
also it is going to mean there is no litigation there.   
20 
 
It is a settlement.  So it is only in that context, I think 
that one is looking at that, to say when you can allow the 
person to leave, to resign without you paying anything and 
you say:  Okay resign but I will give you this money, so much 
money.   
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 181 of 240 
 
 
It seems inexcusable if you do not have any problem 
with the person coming back.  And of course even if you had 
issues to say:  Look, maybe this person is not up to the job.   
 
Maybe the proper thing would be to let them come back 
and then you deal with the process that is aimed at dealing 
with your concerns about his or her performance, you know.   
 
Because if indeed they are not up to the job, they are 
not going to be entitled to that kind of money.  They might be 
entitled to notice and notice pay or whatever.  But it is not 
going to be that kind of money.   
10 
 
So I think the R 18 million is as opposed to a situation 
where you allow them to go because it is their decision.  You 
are not pushing them out.  I think that part you understand.   
MS KLEIN:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have a problem with that?  
MS KLEIN:   I do Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   In fact, if may just... and I know we are all 
committed to time but if you can indulge me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MS KLEIN:   I think and as you are speaking, obviously, you 
are giving me a chance to also just consider ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   ...why would I even have thought ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 182 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   We were on, for me, a burning platform.  The 
country was without electricity.  We were sitting with no 
money.  Now, I mean, I understand Chairperson.   
 
Now you can say you:  Okay, you have no money but it 
is 
R 18 million. 
 
We 
were 
sitting 
with... 
there 
was 
pandemonium.  You said it earlier.  Instructions from, we 
heard now, the president, the War Room, executives.   
 
And there was a lot of discord there as well.  The new 
board.  So from my personal perspective, I was not going to 
fight it.   
10 
 
You know, if you are saying to me that was the wrong 
decision, Chair.  If you say it ultimately that was the wrong 
decision.  Then you know what, I will respect you for saying 
that but in that context of what we were facing – what we 
were facing at the time which was R 434 million cost of this 
country a day.   
 
Now we are sitting with a threat of total blackout.  If you 
ask me, some of the decision that we have made, I am going 
to concede today, could have been better made.   
 
And if this is going to be one of those where you say to 
20 
me personally:  You should not have made that decision.  
There would have been a chance for you to... then I am 
going to concede to that.   
 
But if you ask:  Did I pay the R 18 million because I 
wanted them, because I wanted somebody else in.  That 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 183 of 240 
 
was... if there was such a thing because I also heard Mr 
Tsotsi saying about meetings that...  
 
Remember another thing that we must not forget.  There 
were meetings being held outside the boardrooms that the 
board had no knowledge of.   
 
I cannot account for that here.  So I am going to go with 
you and say to... Please, Chairperson, I hope you do not 
think I am trivialising the point...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no. 
MS KLEIN:   Because you are making also what Mr Seleka is 
10 
making. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  I understand what you are 
saying.  But I think your approach seems to be that you were 
– you seek to justify the payment of the amounts that were 
made on the basis that you thought these executives were 
not good for Eskom to come back.   
 
I think that as I understand it, it amounts to that.  You 
thought:  Look, maybe they will fail to fix the problem over 
whatever years they have been around and they must go.   
 
We will look for somebody else who will maybe deal with 
20 
these situations better.   
 
And when you look at it that way, you justify it by simple 
saying it is worthwhile because we might get people who will 
put Eskom in a better position, okay.  Am I right? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, you are... you are articulating 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 184 of 240 
 
exactly what I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MS KLEIN:   From my personal view.  But from the board’s 
perspective the reason that we were looking at numbers, my 
understanding which had come to us from various quarters 
where people were asking to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   So it was not... so in my view, I was not going 
to fight to keep people who, in my own view, I would have 
treated in a particular way in the private sector. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS KLEIN:   But you are right there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So that is how you justified it 
personally. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you have said also there was no such 
discussion at board level in any board meeting and therefore 
nobody can say, I would imagine, that the way you look at it 
is the way the board looked at it. 
MS KLEIN:   Exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So one would still want to know, why did 
the board do this? 
MS KLEIN:   H’m. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 185 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka, we might not have time to 
cover what you wanted to cover but... so feel free to 
continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chairperson.  Ms Klein, 
you will be given the file of Mr Tsotsi which we used 
yesterday.  Chairperson, I am just going to read out to Ms 
Klein which is now the affidavit of Mr Dan Marokane.  Just to 
identify the file for record purposes, it is U17, Eskom Bundle 
02 U17, page 543.  That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you think I need to have a look at or I 
10 
might be able to deal without it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me read the file, file read to you 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in the interest of time.  Mr Dan 
Marokane writes in paragraph 3 Ms Klein. 
“I hereby confirm that following my suspension from 
the position of Group Executive Big Capital at 
Eskom on 12 March 2015, I reverted to the board via 
attachment... 
20 
 
And we will get to that letter now. 
“This letter addressed to the chairman of the board, 
Mr Zola Tsotsi had copies to the company secretary, 
Mr Malesela Phukubje was never acknowledged nor 
responded to.   
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 186 of 240 
 
Subsequent follow up letters from my lawyers and 
Eskom board also suffered the same fat.  As time 
progressed it became clear to me that the board was 
deliberately frustrating me.   
It was well into the month of May 2015 around the 
20t h of the month that I called the interim chairman 
of the board, Dr Ben Ngubane in the evening to 
indicate to him that I have come to the conclusion 
that I could no longer trust the board and as such I 
wanted to discuss how to separate.   
10 
By the following morning, that is after waiting for 
over a month or nearly two months, Dr Ngubane had 
already assigned two board members, Mr Khumalo 
and Zethemba Xhosa to have separation discussion 
with me.    
We concluded the separation discussions at the end 
of May 2015 and I left the employ of the company 
effective 1 June 2015.” 
 
So you see again there that the initial stance of yet 
another executive was to come back to the board and let me 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, do you want to look at the letters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us lead the evidence...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, to hear what he was saying in the 
letters. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 187 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what they were saying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The letter is on page 505 Ms Klein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe give me that... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Maybe I have the file, Chair.  It is a 
fairly long letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can just go to the relevant parts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The relevant parts, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That they talk about going back or 
something. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, that is page 
545. 
MS KLEIN:   545? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   505. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  No, I got that.  I have got that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are there.  
MS KLEIN:   I have got that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The portion I would like to read is on 
page 509.  His concluding paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think my registrar, does not... 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He is gone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is something he has not had. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 02.   
CHAIRPERSON:   02 is here.  I thought I heard U17 or 
something or is that the exhibit or what? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 188 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was at the time, I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, five zero? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   509. 
CHAIRPERSON:   509. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 26.  He says there: 
“If ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I do not have 509 on Bundle 02.  It 
must be the next bundle.  My last page is 490. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, no, no.  Sorry, Chairperson.  Sorry.  
That is my fault.  Eskom Bundle 07(a).  Page 509. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just go ahead.  Yes, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you. Paragraph 26.  Mr 
Marokane writes: 
“If the board... 
 
May I ... Chairperson, I beg your pardon.  The letter is 
dated 18 March 2015 on page 505. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is addressed to the chairperson of the 
board at the time, Mr Zola Tsotsi.  It is also for the attention 
of People in Governance Committee of the board.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of the company secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein, that would have been the sub-
committee of the board you served on.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 189 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you nod, the records... I mean, ja, the 
record will not capture your agreement.  You should 
verbalise it. 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry, Chair.  Are you asking me a question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am saying if – when you nod it is 
not being recorded. 
MS KLEIN:   Oh, I am so sorry.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   I apologise.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  That was the sub-committee of the 
board you served on. 
MS KLEIN:   Correct.  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Then we go to that paragraph on 
page 509.  He says: 
“If the board has an absolutely genuine desire to get 
to the heart of all Eskom’s problems, understand 
how those problems came about and how they were 
over time handled and/or is handled, then what 
Eskom needs to do in order to overcome its 
20 
challenges.   
I am willing to cooperate with the independent 
investigation on the basis that I will be allowed to 
advance and share my genuinely held open and 
frank views without fear of retribution or any other 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 190 of 240 
 
adverse 
consequence 
to 
me, 
my 
professional 
integrity, my reputation in the market place and 
importantly my career in Eskom and my anticipated 
and indeed hoped for career path within Eskom.” 
 
So this again is a man who expressed a wish to come 
back seven days after his suspension... well, he was 
suspended on the 12t h of March.  So that is six days after his 
suspension.  Do you see that? 
MS KLEIN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now did you become aware of this letter 
10 
at the time? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I can categorically state, I did not.  
Sorry.  I can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, just repeat it. 
MS KLEIN:   I can categorically state, I did not.  The first 
time I became aware of a letter from Mr Marokane was when 
his lawyer, Brian Khan, wrote to us.  You probably have it 
here as well.  I picked that up when I was going through it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Preparation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   I think... I mean this is just a view.  I do not 
know.  Unless you know differently.  My view is letter 
arrived... did you say the 18t h of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 18 March. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 191 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   18 March. 
MS KLEIN:   18 March.  But do not forget.  The board had its 
meeting on the 19t h of March with Mr Tsotsi.  And at that 
meeting, I complaint about what he responded and Mr Tsotsi, 
with credit to him because, you know, I think he operated 
almost as an executive director.  He was there all the time.   
 
He told us at that meeting that he had received 200 
emails to which he had not responded.  That is the first 
point.   
 
The second point is that when Mr Tsotsi left, I am not 
10 
sure what secretary did with this because it really only 
became... I picked it up when Brian Khan wrote to us which 
was after this.   
 
And I do not know if you have that letter Chari.  But it 
was a letter written to us by Brian Khan complaining that he 
is acting for Dan Marokane who written on a particular date 
and would not have any response.   
 
So if I ask me do I know this came to the People in 
Governance.  Chair, I do not know that.  I do not know that.  
But if it shows that if it was there, I cannot... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, I would imagine that because it 
is quite clear from the contents of the letter that it was not 
written to Mr Tsotsi in his personal capacity but in his 
capacity as the chairperson of the board.  If he left and then 
company secretary, I guess, would have said to make sure 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 192 of 240 
 
that his successor was aware of the letter so that he or she 
could deal with it.  Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   So Chair, if I may add?  I would assume that 
you would maybe put it the next chair, you know, was he 
aware of it.  Because like I said, I can only go on the fact 
that I knew that he had an overload of emails that I could 
spoke about this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   But, no, I was not.  To answer your question.  I 
was not aware of that letter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minutes of the meeting you referred 
to which we also to a large extent referred to during Mr 
Tsotsi’s testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we still need this bundle or it can go? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You still need the very same bundle 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because... may I add as we go there.  
You see the company secretary is also copies. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And specifically, on behalf of the PMG, 
the People in Governance Committee.  So you still say that 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 193 of 240 
 
that letter did not come to your attention? 
MS KLEIN:   I cannot remember seeing it.  That is what I am 
saying.  Maybe you are asking me if I know about it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   I cannot remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So this letter is dated the 18t h.  
The next day is the meeting of the board which you... the 
minutes of which you found on page 679 of the same file.  
Chairperson.  679. And this the meeting, Ms Klein, you are 
referring to where Mr Tsotsi gets excused and he... there is a 
10 
resolution that he should be subjected to some disciplinary 
action. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   IN that meeting or the minutes rather, 
there is a caption on page 680 under paragraph 8.3.  The 
heading is Suspended Executives.  And it reads... sorry, let 
me ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   680? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   680, yes.  Because at the ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Sorry.  No, I am at 580.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you ...[intervenes]  
MS KLEIN:   Just bear with me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   679, 680. 
MS KLEIN:   I am there, I am there, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, paragraph 8.3: 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 194 of 240 
 
“Suspended executives” 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it reads: 
“With regard to the letters from suspended executives 
including the CE...” 
Is it not referring to these letters one of which will be this on 
the Dan Marokane? 
MS KLEIN:   It could be.  Remember at that stage I do not 
remember seeing letters unless it came to People in 
Governance where I specifically saw it.  I cannot remember, I 
10 
do not remember that.  First letter I remember from Dan 
Marokane is the one from Brian – his lawyer, Brian, 
complaining about the fact that we had not responded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS KLEIN:   So with regard to letters from the executives, I, 
at that stage, had not seen the letters, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because both – well, all three of them in 
their affidavits explicitly say they wrote letters to the board.  
Now let us see what the board here says about the letters. 
“With regard to the letters from the executives, 
20 
including the CE, it was agreed that the position was 
clear that no charges would be preferred against the 
suspended executives at this stage.  The legal 
department was authorised to send a letter that had 
been prepared in this regard. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 195 of 240 
 
 So what does that mean?  That means the legal department 
had been instructed to prepare the letter in response to the 
letters of the executives. 
MS KLEIN:   No, I do not think so, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   Look, we are talking about the meeting of the 
19t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS KLEIN:   Which is a day after the actual discussions of 
the meeting.  What told me is that they had not gotten a 
10 
letter – sorry, Chair, I am looking this way  - they had not 
gotten a letter after the discussion.  Remember, we called 
them in and said to them give us a reason why you think that 
your presence here will not hamper the investigation – or the 
inquiry.   
They then gave us their reasons, we then reconvened 
and said look, sorry, that is when the final decision gets 
taken to say those reasons did not hold up and we were 
going to put them on suspension. 
 
They were not given letters at that stage yet.  That is 
20 
my understanding of those letters referred to there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was under the impression that they 
were given the letters of suspension at the meeting – or 
rather, on the 11t h because I think Mr Matona said or says in 
his affidavit – or somebody says in their affidavit that as the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 196 of 240 
 
discussions were happening, Mr Tsotsi had those letters with 
him. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think that may be correct because I 
think Mr Linnell may have prepared them the previous day 
and I saw in this letter that we just looked at now of Mr 
Marokane, where he says you gave me this letter of 
suspension and I pointed out that especially not true what is 
written here in the letter and I think he referred to the part 
where he says he made various representations and he says 
10 
you agreed that this was not true and we crossed it out. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, you are one hundred percent 
correct.  I am getting my dates confused.  I am thinking this 
is still the 11t h, so I apologise for that.  Which is why I am 
thinking those are the letters but then I have got to concur 
with the evidence leader …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The evidence leader, ja. 
MS KLEIN:   That that can then only refer to letters received 
which, like I said, I do not remember getting a copy of.  That 
I did.  But I am sorry, I kind of took us on a detour. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
MS KLEIN:   But I got the dates wrong, I am thinking of the 
11t h, this is the 19 t h, I apologise for that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Ms Klein.  Then I – let 
me go back to the point which I had asked you about, why 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 197 of 240 
 
take a step – which is on page 16, paragraph 57.  Now we 
are back to your own bundle. 
MS KLEIN:   My one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To your affidavit. 
MS KLEIN:   Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 16, paragraph 57.  You were 
explaining why you took the step to find out whether any 
wrongdoing on the part of Mr Koko had been checked and 
established by the investigation of Dentons.  And you gave 
the reasons why you did so.  But let us determine the 
10 
reasonableness of your explanation because you would know 
that 
Dentons 
mandate 
did 
not 
involve 
investigating 
wrongdoing on the part of the executives.  Dentons report, 
which I read yesterday, explicitly says that.  And this I 
wanted to understand.  If you say you took the step, on what 
basis would you do that? 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, but Chairperson, like I said earlier, this step 
that I took was in the month of July after all the discussions 
and everybody else had asked – you know, well, my 
understanding was, they had asked to go, I am hearing now 
20 
they did not ask to go, based on different evidence.   
 
Mr Koko – I think I said it in parliament as well, if you 
go and read my affidavit, I still say he is a very, very strong 
engineer, but as People in Governance, I got numerous 
complaints about Mr Koko with various individuals and you 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 198 of 240 
 
know, it is just his leadership style.  Which may be right or 
wrong, I mean, I never worked with Mr Koko.  And based on 
that and the fact that there are three people of the four who 
have left.   
I wanted to be one hundred percent sure that there 
was nothing in the report and I concur with evidence leader, 
I was here yesterday, when I heard that there was going to 
be no – I do not remember the exact wording, but we were 
not looking for to fight any wrongdoing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   But do not forget, Chairperson, that as board 
member, I was one of the people or the board was told about 
something Mr Koko had done and I wanted to be very sure 
that we had absolutely nothing that he had done incorrectly, 
before we brought the one person back.  That was my reason 
for saying well, hold on, guys, if this is the only person and 
we are going to bring him back, I want to be sure.  So let me 
make the call to – I did not ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not want to have a situation 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MS KLEIN:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] wanted to 
bring him back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, you did not want to 
have a situation where you allowed him back and then you 
were criticised that you allowed him back even though the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 199 of 240 
 
Denton report found something wrong that he had done.  
MS KLEIN:   Correct, Chairperson, specifically based on 
what the Chairperson had told us initially when he tried to 
motivate for the suspension, Koko’s suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   So that was the reason for making sure with 
Dentons that there was no wrongdoing.  That is number one.   
 
That still did not satisfy me, I wanted to make sure.  I 
then contacted Jerry Cappel(?) and I asked Jerry, Jerry, give 
me your view, what if it is me?  You bring somebody back 
10 
who we have now heard has done nothing wrong.  Can we, 
as a board – is there a way that we can say we are not going 
to take him back and he said you have got no legal standing 
to do that.  So that was my reason for doing that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ja, I will quickly find that wording 
for you, it is Eskom bundle 03, EXHIBIT U14.  That will be in 
your bundle. 
MS KLEIN:   3, U14? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom bundle 03. 
MS KLEIN:   Oh, I have got it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Page 649. 
MS KLEIN:   Ja, got it.  Got it, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The first thing I want to say, Ms 
Klein, or draw your attention to is what Dentons itself writes 
on page 652, paragraph 4.7.  Dentons writes: 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 200 of 240 
 
“The minutes of the meeting of the board on 31 
March 2015 authorising the investigation records as 
follows.  The terms of reference were based on the 
audit.  Members were generally comfortable with the 
terms of reference in that they adequately addressed 
all the issues the board wanted to be dealt with.” 
Do you see that? 
MS KLEIN:   I see that.  I see that, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You would have seen those terms of 
reference. 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I was not a member of audit and 
risk. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, my question is, you would have seen 
the terms of reference. 
MS KLEIN:   No the final terms of reference, that was 
designed by audit and risk. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Are you saying you did not see 
the terms of reference? 
MS KLEIN:   There was a terms of reference that was sent 
out, a draft, which I gave input to.  Audit and risk  this 
20 
present or fine tuned, if you will, together with Dentons and 
you can help me, Chairperson, but I am not sure that it came 
back to the board for full final.  It may have, I just do not 
recollect, that is what I am saying to you.  Audit and risk 
drove that process. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 201 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So audit and risk  would not have 
accounted to the board on the terms of reference? 
MS KLEIN:    No, no, I am not saying that, I am saying I am 
not aware of it.  You are asking me I would have seen it, I 
am saying to you I am not sure that I have.  That is what I 
am saying to the Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and I am asking whether would audit 
and risk not have accounted to the board on the terms of 
reference for the appointment of Dentons? 
MS KLEIN:   Remember, audit and risk was tasked to do 
10 
certain things as was P & G and then we had various 
meetings in between.  I cannot tell you whether they brought 
this into the board or not.  That is what I am saying.  They 
may have but I do not remember seeing it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But you will recall from the audio 
recordings that the board explicitly said audit and risk and P 
& G must account to us, to the board.  We are delegating the 
powers to them but they must account to the board.  
MS KLEIN:   Okay, if you go according to what was said, 
then the answer is yes.  If you ask me if I say that, I do not 
20 
remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is …[intervenes] 
MS KLEIN:   I may very well have come to us, I do not 
remember, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So well that you would have seen 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 202 of 240 
 
then the terms of reference that Dentons says, paragraph 
4.9: 
“The terms of reference do not require investigation 
of 
misconduct 
of 
any 
specific 
individuals.  
Accordingly, 
no 
recommendations 
are 
made 
in 
respect of action to be taken to deal with misconduct 
by any specific individuals.” 
Do you see that?  
MS KLEIN:   I see that, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when was this request made to 
10 
Dentons enquiring whether or not there is a finding of 
wrongdoing against Mr Koko? 
MS KLEIN:   I think it would have been sometime in June, 
the month of June, because I remember at the meeting on 
the 1 July, which was chaired by Ms Mabude because she 
was the Chairperson of People in Governance, she actually 
told the meeting she had asked me to clarify with Dentons 
whether or not there was an issue of wrongdoing, which is 
what I then did because I was uncomfortable. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, at some stage we need to go back 
to finalising evidence relating to the different meetings.  At 
some stage Ms Klein testified about what happened at the 
meeting before the Minister arrived, testified about what was 
discussed when the Minister addressed the board and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 203 of 240 
 
testified about the meeting after the Minister had left.  It may 
be that she has said everything she is supposed to say, I just 
want to make sure that we do not leave anything hanging in 
regard to those matters.  I remember that now because I do 
want to find out whether she would – attend the P &G 
meeting that afternoon that Mr Tsotsi talked about but that 
we can deal with that at some stage.  You can continue with 
the issues you are still exploring. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I will make – ja.  Chair, there is an 
immediate answer to your question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is that Ms Klein has confirmed 
that she was in attendance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She attended. 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright. 
MS KLEIN:   Are we talking about the meeting on the 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The P & G. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 11t h. 
MS KLEIN:   No, no, absolutely, I did attend.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS KLEIN:   I was there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 204 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I will ask her some questions later 
but you can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, that 
explanation that you – what did you say?  You found – you 
asked Ms Mabude and she specifically requested you to go 
find out whether there is not a finding of misconduct or 
wrongdoing against Mr Koko.   
It is difficult to understand when the board itself 
already on the 11 March said we were not alleging any 
wrongdoing 
against 
the 
executives 
even 
before 
you 
10 
formulate the terms of reference.  You have made that 
conclusion, no allegations of wrongdoing, step aside, so that 
you do not impede the inquiry.  So I am still struggling with 
the basis or that step you took to try and find out whether 
there is wrongdoing or not against them. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what counsel is saying to you is, 
you had no basis or thinking that Dentons could have a 
finding of misconduct against Mr Koko because you knew 
that that was not part of their brief.  So how could you have 
20 
thought that they might have made such a finding because 
you knew that they had been told that it is not part of your 
brief to make any finding of misconduct against these 
executives. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, you can only answer you the best 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 205 of 240 
 
way I remember.  I was particularly uncomfortable with Mr 
Koko based on what the Chairperson had told us and that is 
not in evidence at the moment.  That needs to be found and 
you will find it when you speak to other board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS KLEIN:   So you asked me did I see the terms of 
reference and I am saying to you I do not remember seeing 
that.  So sitting here yesterday I heard that.  I heard that.  I 
said it in parliament as well, I am uncomfortable with Mr 
Koko for reasons of my own based on being Chairperson P & 
10 
G and just great technical person but, you know, people were 
uncomfortable with leadership issues.   
 
So me phoning Dentons was a way for the board to 
say to me go and satisfy yourself if you are uncomfortable.  
That is why I made the call.  And beyond that, that is why I 
even phoned Jerry.  What the board may or may not have 
though, I am answering for why I was uncomfortable. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that paragraph 4.7 talks about 
the minutes of the meeting of the board, not the audit and 
risk committee. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do the minutes say or what is the 
point about the minutes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is 4.7, that means it is the meeting of 
the board where the terms of reference are discussed and 
the members say they are generally comfortable with the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 206 of 240 
 
terms of reference in that they adequately addressed all the 
issues the board wanted to be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept, I take it, that you were aware 
that the board had said it was not part of the brief of 
Dentons to investigate any wrongdoing on the part of the 
executives.  That one you accept, that you were aware of 
that.  
MS KLEIN:   I accept that that is what it says, I just said I do 
not remember it but I have got to accept [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  But in terms of your own 
understanding as the investigations by Dentons was carrying 
on, was your understanding that their investigations would 
include looking into any wrongdoing on the part of the 
executives? 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson, I think what shapes my thinking, if 
I were to put it you this way now.  In terms of Dentons, I had 
very little to do with Dentons themselves but I remember the 
Chairperson of the board – now look, obviously this is now 
not in my statement, I am responding to the question.   
20 
If there was no wrongdoing on the part of the 
executives - I remember a call from Dr Ben one night telling 
me that Suzanne Daniels was in an absolute state because 
one of the investigators had rubbed her – not really rubbed 
her, had really roughed her up so badly.  Now do not forget 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 207 of 240 
 
Suzanne Daniels worked for Koko.  Suzanne Daniels worked 
for Koko.  So if they roughed her up so badly based on 
what?   
And I think that was all the things that was going 
through my 
mind 
at the time 
when I had 
– I was 
uncomfortable and even at that stage I did meet with 
Suzanne to say what had happened because she was – at P 
& G it was my job to make sure people were okay and she 
told me what had happened.   
I then phoned Dentons and I said what is this, you 
10 
know, how come you people are roughing people up like 
this?  And he said it was a junior investigator and the junior 
investigator was probably just – like overplay.  I think all of 
those things were in the back of my mind which created the 
level of discomfort that I had.   
So it does not negate the fact that you were not 
investigating any wrongdoing but here is the assistant of one 
of the people who I had read from the Chairperson had just 
done certain things, so I wanted to be very sure before 
agreeing to bring 
Mr Koko back, that there 
was no 
20 
wrongdoing on his part.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless, Mr Seleka, unless there is a point 
that I do not – I have not appreciated, I do not know whether 
you still want to pursue that point, that line. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 208 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless there is something else I think we 
may have spent enough time on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, I can finalise it because I 
have only now been able to receive the minutes of the board 
meeting which I referred to there in paragraph 4.7 as the 
board sitting on the 31 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, what I am looking for is she 
decided she was going to ask Dentons whether they had 
found any wrongdoing on the part of Mr Koko.   
She might not have had to do that since Dentons was 
10 
not mandated to investigate any wrongdoing.  So unless the 
idea is that her going there or to Dentons to ask was 
connected with something else, it would seem to me that 
there is not much one – much more one can make of it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course, there might be something 
that you are looking at which I might not be aware of. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you want to round it off, having 
covered that, that is fine. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed.  Indeed, Chairperson.  May I, 
Chairperson, with your permission, hand up a copy of those 
minutes of 31 March 2015, Minutes of the Eskom Holdings 
SOC Ltd board meeting.  We will mark it accordingly for Ms 
Klein’s bundle.  Chair, perhaps it will come at the very end of 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 209 of 240 
 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you want us to look at? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson, the first page reflects 
members who were present in the board meeting, Dr 
Ngubane, the Acting Chairman at the time, Mr Norman 
Baloyi, Ms Carrim, Mr Khoza, Ms V J Klein.  That will be you, 
Ms Klein?  
MS KLEIN:   Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr K Kumalo and Ms C Mabude, Dr P 
Naidoo, Ms V Naidoo and Mr Pamensky.  Chairperson, the 
10 
specific issue here is on page 7 of that document, paragraph 
7.4.  The terms of reference for the board’s inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The bottom, page 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 7.4, terms of reference for 
the board inquiry.  There is: 
“The draft terms of reference for the board inquiry 
into the affairs of Eskom were tabled for approval 
details of which had been distributed to members.  It 
20 
was noted that interviews were still being conducted 
to identify the service provider to conduct the 
inquiry.” 
If you turn the page, it says: 
“The terms of reference were based on the audit.” 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 210 of 240 
 
Now you will recognise that paragraph, that is the one 
quoted in the Dentons report. 
“The terms of reference were based on the audit, it 
was requested that the term “unfettered” be removed 
from the draft.  Members were generally comfortable 
with the terms of reference in that they adequately 
addressed all the issues the board wanted to be dealt 
with.  It was noted that the inquiry could take up to 
12 months.” 
You see familiar from Dentons report, Ms Klein? 
10 
MS KLEIN:   Yes, I see it, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then it gets resolved at the bottom, just 
after the next paragraph: 
“Resolved that the draft terms of reference for the 
board inquiry into the affairs of Eskom are approved 
subject 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
change 
requested by the board.” 
MS KLEIN:   I see that, Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But the point …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, I am sorry, I have lost you. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you have lost me?  
CHAIRPERSON:   The result parties were? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you go back to the first paragraph 
Chairperson on page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On page? 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 211 of 240 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   8, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you go to the top paragraph, skip the 
second paragraph, then you see the words resolved that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then point number one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay I see that, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  So the – Ms Klein 
the – what this raises in one’s mind, looking at, as the 
Chairperson was painting that – the allegation scenario of 
10 
Mr Koko meeting at Melrose Arch, knowing that there will 
be suspensions and subsequently he being the only one 
coming back and the basis on which you are personally 
involved in his coming back in that the reason was well let 
me go find out whether there is any wrongdoing found 
against him when in fact you would have known in this 
board meeting which finally having looked at the draft 
terms of reference resolved that they be finalised, that 
there is no wrongdoing on his part. 
 
It does not – it does not seem to be a cogent 
20 
reason for having secured his return.  It seems something 
more lurked behind the decision.    
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson I cannot talk to what lurked 
behind the decision I was asked a question – if you were to 
check with any board member I was the one person who 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 212 of 240 
 
was concerned from the day that the Chairperson told us 
about 
certain 
allegations 
against 
Mr 
Koko. 
 
I 
was 
concerned about that; I was concerned about his return 
which is why I did what I did.   
          I think what we are not addressing right now which 
probably has got nothing to do with the terms of reference 
is if you were to listen to the tape of the 11 t h of March we 
said we would have a concurrent process running for those 
who’s going to be charged.  He had never been charged 
but there was some serious allegations made.   
10 
          I wanted to make very sure myself that Mr Koko 
according to the findings as the Evidence Leader has 
pointed out correctly would not have been picked up but to 
make very sure that there was nothing that they saw there 
that could possibly have alerted us to something that may 
have lined up was what the Chairman had said because the 
Chairman had made some serious allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.          
MS KLEIN:   So when you know when talk about a cogent 
reason and it is not being cogent I cannot talk to that.  I 
20 
cannot talk to the meeting at Melrose Arch I was not there 
and I certainly did not have any sinister reason for doing 
what I did here.  I did what I did in order to protect what I 
thought was the board to make sure that we were not 
bringing somebody back that ought not to have come back.   
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 213 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka you estimated 30 
minutes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am finished with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have done an hour so let us try and 
see if we can finish…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   With suspensions.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I move onto the next point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is something Chair which might 
10 
remain because Ms Klein refers to the Chairperson having 
made 
allegations 
of 
wrongdoing 
against 
the 
certain 
executives.  But Ms Klein you would know from that 
meeting that Mr Tsotsi – well you need to give us your 
report to this because somebody there says the FD and it 
is not Mr Tsotsi.  The FD was the one involved in meeting 
with the bidders and Mr Tsotsi is asking was that reported 
in surprise.  That is a question also asked by Mr Baloyi 
where are the facts but we can deal with that.  Do you 
recall that?         
20 
MS KLEIN:   I do recall that Chair.  Can I comment if I 
may?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   Chair that is the same meeting I am saying to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 214 of 240 
 
you that recording is not complete.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
MS KLEIN:   Remember I am saying to you where is that 
recording starts and in fact let me put it this way I think 
before I leave can I hear where that starts so that we can 
be sure that the version I have got is exactly the same 
version you have got.  Is it possible?    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja they will look for it.  
MS KLEIN:   So they can just to take that off the table.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
10 
MS KLEIN:   Alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, for purposes of…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me go to my question about the 
P & G meeting.  You would have heard Mr Tsotsi say 
yesterday that after lunch he went to join the P & G 
meeting and was like ten minutes late.  But when he 
arrived he found that the people who attended the meeting 
where or they did discussing names of people who would 
act in the positions of the executives who were going to be 
suspended.  Now do you have any recollection of how 
20 
those names or where those came from?   
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson I must tell you I was very 
surprised when I heard that yesterday.  I do not remember 
the P & G starting without Mr Tsotsi.  So once again I am 
talking about based on my memory of five years ago.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 215 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS KLEIN:   As well as listening to a recording which I say 
is incomplete.  I do not recall anybody talking about 
names.  My recollection of the names that were eventually 
considered for suspension came from Mr Tsotsi himself.  
So I am a little concerned that we are not saying the same 
things I agree with that but I guess that is what this is 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.    
MS KLEIN:   You know I do not recall the meeting starting 
10 
without Mr Tsotsi because my understanding was that Mr 
Tsotsi was going to chair the P & G.  So why would the 
meeting start without him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that is interesting I was looking at 
Dr Ngubane’s affidavit I seem to think he also says the 
names came from Mr Tsotsi I may be mistaken but I seem 
to think he says something along those lines that – where 
is the file that has got Mr, Dr Ngubane’s affidavit.  So you 
were at that P & G meeting from when it started you were 
there?    
20 
MS KLEIN:   Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The P & G meeting…[intervene]  
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   When it started you were there? 
MS KLEIN:   I can only imagine that I was I am typically 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 216 of 240 
 
never late for meetings so I cannot imagine that I would 
have been late.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
alright 
and 
you 
say 
your 
recollection is that the names came from Mr Tsotsi?  
MS KLEIN:   Absolutely Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you know did, he come up with 
those names at the P & G meeting or had he already 
mentioned the names in any one of the previous meetings 
that day? 
MS KLEIN:   I think that is the piece that is missing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is missing.  
MS KLEIN:   I am not sure if it was at the end of the board 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS KLEIN:   I do imagine that there was a P & G and other 
members were asked to join as well I think even he said so 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja he said so, ja.  
MS KLEIN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But your memory in terms of who came 
20 
with the names is it quite clear.  
MS KLEIN:   That I am 100% clear on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That it was Mr Tsotsi?  
MS KLEIN:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And is your – do you have a recollection 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 217 of 240 
 
as to whether the P & G meeting started without Mr Tsotsi 
being there and he joined later or whether when it started 
he was there.  Do you have any recollection of that? 
MS KLEIN:   No that is the part I cannot remember.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot…[intervene] 
MS KLEIN:   But I can only say to you I find it strange that 
we would have started a P & G of such a critical nature 
without him.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS KLEIN:   That is all I can say. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS KLEIN:   But there may be evidence that it was true I 
do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes of course he was not going to Chair 
the P & G meeting. Is it?   
MS KLEIN:   No, no you see that is my dilemma he was 
always going to Chair P & G. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and as far as you recall did he Chair 
the meeting? 
MS KLEIN:   He chaired the P & G. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  I thought I had seen minutes 
that puts him as one of the people attending or members 
but not as Chairperson.      
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, Chair the - what we see is that the 
board deliberates on who is going to chair because Mr 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 218 of 240 
 
Zithemba Khoza…[intervene]  
MS KLEIN:   Was the Chairperson.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who is the Chairperson is going to – 
has been earmarked to act in the CEO’s position so he is 
conflicted.  He cannot also hand a letter of suspension.  So 
there is a P & G meeting then there is the suspension 
meetings it seems Mr Koko chaired the latter but not the 
forma and you can check Ms Klein.  So although there is 
some deliberation and the board does say we authorise you 
Mr Chair we place you in that position.   
10 
MS KLEIN:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   To chair the P & G but he says no, 
ultimately I think he chairs the suspensions as opposed to 
the P & G meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
MS KLEIN:   Ja.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   But Chair I think that is a very important point 
that the Evidence Leader is raising because I think in the 
recordings that part of the board meeting where this is 
20 
originally discussed seems to me what is the missing part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.     
MS KLEIN:   That part between the board meeting because 
remember the way we got it is that there was a board 
meeting.  The Minister arrives, we break and we go into P 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 219 of 240 
 
& G.  There was a meeting before the P & G.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, we do have that.  
MS KLEIN:   Do you have that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, no that audio is there.  
MS KLEIN:   Alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it flows into the P & G.  What we 
do not have is the suspension meetings which is what Mr 
Tsotsi chaired.  
MS KLEIN:   Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well you say chaired but he is really 
10 
the one made responsible to speak to the executives and 
handover the letters of suspension but it needs to be 
clarified of course.   
MS KLEIN:   Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   In regard to the P & G.  
MS KLEIN:   But Chair I want to add onto what the 
Evidence Leader has just said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   Remember at this stage according to my 
20 
knowledge I do not know about anybody else’s, I am talking 
about my knowledge.  We are suspending, I do not know 
when the – your point about that Zithemba Khoza was 
going to act.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 220 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   That discussion only happened afterwards so 
then I am – you have got to show me in the minutes 
because maybe I do not have it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minutes are in your bundle.  
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1460.  
MS KLEIN:  Is that the first bundle now?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Eskom bundle 05. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure you can read it what does it 
say.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, the Chairperson there is Mr Z 
Khoza. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Z Khoza.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the Chairperson.   
MS KLEIN:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Carrim is there Mabude, Dr Naidoo, 
Ms Naidoo, Mr Baloyi, Mr Tsotsi and then Ms Klein.  
20 
MS KLEIN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is on page 1460.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 221 of 240 
 
MS KLEIN:   1460? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Number 5.  
MS KLEIN:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom bundle 5.  
MS KLEIN:   Ja I have got it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have it? 
MS KLEIN:   1460?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   1460, yes.   
MS KLEIN:   So is this sorry Chairperson is this 
the…[intervene] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This is the minutes of the People and 
Governance Committee on 11 March 2015 at 14:58.  Now 
we do not have minutes and I do not think there are 
minutes where the executives are called in one by one and 
there is discussions with them to be handed letters of 
suspension.  So this would be before that…[intervene] 
MS KLEIN:   Suspension meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So if the names came from Mr Tsotsi 
that is the names of the people who were going to act in 
the positions of these four executives.  If that part of your 
20 
evidence is true, then it would also mean that Mr Tsotsi’s 
evidence that he found or that he asked those present how 
they could be discussing those names because they did not 
know the people so that would be problematic to because 
he would have brought the names and he would have been 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 222 of 240 
 
the one who asked that everybody discuss those names.  Is 
that right?       
MS KLEIN:   I would imagine so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   Yes, because remember for me the board, 
meaning the board myself of the view I did not know any of 
the people.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   So I mean I would not have possibly have 
been able to come up with a list of names. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MS KLEIN:   Having said that though I mean there were 
other people who had been there before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MS KLEIN:   So I am not saying that Mr Tsotsi did not find 
people talking about it but I did not hear that and 
remember we talking about the replacements the people 
who are going to take over. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson may I go and charge to 
20 
the Chairperson that Mr Baloyi has also recently arrived an 
affidavit to the Commission.  Mr Norman Baloyi which 
should in due course form that part of the bundle.  In his 
affidavit dated 7 September 2020 paragraph 3.14 – Ms 
Klein I will provide you with a copy.  He said during the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 223 of 240 
 
meeting, he is talking of the meeting of the 11 t h, Dr 
Ngubane was on course on several occasions with officials 
from the office of the Presidency wherein he confirmed the 
names of the officials who would act in the positions of the 
respective 
suspended 
executives. 
 
Dr 
Ngubane 
was 
referred to as the ambassador I believe the board and P & 
G 
committee 
meetings 
were 
recorded 
and 
they 
can 
evidence this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see Dr Ngubane says in his 
affidavit these names came from – he says it was Mr Tsotsi 
10 
who provided these names and he says Mr Tsotsi said he 
got these names I think either from the Minister or from the 
Presidency.   
          And Dr Ngubane then says he had to phone the 
Minister or the Presidency I cannot remember in order to 
verify that Mr Tsotsi had obtained these names from either 
the Minister or the Presidency that is what Dr Ngubane 
says.  So it would therefore seem that Ms Klein and Dr 
Ngubane may be talking the same thing when they say Mr 
Tsotsi provided the names to the members of the board or 
20 
the committee.      
MS KLEIN:   Chair I can only just state from my 
perspective not you know having the benefit of that but I 
do not believe any of the new board members were in a 
position to make a decision as to who would be deputised.  
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 224 of 240 
 
I mean we only had like you said there were only there 
three months trying to hold all the board in the air I mean 
how would we have known who could have done this job.  I 
could certainly could not – let me just talk for myself I did 
not know anybody well enough to be able to make a call as 
to who we deputise and who would not.  And if I remember 
though I have got to agree with something that the 
Evidence Leader just said about Norman Baloyi I remember 
Dr Ngubane you know going in and out of meetings about 
that so it must have been to go and phone various people, 
10 
phone the Minister I mean I cannot bet for who he did 
phone.   
          But driving home last night I was actually thinking 
about that why – you know what struck me as strange 
Chairperson is why would the Chairperson have allowed Dr 
Ngubane to go and make this call.  I just riding home I just 
thought to myself I mean why would the Chairperson not be 
making those calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I – well the one explanation would 
be and I think if I am not mistaken this seems to come out 
20 
of Dr Ngubane’s affidavit is that there was mistrust 
between Mr Tsotsi and the board or a substantial number of 
board members or some board members.  So that if Mr 
Tsotsi on Dr Ngubane’s version said the Minister gave me 
these names as the people who must act in this positions if 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 225 of 240 
 
they did not trust on what you are saying then one could 
understand if someone like Dr Ngubane decided he wanted 
to verify that but in a situation where there was trust there 
would not be a need for that.  Do you understand what I 
mean?         
MS KLEIN:   I hear you Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I seem to understand Dr Ngubane in 
his affidavit to say because of how Mr Tsotsi handled some 
of the matters on the 11 t h you know some board members 
or the board members began not to trust him.  So that is 
10 
how I – that is what I think according to Dr Ngubane 
happened.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I read the paragraph to you 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not really, no ja, we are at nine minutes 
to six.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will have to stop at six.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have to stop at six.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Klein Mr Tsotsi then gets subjected 
to some disciplinary action by the board.  Why did the 
board do that? 
MS KLEIN:   Let me respond remember I was here 
yesterday so I heard a lot of what the Chairperson said and 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 226 of 240 
 
so I also went away last night and I had to think about this 
very, very deeply.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is page 18 paragraph 67 it might 
help you expedite your answer to the Chairperson.  
MS KLEIN:   Thank you, page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 18.  
MS KLEIN:   Page 18  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, paragraph 67.  
MS KLEIN:   67? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   67, ja.  
10 
MS KLEIN:   Okay shall I quickly go through it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can read it out loud.  
MS KLEIN:   Okay the board unanimously agreed that the 
board committee on the 19 t h, 2015 of March 2015 that he 
had lost confidence in the Chairman Mr Tsotsi and he 
would recommend his removal due to as a director due to: 
number 1 his failure to seek or obtain board approval for 
the appointment of the consultant Nick Linnell.  His actions 
in terms of the suspensions and then 3, preparing and 
distributing a media release without board approval.  So let 
20 
us start with the first one when – and I mean I was here 
yesterday I heard, I had the benefit of listening to the – 
sorry Chairperson.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no carry on. 
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson I had the benefit of listening to 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 227 of 240 
 
what was presented yesterday by Mr Tsotsi, listening to the 
recording as well. That the board was even though we 
listened to Mr Linnell, Mr Linnell was introduced as the 
person who was going to help us.  Mr Tsotsi in fact started 
out by saying I am sorry I should have told you board 
before; he actually starts out his testimony if you listen to 
the recording like that.  So we listened to Mr Linnell and 
with due respect Mr Linnell had a lot of knowledge so I 
mean he did bring a lot of knowledge to the table 
especially given that we were then told that he drafted that 
10 
oval arch memorandum and that he apparently helped put 
the resolutions together.  
          What I think became very uncomfortable to the 
board and once again me.  I think I could live with all of 
that but when that media release went out the one that we 
had helped to give input into which I think you played a 
part of yesterday.  There were some blatant inaccuracies in 
that there.   
          Number 1, it stated that Mr Linnell was going to 
oversee 
this 
whole 
investigation 
that 
was 
not 
our 
20 
understanding, he was going to support but he was never 
going manage this process.  I am talking for myself now 
and maybe you have got minutes to show differently but 
this was my understanding.   
          Number 2, it spoke about the fact that the board 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 228 of 240 
 
had agreed to appoint an acting Judge or a retired Judge 
and there was a third point I cannot remember what it was 
now.  But those were not things that were discussed 
anywhere on that tape or with us with Mr Linnell not with 
Mr Linnell with Mr Tsotsi.  That is why the board then in 
that week was up and down to say but Chairperson how 
could you put out a media release like this, this is number 
1, inaccurate and number 2, this is not – you were 
supposed to get sign off from the board. The Chairperson 
then in a later meeting apologised I think it was the 19 t h for 
10 
the oversight but I think for me, for me that as one of the 
biggest problems.  First of all, you bring somebody you 
have already engaged, we have not had a chance to, then 
we get told the man has done a lot of work.   
          You tell us you going to give us the deck you do not 
give it to us.  You tell us there is executives who has done 
all these wrong things, then we all come to a point where 
we all have to agree that we cannot hold those charges 
against the people and we all now need to go with the – 
almost the middle of the road.  That they are going to 
20 
impede the investigation.   
          I think for me Chairperson those were my reasons 
for accepting that we had lost confidence.  There was 
another reason given, there was another reason.  When – 
and that is why you know the giving of the names becomes 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 229 of 240 
 
very – it is not very clear for me who gave what names 
because I know that the Chairperson himself had a list 
which included a gentleman by the name of Maliselle 
Sekasunge who he wanted to have run, I think it was 
Generation I may get it wrong without telling the board that 
Maliselle Sekasunge was on suspension.  So when you put 
all that together when I looked at this the Chairperson was 
giving, he was being very economical with information and 
the board were expected to make huge decisions for which 
we were trashed in the papers.  So Chairperson that was 
10 
my, that was my view.                
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, now I am going to finish Ms Klein 
because the minutes of that meeting of the 19 t h actually 
say that he did not circulate the media release that it was 
leaked.  It says it was leaked without the board’s prior 
approval, the minutes of the 19 t h.  
MS KLEIN:   Chairperson I think you may want to clarify 
that and I know this is inquisitorial but personally the office 
of the Chairperson at that stage was a gentleman by the 
name of Leo Dhlamini and Chairperson I would suggest 
20 
that you may be ask that particular question of Mr Dhlamini 
because that was not my understanding.  That was – the 
Chairperson had sent it onto Leo my understanding was for 
not on sending it not to be put out to the boards.  So I 
think 
inquisitorial 
as 
this 
is 
I 
know 
we 
giving 
the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 230 of 240 
 
Commission more work but you may need to just get that 
on an affidavit.        
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is fine you mean somebody to 
confirm the correctness of the minutes?  
MS KLEIN:   No, no the correctness of the fact that it was 
leaked.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay.  
MS KLEIN:   Ja, remember I cannot talk to that this was 
something that the Chairperson said.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So those are your only reasons why you 
10 
support it? 
MS KLEIN:  Remember I have given you Sekasumbi[?] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Okay I have given you the fact that I felt that the 
way the Chairperson had handled the suspensions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  By giving it – let me tell you how I felt the day 
after.  I had given you Chairperson you have asked me what 
were my views.  My views as a – somebody from private 
sector who has run big businesses was specifically this.  But 
20 
on looking at it in hindsight I asked myself questions like did 
you get the right information to make decisions such as 
these?  And I almost felt – I felt pressured.  I felt maybe we 
did not get the right information.  Then you have got 
something that goes out, something that was not discussed 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 231 of 240 
 
with the Board and then it is leaked.  I just felt there was – 
that together with my own experience on the earlier matter I 
mentioned TNA where I was very specific – you got no 
answer and somebody was going to talk to me as if they 
were going to change my mind.   How can they change my 
mind of something I felt strongly about? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Seleka it may that you or your 
junior could make a note of Ms Klein’s – what Ms Klein has 
said about that resolution relating to TNA and you pass that 
information to Advocate Kate Hofmeyr because she dealt 
10 
with TNA matters.  What she says might be something that 
she might be interested in.  Ja okay. 
MS KLEIN:  Thank you Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Sorry, the note actually appears in 
the charges itself? 
MS KLEIN:  Just remind me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The charges. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About – the charges levelled against Mr 
Tsotsi. 
20 
MS KLEIN:  yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The third one is  
“The Director authorised the commission of a 
media statement in relation to an inquiry into 
the 
affairs 
of 
the 
company 
with 
the 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 232 of 240 
 
assistance of the consultant without the 
knowledge and or consent of the Board.” 
This is the first part, and we know that cannot be 
correct because the Board knew and the Board 
consented.  Then there is the second part to it.   
“The media statement consequently fell into 
the public domain.  The media statement 
contained 
numerous 
inaccuracies 
and 
information which may lead – may lead to the 
company facing potential legal action from 
10 
third parties named therein.” 
 
I do not know – that media statement is it the one 
which was drafted with the Board? 
MS KLEIN:  No.  Sorry through you Chairperson.  I think that 
was the point that the media statement that was drafted with 
the Board which is what we heard on the recording yesterday 
was significantly different to that which as the evidence 
leaders indicated eventually landed whether leaked or 
otherwise I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But Mr Linnell who is the drafter who 
20 
assisted says that is the media statement that was – he sent 
to the company secretary that it should be released.  He 
understands that it was never released. 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I cannot talk to that.  I do not know 
about what he sent to the company secretary.  I do not 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 233 of 240 
 
believe I was copied on it.  All I know is whatever appeared 
in the media was not what the Board had agreed and that 
was I think almost the sword that broke the camel’s back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair that will complete the questions.  I 
have in regard to Ms Klein on the suspensions.  Ms Klein do 
you hold strong views about the first two charges that were 
brought against Mr Tsotsi involving Mr Linnell? 
MS KLEIN:  I actually do.  Chairperson I actually do.  I think 
the court. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja let me ask you a follow up question. 
10 
How do you do that when the Board itself made the 
resolution to appoint him as a coordinator? 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson you asking my view now right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no the Board’s. 
MS KLEIN:  No, no okay the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let – let… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes you as a member of the Board. 
MS KLEIN:  I disagree that he was appointed.  I know that 
that is how the evidence was led and I know that is what was 
20 
on the recording.  The Board would not have brought 
charges less than a week later if they had agreed.  I think 
the Board agreed I certainly agreed – not agreed accepted 
Mr Linnell’s presence there because supposedly of what he 
knew and what he brought to the table.

MS KLEIN:  But why did you make use of him if you thought 
that he was brought in irregularly?  You should have wanted 
to have nothing to do with him.  You should have from the 
beginning said to Mr Tsotsi you cannot do this – cannot taint 
the Board’s process by bringing somebody irregularly here.  
Why – have you gone through the processes?  If you have 
not why you bringing somebody to the Board in breach of the 
processes of the company?  We will not taint our processes 
with somebody you bring in like this here.  That is what you 
should have done if you had a problem, is it not? 
10 
MS KLEIN:  I agree with you completely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not do that 
MS KLEIN:  And I did not do it and I will take whatever 
decision you make on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I will tell you as a personal – my personal view? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Not a Board view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I felt bullied but that is my view. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is important.  You see 
what I am putting to you is just to show you another angle. 
MS KLEIN:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To it but it is to give you an opportunity to 
look at it from another angle and see whether you would still 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 235 of 240 
 
hold the same view in the light of … 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes  Okay. 
MS KLEIN:  And Chairperson I am not going to [00:06:42] 
into saying.  I should have stood up in the board meeting 
and said no I will not accept this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I am saying you – I am saying to you today and I 
am not sure what other Board Members are going to say but 
a lot of things that we experienced right upfront was an 
10 
inordinate amount of bullying by Mr Tsotsi – bullying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
MS KLEIN:  Absolutely.  If you listen to the recordings you 
can pick that up.  It was not a case of let us discuss this it is 
like this because I am telling you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how does one person bully how many 
members of the board? 
MS KLEIN:  I think it was twelve.  Twelve . 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how does one person bully twelve 
members of the board that he – or is it – is it ten because he 
20 
and Mr – Ms Mabude came from the previous board? 
MS KLEIN:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bully ten members of the board that he has 
not worked with for a long time. 
MS KLEIN:  Chairperson I cannot answer for others I am 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 236 of 240 
 
telling you what my experience … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you felt bullied? 
MS KLEIN:  I felt bullied because issues that were raised 
were literally just shut down.  And you can – you can listen 
to some of the recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  Remember this was not meeting number 1 as my 
Counsel will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  Share. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  And maybe it would be a good idea to listen to 
some of the approaches. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I mean it took a lot out of me to stand up on the 
morning of the 19t h and say because literally the meeting 
started with the Chairperson telling us, I have a – a 
particular problem that you are speaking to EXCO members 
and I had to literally sheepishly put up my hand and say, 
Chairperson 
excuse 
me 
I 
have 
sent 
you 
significant 
20 
information and I am not getting a response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  So you asked me – I think the question from the 
evidence leader was, how strongly did I feel about it?  I say 
very strongly 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 237 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  Your question is, why did you not oppose it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  I felt bullied in – I felt bullied into a lot of what 
was happening there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KLEIN:  Okay but – like I said that is my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KLEIN:  I mean I cannot talk for the other Board 
Members. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay I think we will stop for today 
here.  Obviously, Mr Seleka you have not finished – you 
have not exhausted your questions on suspensions, is it not 
or have you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja well – there may be one or two Chair 
but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No what I was thinking is that maybe what 
we should do is arrange for Ms Klein to come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For purposes of allowing you to finish at 
20 
least the suspension part of her – of your questioning.  And 
then of course she would still come back later for the 
secondment.  But it may well be that we might say look when 
she comes back… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 238 of 240 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You deal with the suspension part and the 
secondment part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might just depend what is convenient 
with… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The latter. 
MS KLEIN:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think latter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The latter will … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is more convenient. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KLEIN:  I support that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja and if we do it that way it might 
take – it might take some time before she comes back 
depending on whether – how soon you are ready to … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with the secondment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you able to say whether we should 
arrange for some time next week or not yet? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think not yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me come back to the Chairperson. 
10 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 265 
 
Page 239 of 240

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And we could then determine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Future dates with my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Subject to the Chairperson’s decision on 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  So – so we will adjourn.  
10 
You are not done giving evidence.  The plan is that you will 
come back.  The date when you will come back will be 
determined in due course. 
MS KLEIN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there will be communication between 
Mr Seleka and your Counsel.  So you will come back.
