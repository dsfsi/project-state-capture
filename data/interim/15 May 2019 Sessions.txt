PROCEEDINGS ON 15 MAY 2019  
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair the next witness for Transnet it is 
Mr Mohammed Mahomedy and for the purpose of leading his evidence 
we will be referring to two main files which we have now taken the 
10 
liberty of marking them as Exhibit BB3A and Exhibit BB3B.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit BB3A and Exhibit BB3B  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  3 – BB3B yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And subsequent Chair to having filed or 
dispatched the 3.3 Notices Nedbank did file a 3.4 Application even 
though it might not be complete as they intend to ventilate other issues 
in due course.  And pursuant to that Mr Mahamedy also filed a 
supplementary witness statement where he effected some minor 
corrections and also responded to Nedbank’s Rule 3.4 affidavit.  We 
20 
propose Mr Chair that we mark the Nedbank Rule 3.4 affidavit as 
Exhibit BB3.2 and to mark the Exhibit – the supplementary statement of 
Mr Mahomedy as Exhibit BB3.3 and we beg leave to formally hand 
same to you Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just thinking whether we should get Nedbank’s 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 3 of 154 
 
affidavit in at this stage before the – their witness comes in.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair we are simply indicating as a 
matter of process that that is why this happened we might not even 
have to formally hand them over to you at this stage but simply to 
indicate that subsequent to the initial statement…  
CHAIRPERSON:  That they are responding to – are they responding to 
the witness’s statement insofar as it effects them?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In as far – in as far it affects them they 
indicate areas where they are not in agreement with certain assertions 
arising from there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But they also say in their affidavit that in 
due course they will seek leave from the Chair to lead evidence and to 
cross-examine Mr Mahomedy if those issues are not being resolved by 
the parties before that – before that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first lever arch file  will be market Exhibit BB3A 
and the second one will be marked Exhibit BB3B and you have a small 
file that you have made available here which consists of an affidavit 
from – by – is it Mr McCarthy? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr McCarthy that is from Nedbank yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  McCarthy from Nedbank.  That one will be marked 
Exhibit 33 you said 2? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  33.2 and Mr Mahomedy is 1 BB3.3.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair.  That should be in order.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 4 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened to 33.1? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is 33.1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  They took that – the statement of Mr Mahomedy 
maybe in itself will be 33.1 but they did not refer this ones by firstly 
numbering with a number 1 number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if we do not change them somebody following 
the proceedings trying to read this thing will think there is BB3.1 
missing and…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes definitely… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They might spend time trying to find that.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In terms of the sequencing yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe we should change to say Exhibit BB3.1.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will be Mr McCarthy’s affidavit and BB3.2 will be Mr 
Mahomedy’s supplementary affidavit.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That makes sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us do it that way and then during the break…  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We will amend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This can be changed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We will amend them accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair we are ready to lead the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 5 of 154 
 
evidence of Mr Mahomedy and may the witness be witness be sworn in?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath or affirmatio n. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mohammed Suleman 
Mahomedy. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  So you solemnly affirm that the evidence that you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so 
10 
please raise right hand and say, I truly affirm.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I truly affirm. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mahomedy as 
already indicated to the Chair we will be referring to four exhibits which 
I see they have already been placed before you.  You will see that the 
two big files the fir st one should be marked Exhibit BB3A that will be 
the first file.  And the second one is Exhibit BB3B.  You have already 
also heard that there was a – an affidavit by Nedbank which we have 
20 
now amended it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let – I am sorry Mr Mokoena let me ch eck whether 
everybody can hear you at the back?   Nobody shakes their hands so it 
means they hear you.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 6 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  They are contained in a separate folder 
and they are marked r espectively Exhibit BB3.1 and Exhibit BB3.2 but 
for the purposes of beginning with your testimony could you please 
concentrate on Exhibit BB3A and should I move to another file I will 
alert you and notify you accordingly.  Now let me assist you to navigate  
that first file.  You will see on the first it is a cover page.  The 
document immediately there it is an index.  It will help you or assist 
you to locate the different documents which we will be referring to from 
time to time and immediately after the ind ex there is a document Mr 
10 
Mahomedy can you please identify that document for us immediately 
after the index? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Advocate Mokoena this is my 
statement to the commission. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May you then refer to page 3 9 – 
page 39 Chair?  Is your signature appearing there?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And do you confirm that your 
statement it is in a form of an affidavit?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes that is true. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And you also confirm the contents of 
your statement to be both true and correct?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Advocate. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now Mr Mahomedy can you please 
share with us your qualifications?  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 7 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I am a qualified Chartered 
Accountant in South Africa. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And prior to joining Transnet what 
did you do? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Advocate I think it would be 
good to just give a brief history.  I  think… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes please. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  I think in 2001 I joined 
Eskom as a Division Finance Manager in the Transnet – sorry in the 
Transmission Division.  Thereafter I joined Transnet Freight Rail which 
10 
was then called Spoornet in September 2004.  It was there until May 
2006 at which time I resigned and joined a company called Cutting 
Edge Commerce where I was employed until April 2008.  Between April 
2008 and September 2008 I worked at Cutting Edge Finance as a 
Financial and Management Consultant and I have been at Transnet 
since October 2008 in a variety of functions.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now can you share with us you know just 
briefly your employment history within Transnet itself?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I will start with my current 
role in which I was appointed by the Honourable Minister Pravin 
20 
Gordhan on the 1 May 2019 as the Acting Group Chief Executive.  That 
is not included in my statement as it was subsequent to this – the 
submission of the statement. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chairperson.  Prior to that I 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 8 of 154 
 
was the Acting Group Chief Financial Officer once again appointed by 
the Honourable Minister Pravin Gordhan the Public Enterprises Minister 
on the 15 May 2018.  I wa s the General Manager of Finance within 
Transnet Group Capital a business unit within Transnet from August 
2016 to the 15 May 2018.  And before that I was the General Manager 
of a department called Group Capital Integration and Assurance from 
February 2013 to August 2016. The key responsibilities in that function 
was the capital strategy of Transnet as well as the capital portfolio 
management of Transnet.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  From October 2008 to 
January 2013 I spent that time as an Executive Manager of Finance at 
Transnet Freight Rail and amongst my key responsibilities in that space 
were the – some of the finance related matters but also specifically 
payroll management and the internal financial controls of Transne t 
Freight Rail.  I think it must be – it is necessary to also state that 
during the period that I was reporting into the Group Finance Space 
between 2013 and 2015 on occasion I would have acting as the Group 
Chief Financial Officer in the absence of the th en CFO Anoj Singh and 
it is on this basis that you may find my signature appearing in a variety 
20 
of documents and memoranda as the Acting Chief Financial Officer.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  During that period. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now at the time when you deposed to 
this statement which capacity did you occupy?  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 9 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I was the Acting Group Chief 
Financial Officer of Transnet. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and in that capacity could you 
please share with the Chair your responsibilities?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Right up top the key 
responsibilities of the Financial Sustainability of Transnet and the 
Financial Management of Transnet.  It would also look at the controls 
within Transnet, the fina ncial controls and the treasury function of 
Transnet which is largely where Transnet procures funding and 
management of the cash flows of Transnet.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now the – that responsibility of the 
treasury function what did it entail?  Did you  – were there people 
reporting to you?  Was it a unit on its own?  How did it operate within 
the bigger structure of Transnet?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is a department within 
Transnet but reports to the CFO’s office.  There is a treasurer that is 
ordinarily in that position who will report to the CFO and I think the – 
as I said the large responsibility of that department is looking at the 
cash flows, looking at the funding requirements of the business and 
then going out to the market and talking to  a variety of lenders to look 
20 
at whether you know when we borrow money who we borrow it from and 
at what rates and that is a synopsis of that.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  From page 3 starting from 
paragraph 3 Mr Chair Mr Mahomedy you prefaced your evide nce by 
highlighting or providing high level observations can you please take us 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 10 of 154 
 
through those high level observations?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  I think also it would be 
necessary Advocate to give the commission a view as I said it in 
hindsight that we actually have done all of these reviews.  I was 
appointed on the 15 May 2018 the new board of directors were 
appointed around the 23 May 2018.  At this time Transnet was in the 
midst of their financial close process with the external auditors.  It was 
subsequently qualified as a set of accounts which created certain 
challenges for Transnet and the qualification was largely around PFMA, 
irregular expenditure.  I think together with the board at the time the 
10 
numerous media reports and pervasive reports arou nd corruption or 
allegations of corruption at Transnet were really something that was put 
under the microscope by the board.  As the Acting Group Chief 
Financial officer I would state I am – I am a member of the board of 
directors of Transnet as well.  The  process of understanding exactly 
what transpired in the years that were preceding the appointment of the 
board and myself we commenced a review of a number of transactions.  
Particularly those that had received a fair amount of media scrutiny.  
Amongst them were transactions that would look at 1064 which was 
commonly called 1064 in Transnet the acquisition of 1064 locomotives?  
20 
There were related transactions to that like the maintenance agreement 
that was signed with China South Rail. Neotel which was in the press 
for a number of issues around payments that were made to other 
entities.  Regiments Capital, Trillian Capital and Trillian – there were 
other entities within the Triallian group of companies that were also you 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 11 of 154 
 
know discussed in the media.  And th e Durban relocation programme 
which was the relocation of two originally equipment manufacturers or 
what we commonly call OEM’s. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  From Johannesburg through 
to Durban and also the service provider Nkonki.  These were the high 
level transactions or contracts that we deemed were necessary to look 
at, at the time.  It is not an exhaustive list.  There have been a number 
of reviews that are outside of this list and I think I would also stress 
that the processes in some of these transactions continue.  They are 
10 
not limited to the 16 April submission they will continue.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  For a variety of reasons 
Advocate. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And if you go to paragraph 3.1 if 
you read it into the record and expand flowing obviously from an 
experience when you now reviewed you know the different contracts.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chairperson I think it is 
necessary at this point to state that on the  review of governance within 
Transnet what we found was that certain transactions were approved 
20 
through normal processes and some of the transactions did not go 
through the governance processes prescribed within Transnet.  I detail 
under 3.2 some of the ex amples which I will provide more insight and at 
a later stage however suffice to say that if we look at the Neotel 
transaction as an example there was an approved memorandum to 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 12 of 154 
 
appoint Neotel in October 2013.  In about the 20 November 2013 a 
memorandum was signed by the then Chief Executive of Transnet Mr 
Brian Molefe nullifying the decision of the people that approved the 
memorandum of the 31 October and replacing Neotel with T-Systems.  
Subsequent to that period of the 20 November 2013 there seems to be 
a lot of inactivity and then on the 5 December or around the 5 
December 2014 a further memorandum surfaces that approves the 
appointment of Neotel.  This is something that is not ordinarily in the 
process of procurement at Transnet.  When you give considera tion to 
the fact that Neotel was initially recommended through an open tender 
10 
process and they were all of the necessary procurement events that 
had been adhered to.  The memorandum of the 20 November 
essentially just nullified a proper procurement process .  That is one 
example. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  If we look at the 
maintenance agreement with China South Rail this agreement was 
authorised or recommended to the then Minister of Public Enterprises.  
It was a submission that was made directly to the board of directors, 
the full board of directors.  As far as we have checked out records 
20 
Chairperson…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When you say directly it means that it 
never underwent any procurement structures within Transnet?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As far as we have reviewed 
Advocate we have not seen any evidence of it surfacing at any 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 13 of 154 
 
management committee meeting.  Neither had it gone through the 
structures of management and also within the board there was a sub -
committee of the board that should have reviewed the submission and 
we do not find any evidence of that.  It was presented directly to the 
board of directors.  The full board meeting and then subsequently 
delivered to the ministers of office for approval.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair this now links with the evidence 
of Mr Volmink when he raised those concerns of important structures 
within procurement simply being undermined and transactions being 
sometimes approved by a single person without giving regard  to 
10 
process at all.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And had – yes you may proceed. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Sorry.  Chairperson I think 
also when we look at the entities Regiments and Trillian they have 
featured quite significantly.  We have done a fair amount of review in 
the workings of Regiments.  What we have found is again transactions 
where Regiments would be given approval or approval would be granted 
20 
for Regiments to provide certain services.  An example of that is the 
China Development Bank Loan for which Regiments was paid R166 
million as a success fee.  That particular transaction was approved by 
the ADC and it had not served at any management committ ee internally 
at Transnet neither had it subscribed to the prescripts of Transnet in 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 14 of 154 
 
terms of policies that we have within Transnet.  There is a number of 
frameworks and policies and processes that we have which are well 
established and transactions around  Regiments and Trillian seem to 
have bypassed these prescripts in Transnet completely.  In fact a 
number of executives at Transnet were completely ignorant of the fact 
that these transactions even occurred.  Some of them would have come 
to know of this through the media reports and not through the relevant 
committees that they may have sat on.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And all that – I mean the reviews 
that you have conducted and clear evidence of structures being 
10 
undermined makes you to come to an obs ervation at 3.1 where you say: 
“With the benefit of hindsight and in my new role I 
understand – I now understand that there was a 
system where a set of key role players both internal 
and external and Transnet executive board members 
and certain companies acted in concert to the 
detriment 
of 
Transnet’s 
best 
interest 
causing 
[indistinct] losses to the company.”  
And that is what you are maintaining?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Yes Advocate I maintain 
20 
that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May I then refer you  to page 4 and 
take us what you saying in paragraph 3.2.5?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Yes.  Again the Durban 
relocation which is now what we commonly call the Durban Relocation 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 15 of 154 
 
but this was the relocation of two OEM’s that were originally envisaged 
to assemble their locomotives in Johannesburg or in the surrounds of 
Gauteng were moved to Durban.  Once again when we reviewed the 
documentation it again seems as though individuals authorised this 
particular move and this particular move had not served at a ny relevant 
committee within the executive structures. Something as significant as 
this with the impact that it had on the delivery schedule should have or 
ought to have at least surfaced at the EXCO at the Executive 
Committee of Transnet if not even at th e board level.  The value that 
we reference on the Durban Relocation is just in excess of R1.2 billion.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And in order for us to appreciate 
what you are saying to the Chair you make reference to two annexures 
there, Annexure MS M2, 3 and 4.  May I refer you to page 47 the same 
bundle Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You can take us through that – through 
those documents in a chronology that might best suit your evidence 
because you can see that they are – from page 47 up until page 49. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Advocate.  Chair I think 
if we look at the documents that are annexed on annexure 3 and 4 it 
20 
actually provides the corroboration that this Durban Relocation for both 
the OEM’s was approved through a set of individuals rather than 
surfacing at any committee.  In fact it has the signatures of five or six 
executives but it had not served at any specific committee internally at 
Transnet at an executive level for approval.  We also would note th at it 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 16 of 154 
 
says that: 
“There is an outcome to the final negotiation.”  
And that again is being approved by a set of individuals.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I must hasten to say that the 
delegation of authority may have allowed t hese transactions to be 
processed in this particular way.  However good governance would 
actually call for some level of reporting and some process particularly 
when we did have steering committees etcetera that were in place at 
the time. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now let us place them properly on 
record so that we can be able to follow and appreciate your evidence.  
It you turn to page 50 you will see it must be saying MSS50.  Can you 
please identify that document for us?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Sorry my apologies.  This 
would be a memorandum.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is addressed to the 
Group Chief Executive at the time from the Acting Chief Executive of 
Transnet Freight Rail at that time requesting for the Acting Group Chief 
20 
Executive to approve the relocation of China North Rail to TE’s 
facilities in Durban Transnet Engineering Facilities in Durban for the 
manufacture of 233 Class 45 Diesel – Electric locomotives.  It should 
actually read Diesel Locomotives. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And if you go to the paragraph 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 17 of 154 
 
under the purpose, what is the purpose as described in that document?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It says: 
“Request the Acting Group Chief Executive to note 
the final outcome of the neg otiation for the relocation 
to Durban with CNR.  Approve the variation order for 
the relocation to Durban to a maximum value of R647 
million that is 647 181 494.00 with CNR.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No tender processes? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There is – as far as I am 
concerned there was not a process this was something that was put 
10 
together through a negotiating team who then made this proposal I am 
– my assumption is then to the Acting Chief Executive of Transnet 
Freight Rail. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And then it ask for a sign off 
of a letter to be issued to CNR to accept their final proposal.  And that 
letter is in the evidence pack as well Advocate.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you go to page 47.  Would that b e the 
letter that you are referring to or what is the purpose of this letter on 
page 47? 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair it would be page 48 
which would be the letter to China North Rail.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So it is exactly that letter 
that was signed which approves the variation order and under point one 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 18 of 154 
 
which says the Durban variation order for an amount of 647  181 494 
and it asks for the detail invoicing based on the variation order 
payment terms stipulated. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And when it says variation order what is 
being referred to? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In this case it is basically an 
increase in the cost of the project essentially because it is a variation 
from the original agreement that was entered into in March  2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And do you know what was the original 
10 
amount and to what amount was it now varied to?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think later on yes the 
amount for China North was somewhere  in the region of approximately 
9.9 billion. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And this 647 million is on 
top of that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As an additional? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is an addition yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and then who signs the letter on 
20 
page … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The Acting Group Chief 
Executive - Mr Gama – at the time. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you to – back to 
your statement with particular reference Chair to paragraph 4.1? 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 19 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page?  I am sorry. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am trying to (indistinct).  It is page 4 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now we may proceed Mr  Mahomedy to 
deal with the specific transaction.  C an you just give us an overview as 
to what transactions were under review as per your paragraph 4 and 
take us to the details of each in that summary?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chairperson as I said earlier 
on we selected certain transactions for revie w that were pervasive in 
10 
media reports as well as some concerns that were raised by the new 
Board at the time and we specifically focused on certain key 
transactions. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and when you go and look at the 
locomotives you then state – you know – the various sub topics that 
you dedicated your time on in order to expand on how – how it was 
reviewed.  Can you please take the Chair through that?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So the 1 064 locomotives 
was obviously a very significant transa ction in the life of Transnet.  At 
the time the issues that were being addressed was the fact that the 
20 
locomotive business case which was prepared in around April  2013 was 
for a value of R38.6 billion and the contracts that were entered into in 
March 2014 totalled approximately R49.4 billion and the question was 
always whether this increase was justifiable or not.  Amongst other 
things China South Rail had also received certain other contracts for 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 20 of 154 
 
the build of locomotives which were prior to the 1  064 program.  They 
had received a contract to build 95 locomotives which was through an 
open tender process at the time and then they had received a contract 
which was through confinement to build 100 locomotives for the coal 
line.  The allegations around the 100 l ocomotives was specifically 
around the process where originally it was envisaged that Mitsui will 
build those locomotives because they had built the previous set of 100 
locomotives on the coal line and there were the allegations around the 
fact that China South Rail were replaced as the service provider.  This 
is just some context as to why …  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
We 
looked 
at 
these 
transactions. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Obviously we also then knew 
of the deposit that was paid on the maintenance agreement with China 
South Rail.  We also learnt that China South Rail was the only entity 
that had received this maintenance agreement.  We had not entered 
into the maintenance agreement with  any of the other OEMs at the time 
and then we looked at the Locomotive Transaction Advisory Service 
20 
Contract which originally was with McKinsey and which had morphed 
into a Regiments led consortium when Regiments were originally not 
even part of the consortium that had bid for that particular piece of 
work.  Some of the signs that were problematic for us was the fact that 
we had paid as part of the Locomotive Transaction Advisory a 166 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 21 of 154 
 
million as I said earlier on for the facilitation and what was called t he 
success fee for the China Development Bank loan.  The payments for 
relocation costs as I alluded to earlier on.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  What we then believe is 
unwarranted Transaction Advisory fees and costs on the C hina 
Development Bank loan and the reason and the club loan this is a 
transaction that we will expound on later on which is called the ZAR 
Club Loan.  Chairperson very simply all it is – is a syndication of banks 
to lend us money for which Trillian charged  us including VAT 
10 
approximately R93.5 million. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  For what? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is exactly the question 
that we asked because the Treasury Team at Transnet had the 
capability to execute all of these transactions and we  could not 
understand why.  In fact at one of the meetings I clearly remember the 
Chairperson of the Board ask a question around why was our Treasury 
Team replaced with Regiments and Trillian and that was very early on 
in the tenure of the new Board and th at precipitated all of the reviews 
that have taken place on the Transnet Treasury function which we will 
20 
also talk about later on.  There are certain discussions around 
contracts with McKinsey.  The ones that I had personal involvement in 
from a management perspective was what is called the SWAT contracts.   
It has got nothing to do with any of the American Agencies Chair.  It is 
a contract that was put together.  For some reason the name SWAT was 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 22 of 154 
 
given but it is largely a process that was to put together t eams that 
would assist Transnet in the capital strategy and structure of the 
business. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We also looked at Trillian 
capital partners as I will also denunciate further down in the 
submission.  I was  personally involved in some of the transactions that 
were pushed through the system for Trillian when no work in the 
departments were done and that was something we had to look at 
because there were different entities within Trillian that were getting 
10 
paid and we will talk about that as well.  Nkonki I think the 
Auditor-General in around March  2018 issues a notice to State Owned 
Entities and state organs around the involvement of Nkonki in possible 
state capture at that time and Nkonki were the service pro vider to 
Transnet for an internal audit function which went out on open tender in 
2013.  In around January/February  2017 there was a submission to the 
ADC which was a Board Sub Committee – the Acquisitions and 
Disposals Committee which made procurement dec isions to award 
Nkonki an increase in that internal audit service contract for R500 
million. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With any tender process?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No tender process.  Also 
violation and contravention of the PFMA.  Violation and c ontravention 
of National Treasury notes and instruction notes?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 23 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The 500 million in context 
Nkonki had a contract for five years initially from 1  August 2013 to 
31 July 2018.  That total contract w as for 500 million over five years for 
the internal audit service work and this approval in February  2017 was 
effectively giving them a 500 million increase on a 500 million contract 
over a 24 month average period. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So meaning that in total it would have 
actually scored almost …  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  A billion Rand. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A billion – a contract to the value of a 
10 
billion – one billion? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes that is correct and 
obviously Neotel - as I also explained a little earlier - and T-Systems.  
T-Systems in – in Transnet Group Capital while I was there I had 
identified in the execution of my function there certain irregularities.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Those 
are 
the 
key 
transactions. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now let us focus our attention to the 
1 064 locomotives.  What was your involvement in this transaction – if 
20 
any? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in my role as the 
General Manager of Group Capital Integration at Transnet one of the 
key accountabilities that I had was management of the capital portfolio 
of Transnet and that included all of the key projects and mega projects 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 24 of 154 
 
that Transnet was contemplating at the time under what was then called 
the Market Demand Strategy or short the MDS.  This was a strategy 
that was implemented in around 2011 with a seven year view of 
executing capital that was in excess of R300 billion.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To create capacity ahead of 
demand.  That was the punchline.  We wanted to create capacity ahead 
of demand so that when the key commodities with – would actually 
materialise the infrastructure would be in place and we would not be 
disadvantaged as a company or a country.  One mega project within the 
10 
300 billion was the acquisition of locomotives.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
There 
was 
a 
detailed 
process to understand whether there was a business need for Transnet 
as to whether they required locomotives and specifically this was in the 
Transnet Freight Rail Division.  The process of creating a business 
case takes into consideration the business need, financial assumptions 
and a whole host of other activities.  The ownership of that business 
case is always within the operating division that will utilise those 
assets and in this case it was Transnet Freight Rail.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  However at the time there 
was a – there was a level of intent which was is sued to McKinsey or the 
McKinsey Consortium to assist with the business case amongst other 
things related to the advisory on 1  064.  My role was to actually assist 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 25 of 154 
 
McKinsey in coordinating the activities between Freight Rail and the 
group functions and als o managing the process of getting the business 
case completed at the time. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is largely where it was. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and a business case was completed.  
May I refer you to page 57? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes advocate.  That is the 
business case that was completed and submitted.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now in order for us to appreciate 
10 
what did it entail and whether it did achieve also its purpose may I 
refer you to page 90 of the very same document – the business case – 
and under the heading – under paragraph 4.3 Chair – under the 
heading “Approach to Cost Calculation” and tell us what was sought to 
be achieved in that paragraph and what really transpired.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think when you look 
at the approach to cost. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The first thing that we speak 
about here is to look at the life cycle cost of the – of the locomotives 
20 
and also to focus on the capital and other costs.  So not necessarily 
just what it would cost to buy the locomotives ….  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Bu you would have to assess 
what it would be over the life cycle of this particular asset.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 26 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And all those issues would be factored 
at that stage? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So that in the future there are no any 
other surprising costs that might befell Transnet.  Am I correct?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think under 4.3.1 …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Some of the salient issues 
10 
of this particular paragraph is also towards the m iddle of that particular 
paragraph.  It says that: 
“The localisation component wraps up over time.  
The USD price component was forecasted by 
escalating at USD inflation and converting back to 
ZAR …” 
Which is the South African Rand. 
“…using forward ZAR/USD  hedge rates.  The local 
price component was escalated at South African 
PPI.” 
20 
Why that becomes critical and important is that when the business case 
was prepared - and as I state further down in my statement as well – 
we cannot read the business case in is olation of the financial model 
that was prepared at the time. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 27 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which was very in depth as 
well.  Which was prepared by Transnet Freight Rail at the time and in 
the financial models as well as in t he business case we factored in the 
escalation for the locomotives.  It would be normal practice at Transnet 
when you consider that you would look at purchasing something over 
period of time.  If you were purchasing something just for this year you 
may not have the impact of escalation but this was originally envisaged 
to be a six year delivery program and taking into consideration the 
values that were at play one would have had to have brought in 
escalations on the pricing and it is clear in both the finan cial model and 
10 
on page 90 of the submission that the local PPI rates as well as the US 
inflation rate and if my memory services me correctly I think it was at 
about 2.3 percent escalation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  On US Dollar rates through 
the business case.  That meant that in the 38.6 billion we had already 
factored in a level of escalation and inflation.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you to page 97 – 
in the same document Mr  Chair - with particular reference to paragraph 
5.2 so that you must – we have to understand as to what was 
20 
considered at the time when the amount was estimated and what 
factors were taken into consideration.  Take us through paragraph 5.2.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think suffice to say in 
paragraph 5.2 is EXHIBIT 29 which is very clear.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 28 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  At the time that the business 
case was prepared the foreign exchange – the spot rate – was R9.13 
for a – for one South African Rand and thereafter we would have 
obtained the future possible rates an estimation of the forward curve - 
what we call the forward curve.  We would have obtained that from 
either financial institutions of the entities that we normally use 
(intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Having regard to the duration of the 
contract itself? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So what is important here 
advocate is that we did factor in an escalation - if you want to call it 
that - in the foreign exchange rate against the US Dollar giving 
consideration to the fact that a number of the components of any 
original equipment manufacturer submission would have a dollar 
component but I also think that one of the very impo rtant points is the 
last paragraph on page 97. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which talks about the impact 
20 
of localisation.  Essentially 55 percent and 60 percent of the diesels 
and electric locomotives were to have had a loca l – that impact or that 
percentage of localisation or the local content.  That would mean that 
that percentage would not necessarily be subjected to a foreign 
exchange impact because it would be spent locally in our country and I 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 29 of 154 
 
think the paragraph explains it very, very simply.  It says:  
“Localisation of production is a natural hedge.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  “Exposure would 
increase with a lower level of localisation.  The 
exhibit below shows foreign currency exposure for a 
10 percent devaluation scenario to be 1.2 billion.  
Given a 70 percent localisation component without 
any localisation exposure under this scenario would 
be 4 billion.” 
10 
That also explains the impact of the foreign exchange to the entire 
transaction. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you back to page 
5?  That is now your statement before the Commission and proceed to 
take us through paragraph 5.1 point two onwards on the 1  064 
locomotives. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In terms of the business 
case for the 1 064 as I said earlier on there was an advisory contract 
that was initially also handed to the McKinsey Consortium.  I had no 
role in the procurement of that or the process that was followed in that 
20 
transaction advisors. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That process commenced in 
2012 at some point.  When I got to the general – sorry – the Group 
Capital Integration and Assurance Department the letter of intent had 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 30 of 154 
 
already been issued to McKinsey.  Through the p rocess we learnt that 
the McKinsey Consortium had had some changes.  Amongst others 
Letsema who were part of the original submission and there was an 
indication - and again I have not seen the documentation – but there 
was indication that Letsema were serv ice providers or planning to be 
service providers to an entity that may have or could have bid in the 
1 064 program already.  Once again just to give context.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Advocate if you would allow 
me. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes please. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The RFP had gone out in 
July 2012 for the 1 064.  Timelines are quite important as we progress 
through this conversation.  So in December  2012 the LOI is issued to 
McKinsey.  Subsequently Letse ma is found to have a possible conflict 
of interest and later on Nedbank were also deemed to have a possible 
conflict of interest which was documented through letters between 
Transnet and McKinsey as McKinsey were - the heads of agreement 
were held with them - where it was expressed that Nedbank had shown 
an interest in downstream funding activities and accordingly they 
20 
deemed to be having a conflict of interest.  Regiments had been the 
replacement entity for both – as far as we are aware – for both Letsema  
and Nedbank.  That changed the consortium in all of its faces and we 
have learnt subsequent to the reviews that have been conducted also 
by MNS that this particular contract is deemed irregular in terms of 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 31 of 154 
 
procurement processes and – and the PFMA as well. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We then – obviously the 
business case commenced – the process of preparing the business 
case commenced with TFR and McKinsey.  There were a number of 
issues etcetera but the TFR/McKinsey – when I say TFR.  It is the 
Transnet Freight Rail Teams – McKinsey as well as the Group Capital 
Integration Teams work together.  Mr  Singh – Mr Anoj Singh – the then 
CFO of Transnet provided the key oversight role in this process of the 
preparation of the business case.  It – it required long hours working 
10 
over weekends and Mr  Singh was very, very involved in this process 
and at points during the process he also liaised with the TFR Chief 
Executive - who was ultimately the owner of the business case – he 
liaised with him and at that time it was Mr  Siyabonga Gama.  As I said 
advocate and Chair the business case must be read in conjunction with 
the financial model.  In some cases some detail may be in the financial 
model but may not be explicitly stated in the busin ess case.  However I 
think the business case is quite comprehensive.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And I think we have gone 
20 
through the relevant pages where in 5.17 as I state:  
“The business case included the forward curve on  
the foreign exchange rate for the US Dollar.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And this was as per the financial model 
which was prepared Mr  Kahla? 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 32 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  This was prepared by 
Transnet Freight Rail.  Obviously Mr  Kahla prepared all of it and then it 
went through some review processes by McKinsey as well as our teams 
and it is included in that particular model as well as it is stated in the 
business case document. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As I said the financial model 
provided for inflation a different rates at estimates of between 5.9 
percent for the SA PPI and approximately 2.3 percent for the US Dollar.  
There is an assumption in the business case which is 50 percent local 
10 
content.  We are aware that that is not in line with the DTI codes but 
that was an assumption in the business case.  In fact the DTI codes are 
higher than the 50 percent.  The assumption also in the business case 
is a six year delivery schedule.  These things become relevant as we  … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  (Intervenes). 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Will progress further.  Chair 
in terms of 5.1.75 the total capital acquisition cost which was estimated 
in the business case in April  2013 of R38.6 billion also included R2.24 
billion in what we call contingencies making provision for somethings 
that we may not have thought of in the business case and that is 
20 
explicit on page 96 of the submission – EXHIBIT 28 – which talks about 
the locomotive contingency over the period at R2.24 billi on. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So everything equal Mr  Mahomedy if one 
looks at the business case and the financial model one would not have 
expected any increase into the acquisition of the 1  064 locomotives and 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 33 of 154 
 
having taken us through all the factors that w ere actually estimated and 
forecasted? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Advocate I think when we 
look at the complete business case that was submitted I think we 
should have a 90 to 95 percent comfort – confidence level in the 
numbers that were proposed.  If there was something that was 
extraneous completely out of kilter with what we had projected and an 
example would be if the exchange rate went far beyond what we had 
put in – yes there would be an – there would be an expectation of an 
increase.  However the R2.2 billion contingency would have given you 
10 
that first room to manoeuvre and only if you went beyond the 2.2 billion 
would there be an expectation to go beyond R38.6 billion.  So I have a 
confidence in the numbers that were submitted at the time becaus e of 
the buffer that was created and 2.2 billion is quite a significant number 
when one considers any business case.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  From page 6 paragraph 5.1.9 you 
proceed to highlight certain issues for the Chair.  Could you please 
proceed? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  One of the key assumptions 
in this business case is what we call the demand profile which talks to 
20 
the expected volume that the general freight business would deliver on.  
It becomes quite significant as at the time of prep aring the business 
case we have to consider where the macro economic factors were.  
Where we were as a country.  We had significant challenges from the 
2008 financial crisis – global crisis.  There was a lot of discussion 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 34 of 154 
 
around – as I remember talking about – people were talking about 
green shoots in economies across the world.  There was an expectation 
that commodities would pick up.  So there was a view that there was a 
– there was a need for locomotives that were relating to a growth in –
what we call – the general freight business.  Very, very high level.  The 
general freight business is all of the commodities except for the export 
coal and export iron ore.  So all of the other commodities that Transnet 
Freight Rail moves would fall under the auspices of  general freight.  At 
that time we had a projected volume for general freight.  Together with 
the - together with the quality of locomotives that existed at the time 
10 
there was a need for new locomotives.  The last batch of locomotives 
that Transnet had procured in any big significant procurement event 
went back to the 70s – late 70s – I believe it was.  So we had an 
average age in our general freight fleet that was already more than 30 
years.  Locomotives would normally – they had a useful life of about 30 
years depending on utilisation etcetera.  The reason this is important is 
because that projected demand, which was in the business case, did 
not materialise.  
 
Now once again in the document that we submitted the 
business case is very clear in the executiv e summary towards the latter 
20 
part of the executive summary where it says that – it’s on page 66, it 
says Transnet’s procurement strategy relating to this locomotives will 
be flexible enough to adapt to actual locomotive demand that is 
realised over time. 
 
This is quite key, up to year one, year two there was no 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 35 of 154 
 
demand, it did not materialise. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  There was no demand at the time.    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     The demand did not 
materialise to the expectation in the business case.  If we look at the 
values that were anticipated we should have been doing upwards of 
110/120 million tons a year in general freight.  We currently have 
reached, last – well the previous year we did 90million tons so clearly 
the demand was not materialising as expected.  We then had to have 
looked at what the revised profile should have been and action should 
have been taken and that was not done.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     So I think that when we talk 
about 518 we are actually talking about the demand and as it would 
have – as it was envisaged in the business case.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     I think the other key matter 
is that when we look at the – and all of this becomes quite relevant  
when we start looking at the increase in ETC or the increase in the 
expected total cost of the project a little later on.  When we modelled 
all of the numbers relating to the expected volumes, the expected 
20 
revenue, the costs, the total cost of ownership t his project yielded 
Chairperson what is called a net present value positive, meaning that 
this business case would at the end of the day yield a positive benefit 
to Transnet.  It’s quite important, it’s in the documents.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 36 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Obviously as I said in July 
2012 when the RFP went out tenders would have been received, but 
they would have been, they would remained closed because we had not 
at that point received the approval from the Minister in terms of  Section 
54 of the PFMA, which was necessary, so the documents would have all 
stayed sealed, the process of approval within Transnet, internally 
commenced in about April 2013 where it went through to relevant 
management committees and then through to the s ub-committees of the 
Board and then ultimately to the Board, who then made a submission to 
the shareholder Minister for the Section 54 approval, which was 
10 
received in August 2013 from the then Minister of Public Enterprises 
which I think was Mr Malusi Giga ba. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Once that approval was 
received then the evaluation processes would commence and the 
evaluation processes would look at a number of factors, it would look at 
supply development, BBBEE, the financial aspects, the technical 
aspects and the – you know whether there’s compliance and 
responsiveness from all of the tenderers at the time.  This was 
conducted by teams within the Transnet Freight Rail space and there 
20 
was no involvement from either myself or my team in that particular 
process of evaluation across any of that.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Why was your team or that Department 
excluded? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That would be normal 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 37 of 154 
 
process that the owners of the business case and th e owner of the 
procurement transaction would conduct those evaluations.  It wouldn’t 
have been, it’s not uncommon that the group teams get involved at 
some point, but in this case were not involved at all.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, now from paragraph 5.1.11 you’re 
talking about the very same issue that you are no longer involved post 
that stage. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   So I think Advocate to give 
some colour to this subsequent to the completion of the business case 
the approvals and the evaluations there was a discussion around who 
10 
would form part of that negotiating team to now get into contracting 
stage, because you now had the evaluations, you had everything that 
was now completed, and one would expect that that would have been 
all done in terms of all of the legislated processes and internal 
procedures.  You would now engage in what we now call the post -
tender negotiations.   
 
This was to have been – to have commenced in about the first 
week of February and as I mentioned around the 3 r d or 4 t h of February 
2014, my memory is not exact, but I remember it was either a Monday 
or Tuesday in the first week of February I was informed by Mr Arnot 
20 
Singh that I would not have any further role in the negotiations and that 
I would be spending time at the office and making sure that that would 
continue in terms of the sustainability of finance and he was appointed 
then, and this is what he informed me that he was appointed by Mr 
Molefe, Brian Molefe at the time, to head up the negotiations.   
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 38 of 154 
 
 
On the same day I was also informed by one of the members of 
the McKinsey team of their withdrawal from the negotiation team.  
Initially it was envisaged that they would be significantly involved in the 
negotiation team, assisting Transnet, not necessarily directly inv olved 
but assisting Transnet in negotiation through whether it was the 
strategy of negotiation through whether it was the strategy of 
negotiation defining the parameters and also assisting in terms of 
providing Transnet with insights from their global expe rience in not 
necessarily just locomotives but other significant transactions.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, but why – what was the reason for 
10 
them withdrawing? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     I’m not entirely clear but I 
was given some indication tha t there was a – there was discomfort from 
McKinsey around the timing, or the proposed timing that Transnet was 
putting on the table to negotiate such a significant transaction.  There 
was talks of a six week negotiation period which obviously didn’t make 
too much sense when you give consideration to the fact that were 
talking about what of the time, if my memory serves me correctly was 
one of the single biggest locomotive transaction in the world, and we 
were talking about negotiating this over six weeks.  We had negotiated 
20 
and I was involved in the 95 loco negotiation which took probably the 
same period of time and that was for 95 locomotives, so I think what 
indication I had got at the time, and it may be true or not, but I had got 
that indication from an individual at McKinsey that there was discomfort 
in terms of Transnet “rushing” the negotiation process.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 39 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    What then happened after it withdrew, 
after McKinsey withdrew?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   As far as I’m aware McKinsey 
then withdrew and there was a cession or a – for purposes I know the 
lawyers that are sitting here will say to me it was not a session, there 
was a purported session of the McKinsey locomotive advisory contract 
and the reason I say that Chair is because we have not been able to 
find a cession agreement between McKinsey and Regiments on this 
cession.  What we do have is a letter, I think that’s marked I think it’s 
Annexure 6 if I can reference it where McKinsey actually writes to 
10 
Transnet ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    I think it’s page 175. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes it’s page 175. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Page 175 is a letter from 
McKinsey stating that the – all rights and obligations created through 
the 1064 locomotive advisory was ceded and/or delegated to Regiments 
capital in accordance with such agreement to discussion.  There isn’t a 
cession agreement as far as we are aware, however it is also worthy to 
note Chair this letter is written the 16 t h of April 2014.  As we go further 
20 
down in the document you will also find that the exact MSA, which is 
the Master Service Level Agreement, was actually only signed by 
McKinsey on the 21 s t of February 2014, which is subsequent to the 
cession date, and it may be interesting but that’s the facts that we have 
at this point in time.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 40 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Now other than the letter that you see 
on page 175 you are saying that from the records of Transnet there was 
never a cession agreement?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Not in my understanding 
there was not a cession. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   What I want to also understand what 
was the status of the letter of intent if is recorded, between McKinsey 
and Transnet at this stage of this purported cession?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    As far as I’m aware in – 
there were certain extensions to the letter of intent and at some point 
10 
again in my document I think it’s later on, we talk about the letter of 
intent; the validity period had been extended to the 30 t h of November 
2013.  I don’t believe from the documents that we’ve reviewed that 
there was a further extension to this LOI, and therefore this letter of 
intent had essentially expired. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now assuming that there could have 
been that cession, I know you said purported cession, what rights, if 
any, would McKinsey have to cede you know the contract, having 
regard to the fact that the letter of intent has lapsed?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I guess that you know 
20 
something that the lawyers would h ave to debate but if the letter of 
intent expired without a Master Service Level Agreement being drawn 
up there essentially isn’t a contract that can be entered into as far as I 
understand.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes.  But we know that when this 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 41 of 154 
 
cession occurred there was never any tender process in relation to the 
services to be rendered by Regiments?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     No there wasn’t a tender 
process that went through and in fact I think when we look at the 
Regiments’ involvement in this as we progressed, if I can call it that, 
into 2015 this contract moved from a value of approximately R35million 
to over or close to 270/280million and Regiments were the primary 
beneficiaries in that extension of value in time.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes.  May I then refer you back to your 
statement, page 7 Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Mokoena ...(intervention)  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   177. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ... looks like this is the time for the short 
adjournment. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I was assured that I would never miss 
that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to take the short adjournment and we 
will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Chair before I proceed I am 
informed that we have now effected the necessary changes to Exhibit 
BB3.1 and Exhibit BB3.2 so that they must not be any sense that there 
is any number or…  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 42 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja not that is fine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Exhibit that it is missing from the 
proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Mr Mahomedy just before the tea 
adjournment I was about to refer you to page 7 of your witness 
statement with particular reference to paragraph 5.1.1 3 for you to 
please take us through that. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as I alluded to earlier 
on there was a purported session of the McKinsey contract for the 1064 
10 
advisory which the earliest was effective on the 4 February 2014 in 
terms of the document numbered 175 or on the 5 February – my 
apologies.  However Chair in – I have reviewed some documentation 
that suggest there was a contract that was entered into between 
Transnet represented by Mr Anoj Singh and Regiments represented by 
Mr Niven Pillay at the time that dates to the 20 January 2014 which is 
for the very same services and it is headed ‘Transaction Advisory 
Services related to the acquisition of 1064 locomotives over a period of 
twelve months.’  Annexures – page 177. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes before we go there.  But if you look 
20 
at the timeline you know in relation to the purported session and this 
agreement that you say that you have now reviewed how was this 
possible, how – what happened? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This is exactly part of the 
confusion and where one gets to the conclusion that there seems to be 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 43 of 154 
 
or seemed to have been parallel processes in play at the time.  The 
purported session rightfully or wrongfully the – happened on the 5 
February 2014.  However before that date on the 20 January 2014 there 
seems already to be an agreement between Regiments and Transnet to 
execute on the very same contract that McKinsey is the heads of 
agreement with. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And no procurement processes 
obviously? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  There is no procurement 
processes as far as we are aware that were on this matter but in 
10 
addition if we actually look at page 180 or the same document …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Mr Chair may I refer you first – Mr 
Mahomedy let us go to page 177.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And then please identify that document?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this is the document 
that I am referencing which says that there is an agreement between 
Transnet and Regiments.  In fact it is on a letterhead that incorporates 
both entities. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes and… 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Transnet and Regiments. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And what is the date of that letter?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The 20 January 2014. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now let us go to the page that you 
wanted to take the Chair to that will be page 180.  Yes.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 44 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  Chair if we look at the 
signatures on the document Mr Anoj Singh is a signato ry and next to 
that – next to his signature is marked subject to items listed below.  
And amongst the things that are listed below it says:  
“Costs and payment against this scope may not be 
made.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Tell – tell us – tell the Chair where you 
are reading? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I am reading the last line on 
page 180 Chair – my apologies. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  The handwritten. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  The handwritten.  It is 
handwritten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The handwritten note?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It says: 
“Costs and payment against this scope may not be 
20 
made above R9 million without s pecific approval.” 
This is 2014. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  We later learn that this 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 45 of 154 
 
amount exceeded R284 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It was not to exceed R9 million…  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This is… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But upon review it is – it exceeded how 
much? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  It exceeds R280 million.  
This was – and it says without the specific approval by Transnet.  
However the document is out of sy nc in terms of timelines, clearly out 
of sync.  It does not make sense that Transnet would be negotiating 
10 
with a service provider who is going to become the – what would you 
call it?  The cessionary or the cadent of the transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the cessionary. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  While – the cessionary while 
there is a – seems as though there is a conversation taking place whilst 
this is still being discussed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So effectively the cession as 
I understand it between Transnet and McKinsey was a – was an 
irrelevant discussion because this agreement was already drawn before 
20 
that date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Already before that date there was an 
existing agreement? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Agreement. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 46 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Between the two parties?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  What is also I think to add to 
this Advocate is the fact that this agreement or t his supposed 
agreement is drafted with Transnet and Regiments on a Transnet and 
Regiments letterhead.  That is not normal practise in Transnet.  That is 
not where we present legal documents with sharing letterheads or 
bringing in logos of different entitie s onto legal contracts. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Mokoena the fissure that Mr Mahomedy is 
mentioning sounds like something I have heard before in this 
commission and it may have been in relation to Eskom where the 
letterhead of a SOE or a letter reflected the letterhead or emblem or 
logo of the SOE’s as well as of the …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Service provider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Proposed service supplier and in regard to that there 
was also queries about how that came about and I thin k whoever was 
giving evidence may also have said that was unusual.  I think I 
remember I asked the question how it was possible that it should be 
20 
like that.  So somebody will just need to go and check and see whether 
maybe this is how some of these things were being done.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Indeed Chair.  Now you conclude neatly 
on that aspect with reference to your paragraph 5.1.14. Please take the 
Chair through it even though I am sure that you might have ventilated 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 47 of 154 
 
same through your evidence. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chair I think the above 
illustrates further there was a parallel system at play because 
McKinsey having been appointed through a procurement process for the 
transaction advisory service there was a parallel appointment of 
Regiments in January 2014 for the same service.  And I think that is 
explained through the timeline that I pointed out earlier on.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now earlier on when you gave the 
Chair the summary of the topics that you will be canvassing you did  
also talk to the unjustified increment of the ETC.  Now could you please 
10 
proceed to provide much more details and clarity around this issue?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair when the negotiations 
with the OEM’s were complete we were then informed that  the ETC 
what we call the ETC the estimated total cost of completion of the 1064 
locomotive transaction was now going to be in the region of R54 billion 
which includes a contingency.  I raised the matter with Mr Anoj Singh to 
enquire in terms of what had transpired and he gave me some very high 
level reasons stating escalations, if we needed to go out on this long 
term or longer term foreign exchange the rate had deteriorated at the 
time given that but he said that there was a detailed report that was 
20 
being prepared for the approval of the board who was the accounting 
authority at the time.  And that was where that matter was left for that 
point.  However one of the things that we are not aware of, we have not 
seen the documentation in terms of…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry as a matter of interest what was your 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 48 of 154 
 
reaction to what you say high level reasons that he gave you?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We did… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they convincing to you?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Not necessarily Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There were as I said the two 
clean matter – the clear matters that he put on the table at the time 
was escalations which if we left it out for six or seven years it would 
cost the company too much and the foreign e xchange.  I remember him 
saying that it would have cost us more than – more than another R10 
10 
billion if we left it.  So when I say another R10 billion it would have 
gone to beyond R60 billion.  That was his assessment at the time.  
Having no context to any  of the discussions because I had no role at all 
in the negotiations we did not accept it but I think we looked at it 
circumspectly.  There were – it was not clear to me that we would have 
a justifiable increase for this value on the table particularly in light of 
the R38.6 billion business case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But also to piggyback from the Chair’s 
question at this stage Mr Mahomedy there was a detailed business case 
20 
that you have taken the Chair through.  There wa s a costing model that 
factored a number of issues and I am sure that Mr Singh must have 
been aware of those documents?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Mr Singh was definitely 
aware of all of those documents Chair.  As I said he was the effective 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 49 of 154 
 
sponsor of the entire business case process at the time in April 2013.  
He had full oversight of all of the processes in the preparation of 
business case.  As I also stated that we had long hours – long 
discussions and debates and meetings some of which were at Tran snet 
others were at the McKinsey offices even on weekends and Mr Singh 
used to be present for a lot of those meetings at McKinsey.  So he had 
an intimate understanding of the business case.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And on paragraph 5.2.3 you seem 
to be highlighting in far much more clarity the issues that the Chair was 
posing to you.   
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I also think that in – at 
some point in April 2013 the business case which is presented in front 
of the commission today in the Executive Summary part references that 
the business case or this business case excludes the impact of price 
escalations and foreign exchange. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That I do not believe is true.  
There have been a number of reviews that we have conducted in that 
regard and I think that that was an oversight on the part of Transnet in 
terms of aligning this document with some other documents that were 
20 
presented and not necessarily by somebody who was involved in this 
process who understood that it included all of these costs.  So the 
submission before you in the Executive Summary says it excludes but it 
does include.  It may exclude as I said any extraneous event or 
extraneous cost not necessarily escalations and inflatio n that was 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 50 of 154 
 
specifically included. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And when this increment was 
sought was there a memorandum that was prepared to the board?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  I think in recent 
months I have been provided with a memor andum that was submitted to 
the board of directors – once again Chair it was submitted directly to 
the board of directors in May 2014 which endeavours to explain the 
increase in the ETC from R38.6 to R54 billion.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And for completeness Chair I am 
referring the witness to page 182.  182.  
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes here. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Are you there? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am just waiting for the Chair to locate 
the relevant document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it on divider MSM8?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It is 8 Chair it is MSM8.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  That we are referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That – mentioning the MSM or the divider 
20 
might. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Might help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Help with locating it ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We will do that Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 51 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now could you please identify that 
document for us? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this is a document 
from the then Group Chief Executive Mr Brian Molefe to the Transnet 
board of directors under the subject ‘Increase in Estimated Total Cost 
of the acquisition of 1064 locomotives for Transnet Freight Rails 
general freight business.’ 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And can you take us through the 
contents of that paragraph under the heading ‘Purpose?’  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The purpose of this memo is 
10 
for the board to note the reasons for the increase in ETC.  
To request that the board  approve an increase in the ETC or estimated 
total cost for the acquisition of the 1064 locomotives for the general 
freight business of Transnet Freight Rail from R38.6 billion to R54.5 
billion. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And I know that later on you w ill be 
commenting on this memo but for us to appreciate your comments take 
us through what is stated in the Executive Summary?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  Chair I think largely in 
the Executive Summary it endeavours to provide an explanation of th e 
20 
movement from R38 billion or R38.6 to R54 billion in different 
categories.  It puts it down to update on business case for updated 
economic assumptions, forex and escalation risk mitigation, Transnet 
Engineering scope, contingencies and then it goes on t o say that was 
actually some of the costs were lower than the capital acquisition cost 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 52 of 154 
 
of minus 6.5 billion. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Refer please to page 185 and 
under discussion the items that are listed in paragraph 3 would that be 
a justification for the increment?  Page 185. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I do not believe that 
these are proper justifications…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  No I understand that … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  For in terms of the 
submission. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I understand that you might not believe 
10 
it. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But for now I am saying that as they are 
recorded there…  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is the recorded … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  These would appear to have been a 
justification for the increment?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you just take us through?  What was 
the justification? 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   
“The increase in ETC of R15.9 billion is due to the 
following: 
Escalations from the approved business case to 
award date. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 53 of 154 
 
Forex from the approved business case to award 
date. 
Additional scope of work allocated to Transnet 
Engineering for the strategy to enable TE to 
eventually transform to An OEM of locomotives 
strategic. 
The cost of reducing the batch size strategic and risk 
mitigation. 
The cost of future escalations over the life of the 
contract forward looking and risk mitigation.  
10 
The cost of fixing forex exposure over the life of the 
contract forward looking and risk mitigation. 
And 
contingencies 
related 
to 
variation 
orders, 
options such as electronically controlled pneumatic 
braking and wire distributive power and capital 
spares. 
Item G of Table 2.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And you had an op portunity to 
review these grounds of justifications in light of the documents that you 
have reviewed and having regard to the previous business case can 
20 
you take us through your overall assessment of this memorandum?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think before we go to 
the if it will please the Chair – before we actually go to the actual 
numbers and the justification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 54 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is also quite important to 
understand the process that was followed once aga in with the 
submission. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair once again this 
significant increase is provided on a memorandum directly to the board 
of directors.  There is no management process that has look ed at the 
veracity of this submission.  Ordinarily within Transnet a submission of 
this nature would have to serve at an investment forum, the capital 
10 
investment committee and the executive committee from a management 
perspective.  Within the board’s struc tures at that time right or wrongly 
it would have served at the ADC, the acquisitions and disposals 
committee before submitting to the board itself.  That process was not 
followed at all.  It served directly at the board.  The second key matter 
is the date.  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go there.  So are you saying ordinarily 
when there is a transaction that has been subjected to a tender process 
and if there are – there is an increase in costs there is a procedure 
through which…  
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a procedure for the approval of those costs 
of the increase in costs and in this case at that time it should have 
gone through the bodies that you have mentioned but you say it did not 
do that.  That was not done.  It went straight to the board and you say 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 55 of 154 
 
that was unusual? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That was entirely unusual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MA HOMEDY: Chair the other significant 
point in the timing of this transaction.  The contracts were signed 
around of the 17 March 2014.  This approval is dated May 2014 which 
is essentially a post factor approval.  The process once again dictates 
that you cannot enter into a procurement transaction if the capital 
10 
investment value has not been increased to the value of the contract.  
Which would mean that this approval would have been required prior to 
us entering into those contracts which did not happen so th is is what 
we call a post factor approval which again contravenes the Transnet 
processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if this kind of submission had been subjected to 
the normal processes which would have included the involvement of 
management is it likely that management would have said but how can 
this happen you know while you already had an agreement and now you 
bring this?  They would – in all probability they would have queried 
20 
that, management? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Most definitely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Because he contracts – this 
was essentially a non-event. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 56 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  From an approval process.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I say that with caution but it 
was a non-event because it was – the contracts had already been 
entered into.  Transnet was already committed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To the R49.4 plus the R4.9 
billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But we were already 
committed into the transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And there was no explicit 
approval  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Prior to the execution of 
those contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess that you probably can think of no basis 
on which those who wanted this approval could have advised if this had 
20 
gone through management and management said what are you doing?  
Thing do not happen this way you have got to have this first.  Or are 
you able to think that maybe they might have had some basis or to 
justify doing these things this way?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in terms of any 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 57 of 154 
 
process on the increase of an estimated total cost of a project in 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We have a delegation of 
authority document which is very clear.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED 
SULEMAN 
MAHOMEDY:  Which explains the 
processes and the approval limits that exist.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And it should have in all 
10 
probability had to have gone through the management structures.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  So clearly in my opinion 
there was a concern somewhere along the line that had it gone through 
management it may have raised red flags. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes exactly that is what I was wondering whether 
management was being bypassed because it was foreseen that 
management would disagree and – and it would be difficult to justify to 
engage management with – in any rational manner to get them to agree 
and that therefore it was thought well let it – let us send it to the board 
20 
of directors maybe the board of directors are unaware – were seen as 
unlikely to raise objections. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair to illustrate the point 
that management would definitely have disagreed is the fact that in the 
original business case we said that the business case was nett present 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 58 of 154 
 
value positive which made sense to make this investment.  In terms of 
the nett present value at the time it was reflect ed as is reflected in the 
business case at a positive R2.7 billion.  The – in my opinion moving 
from R38 to R54.5 billion the business case is definitely negative.  It is 
a NPV negative number.  That was – would have been an immediate red 
flag for management. Making in this case a R54 billion investment with 
a negative NPV is the first and most important sign that there is 
something wrong.  And that would have been based on the; for want of 
a better word the optimistic projections on the revenue numbers.  A nd 
with that it would give you a negative NPV.  The reason I put this on 
10 
the table is because in point 7 on page 183 it says that:  
“The NPV of the business case remains positive at 
R11.68 billion.” 
And that is because they change their assumptions in how t hey 
calculated the NPV.  That is the first red flag Chair.  The second red 
flag this was not an increase of 3% or 5% and even if it was 5% or 3% 
it was significant.  But Chair this was an increase that was from R38 to 
R54 billion.  It was approximately 50%  just about 40 odd percent 
increase in ETC.  The first thing that management would have asked for 
was if the financial models were updated?  And a new business case be 
20 
presented.  This memorandum is not a business case it is a 
memorandum.  It does not go through the same risk mitigation 
processes as the original business case had undergone.  Now clearly if 
we model the R54 billion into the business case or into the financial 
model you would not come up with a positive NPV.  Based on the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 59 of 154 
 
assumptions of the business case.  What they then did was they used 
different assumptions.  So we normally use what is called the weighted 
average cost of capital to do the – to do the nett present value 
calculation which is at the time was about 12.5%.  If you use a higher 
rate you will get a bigger number and they used a higher rate to get 
R11.68 billion but it is not comparable to what we used in the business 
case.  This was done to suit the outcome.  That is essentially my view 
on the matter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Perhaps Chair this fell under those 
10 
categories of confidential confinement or variation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Might be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And that Mr Volmink was complaining 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Then you proceed Mr Mahomedy to give 
us your overall assessment on the memorandum in much more details 
because we want to understand why you took issue with it?  
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the foreign exchange 
aspect of the increase in ETC which is included in this memorandum 
the large part of the increase in ETC is reference to foreign exchange 
fluctuations as well as escalations.  The first and very important 
consideration from our point of view is the point of localisation which I 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 60 of 154 
 
touched on earlier on.  That 55% and 60% of this contract was subject 
to localisation which would mean that there was no foreign exchange 
impact on that number.  Chair if we take the contract value in terms of 
what was signed.  I am not referencing the business case of R49.5 
billion and we remove an average of 55% which was for local content of 
approximately R27.2 billion we are left with R22 billion that is 
subjected to foreign exchange.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  What is also crucial is that 
at the outset and within a few months of signing the contract Transnet 
10 
paid significant deposits to the original equipment manufacturers on the 
assumption that those monies were sent off shore to the ir holding 
companies or their entities that were registered out of the country.  
That was made on the first day or within a few months of that.  It would 
also not be subject to foreign exchange because if we paid you the 
money today you would remit those f unds off shore and there is no 
foreign exchange implication.  Chair the deposits that we paid within a 
six month period of the signing of these agreements totalled 9 point – 
approximately – R9.6 billion. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In deposits – deposits only? 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In deposits or what we call 
advance payments. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So we had the 22.3 billion.  
We reduce it by a further 9.6 billion which leaves only R12 billion 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 61 of 154 
 
subject to foreign exchange movement.  We cannot then be saying that 
the bulk of the 14 billion movement is then foreign exchange and 
effectively 
Chair 
in 
the 
documents 
that 
have 
been 
provided 
approximately – I think it is – sorry my apologies Chair – R5.7 billion is 
attributed now to foreign exchange movement but the entire contract 
was not subject to foreign exchange movement and as I have pointed 
out in my calculation in my opinion we believe that between 25 percent 
and 32 percent of the contract value had a foreign exchan ge 
implication.  So to say that if it is between 12 and R15 billion that the 
foreign exchange movement was in the region of R5.7 billion does not 
10 
make sense in the context of what I have just pretended.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think that is the first issue 
and that is quite significant because 5.7 of the 16 billion was attributed 
to foreign exchange. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you continue to give me your assessment of – of 
this submission made to the Board at some stage I would  like you to 
deal with the question whether the kinds of errors or what may appear 
to be errors could possibly have been genuine errors.  Somebody 
making – overlooking something and making a mistake or whether you – 
20 
there are some where you say that somebo dy with this kind of 
qualifications and this kind of experience could not have made this kind 
of mistake.  So maybe there is something much more than just a 
genuine error in saying this or that in the – in the memorandum about 
what increased the – these costs.  Okay, you may proceed. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 62 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Thank you Chair.  Chair the 
other significant part of the increase in the ETCs as the documents that 
are in front of you suggests is R9 billion that talks to what is called the 
escalations.  Now the one thing that does not make sense is that we 
are not seeing any negative cost issues in the sense that costs have 
come down and the reason I say this Chair the initial business case 
was submitted for a six year delivery schedule and escalation would 
have been put in for each year.  If you now compress the timeline and 
you come down to three years you should have for the three years on 
the outside you should have a saving.  So to blanketly say that the 
10 
escalations had to happen does not make sense firstl y.  Secondly 
included in the business case were escalations and somehow those are 
being ignored …  
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In calculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the memorandum ought to have dealt with the 
question of what about the esc alation cost that were contemplated in 
the business case.  How do you factor that - them in, in order to arrive 
at the new escalation cost?  It should have dealt with among other 
things that one – that issue.  That is part of what you are saying?  
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes most clearly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And that is why Chair I 
alluded to earlier on to say that the business case should have been 
redone in its entirety.  Not supported by a simple memorandum but 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 63 of 154 
 
rather putting in all of the new assumptions into a business case and 
the financial model to determine how the 54 billion would come – how -
how it was arrived at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  At this point all we seeing is 
unsubstantiated – if I can call it that – numbers that are put onto a 
memorandum.  We have not seen this translate or we have not seen the 
financial model that translates into these numbers.  How it was derived 
at.  What number – what assumptions were made?  What were the 
changes?  What were the differences between the business case?  That 
10 
is not necessarily explained in – in the level of detail that it should be 
explained in.  Chair I think as I said – you know – there are three key 
categories.  The first is the foreign exchange which I have tried to 
explain.  The second is escalations.  The memorandum again ignores 
the fact that escalations were already included in the business case.  It 
just says that this is – I think – R9 billion from the date of the tender to 
the date of the award and going forward.  Yet we had escalations 
included in the business case – as I said earlier on – of five – 
approximately – 5.9 percent for South African PPI as well as 2.3 
percent for US inflation.  The third aspect is what is put he re under the 
20 
term contingencies.  In the original business case Chair we had R2.2 
billion for contingencies.  There is a further 4.9 billion been put in for 
contingencies in this memorandum.  The key issue from our perspective 
is that at that time in May  2014 these were fixed price contracts.  We 
had already established the fixed price perspective with all of the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 64 of 154 
 
hedging that was included.  All of the escalations were included.  Then 
one cannot understand why we would have such a high contingency in 
addition to all of the costs that have been put in.  The design was 
largely done.  They were still going through some of the final touches 
but a 10 percent contingency is deemed high when you have a fixed 
price contract.  So that is the third part of it in terms of not necessarily 
agreeing with the level of diligence and expertise that you referenced 
from the individuals who were signing this document to actually agree 
with the content of this document and I think these would have been the 
red flags that as manage ment we would have identified.  We sometimes 
10 
do not even allow 10 percent contingencies on projects that are in 
execution that have not even been finalised and in this case we were 
saying - we are saying here that the contracts have been established.  
All of the risks have been mitigated.  That is what the document says – 
the risks have been mitigated and yet on top of all of the mitigated 
risks there is an additional R4.9 billion that is put in for contingencies 
and one needs to question what the purpose o f the 4.9 billion would 
have been at a later stage.  Chair I think the …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There are various documents 
20 
that have been prepared that question the – the veracity of the 
increase in ETC and one of the m is the MNS Volume 1 Report that I 
believe we will serve at this Commission as well (intervenes)..  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Also investigating the same issue?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That investigated - amongst 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 65 of 154 
 
others … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  One of the issues is the 
increase in ETC that has gone through quite a significant review from 
MNS. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now let us deal with the question of – 
Chair I think it is quite important – that having regard to the fact that 
there was a cost (indistinct), the business case and there was this 
significant increment directly from either the end user to the Board 
itself without having to go – to go through other procurement structures 
10 
and the things that you are hig hlighting in paragraph 3.1 of your 
statement – could this have been just a genuine mistake that 
happened? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think I am going to 
try to address that together with the question that the Chair posed.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
In 
any 
business 
of 
Transnet’s size you have management structures.  You also have 
non-executive structures.  The reason you have that is so that the 
combined intellect of the grouping of people who sit together is far  
20 
better than the intellect of an individual sitting on a document.  Now 
within the document that is in front of us had this document served at a 
Committee firstly I would like to stress that no individual in my humble 
opinion has got the expertise across every facet of a business.  I think 
it is something that we can …  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 66 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We can agree on.  Therefore 
when you have a Committee that looks at some of the transactions they 
interrogate the document or the s ubmission based on their areas of 
expertise and you have the cross functional skill set that will sit in 
those Committees.  Those Committees have been designed to ensure 
that you bring the cross functional skill set to the organisation so that 
we all act in the best interest of the company.  This document by 
bypassing the management of the business and bypassing the 
structures that were put in place with the cross functional skill set that 
10 
existed at the time is clear that there was either an intent to bypa ss the 
process or genuinely there were – there was an error of judgment but I 
do not believe that you can say that there were genuine acceptable 
mistakes.  Again from the people with the experience and expertise but 
for me it is not about the area of exper tise who drafted this 
memorandum.  It is about the process because there is a process that 
works that will allow for any errors of judgment Chair that will be picked 
up.  In this case by bypassing all of those management structures you 
removed the opportunity for a cross functional team to identify if there 
were genuine errors for those to be identified and corrected but once 
20 
again I think it is also critical to reemphasise the point Chair that this 
was all done after the contracts were signed which is larg ely irrelevant 
in any conversation because I mean if there were errors what would the 
outcome have been or what would the recourse have been.  The 
contracts were already signed.  Transnet were already committed to 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 67 of 154 
 
R49 billion for the execution of these con tracts. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I hope I have answered the 
question. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, you definitely did.  Now may I refer 
you to page 10? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You reviewed a lot of transactions.  You  
found a lot of documents - went through them.  Would this have been or 
was this one of those put through that is the transaction under 
confidential …?  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Confinement? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No, no it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This was an open tender and 
all of the evaluation etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But there are question marks 
20 
over the evaluation process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
But 
this 
was 
not 
a 
confidential confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you come across any document that contained 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 68 of 154 
 
any explanation or justification why this memorandum was n ot 
subjected to management scrutiny in terms of the bodies that you have 
told me about? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair.  We have no seen 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not find anything?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Any document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That suggest this was 
discussed anywhere as to why it was going to not be presented to any 
10 
management structure, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  May I – may I then refer you to page 10 
of your witness statement and at paragraph 5.3 you deal with a new 
topic referring to the Transnet bias in favour of the CSR and before you 
deal with the contents of that topic briefly explain to the Chair as to 
who is CSR. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair CSR is China South 
Rail an entity that produced the 95 locomotives for Transnet.  
Subsequently they produced 100 locomotives and then were given 359 
20 
electric locomotives of the – of the 1 064. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am interrupting you but there is a 
question that is – that I want to ask and I am taking you back to what 
we were talking about in regard to that memorandum.  You have made it 
quite clear that if that memorandum had been presented to the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 69 of 154 
 
management 
bodies 
to 
which 
it 
should 
have 
been 
presented 
management would definitely have picked up certain problems in regard 
to the request for the approval.  Are you able to tell me what the 
difference was between management and the Board that may have 
resulted in a situation where the Board did not or could not pick up 
what management could or would have picked up?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something that you able to – to in term – 
normally of course management maybe dealing with a lot of things quite 
often.  Maybe much more  often than the Board.  The Board sits only 
10 
seven times but also you may have a Board that does not have certain 
expertise that is required for certain things that the management – 
which the management has.  Maybe they just have lawyers only - for 
argument sake – on the Board and there is no accountant and you – it 
is something where you need an accountant or somebody with some 
expertise.  Are you able – is that something you are able to talk about 
or is it something you would rather reflect on and deal wit h at some 
other stage? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think I will have to 
reflect on that as a result of the fact that we have had a number of 
20 
Boards … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  At Transnet and I just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Need to go back and confirm 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 70 of 154 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The composition of that 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And will come back on that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I interrupted you.  You were dealing with 
10 
… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  CSR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Still explaining to us what is CSR, yes.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as I said the China 
South Rail had got – the first one was the 95 locomotives to deliver - to 
manufacture and deliver 95 locomotives that were going to be used 
essentially on the manganese channel for Transnet.  This process 
commenced in 2011 and it was an open tender.  We will touch on some 
of the challenges of that tender later on but I am giving a view on 
20 
China South Rail.  Subsequently in around 2014 there was this 
confinement to China South Rail to produce 100 locomotives and then 
through the 1 064 program they got – of the 1 064 they received the 
lion share of the electric locomotives and they had to manufacture or 
their contract for manufacture was 359 locomotives.  So I think that is 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 71 of 154 
 
essentially China South Rail but after the conclusion of the 1  064 
program with the 359 in around 2016 there was also a maintenance 
agreement that was – I would not say concluded – but I think there was 
– there was a letter of intent that was issued to China South Rail to 
maintain all of those locomotives that they will  ultimately have 
produced for Transnet.  It was a 12 year agreement that was in the 
region of - a total of – R6.18 billion.  So these were quite significant 
transactions for an entity and I think that is largely the overview …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Of China South Rail at 
10 
Transnet. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and then at paragraph 5.3.1 you now 
commence telling us about why after having reviewed everything you 
come to the conclusion that there was biasness in favour of  CSR. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair under the heading of 
MSM12 we have included the RFP – the request for pricing - that went 
out for the 95 locomotives and the 95 locomotives the issue date was 
6 December 2011 and the closing date was 28  February 2012.  This is 
quite an important date in the process that ensues.  What we have 
identified 
- 
in 
our 
submission 
as 
well 
under 
MSM11 
– 
are 
20 
communications between an executive at CSR – Mr Wang An – writing 
to … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is page 202 Chair. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Page 203. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 72 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mr Wang An writes through 
to Mr Garry Pita who is the then Chief – sorry – he is then Chief Supply 
Chain Officer of Transnet.  Mr  Pita was the Supply Chain Officer at that 
time.  It is also going to come up later where he was the CFO later on 
but at that time he was the Group Supply Chain Officer and it follows 
an email trail that says that – and I will read out … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
If 
it 
pleases 
the 
Commission. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It says: 
“Dear Mr Pita, thank you for your email.  We were 
very pleased to have a chance to meet with your 
Group CEO – Mr Brian Molefe – at the beginning of 
December.  We expressed our interest in your 
tender for the 95 electric locomotives and the South 
African market as well.  Regarding the tender 
document we are contacting Mr …”  
That is an error because it is Ms.  
“…Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe and transferring the money 
20 
to your account for getting the document.  Due to 
only South African Rand being acceptable the 
money 
transferring 
process 
is 
a 
little 
bit 
complicated but we believe we could get the tender 
document within this week.  You are very kind to 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 73 of 154 
 
facilitate us your support on the tender document if 
we need an inform you.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The challenge … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  This – this communication 
references a meeting that took place between Mr  Molefe and the people 
from the CSR and at this time it was even before the procurement of 
the locomotives was done.  Am I correct?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  So there if you look at 
the bottom part of the email Mr  Pita writes to Mr Wang An and he says: 
10 
“My CEO – Mr Molefe – advised me that you met 
earlier.” 
He confirms the meeting.  He also stated that:  
“CSR 
Electric 
Locomotive 
showed 
interest 
in 
participating in our next tender.”  
What is interesting is that tender was already in play.  On 6  December 
that tender was already opened.  The issued date is 6  December.  
These 
notes 
are 
being 
exchanged 
between 
16  December 
and 
19 December.  In terms of governance and in terms of process within 
Transnet no executive is allowed to engage with a bidder in a – what is 
20 
called a closed tender period and the Group Supply Chain Officer here 
is now engaging with a bidder informing him that there is a bid out 
there or there is a – there is an RFP out in the market whereas this 
RFP was an international RFP.  So bidders from  across the world if they 
had an interest would have at that time commenced their preparation 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 74 of 154 
 
for the bid documents. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You conclude saying with 
paragraph 5.3.2.  Please take us through the contents of that 
paragraph. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  What we are saying is that if 
– which is a big if because it is not allowed in terms of tender 
processes – but if Mr Molefe and Mr Pita were wanting to engage with 
bidders then all bidders should have been afforded that equal 
opportunity.  We are not sure what the conversations were in those 
meetings and we are not sure what the discussions were.  However it is 
10 
certain that there seems to be preferential treatment given to one 
bidder over the other where a particular bidder – bidder is told I am not 
sure whether CSR is aware of this RFP.  We do not ordinarily pick up 
the phone in an RFP process and say to people there is an RFP.  You 
need to please respond.  That is their responsibility as a business in – 
in the global space.  So there – there seems to be a special 
relationship that CSR enjoyed in the context of the procurement 
process because there definitely was untoward discussions - and when 
I say untoward meaning unprocedural discussions in a closed tender 
period - but in addition Chair I think within good governance principles 
20 
it is also not expected that an entity particularly their Group Supply 
Chain Officer and Chief Executive engage with one party in an RFP 
process.  So it is not just the procedures within Transnet but I think as  
executives in a business we would not expect that conversations are 
happening behind the scenes when a tender is live.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 75 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now could you address the new 
topic on page 10 from paragraph 5.3.3?  You are dealing with the 
changing of the evaluation criteria in relation to the 95 locomotives 
transaction. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair if I may refer the 
Commission to page 218 under the Annex MSM12 – page 218 
paragraph 6.2.  This is the RFP Chair that was issued to the market 
and this would have been a standard RFP that would have gone to all 
market participants at the time.  What it details is the BBBE rating 
requirements.  I do not intend reading all of it but I think what it does 
10 
say midway through that page: 
“The respondents will be required to furnish proof 
of the above to Transnet SOC Limited.  That is a 
detailed scorecard as stipulated above in respect of 
large enterprise and QSEs or proof of turnover in 
respect of EMEs.  NB – note well – failure to do so 
will result in a sc ore of zero being allocated for 
BEE.” 
This becomes quite relevant as I proceed Chair.  That is the – the 
requirement in the RFP.  What we then have under Annexure 13 – 
20 
MSM13 page 268 - is a memorandum which is – which is addressed 
from the Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail at the time - 
Mr Siyabonga Gama – to the Group Chief Executive – Mr Brian Molefe.  
The purpose of this memorandum it says:  
“Is to provide an update to the Transnet Group 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 76 of 154 
 
Chief Executive on the progress on the tender 
evaluation as indicated in the memorandum to the 
GCE dated 20 April 2012.  It is also to request for 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Executive 
to 
approve 
the 
shortlisting of the tenderers that have met the SD 
threshold of 60 percent and to approve the issuing 
of letters to unsuccessful tenders that did not meet 
the SD threshold for stage 1 of the evaluation 
process.” 
The reason this becomes quite critical is because we – in the document 
10 
– in the RFP we said that if a bidder does not submit the BBBE 
certificates they are scored zero.  Cha ir later in the document you will 
find under paragraph 7 of that document Chair on page 269 …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Before you go to that paragraph can you 
take us through paragraph 4 on page 269?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair paragraph four says: 
“BBBEE rating certificates in respect of JV partners and sub -
contractors as well as the distribution of the BBBEE status 
were to be furnished with the tenderer submissions to enable a 
fair evaluation of all submissions received.  Incorporated JV’s 
20 
also had to provide a consolidated BBBEE certificate for legal 
entity, un-incorporated JV’s were required to submit BBBEE 
certificates of all of the consortium partners.  As such any 
foreign – the foreign companies would not have provided a 
BBBEE certificate and therefore would not score any BBBEE 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 77 of 154 
 
points.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    So this was part of the requirement?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes you wanted to take the Chair to a 
different... 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     To paragraph seven. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Paragraph seven says that 
in light of the above and it explains a few things about the BBBEE as 
SD, the cross-function evaluation team what is called the CFET 
10 
proposed two options for stage one.  Option one, as part of stage one 
of the SD evaluation and as per the RFP – it’s important Chair because 
it says as per the RFP, and the BADC submission which was the Board 
Acquisitions and Disposals Counsel Committee submission,  the SD 
evaluation includes BBBEE and FRC.  The effect of this is that foreign 
tenderers that do not have local representation are prejudiced and will 
receive zero on BBBEE.  This option does not support the BBBEE code 
of good practice which allows for suc h foreign companies, if registered 
locally to start up enterprises etcetera and then what it says is, based 
on option one, the following three tenderers met the minimum threshold 
20 
of 60%.  Chair this is relating to the 95 locomotives so this assessment 
is based on what the RFP said.  Based on the RFP assessment three 
bidders qualified, Siemens, Bombardier, SSMM Consortium.  Then 
there’s an option two which is presented below which essentially says, 
we will do everything except for this in the RFP we’ll ignor e this and 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 78 of 154 
 
then now there are five bidders that qualify and the bidders are, 
Siemens, Bombardier, Malcom CSR, there’s a company called Malasko 
Trading 85 and SSMM and on the following page, Chair, what is now 
submitted for approval to the GCE at the time i t says on the last bullet 
under paragraph nine it says, “It is recommended that the GCE 
approves the issuing of letters to answer successful tenderers due to 
their bids not meeting the minimum SD evaluation threshold for stage 
one which is based on option two”, which was not in agreement with the 
RFP by the way. 
 
So that process was not within the realms of the GCE’s 
10 
mandate and the reason I say that is because they are explicit in the 
document that says that the BADC approved the terms of the RFP.  The 
BADC would be the only committee that can change that.  This kind of 
change could be prejudicial to another bidder because had the bidders 
known that you were not going to look at this, you were going to ignore 
it, even though you said in your RFP that you wi ll be scored zero, had 
other bidders they may not have – I mean you may have had a number 
of other bidders on the table because they would have known that this 
particular piece was not relevant.  So we issue it out as being 
mandatory and then we ignore it and then a point – or bring CSR into 
20 
the mix of bidders and that’s why we’re saying that it’s under a bias 
where CSR truthfully, if you look at this, and if it was evaluated in 
terms of the RFP, they would not have qualified in the first phase – the 
first stage and they would have been excluded but yet they were able to 
go through stage two Chair. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 79 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ordinarily if you had issued a request for proposals 
and you had said these will be the criteria against which bids will be 
evaluated and subsequent to the issuing of that request you change 
your mind about some of the criteria, one or more, does the Transnet 
Procurement regime say what should happen, namely whether you 
should re-issue or you should issue an amended request for proposals 
or whether it does allow that, without amending the requests for 
proposals and letting everybody know of the amendment whether it 
does allow that you can change things provided, maybe, certain 
requirements are met? 
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair I think the first thing 
that happens is an assessment of that change of criteria to determine 
whether it is a fundamental change, we have to look at the – obviously 
also the impact on other codes within the PPPFA the Transnet 
procurement processes as well as the PFMA.  If the change is not 
deemed significant change then we would ordinarily inform or we have 
the right to inform all of the bidders to say this is a change that has 
been effected and will it change anything in your submission but a 
change of this nature where you had it as a mandatory and you said 
that it’s a – in terms of first we said, what we submitted, we said, 
20 
failure to do so will result in zero and now we’re ignoring that we would 
have had to have gone back to the Board Acquisition Disposals 
Committee to ask for guidance.  There’s a number of ways you can deal 
with this, the first is you can actually call this a non -award and say that 
we are now changing – fundamentally changing some of the criteria and 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 80 of 154 
 
re-issue to the market. Ordinarily if it was not d eemed to be a 
significant deviation it would have at least have required us to inform 
all of the participants that initially had indicated an interest because 
this particular one went through compulsory briefing and there was a 
whole host of processes that we followed at the time and we should 
have at least disclosed it at some of those briefings but clearly, again 
it’s three signatures on a document.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Now if I may refer you to page 270 and 
identify for the Chair as to who signs the document?  
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair this document is 
signed by the Chief Procurement Officer of Transnet Freight Rail at that 
time Mr Thamsanqa Jiyane, the Chief Executive of Transnet Freight 
Rail at that time Mr Siyabonga Gama and the Group Chief Executive of 
Transnet SOC Limited, Mr Brian Molefe at that time.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes in the light of what you’ve told the 
Chair about the changing of the criteria or the mandatory requirements 
of the tender itself, would this have been a genuine mistake of people 
not understanding the RFP or not really understanding what were the 
requirements of the tender?  
20 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair in signing this as the 
Chief Procurement Officer one would expe ct that the Procurement 
Officer is au fait with these rules as they are the rules of the game of 
procurement. So I wouldn’t – you know I would expect that the Chief 
Procurement Officer of an entity like Transnet Freight Rail know that 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 81 of 154 
 
this was a deviation and that the deviation had to have been approved 
by the committee that originally approved the transaction and also one 
more thing, I think it’s also important to note that this is a 
contravention of the PFMA as well in terms of the processes of the 
PFMA that’s applicable to Transnet. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Yes, may I now refer you to page 11 of 
your statement and let’s now interrogate the issues under the heading, 
“payment of an unusual high advance payment”, can you please 
proceed highlighting those issues from paragraph 5.3.5?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair Transnet had 
10 
executed a few transactions with locomotive OEM’s before the 1064.  
Some of them date back in the last ten or twelve years but nonetheless 
relevant with Mitsui and there were o ther contracts with General 
Electric, when I reference other, meaning outside of the 1064. In the 
contracts with General Electric the negotiations yielded that we pay a 
deposit or an upfront fee of 10% of the contract.  These are largely 
related to costs that the OEM will incur before the first locomotive is 
delivered or before the delivery of any locomotives take place, the OEM 
has to spend money in setting up costs, in, you know, the plants that 
they have to build etcetera, so there’s quite a significant amount but 
20 
the practice was 10%.  In some cases it would have gone up to, maybe 
even 15% but that was about the ceiling that we were paying.  On the 
95 locomotives which we entered into in 2012 with China South Rail 
that we just discussed earlier on, we pa id a 10% deposit to China South 
Rail or an upfront fee of 10% Chair.   
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 82 of 154 
 
 
During the post-tender negotiations of 1064 there was a lot of 
rumblings in the corridors of Transnet that the negotiation team was 
contemplating a much more significant advance paymen t to some of the 
OEM’s.  Chair I – during that time personally called Mr Anoj Singh, 
asked him for an appointment because the team that was negotiating 
the 1064 was based at the Webber Wentzel offices and not at Transnet 
and scheduled a meeting with him to  enquire of him if it was true that 
the team is contemplating a higher deposit payment.  He did not deny 
that, he did, to some extent say that they were thinking about it and 
what was my concern and I said well there were two things, the first is 
10 
that this is out of kilter with all of the negotiations that we’ve 
undertaken to date and the second thing is that this -  if it was higher 
than 10% it was not necessarily budgeted for in our cash flows and 
thereby it would impact significantly some of the key rati os of Transnet, 
the financial ratios.  Particularly the cash that was going to leave the 
business and it would impact our – what is called a cash interest cover.  
A cover that is, or a ratio that is a focus of a number of institutions 
globally and locally including financial institutions but also credit rating 
agencies. 
 
In having that discussion with him, he acknowledged my 
20 
discomfort and he advised that he would consider my discomfort and he 
would consider what they would look at and that is when that 
conversation ended.  Despite the concerns we raised we then heard 
that they negotiated with China South Rail to pay a deposit on the 
signing – on the date of signing of 10% and within six months to pay a 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 83 of 154 
 
further 20% to China South Rail.  Chair the quantum of these 
percentages equates to the following.  The China South Rail contract is 
18billion rand, a 30% effective deposit within six months equates to just 
over 5.4billion rand. Now to pay 5.4billion rand upfront when no single 
locomotive has been delivered and your first locomotive is months or 
maybe even a year away does not – is not warranted in my humble 
opinion.  We will see that with other locomotive suppliers that it was 
not anywhere near that, so we cannot understand the disparity in the 
payment in advanced payments, if it was consistent, like 10% because 
General Electric were paid 10%, Bombardier were paid a 9% deposit 
10 
and then a further 9% within six months so that’s 18%, China South 
Rail were paid about 15%, so there’s clearly a disparity when China 
South Rail receives a 30% deposit in a six month period.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Was there any explanation preferred as 
to why were they paid such a huge advance payment?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     I’m not aware of that, we did 
request that, we were never provided that because we requested to 
understand the technicality behind that, I do believe there’s a technical 
paper that may have been written but then again one is the technicality 
but more importantly from our perspective is to look at the dis parity in 
20 
treatment – treating one OEM so significantly differently to the other 
OEM. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And in terms of the 359 locomotives?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   That was for the 359 where 
we paid a 10% and 20% and on the hundred...(inte rvention).   
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 84 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes on the hundred. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     I also believe that we paid a 
30% deposit on the hundred locomotives as well.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Equating to how much in rands?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That was equating to 
approximately just over 1.2billion rand.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Even before delivery of any 
locomotives? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That’s right. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, may we then deal with your next 
10 
topic from paragraph 5.3.9 Chair, it’s on page 11, the payment of the 
interest penalties to CSR and you refer to the period of June 2015.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair the penalties and 
interest that we reference here actually relate to the late payment of  
the deposit.  So as I mentioned 10% was paid on the signing and a 
further 20% was due within six months or on the sixth month, I think it 
was September 2014.  The 20% Chair amounts to just over 3.6billion 
rand, then in September 2014 when the payment was due there was 
some arrangements between Transnet and CSR for the slight delay in 
the payment, subsequently there seems to have been correspondence 
20 
between Transnet and China South Rail to say, well, we don’t have the 
cash Transnet and we will now request from you for a deferment in the 
payment or a deferral in the payment to 2015.  Obviously the 
locomotive supply agreement then would kick in because these 
penalties now would attract interest.  What is not necessarily making 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 85 of 154 
 
sense from our perspective Chair, is that Transnet at the time, had 
significant credit facilities available that we could have utilised and the 
interest rate on those facilities was averaging between 6.4% and 7%.  
Whereas the Locomotive Supply Agreement called for interest to be 
paid at prime rates, the prime at the time was in the region of 9.25%.  
Now we then continued in June 2015 to pay China South Rail an 
amount of 229million for interest and an amount including VAT of 
68million rand for what came across as further hedging costs.  I w ill 
deal with each one of these Chair if it is okay as it – each one of them 
has a different nuisance.  The interest amounting to 229million as I 
10 
said, we could have utilised our facilities internally at Transnet with 
banks that we already had relationships and we could have paid an 
interest rate of between 6.4 and 7% which was significantly lower – 
would  have been significantly lower than the 229million, it could have 
been lower by approximately 80million which would have saved 
Transnet money but be that as it may.  Chair what is also quite 
interesting is that on the 1 s t of June 2015 there’s an email from the 
Group Treasurer at Transnet, Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi who writes to Mr 
Wang Pan of China South Rail on the 1 s t of June and he says, please 
receive the attached and he copies Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Danie Smit in 
20 
this mail and...(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Mr Chair, may I refer you to page 272 
and that is MSM14.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That is correct advocate. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, while the Chair is finding his way 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 86 of 154 
 
to that document, if you go to page 272 and identify that document for 
us. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair this is an email from 
Mr Ramosebudi of Transnet on Monday the 1 s t of June 2015 at 11h21 to 
China South Rail, Mr Wang Pan. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes and what does he attach to his 
email if you go to page 273?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair on page 273 is a 
spreadsheet and excel spreadsheet that was attached to this mail which 
goes on to do the calculations of the interest that should be billed to 
10 
Transnet.  Essentially this is odd because, why would I as Transnet 
write to a supplier and say this is the interest you need to bill me, that 
is the role and responsibility of the supplier to bill me i nterest if he 
deems it necessary.  So we precipitate an action, we do the calculation, 
we actually go ahead and send the calculation to the supplier and say 
this 
is 
what 
you 
need 
to 
bill 
me 
and 
obviously 
a 
day 
later...(intervention).    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Go to page 274 and identify that 
document for us in your sequence of evidence.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     This is Mr Wang Pan 
20 
otherwise known as Elton at CSR, essentially writes back to us on the 
3 r d of June at nine minutes past midnight, he writes to Mr Anoj Singh 
and copies Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi and a few other people and he 
says, please find attached the invoices and the latest statement as you 
requested and attaches an invoice for 229million Chair and a second 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 87 of 154 
 
invoice that is attached Chair under the number of 278...(intervention).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Let’s start with the one on 275 and 
onwards are those the invoices?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes Chair these are invoices 
275 is the invoice for the deposit amount.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now I need to understand your evidence, 
you say that, I mean, Mr Ramosebudi was an employee of Transnet at 
the time.   
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     He was Transnet’s Group 
10 
Treasurer. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    He computes an interest on behalf of 
the service provider. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes that is essentially what 
was done. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    He then request for an invoice that 
would be paid by Transnet pursuant to his computation?  
MR MOHAMED SUL EMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And this is done, according to your 
evidence, at the instance where there was a facility available for 
20 
Transnet? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   As far as we have reviewed 
there was a facility available that Transnet could have paid this money 
on the due date and circumvented a significant interest bill to a third 
party, it  would have been our interest.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 88 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And what is your comment around this 
– these facts that you’ve alluded to the Chair? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair if we look at the 
position of the individual being the Group Treasurer the one challenge 
that we have is I’m not sure why this payment was not made on time.  
Mr Ramosebudi only joined Transnet in March 20 15 by the way, on the 
1 s t of March 2015, there was a previous treasurer who resigned her 
position but one of the first things we would do is look at the payment, 
regardless of what the amount is and look at whether we have funds 
available.  The first place  we would look at is into our bank account 
10 
whether we had that kind of money available, it’s unlikely that we would 
sit with cash balances of that amount but Transnet is a entity that is 
quite significant in terms of our capability and our requirements for  
funding. So we have different credit lines that are available with 
institutions locally and globally and at the time when we’re talking 
about the due date in 2014 we still hadn’t seen the increases in interest 
rates coming through for the cost of money to  entities like Transnet it 
would have been much cheaper to borrow the money, as I said we had 
facilities that would have cost us 6.4 or up to 7% yet we at that time 
made a decision that we’re not paying it, it doesn’t make sense from a 
20 
finance perspective.  Why would you want to pay somebody 9.25% 
interest, you’d do that calculation right up front and make a decision 
whether I’ll pay them using the agreement and defer the payment and 
pay this 9.25 or look at whether I have cash or facilities available at 
the time. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 89 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry I want to take you back – I’m just not sure 
whether I heard the figure that you mentioned correctly when you were 
looking at invoices starting from page 272 and then you went to the 
invoices, did you mention the figure of 275 because I’ve been trying to 
look for 275 but I may have...(intervention).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   That is a page number, I think Chair, it 
may be reference to the page number.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Page number where the invoice 
appears.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay but the interest itself was how much?    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     229million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where do I find that?    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   That would be on page 276 
Chair.     
CHAIRPERSON:    Well on page 276 I’ve got – the figures I’ve got 
there is 229, 229, 229 oh but there are two numbers at the top there is 
MSM276 and then there’s 261, which number is the correct number?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    The 276 Chair – 261 should – would be 
obviously the number from the original affidavit itself.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    But the paginated we are concentrating 
on the MSM276. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes so where is the figure you’re talking about on 
that page? 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 90 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair it shows there invoice 
total 229 367 461.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay 229 at the beginning. 
MR 
MOHAMED 
SULEMAN 
MAHOMEDY: 
Yes 
so 
it’s 
actually 
229million...(intervention).    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I must have been hearing something yo u didn’t 
say.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    My apologies.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay thank you, okay alright, thank you.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Chair, I’m now, reliably told that it’s 
10 
one o’clock the time for the lunch adjournment.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay we will take the lunch adjournment it’s one 
o’clock we will resume at two o’clock, we adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you must – you may proceed Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Thank you.  Mr Mahomedy just before 
the lunch adjournment you were still taking us through the payment of 
interest and penalties.  Just give us a high level summary on that topic 
and please also you know reference it with page 275 so that at least we 
20 
are able to appreciate the essence of your testi mony around the 
interest issue. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Thank you Advocate.  Chair I 
think the first point that needs to be made is that there was a total of 
R29 million that was paid to China South Rail as a result of a delayed 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 91 of 154 
 
payment.  This is made of two components.  The first part is a R229 
million interest and the second part is what is called a foreign 
exchange adjustment.  Relating to the first part as I said it is of interest 
that the Group Treasurer at the time sent an email to China South Rail 
giving them the computation of the interest.  And secondly he also 
provide them – provided them with the computation of the foreign 
exchange adjustment.  It is not common practice for us to provide a 
service provider or a supplier with the calculation  of these amounts.  
Chair what is also quite interesting is the fact that the contract with 
China South Rail was a rand based contract.  And all of the forex was 
10 
mitigated and hedged in the rand based contract.  So one if from a 
finance point of view we ar e confused if I can use that term as to why 
we would pay a foreign exchange adjustment to a rand based contract 
which had no reference to forex in that contract.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the significance of the term rand based contract 
that the creditor takes th e risks of the rand fluctuation without being 
able to say but look we should take into account for example the US 
dollar rate, is that what the significance is of that term?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The creditor assumed all of 
the risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And that was factored into 
the pricing. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 92 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As it was entered into 
between Transnet and the OEM’s at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if – if the parties are negotiating a contract and 
the party that will be paid and – some amounts does not want the 
agreement to be rand based then they put forward the proposal that for 
example the amounts must be US dollar bas ed.  Is that right?  And if 
they do not put that; that means they accept that the transaction will be 
rand based? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And… 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  If the risk is – my apologies.  
If the risk is assumed by Transnet then it would be Transnet’s 
responsibility to take all of the forex hedging.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In this case it was agreed 
between the two parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHO MEDY:  That all of the risk  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And the hedging would be 
for the suppliers account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And it was factored into the 
pricing. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 93 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And of course I a ssume that if it is rand based 
depending on what happens you know in the markets you could be 
lucky in that it could go up or go down, the rand could go up or go 
down and so that is – if it goes your way then you might benefit if it 
does not then it is jus t a risk that you accept it.?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And that is why it is odd on 
this particular penalty that we actually paid an amount of R 59.8 million 
10 
as referenced in MSM27.8 to China South Rail for what was marked as 
the cost of rolling forward an FEC because of the delay in the payment.  
But what is also significant Chair is that this is a financial services 
transaction.  In addition to the fact that we believe there is a – it was 
rand based and we should not have been levied this penalty in addition 
to that we were also levied VAT on this transaction which is not in 
terms of the VAT Act.  So we paid a total of R68 million that relates to 
what is called the foreign exchange forward rolling of the FEC.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And anyone within Transnet dealing with this contract 
would have known or at least checked the terms of the contract first 
20 
before putting Transnet at such financial risk as agree ing to these 
types of costs.  One would have thought that they would go through 
first and see whether it is a rand based contract or not?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair I think in addition 
it would have also required that it be more than just a f inance 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 94 of 154 
 
transaction that you would have had the legal teams look at it, the 
operation teams look at it before we agree to a significant payment of 
this nature of R297 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Especially when you are talking about very big 
amounts. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now against that background and clarity 
Mr Mahomedy turn to page 276 so that we can move on and explain to 
the Chair what was the – what is this document and its purpose and 
10 
what is the amount in the light of what you have now clarified to the 
Chair? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair document number 276 
is essentially the invoice that we received as you would note it is dated 
the 2 June 2015. As I presented Mr Ramosebudi submitted  this 
calculation to China South Rail on the 1 June so literally one day later 
they take the amount that was on the spreadsheet of R229  367 461,00 
and included onto an invoice and submitted to Transnet for payment 
and this was effectively paid.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And if you turn to page 278. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before you do that.  The general treasurer 
I think you said his position was – was it – she – a she who gave China 
South Rail these calculations?  Would he or she have been involved in 
the authorisation of the payment later on when the invoice came or 
would he or she not have been involved in that?  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 95 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the group… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Ramosebudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that something coming up?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Mr Ramosebudi was the 
Group Treasurer at the time and he provided the information but he did 
not make the physical payment.  No he did not authorise the physical 
payment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now I was referring you to the second 
document in order to tie up your evidence.  At the document is at page 
10 
278 and identify that for the Chair and also comment on its contents?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair page 278 references 
an invoice again from China South Rail to Transnet for the amount of 
R59.8 million with the description being the cost of rolling the forward 
exchange contract.  And then VAT being levied on that for an amount of 
R8.3 million showing an invoice total of R68.2 million w hich was 
subsequently paid to China South Rail.  Once again Chair the amount 
of R59 855 million is the exact amount that is reflected in the 
spreadsheet that was sent to China South Rail by Mr Ramosebudi at 
the time. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now we can then move on Mr 
Mahomedy and deal with the advance payment from page 5 – paragraph 
5.3.10 of your statement on page 12 Mr Chair.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chair subsequent to the 
conclusion of what we call the locomotive supply agreement which was 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 96 of 154 
 
for the 1064 locomotives to the various OEM’s.  Transnet then using the 
1064 contract and alluded to the procurement process being followed 
through that contract commenced with a process with China South Rail 
for a maintenance agreement.  And this maintena nce agreement was 
not limited to the 359 locos that were to be built in the 1064 but rather 
it was to include other locomotives that China South Rail were building 
or had built that was including the 95 and the 100.  Once again Chair a 
recommendation by the board of directors a submission was made 
directly to the board of directors at which point the board of directors 
recommended that Transnet engage the Minister of Public Enterprises 
10 
for approval of this particular transaction.  At that time the transacti on 
was valued approximately R6.1 billion.  The submission was made to 
the board of directors in July 2016 and subsequently recommended the 
application was made to the Minister and approved by the then Minister 
of Public Enterprises Ms Lynne Brown.  What is  also interesting in this 
submission is that China South Rail requested what they called or 
termed start-up costs totalling 10% of the value of the contract which 
means it equates to R618 million plus VAT.  In October 2016 this 
particular payment was effec ted and China South Rail was paid a total 
that was in the region of approximately R700 million which included 
20 
VAT.  Chair in October 2017 again I think the timelines are quite 
important the approval or the recommendation from the board in around 
July 2016.  There is approval from the Minister and there is a payment 
that is effected in October 2016.  A year later in October 2017 there is 
a document where the Group Chief Executive informs China South Rail 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 97 of 154 
 
that as a result of the number of allegations of corru ption this award 
will essentially be suspended.  This is in October 2017.  That document 
I believe is in the pack under MSM16 I think it is.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But we will look at that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  MSM16 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Which will be now on the second bundle 
I think.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Now that is on BB3  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  2B.  2B. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair my apologies I think 
the letter I refer to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  My apologies Advocate is 
MSM15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  15? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  15 page 340 or it is 
MSM340. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is the last  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Document on that lever arch file.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in this letter to the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 98 of 154 
 
Chairman of CRRC which was the holding entity for China South Rail it 
says: 
“Materials and reliability support contract.”  
Page 340. 
“Transnet amongst other things we refer to previous 
correspondence and the signing of their [indistinct] 
contract Transnet is a state owned entity and has to 
conduct its business, incur expenses and procure 
materials and services in compliance with but not 
limited to the constitution of the Republic of South 
10 
Africa and the Public Finance Management Act.  We 
had reached finality on the negotiation of the MRS 
contract and we are ready to sign.  However due to 
the corruption allegations that surfaced through the 
media on the 1064 procurement we had to negotiate 
the newly proposed representations and warranties 
clauses.  Further to the above Transnet SOC has 
commissioned 
a 
forensic 
investigation 
on 
the 
allegation of corruption relating to the procurement 
of the 1064 locomotives to ascertain the parties’ 
20 
involvement or non-involvement on the alleged 
corruption process.  The forensic investigation 
commissioned has not yet been finalised.”  
The last line there says: 
“Ultimately Transnet SOC would prefer to resign the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 99 of 154 
 
complete 
MRS 
contract 
with 
the 
proposed 
representations, warranties, clauses as opposed to 
signing the addendum.   Transnet will only be in a 
position to issue a letter of effectiveness to CRRC 
subsequent to the complete MRS contract being 
signed by both parties.  As far as we are aware that 
process was never concluded.”  
The issue is that Chair that letter was issued in October 2017 actually 
the 26 October 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But no effort was made in 
recovering our R700 million that was lodged with China South Rail from 
October 2016.  That process only commenced in July 2018 Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So the – the process was suspended and nothing 
happened for a number of months for about eight months/nine months?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And our funds remained with 
China South Rail in that period.   Chair…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And what was the purpose of the money 
20 
– before you proceed why was it – why were they paid such an 
advanced I mean such a huge sum of advanced payment?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  What is essentially stated in 
the contract I think we have all – or in the submission from China Sout h 
Rail. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 100 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Is what is the – what they 
have termed start-up costs.  To actually commence with producing 
some of these strategic spares locally in South Africa creating the 
capacity here.  As far as we are aware July 2018 when we commenced 
the process to recall these funds they had not yet commenced with that 
– with any of those processes of start-up.  They contend differently but 
that is our contention as Transnet.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes then proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of the letter that we just dealt with now 
10 
they would not have been expected to do anything until the issue of 
allegations of corruption had been – had reached finality? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair yes Chair there were 
two provisos.  One was exactly as you point out and the second was 
the signing of the MRS agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Which as far as we are 
aware had not taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And what happened to the funds 
20 
ultimately? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In July 2018 there was a 
process that commenced through Transnet Engineering to recover these 
monies from China South Rail.  We did have what is called an advance 
payment guarantee in place.  A guarantee that was provided to us by 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 101 of 154 
 
China South Rail at the time.  And unconditional guarantee that was 
provided by the Bank of China to Transnet for the amount of 
R618million.  It was the amount excluding the VAT for some reason and 
we then proceeded to inform the Bank of China as well as China South 
Rail that we were going to recall the guarantees essentially.  All of the 
processes related to that commenced in about September the latter part 
of September 2018 and we reached finality in t he first week of 
December 2018 when China South Rail repaid us the R618 million.  To 
date China South Rail have not yet paid us the VAT portion which is the 
R86 million equivalent for that transaction.  That remains outstanding 
10 
we have had numerous interve ntions with China South Rail requesting 
these funds to be paid to us.  Unfortunately to date we – it still remains 
outstanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What reason do they advance for not paying it?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair at this point we do not 
get a response or we do not get a reason for non -payment.  We had a 
commitment – the Chairman of the board of directors as well as myself 
met with an executive from China South Rail at the beginning of this 
year.  We had received some indication that they would be remitting 
these funds but unfortunately to date we have yet to receive the funds.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that one of the matters in respect of which there is 
either pending litigation or there is litigation contemplated or you are 
not sure about that? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No we are not sure about – I 
do not think on the 86 we have issued any litigation but what we have 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 102 of 154 
 
done is we have written to them and provided and requested payment 
so that will follow due process within our business Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may be one of the matters in respect of which 
the Chairperson of the Transnet board indicated that there was a 
preference to try an reach an amicable settlement.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because litigation can someti mes take too long and in 
the meantime you might not end up getting what you want so yes okay.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Mr Mahomedy maybe to complete on this 
issue and for completeness may I refer you to Exhibit BB3B that is now 
10 
the second file and go to MSM18, 18.  May you please identify that 
document and take us through that document?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this is a letter that is 
written by Transnet to…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry that is what divider?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  351. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  18 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  18 
CHAIRPERSON:  18 okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  18. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  On page 351 is a letter from 
Transnet to the General Manager at CRRC demand for payment of an 
amount of VAT and interest relating to the maintenance and reliability 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 103 of 154 
 
support agreement between Transnet and CRRC E-Loco PTY Limited.  
Essentially we raised the issue in paragraph 2 where we say:  
“In terms of the provision of the letter of award in 
advance payment in the amount of R704.7 million 
was made in favour of CRRC and such amount was 
made up of R618 million and VAT at 14% in the 
amount of R86 million.  CRRC was required to utilise 
the money as start-up costs and also to procure 
[indistinct].  As a result of non-performance on the 
part of CRRC Transnet Engineering TE proceeded to 
10 
claim a refund of the total amount paid to CRRC.  
However 
CRRC 
refunded 
only 
the 
amount 
of 
R618,160 million and held back the VAT amount of 
R86.502 million.  TE Transnet Engineering is entitled 
to be refunded the VAT amount and interests 
amounting to R136.4 million.  TE therefore demands 
a payment in total of R223 million to be paid into the 
following bank account.  We will appreciate if the 
above payment the banking details are provided and 
we will appreciate if the above payment is made into 
20 
the above account by no later than 7 days upon 
receipt of this letter failing which TE will be left with 
no option.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Is the letter that now ties in with 
your evidence that you adduce before the Chair pertaining to the VAT 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 104 of 154 
 
component that was still outstanding and not yet been paid?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now can you turn to your 
statement with particular reference to page 13, 13 Exhibit BB3A?  The 
first file Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what page on that one – are we back to the 
statement? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  13. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  13. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  From – are you there Mr Mahomedy?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes and please take us through your new 
topic highlighted at the unlawful appointment of Regiments and 
subsequent increase in its scope and budget.  Take us through the 
relevant facts under the topic?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Okay.  Chair in May 2012 
Transnet issued a RFP to the market for service providers to provide 
transaction advisory services as it related to the  procurement of the 
20 
1064 locomotives.  At the tender closing date there were a few 
consortiums that actually bid or provided bids and proposals in 
response to that RFP.  We list them.  There is one that we call the 
KPMG Consortium which comprised KPMG Nkon ki, Norton Rose, 
[indistinct] 
the 
PWC 
consortium 
which comprised 
PWC, 
CIIDB 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 105 of 154 
 
Engineers, Cliff Decker, Hofmeyr Incorporated and the McKinsey 
consortium which comprised at the time McKinsey, Letsema, [indistinct] 
Capital, [indistinct] Nedbank, Edward Nathan S onnenberg and Art.  Art 
represented by Mr David Porter and Webber Wenzel attorneys 
submitted a proposal only for procurement and legal services.  Chair 
there is a point that on the 6 December 2012 McKinsey was awarded 
with a letter of intent for this particular service.  However it is 
important to note that that was through a confinement process.  This 
process of the RFP was essentially non-awarded at the conclusion of 
this process.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the open tender process was commenced but was 
abandoned and then a confinement process was then pursued.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair that is to the best of 
my knowledge at the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There was a letter issued on 
the 6 December 2012 or signed on the 6 December the letter is dated 
the 30 November 2012 and signed on the 6 December 2012 where Mr 
Anoj Singh representing Transnet informed the McKinsey consortium 
the letter of intent for the provision I am referencing item MSM19 page  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  354. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  354 in Exhibit BB3B  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  B ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this letter goes on to 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 106 of 154 
 
explain the letter of intent and some of the key deliverables in that 
contract.  It also lists in this contract it lists Regiments, McKinsey and 
some of the other service providers that will be providing service in 
terms of the requirement for the 1064 locomotive advisory.  At the time 
this particular letter of intent under Annexure A on page 360 refers to 
an amount in terms of the deliverables must be executed for a fee of 
R35.2 million as the fee note below any over run in terms of the time 
will not be for the account of Transnet as the engagement is output 
based and not time based.  McKinsey will take overall responsibility for 
the deliverables and the quality of the end products.  Expenses will be 
10 
kept at 10% of the value of the engagement for the supplier and its 
sub-contractors.  It is important to note that at that time it was output  
based.  It had some very specific outputs that were included.  Financial 
project management procurement legal we can go back to this but it 
had all of the key deliverables that were required from this particular 
transaction.  Chair the constitution of the  McKinsey consortium at the 
time had now changed as we pointed out earlier on and…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you talk about that.  Mr  Mokoena will you 
investigate whether we cannot get a better copy?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A better copy Chair, yes (inter venes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not only of this one.  There are a number of copies 
which are quite poor and …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Difficult to read. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Will do that Chair. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 107 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and maybe that could be passed  onto all members 
of the legal team for – for the future that where there is a copy that …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is not legible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is not legible or it is quite poor if they can make 
attempts to try and get a cleaner copy.  Okay, alright.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes Mr Mahomedy. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this letter of intent 
also excluded - just by the way Chair – excluded the legal services on 
page 335.  It specifically stated that:  
10 
“The supplier agrees to relinquish all legal services 
to Webber Wentzel.” 
And goes on to – to state that: 
“Further more clearly the key objectives that 
outlined in this particular document …”  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just about that that sounds quite strange. 
Does it not?  For Transnet to say when they have got a transaction they 
obviously need a lot of legal advice and guidance to say they relinquish 
all legal services from within Transnet.  Now normally Transnet will 
instruct outside attorneys – will instruct lawyers from outside if they 
20 
want to instruct lawyers.  I am sure they do so every day without having 
a clause such as this or is it – is it a usual kind of thing to include 
something along those lines?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in this case I think the 
original consortium - if I remember – included a firm of attorneys from 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 108 of 154 
 
McKinsey as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Essentially I think it included 
Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it was not – it was not Transnet saying they 
would relinquish Transnet legal services or legal services from within 
Transnet? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair.  What it – what it 
said was the supplier being McKinsey …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The consortium …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Will not conduct any legal 
services.  They relinquish all of the legal services …  
CHAIRPERSON:  They would … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To Webber Wentzel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in other words they would not instruct other 
attorneys? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  Yes Chair that is 
largely what it means. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Also what it says is that: 
“Notwithstanding 
the 
appointment 
of 
Webber 
Wentzel by Transnet the supplier will oversee all 
work and deliver the work supplied by Webber 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 109 of 154 
 
Wentzel and manage the deliverables of the entire 
advisory service.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So I assume three was some 
integration … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But it was an – it was an 
exclusion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Because initially it was 
10 
included and then it became an exclusion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think I just want to 
touch on the key deliverables included in the original letter of intent.  
“A robust and de-risk business case that is fully 
supported and approved by the Board and the 
shareholder.” 
That was on of – it is on page 336 towards the bottom.  
“Developing and augmenting the business case for 
the approval of the locomotives by the Transnet 
20 
Board of Directors and Department of Enterprises.  
Procurement …” 
I am not going through all of them but procurement and legal talks to 
all of the different asp ects of the advisory technical and operations.  
Financial – it was talking to developing financing and funding options 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 110 of 154 
 
and then to develop deal structures, financing, hedging and de -risking 
options. 
 
Project 
Management 
Office 
provide 
the 
stakeholder 
engagement etcetera.  The reason that we are doing that is because it 
will become relevant when we talk about the role that then was 
perceived by Regiments - for example. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Were you reading from page 356 356?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  356 of the pack. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Any other issue that you want to 
10 
highlight there for the Chair?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As I said Chair on page 360 
- again I think it may not be entirely legible as you pointed out Chair - 
but what it does talk to on page 360 – I have a slightly clearer copy 
with me.  As I said Chair it says:  
“Deliverables must be executed for a fee of R35.2 
million as per the fee note below.  Any overrun in 
terms of time will not be for the account of Transnet 
as the engagement is output based and not time 
based.  McKinsey will take over all responsibility for 
20 
the deliverables and quality of the products – 
expenses at 10 percent.”  
It then goes in and explains  that the consortium for the various aspects 
total was R35.2 million. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then if you go to page 358 whose 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 111 of 154 
 
signs? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
The 
signature 
from 
Transnet’s side is Mr Anoj Singh. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  On 4 December. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now – now take us through the contents 
of paragraph 5.4.4 – Chair on page 14 of the statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in the page in which McKinsey – 
McKinsey’s people signed or person s igns the Director there – there 
are witnesses who witness his signature but …  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On page 358 where Mr Anoj Singh’s signs on behalf 
of … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There are no witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody signs as a witness. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is true Chair.  The 
documents that we have got …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And we have seen do not 
include a witness to the signature.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Mahomedy paragraph 5.4.4 and 
onwards. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the constitution of the 
McKinsey Consortium now effectively from what was originally 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 112 of 154 
 
submitted is now including Regiments and it comes in under the 
perspective of a supplier development partner and I think they were not 
part of the initial procurement process anyway.  This is possibly a 
breach of the Transnet Procurement Manual and Transnet Supply Chain 
Policy as it is a change – fundamental change in the consor tium that 
was originally bidding for the work.  I think further down Chair on page 
14 of my testimony we provide - under 5.4.6 – we provide a perspective 
on all of the different dates in which Transnet either concluded 
extensions or contracts with McKinsey. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is – that is quite crucial 
10 
Mr Mahomedy.  Could you please take us through that foreshadowing 
the evidence of other witnesses to come?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the first document that 
commences this process is a d ocument that is issued what we call a 
letter of intent as we have just gone through dated 6  December and 
that is the date that it is signed by the McKinsey principal.  There is a 
first addendum to this document which is essentially to ask for an 
extension in the validity period of the LOI.  The LOI had a specific 
validity period.  I think it was three months – if I remember correctly – 
but there is a specific validity period and it needed to be amended as it 
20 
says in the LOI – maybe amended or modified in wr iting by the 
authorised signatories.  There was an amendment that took the 
document out.  There was a second amendment to the LOI in 
October 2013 
which 
extends 
the 
validity 
period 
further 
to 
30 November 2013.  There is an agreement for the provision of the  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 113 of 154 
 
transaction advisory services to Transnet in January  2014.  That is the 
document Chair I referenced earlier on saying that there was this side 
deal – if you would like to call it.  That was long before any session 
because McKinsey was still the heads of a greement with the 
transaction.  So on 20 January there is this transaction or an 
agreement between Transnet and Regiments.  There is the purported 
session that also took place on the 5 t h – sorry my apologies.  There is a 
third addendum to the LOI and this is to transfer the scope to 
Regiments.  On 5 February we provided that letter for the agreement or 
the session in which McKinsey informs Transnet of their intention to 
10 
move all rights and obligations through to Regiments.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
The 
master 
services 
agreement 
for 
this 
particular 
transaction 
is 
signed 
on 
21 February 2014. 
 
Chair 
there 
are 
subsequently 
two 
further 
amendments.  So up to 21  February or 5 February that is the extent to 
which McKinsey were involved.  Now on 28 February 2014 we notice 
that the fees of 35.2 million are now increased to 78.4 million and this 
is largely with Regiments as the service provider or the lead consortium 
partner. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And this is done by way of …?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  A memorandum. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  A memorandum.  Nothing else?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No it is a memorandum.  
Chair then on 16 July 2015 there is a further memorandum.  Again 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 114 of 154 
 
Chair it is a memorandum that is submitted to the – I think I recall it 
was submitted to the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee – to move 
the total fees on the loco 1 064 advisory to close to 289 million in total.  
Chair that is – there – there are other amendments as well but I think 
largely what we saying is that it moved from 35.2 million to a total 
somewhere in the region of R289.5 million in total.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to – so where do you find 289?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair on – actually I am 
going ahead of myself but on 5.4.82 we explain that it moved to 81 – 
sorry.  On page 16 of my statement.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It says that it moved - this 
amount increased to 289.5 million in total.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So what you did Mr Mahomedy you took 
into account this entire contract.  You looked at the different variations 
through the addendums and you made certain observations and those 
observations are from paragraph 5.4.8 and if you can take the Chair 
through the observations of the review th at you have now done in the 
light of all these contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because I asked you about that figure because I 
20 
was looking at the figure. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of 16 (intervenes). 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  166. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 115 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair we will explain that 
hopefully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, go ahead ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now explain to the Chair and give a 
contexts to the amount. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the amounts that 
finally were paid to the different consortium partners including a 
number of things that went into what was then called loco advisory 
services.  There was an amount of 166 million that was paid to 
Regiments under the auspices of loco advisory.  However it was  
10 
actually for executing a funding transaction.  Chair I think at this point 
it is also important to note that Regiments – as I read out part of the 
scope – it was to determine and formulate funding plans and funding 
strategy.  It would not be to execute th ose strategies because there 
would be a conflict and in the loco advisory included in this 289 million 
is an amount of 166 million which was paid to Regiments which was 
then called a success fee for the China Development Bank Loan.  This 
also becomes relev ant as we go further into the document Chair when 
we talk about the transactions – funding transactions that Transnet was 
involved in for 1 064.  So included in the 289 is 166 million that was 
20 
paid to Regiments for this particular execution of this funding .  Of the 
total 289 million Chair Regiments was paid R267.7 million which 
equates to 92 percent of that fee which largely means that they had 
become the lead in the consortium.  Also quite relevant when we look at 
the conflict of interest that arose later on in – in our review.  The 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 116 of 154 
 
variation again we talk about the process Chair and I think 
Advocate Mokoena asks about the initial process – the procurement - 
but the variation in this process would have required in my view a new 
procurement event particularly when we look at the 166 million that was 
now included because that was for a fundamentally different event and 
we should have executed an event for that.  However I say that with 
caution because I give due credit to our Transnet Treasury Team who 
had the capability to execute this transaction with China Development 
Bank without the assistance of Regiments.  So if I may phrase correctly 
if there was a need for it then it would have been a separate 
10 
procurement event.  It should not have been included as one  bundled 
event that then cost us a total of 289 million.  I hope I am making 
myself clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – but your – your evidence is that Transnet 
had enough people who could do this and there was no reason why 
outside – an outside firm was required to – to be involved? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you and once again in regard to this 
as was the case with another issue that you dealt with you have not 
been able to find any document in which contains an e xplanation or 
20 
justification for not using Transnet’s own expertise and capacity?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair we are not able to find 
a document that suggests …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That we did not have the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 117 of 154 
 
capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That gives whatever explanation.  You have not been 
able to find any such document?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair.  In fact we will 
present evidence to the contrary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  What did – what did you understand by 
this success fee of 166 million?  What did Regiments do to be entitled 
10 
to such an amount? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Well the explanation is 
complex in terms of the memorandum th at has been included.  However 
simply put what it says is that Regiments were the arranger of this 
particular 
transaction 
with the 
– 
with 
the 
party being China 
Development Bank.  This is paid out in 2015 - I think it is July 2015.  
What is also quite inter esting is that Transnet had already approached 
China Development Bank way back in 2014.  So when Regiments was 
paid this in fact the then Treasurer of Transnet/Group Treasurer raised 
an alarm bell then to say that there is not a need for Regiments to be 
20 
involved in this at all because the Transnet Team had the capability and 
they had executed transactions that were of similar size if not bigger 
with funding institutions locally.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So I think the key  problem 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 118 of 154 
 
there was that that – you know – Regiments is purported to have done 
the transaction but it had commenced a while ago and some of these 
transactions to give you a perspective in – in the Treasury space.  A 
transaction of this size would take a whi le.  It is not something that you 
conclude on very quickly because there are significant numbers even in 
global terms.  This particular transaction with China Development Bank 
was originally being considered at $2.5 billion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You know it is difficult to listen to your evidence as 
well as the evidence of the other Transnet witnesses who have come 
before me and hear all these large amounts that were being paid out in 
10 
– to say the least - very questionable circumstances and not ask 
ourselves the question but how does it come about that such large 
amounts get paid out and somebody does not pick up the problem 
before they are actually paid out except that the answer must be that if 
the authorisation was made by people not as senior as the people who 
authorised then one would look at the senior people and say where 
were you when such large amounts were – when lower level people in 
the company were authorising these types of payments but when it is 
people right at the top there is a problem about who is  the one who 
would pick and stop and stop these things because some of them were 
20 
approved by the Board itself and then you were either talking of the 
GCEO or a CE of like an operational division or a Group Chief Financial 
Officer.  So it was top people.  S o - so maybe that is basically the 
explanation. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think you – you 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 119 of 154 
 
capture it very succinctly and correctly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In this particular case if we 
look at the payment of 166 milli on the authorisation was from the Group 
Treasurer of Transnet …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which is a very senior 
position/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mr Ramosebudi. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The Group Supply Chain 
Officer meaning the Head of Procurement …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mr Garry Pita. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The Group Chief Financial 
Officer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mr Anoj Singh … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And the Acting Group Chief 
Executive at the time – Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So when we are talking 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 120 of 154 
 
about the four – it is about the most four – about the most senior four 
people … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In an organisation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
With 
the structures 
of 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Even if a lower level 
employee were to question …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The authority for payment …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  They would be given this 
document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And say well in fac t this 
particular document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Was then presented to the 
20 
Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee and authorised by that 
Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Sub Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 121 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And I think you correctly put 
it Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That it is the most senior …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Executives in the business 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That are instructing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That signature appears on 
the memorandum.  It is approved.  There will be an extract of the 
minute … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Because the person who is 
making payment will ask what authority this payment is made …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And he or she will receive all 
of these supporting documents …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That give rise to this 
payment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
And 
accordingly 
the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 122 of 154 
 
individual whoever at whatever level will make the payment based on 
the signatures … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That are on the document … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As well as the approval of 
the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and some of these transactions is – it may be 
argued that it is not as if – it is not as if Transnet did not have 
procedures which would have allowed these transactions to reflect – 
10 
had to be picked up by somebody as not appropriate if they had gone 
through those procedures.  The procedures were there in regard to – 
but they were simply bypassed or it was confinement or confidential 
confinement but even if it was not that.  they were dealt with at a very 
high level and – and anybody below that had no chance to make any 
contribution and – you know – had no chance to pick up the problem 
and try and stop it. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair just to illustrate the 
point you are making Chair.  This particular document once again 
signed by the four individuals …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Was submitted directly to 
the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  A Sub Committee of the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 123 of 154 
 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As far as – again as far as 
our reviews have brought out that this once again is not a document 
that served … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
At 
any 
Management 
Committee…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Because in the Management 
10 
Committee you would have too many people to then convince …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what this does demonstrate is probably Transnet 
now has additional mechanisms but what it does demonstrate is that 
the Commission may have to look at what mechanisms should be put in  
place for a situation where it is the very senior high people who seek to 
authorise illegitimate payments.  What should be done to make sure 
20 
that they can be picked up?  Maybe – maybe it is difficult to provide 
because normally for people at that level yo u expect that they would 
look after the interest of the organisation but it may be that one should 
look at what really should be done because you cannot afford a repeat.  
Obviously one of the – one of the important things is to only appoint 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 124 of 154 
 
people of a certain legal of integrity at - at those high positions but it 
may be that something must be looked at to say if something like this 
were to happen again would Transnet be subjected to the same kinds of 
losses. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I do not know if I want 
to respond to that but I think it is safe to say that the current Board has 
reviewed the delegation of authority.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In terms of that just last 
week I bumped into the Chairman in the corridors of Transnet and he 
10 
said to me that we should never allow you – referencing me – to 
become a one man party in this organisation and we should not give 
you any authority that can create this problem again and I think it is a - 
it is a fair comment in the sense that a delegation of authority allowed 
for people individually to sign certain transactions.  That largely has 
been withdrawn in the current delegation of authority that exists in 
Transnet on the Board’s instruction and we have now what we call 
individuals are authorised to sign only if cross functional committees 
review the document and approve certain things.  So – yes I agree with 
your sentiments entirely. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is said that when any country draws a 
Constitution they should have in mind t he worst possible scenario in 
terms of President or Government and make provision for that and not 
have in mind a very good Government and good President.  So maybe 
what this means is that with SOEs to simply saying we will try and 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 125 of 154 
 
appoint people of integrity at these high positions might not be enough.  
It might be necessary to say let us assume we have done everything we 
can to make sure the person is one of the right level of integrity.  What 
happens if despite that something happens?  Okay, thank you.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair you will recall that Mr  Volmink 
did attend to give some of the recommendations.  He took us through 
different structures …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Of the current Board …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Also identified …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Those concerns and anomalies in order 
to address … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You know – what actually occurring …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  During the time in Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Maybe that will go a long way …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Coupled obviously with other things that 
might be said to strengthen …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  This SOE (indistinct) structures. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 126 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But there is also a far – much more 
fundamental concern Mr Mahomedy haven taken the Chair through the 
amounts that were used or the amount that was paid – you know – to 
Regiments.  If I may take you back to page 13 – 1-3 - with reference to 
paragraph 5.4 and I think that is where you commenced with your 
evidence but it only makes sense now when we now see these huge 
amounts being paid to Regiments.  Only now that we see the 
importance of your evidence.  In this paragraph you identify the parties 
and you take us through the different consortiums.  Am I correct?  
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And if you go through those 
consortiums you say that on the tender closing date that you gave us 
the names of the different consortiums, I mean, does – can you come 
across the name of Regiments in any of those consortiums?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     No they were not included in 
any consortium. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    But yet when you take the Chair to 
page 16, paragraph 5.4.81 they appear to have been paid an amount in 
excess of – an amount of 1.66million. 
20 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   166million Chair.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAH OMEDY:     Yes and Regiments were 
replaced through a variety of other conflicts that were noted at the time 
as I mentioned earlier there was a supposed conflict with Letsema in 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 127 of 154 
 
the advisory team as well as Nedbank.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     There was a point which I thought you were about 
to make at some stage and I don’t know if you made it with regard to 
what Regiments was paid when you look at the amount that they were 
paid, you made – you referred to the fact that in fact, I think , what they 
did or what they were supposed to do related to funding and I think 
funding only and not other things.  So I wonder whether part of the 
point you wanted to make was that in effect, the amount that they were 
paid was for much more than that and whatever much more wasn’t what 
10 
they had done, is that part of the point you were making or sought to 
make?  In other words even if you were to say as far as the funding 
aspect is concerned they were entitled to charge and be paid, certainly 
that is a lot of money that they were paid for which would fall outside 
the funding work that they may have done and for that part of the 
money they did not do anything. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair that is correct the 
question that goes back to the local advis ory letter of intent it says, 
“developing finance and funding options, developing deal structures’, it 
doesn’t talk about execution it talks about developing them.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yet in the same contract 
which Regiments took over from McKinsey, if I can use those words, 
Regiments is then paid 166million rand for facilitating a loan 
transaction with China Development Bank by Transnet, the 166million is 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 128 of 154 
 
what Transnet pays Regiments. The question is, what work did th ey for 
166million in value for that payment to be made, when particularly a 
year before that – almost a year before that Transnet had already 
commenced conversations with China Development Bank and we will 
provide that evidence a little later on.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes we can now move on Mr Mahomedy 
to deal with your topic on paragraph 5.5 page 16, exorbitant transaction 
advisory fees on the CDB and the club loan, but before you do that, can 
you please educate us as to wha t are these club loans. 
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair I think before we talk 
about the club loan it would be necessary to give some context as to 
the, you know, the source and the creation and the reason why some of 
these loans actually came into being.  Obviously we had the 1064 
programme no, if you want to call it, in play, the contracts were signed 
we needed to fund these transactions. So Transnet and the treasury 
team at the time would have to sit down and think about how we would 
fund this 49billion rand – these contracts...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    And the treasury team, you’re talking about, is it the 
treasury team from National Treasury or from within Transnet?  
20 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Ordinarily it would be the 
Transnet treasury team within our office – within our structures, 
however, in a number of instances they have not been party to being 
involved at all, it remains key throughout the document throughout my 
testimony from here on.  So in – around August 2014 as I said the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 129 of 154 
 
previous Group Treasurer Ms Mathane Makgatho, actually visited and 
had conversations with China Development Bank to provide us with 
funding to the value of approximately, at the time the discussions were 
at two and a half billion dollars.  At that time the Forex rate was about 
R12.00 that would then give you funding of 30billion rand.  The 
discussions between China Development Bank and Transnet progressed 
to the point where they would give you what is called indicative pricing 
etcetera.  At some point in 201 5, steps in Regiments, Ms Makgatho 
writes an email before that, also in the documents, where we’ll get to 
that, where she registers her discomfort with the involvement of 
10 
Regiments.  Chair as we’ll progress through each event but what then 
happens is, China Development Bank and Regiments agree that the 
amount will be one and a half billion dollars, that’s what they are 
prepared now to put on the table as a guaranteed funding option and 
that’s what Regiments present so the other billion dollars with the rate  
still at around R12.00 there’s a strategy to now get what is called the 
domestic market involved and see what we can come up with and that 
is then termed the ZAR Club Loan.  The ZAR Club Loan is simply a 
South African Rand loan that is put together with m ore than one 
financial institution.  In this particular case the 12billion rand was taken 
20 
up by the Bank of China locally 3billion rand and again this is in rand, 
this is in South African rand so that’s why it’s called a ZAR Club Loan. 
ABSA takes 3billion, Nedbank...(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Can I take us slightly back so that the 
Chair can follow, are you now taking us through the contents of 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 130 of 154 
 
paragraph 5.5.2? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes and then please take us – it’s on 
page 16 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve got it thank you.   
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     So I’m at the second part of 
it we’ll talk about the first part, China Development Bank, we spoken of 
one and a half billion, the ZAR Club L oan again Chair is 3billion rand 
for Absa, 3billion rand from the Bank of China, 3billion rand from 
Nedbank, one and a half billion rand from Future Growth and one and a 
10 
half billion from OMSFIN which is an Old Mutual entity, that’s the 
creation of the ZAR  Club Loan.  What is also important is that, that was 
not the sum total of all of the funding for 1064 so we touched on the 
China Development Bank of one and a half billion dollars, that was 
based on a draw-down facility which means they gave you the facil ity 
and as you need it you will draw that down and then pay the interest.  
Then in addition to that – sorry Chair, my apologies for going a bit – 
the China Development Bank loan was specifically when the one and a 
half billion was agreed, it was specifical ly for the CSR and CNR 
locomotives.  The ZAR Club Loan, the 3billion that the Bank of China 
20 
gave from the 12 was also specifically for the Chinese locomotives.  
The balance of 9billion was secured under what we call, general 
funding principles.  In additio n to that we also were able to get into  a 
transaction with the United States EXIM facility of 5.7billion rand and 
that was done for the General Electric locomotives because GE is 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 131 of 154 
 
largely an American company so the American EXIM was prepared to 
fund this transaction and then there were two more funding transactions 
on page 17, Chair where it is called an Export Development of Canada, 
the EDC together with Investec locally and KFW Development Bank 
which is out of Germany for amounts of 6.992billion and 2.76b illion 
respectively that related to the Bombardier locomotives.  
 
This is, essentially the – all of the different loans that we 
undertook during the time of the 1064 locomotives...(intervention).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Now these transaction, I mean you 
have referred to the treasury department within Transnet were they not 
10 
capable of sourcing or securing this loans from these various 
institutions without having to involve any other external entity?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     The Transnet Treasury te am 
had the capacity and capability to execute these transactions as far as 
we are concerned. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes now you also draw the attention of 
the Chair to some of the prejudicial conduct from paragraph 5.5.3 to the 
detriment of Transnet, can you please take us through them?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair as I touched on 
earlier on, in terms of paragraph 5.5.4 the China Development loan had 
20 
already commenced discussions or our team had already commenced 
discussions for the China Development Bank loan with China 
Development Bank and then we had the advent of Regiments into the 
transaction and as I explained earlier on Chair 166million was paid to 
Regiments for this particular piece of work which could very easily have 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 132 of 154 
 
been executed by the Transnet Treasury team.  Under 5.5.6, when it 
came to the ZAR Club Loan we have subsequently or since the 
transaction, we have identified an invoice that was paid to Trillian 
Asset Managers for an amount of 82million rand excluding VAT Chair 
and there are subsequent memoranda that talk to the provision of a 
Lead Ranger Service from Trillian Asset Management.  Once again this 
document is signed by a few key individuals and approved by the very 
same ADC, at the time, this was in – around November 2015. 
 
So once again Chair, the syndication of a loan is not a 
complex structure for our Transnet Treasury team, these are things that 
10 
we would do on a regular basis and we would call relevant banks 
together, we would sit with them, explain to them what the requir ement 
is, present to them and say what funding we require and then 
institutions would normally come back to us and say, we are prepared 
to invest in Transnet at these values, these are our terms and 
conditions, that will be assessed and then a final decisi on would be 
made yet again...(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Do you know why Trillian was paid that 
amount, what was – what did they do to be paid that amount?   
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Well it’s alleged that they 
20 
were a supply development partner to Regiments, that’s the information 
that has been presented but in the discussions that we’ve had we are 
unable to find any documentation or any evidence that Trillian did in 
fact do any work on the ZAR Club Load, we don’t believe and we are 
not able to – we had discussed this with the previous treasurer we 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 133 of 154 
 
asked for simple documentation around meetings that were held, that 
were 
scheduled 
that 
would 
have 
shown 
Trillian, 
members 
of 
management or Executives or members of their staff that attended  
these conversations or meetings, because Chair this is in – around 
November/December 2015 early – well between November and early 
December 2015 and the payment is made at that time but we are not 
able to actually find any evidence that any work was actual ly performed 
by Trillian. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes you may proceed with your – the 
contents on page – on paragraph 5.5.8 unless there are any other 
10 
specific amounts which you wish to highlight for the Chair in relation to 
those amounts stated above. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     I think Chair if – we need to 
go to 5.5.11 and the email or the – my suggestion earlier on 
that...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry that is 5? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 5.5.11 on page 19 Chair.     
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay, thank you. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair under a document that 
is – sorry the document is under MSM22 page number 450 – MSM450 I 
20 
would like to, if it is allowed that we read some of the contents of this 
particular email. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Firstly identify the email and tell us.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     The email is from Mathane 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 134 of 154 
 
Makgatho sent on the 21 s t of August 2014 at 12h54pm...(intervention).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Who is she, before your proceed? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     She was, at the time, the 
Group Treasurer of Transnet. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And she’s addressing this letter to 
who? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   She’s addressing this to the 
Chief Executive, Mr Brian Molefe as well as the Group Chief Financial 
Officer Mr Anoj Singh...(intervention).   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    And do you know what was the purpose 
10 
of this letter? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   The purpose was talking 
around the matter of Regiments and China D evelopment Bank.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, you can take the Chair through the 
relevant portions of the letter which you wish to highlight.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Chair in the first paragraph 
she states,  
 
“This email is a follow-up of various discussions I had with 
 
yourselves and in some instances with Regiments included 
 
where I had indicated my disagreement – sorry my discomfort 
20 
 
and disagreement on how the China Development Bank facility 
 
negotiations 
are 
being 
handled. 
 
Regiments 
prici ng 
 
methodology as well as my disagreement of the appointment of 
 
Regiments as the transaction advisor for the facility”.   
 
Under the overall governance midway through that particular 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 135 of 154 
 
section Chair she says, 
 
“I do not support that a 26billion rand facili ty be negotiated 
 
and led by a transaction advisor as we cannot and should not 
 
negotiate a loan facility in isolation of Transnet’s current 
 
90billion rand debt portfolio”,  she goes on to say, “when we 
 
negotiate a facility of this magnitude we assemble a multi-
 
disciplinary 
team 
that 
includes 
legal, 
tax, 
accounting, 
 
structured finance and risk management team members.  This 
 
is to ensure that all possible risks relating to the facility are 
 
identified and mitigated to the extent possible”.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Just before you proceed I think it’s important to 
highlight that last sentence of her first paragraph where she says, “for 
the avoidance of doubt, I’d like to bring the following to your attention”.  
So it looks like this is somebody who wants to make s ure that her 
position is clear and that nobody among those or between those to 
whom she’s addressing the email can later on say, I did not know, 
okay...(intervention). 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair you correctly point 
that out, in addition Chair I omitted to mention a statement that she 
made she says under 1), overall governance in the second sentence 
20 
she says, 
 
“As I indicated I was not consulted nor was I aware that 
 
Regiments was appointed as the transaction advisor and lead 
 
negotiator for the facility as I believe there was no need for 
 
them to be appointed given progress that we had made”.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 136 of 154 
 
 
Clearly indicating that Transnet Treasury had already engaged 
with China Development Bank and they had made progress.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Also making the point that you yourself have made 
that on some of the instances we are dealing with situations where, at 
least as far as Transnet is concerned, there was no need for certain 
external services to be brought in.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay you can proceed. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair under point 2), fees 
and interest expense, she states, 
10 
 
“The current pricing indication is not in line with other DFI’s, a 
 
DFI is a Developmental Funding Institution, asset backed or 
 
even tied facilities” I’m skipping a sentence and reading, “as 
 
China Development Bank Facility is tied to procurement from 
 
China, as it is supposed to support CNR and CSR locomotive 
 
contracts the terms and conditions should mirror that of that of 
 
tied facilities as well as asset backed facilities. These two 
 
elements, tied and security should translate into cost effective 
 
funds which should be close to local funds as well as simpler 
 
terms and conditions”. 
20 
 
Chair the reason that is quite critical is bec ause the funding 
with China Development Bank is what is called a securitised loan and 
meaning that the locomotives that are procured from CNR and CSR are 
taken as a bond...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:    As a surety or authority. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 137 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     As a surety. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Surety ja.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    As a surety over that loan 
and that’s the point...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja so that if the loan is not repaid they can actually 
take those locomotives and attach them or  something to that effect. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That is correct Chair, it is a, 
you know, a simple – like a lease HP, higher purchase agreement where 
the vehicle is always owned by the lender until it’s fully paid off and 
that’s the current situation with the CDB loan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was an adverse condition as far as Transnet 
was concerned is that right?    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That’s correct Chair and 
what the point that is being made here if with that you should have 
lower overall – the risk is lower because they’ve now got a collateral.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair further on the next 
page she goes on, on page 451 to provide a very detailed look at the 
China Development Bank proposal and the am ounts and the rates that 
are quoted here relate to the two and a half billion dollars.  So I’m just 
20 
providing clarity that it was changed subsequently – at that time it was 
relating to the two and a half billion dollar proposal that was on the 
table.  In her view she says that a fair price would be JIBR plus 210 
basis points and that’s the Johannesburg Inter Bank Rate and I’ve 
taken into consideration the size of the facility.  In the current market 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 138 of 154 
 
the proposed CBD structure will cost three and a half bill ion rand more 
in interest expenses and that is based on the two and a half billion 
dollar debt.  Based on these numbers we have looked at it on the one 
and a half billion dollars it equates to just about 2billion rand in 
additional or higher interest bills  that was her calculation in August 
2014. 
Chair under conclusion she talks as follows,  
 
“It is my belief that the CDB facility in its current form is not in 
 
the best interest of the company or the country.  Given 
 
potential capital leakage of up to 3.7billion in excessive 
 
interest expense and excessive arrangement fees which may 
10 
 
be classified as a PFMA violation given information at our 
 
disposal.  The additional interest expense will have a negative 
 
impact on the already fragile cash interest cover rat io. I 
 
therefore recommend that we terminate discussions with China 
 
Development Bank and explore other sources of funds.  
 
Transnet has proved its ability to raise funds from diverse 
 
funding sources even under trying circumstances.  In 2008 and 
 
2009 we were able to raise over 22billion rand even when the 
 
market was closed for other issues.  The latest example is our 
 
ability to raise 8billion rand for the locomotive deposit at short 
20 
 
notice”, 
 
And she goes on to explain her position.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Now she gives this detailed letter or 
memo to the two senior officials identified by itself in that letter, do you 
know whether – did they follow her advice?  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 139 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    the advice as not followed 
because we continued with the C hina Development Bank loan, we 
continued to use Regiments as the advisors, we paid Regiments the 
166million so clearly that was not necessarily – that advice was not 
taken...(intervention).  
CHAIRPEROSN:    Do you know whether they responded to – that is Mr 
Brian Molefe and Mr Anoj Singh whether they responded to her memo 
or email? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair I’m not aware of that, 
I’m not aware of a response. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    If they’d responded – I mean in your 
review of these documents you would have actually come across such a 
document and clearly, you know, refer the Chair to such a document.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    But throughout your review you never 
found any response? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    We haven’t found any 
response to this.  Chair there are certain pertinent facts that we must 
also disclose around the China Development Bank loan.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Transnet had paid what is 
common practice in the banking environment, we pay an upfront fee for 
certain facilities, not necessarily always the case but in some cases we 
pay an upfront fee.  To China Development Bank we paid an upfront fee 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 140 of 154 
 
which equated to 17.7million US Dollars.  At the time of the transaction 
we believe the rate as closer to, about again, R12.00 which will mean 
that we paid 212million rand.  The reason I state this Chair is because 
it was out of kilter with what was paid to other institutions at th e same 
time.  If it pleases the Commission under MSM20 page 367 we try to 
provide a summary to certain transactions focused on the funding of the 
1064 locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we talk about MSM20, Mr Mokoena I think 
MSM22 the one we have just deal t with. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Is very important, it would be very helpful for steps 
to be taken if they haven’t been taken to provide – to get proof that the 
email was received by the two persons to whom it was addressed.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    We have gone far much more further 
than that Chair, we will be calling Ms Mathane Makgatho to testify on 
this specific issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And other related issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine thank you.  Yes we are back at 
MSM20? 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair under the page 
number MSM367 . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair we endeavour to 
provide the commission with an overall perspective of some of the key 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 141 of 154 
 
transactions and funding arrangements that were put in place in and 
around 2015.  This becomes relevant further when we talk about the 
interest rate swops.  And Chair if we look at the upfront fees in column 
C Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MA HOMEDY:  In Column C of page 367 we 
provide the upfront fees that were paid to the various institutions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  One will note that the 
upfront fees equated to between .3 and .45%. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The upper limit being .45%.  
However as it relates to the China Development Bank facility which is 
at the bottom of the page we will note that we paid 17.7 million dollars 
which is based on what we have drawn up to today equates to 1.18% 
which is approximately twice even more than twice what was paid on all 
of the other facilities that we had taken.  And again for purposes of 
transparency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to look for the figure that you gave.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chair if we look at the 
20 
bottom of the page it says China Development Bank  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  US Dollar then there is an 
amount of 1044 that is the total amount we have drawn up to now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the figure I was looking a t but I thought you 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 142 of 154 
 
said 17? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes then next to that on the 
right Chair is a – two columns down is 17.7 million dollars.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  Okay.  Ja. I think…  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As a percentage of what we 
have drawn it equates to 1.18%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As compared to the .3 that 
we paid and .45% it is about – just about more than double. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Close to 3 times 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  What we would have paid 
locally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is also all of these facts 
give corroboration to Ms Magoto’s mail where she says there was an 
ability for us to actually borrow this money cheap er on the local market.  
There is one very fundamental issue Chair that we have to put on the 
table at this point.  By securing the funding in US dollar I go back to 
20 
testimony that we gave earlier on around the hedging costs of the 1064 
increasing ETC.  I would like to try to simplify this but simply put Chair 
we spent billions literally to hedge the 1064 locomotive contract from – 
because all of the OEM’s there were international service providers or 
OEM’s and they would have quoted you their underlying cu rrency would 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93

have been a foreign currency. And we spent all that money to hedge it 
into rand.  The problem is then we go and borrow in dollars to hedge it 
again into rand.  So from a benefit to the country perspective and the 
benefit to Transnet or shall I say the erosion of value to Transnet it not 
on one front.  It is running into multiple billions because we spent that 
money and if it may please the commission for a very simple 
explanation is – I buy a car and they tell me it is 100  000 dollars.  But 
today’s rate is R14 whatever and the bank says well if you want to pay 
it in two years you will – we will charge you R16.  So that car will work 
out to R1.6 million for me.  But then I go back and I say no, no I cannot 
10 
get funding locally I will go and borrow  100 000 dollars from a foreign 
bank and then convert that loan into rands again and pay for that 
conversion again.  And because this is a long term loan because it is 
for fifteen years the cost of this what is now in the treasury term called 
a cross currency swop is what we pay for again.  So we have hedged 
the 1064 locomotive programme.  It has cost us billions and then we 
hedge – we borrow in billions and then we hedge again.  So it is a 
double whammy as far as the total cost base of Transnet is concerne d.  
And it is quite an important point Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So in a way it is difficult to find sense is 
20 
that the point you make that it is difficult to find it is not sensible?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I actually support the 
submission of Ms Mokgatle.  She says we should not be progressing 
with this transaction with China Development Bank.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 144 of 154 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We had to have explored all 
of the opportunities locally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  With our domestic financial 
institutions to decide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And by the way Chair also 
financial institutions from overseas are prepared to lend us in rand as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN  MAHOMEDY:  Transnet is largely an entity 
that conducts its business within the borders of this country.  Its 
revenue and cost base is largely in South African rand so it does not 
necessarily make good financial sense to borrow in dollars particularly 
when you potentially have lenders who are willing to lend you in South 
African rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But is these transactions were no 
prejudicial to Transnet why would they still be proceeded with having to 
take into account what you say as serious losses that could have been 
20 
incurred by Transnet?  And I am asking this question against the 
background of also a thorough advice that it is now being preferred by 
one of the experienced internal members of Transnet dealing wit h the 
same issues why would anyone proceed with such a transaction?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The only possible and 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 145 of 154 
 
plausible explanation from my perspective would be that there was an 
agenda for a payment to be made to Regiments ultimately or some 
entity that existed outside of the system.  Why would Transnet in good 
conscience engage in a loan agreement that has got a significantly or a 
possibly prejudicial interest rate in the first place that comes at a 
higher cost?  Also on page 367 Chair across the line you will note 
under column F. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  An amount of 330 million 
that was paid to China Development Bank for what is called a 
10 
commitment fee.  That is when you do not use the full facility that you  
ask for.  So every time you draw down you pay a commitment fee on the 
difference.  So when you consider all of these factors this would have 
been more expensive particularly if you consider the cost and I am 
using the term loosely the cost of hedging the loan.  Because the 
banking institutions may get offended it is actually called a cross 
currency swop but the cost of all of these things when you add them in 
they have brought additional cost to Transnet’s financial position and it 
has affected us adversely. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  While you are still on that also if 
20 
you can comment on the Column H on the very same page as to who 
the beneficiary and what does it represent?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We put that for purposes of 
clarity and confirmation as I said on the ZAR Club Loan R82 million 
plus VAT was paid to Trillian.  For – at this point in time we do – have 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 146 of 154 
 
not seen any evidence of work performed by Trillian on the ZAR Club 
Loan.  And then on the China Development Bank Loan the R166 millio n 
that I referred to earlier on was paid to Regiments.  So just based on 
the funding you see just about a quarter billion rand.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Being paid out when 
expertise existed in Transnet to execute these transactions.  Which by 
the way we currently are executing transactions maybe not the size of 
this transaction but we do execute with local and foreign institutions 
these type of transactions with the people that are currently employed 
10 
in the Treasury team who largely are there for a number of years.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you worked with both Mr Anoj Singh and Mr 
Brian Molefe for quite some time at Transnet or not really?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I worked with Mr Anoj Singh 
for quite some time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and Brian – Mr Brian Molefe as well?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mr Molefe for a period of 
about probably just – he was the Chief Executive for a while but I 
worked with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  For a big period of about two 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  When you look at that email or memo that was 
written to them by it is Ms Mokgatle?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 147 of 154 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are satisfied that all the points she makes in that 
memo to them points that they would both have easily understood?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair Mr Singh…  
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of their knowledge and experience and their 
qualifications 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Mr Singh on a number of 
occasions acted as the Group Treasurer of Transnet in the absence of 
Treasurers at the point.  So when I say that meaning at points when the 
position of Group Treasurer was vacated and there was an absence of 
an appointed person he would act as the Group Treasurer.  And Mr 
10 
Molefe I think we all are aware of his experience at the public 
investment corporation at the PIC and that is an institution that is very 
heavily driven by Treasury related transactions and investments.  So 
what the points that are made here would be easily und erstood by 
people  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  With their extreme expertise 
and experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So some of these things that – some of the 
points that Mr Mokgatle makes and some of them you have made 
20 
yourself to the extent that they make it – they make what Mr Anoj Singh 
and Mr Brian Molefe may have been doing not to make sense.  Maybe 
they would be the ones who could explain why they did not follow – go 
along with these points made by Mr Mokgatle.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN  MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think in reading this 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 148 of 154 
 
today and in preparation for the commission one looks at the very clear 
perspective that Mr Mokgatle provides.  And also Chair I would like to 
add in discussion with the officials that were in Transnet Treasury at 
the time who have been – some of whom have been at Transnet for 
decades literally they were perplexed by the choice of loans, by some 
of the transactions that Transnet persevered with if I can call it that 
and in some cases they were also deep in the dark when these 
transactions were being negotiated.  As you know Ms Mokgatle says the 
involvement of Regiments as a lead arranger or advisor did not make 
sense to her. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But it also Chair if I may 
provide an opinion from myself.  It does not make sense from a PO 
business point of view in terms of the conflict of Regiments.  They were 
in terms of the LOI tasked with defining the funding principles and the 
funding mechanisms and methodologies and then become the execu tors 
of that funding transaction.  Then later on we will see that it did not 
just stop there they then became the executors of the swop 
transactions which again talked to a very deep rooted conflict that was 
not declared.  Neither was it acted on when the people who signed off 
20 
these payments were very well aware that Regiments were conflicted in 
all of these things that they presented to Transnet.  They were – they 
formulators of the funding plan.  They were the executors of the funding 
plan. They became the executors of the interest rate swops and 
collected significant amount of money and then they were also by the 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 149 of 154 
 
way you will see later on Chair where the counterparty of some of these 
swops were the Transnet Pension Fund and they became – and they 
were the Pension Fund Asset Managers and then became the recipients 
of the Pension Fund paying them literally a couple of 100 million.  So 
we have to look at it holistically to get that perspective and 
understanding that Regiments involvement and I think Advocate 
Mokoena started out with that conversation.  They are dropping into the 
local advisory as a supply development partner suddenly when there 
were other conflicts has to question one has to question the intention 
of that particular decision by the powers that be at the time. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  I mean… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Following up from these pertinent 
questions raised by the Chair and I think this it is important in the light 
of the testimony of Mr – of the Chair of Transnet Mr Popo Molefe and 
Mr Volmink who throughout their evidence emphasised the importance 
of this treasury department and its efficiency.  Maybe let us spend 
some time on it and just tell us for us to be able to understand the 
composition of this unit and the calibre of people that were employed 
within it and the qualifications that they possessed for them to be able 
20 
to undertake this transaction.  I think it is quite important in the light of 
these issues that you have now raised?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think if we look at 
the Transnet Treasury environment in 2014 and I am going to try to give 
a perspective in terms of the years.  
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 150 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mr Mokgatle was the Group 
Treasurer.  Prior to her was Ms Disebo Moephuli who was the treasurer 
for a while – a long period of time as I remember and she was widely 
regarded as a very significant treasurer in the local and global banking 
circles.  Ms Mokgatle had been in the treasury team as a Deputy 
Treasurer for a long period of time as well.  We had a gentleman Mr 
Danny Smith who was also a Deputy Treasurer and if my memory 
serves me correctly Mr Danny Smith spent more than 30 years at 
Transnet and retired at Transnet.  We also have an area c alled the 
10 
dealing room and the dealers that are in that dealing room ordinarily 
will get involved in assessing loans, arrangements for certain vanilla 
transactions, swops, they will be the ones who will actually look at 
whether this is plausible for Transn et to continue.  They will assess it 
in line with global trends.  What facilities we are able to secure at what 
rates, whether these things make sense.  The terms.  Looking at how a 
loan may impact our ability to repay the loan in years to come.  
Because these are termed loans some of them you know up to fifteen 
years.  So the Transnet Treasury team are a very competent group of 
people.  They have different roles.  Some of them are client facing or 
20 
facing the banks, talking to the banks on a regular basis.  Others are 
sitting in the back office and actually crunching out the numbers and 
making sure that the transactions are processed correctly and assessed 
correctly. They deal with very complex financial models.  Truth be told 
Chair some of them I battle to grasp at the first sense and sometime 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 151 of 154 
 
not even the third time but that is their job.  And these are people they 
are looking at complex finance structures, deal structuring etcetera so 
there is a high level of competence in this particular environment.  It is 
not you know it is um – there will be ordinarily people that are qualified 
in degrees in finance and you know in the field of corporate finance.  
So that is ordinarily what we look at.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it would be helpful if in due course we could 
just get a profile of that unit during that time when it was decided that 
it was necessary to get an outside firm to do what they could do to say 
it consisted maybe  I do not know what the numbers are but you might 
10 
not need to include everybody but the imp ortant you know people what 
their qualifications were, what experience they had at the time, how 
long they had been at Transnet and maybe even some of the big 
transactions in which they had been involved if possible.  Just to 
compare what Transnet had in terms of expertise and experience 
compared – that could have been used. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think to summarise I 
will provide that in due course Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But to give you a summary 
of some of the – the seasoned professionals that are in the Transnet 
Treasury when we commenced this process to unravel what actually 
transpired as I said in one meeting the board Chairperson made a 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 152 of 154 
 
statement to say that information at his disposal was that the 
Regiments people had infiltrated our dealing room.   Our dealing room 
is a very sacristan environment.  And what we then later found out and 
the people sat with us and said no, no, the Regiments team never came 
into the dealing room.  The dealing room just left went to Regiments 
offices.  That is the – that is essentially the summary that one of the 
traders put on the table which is – which is quite a telling statement 
that the transactions were now not being executed by Transnet they 
were being executed by a third party who had a very significant interest 
because they were getting paid literally hundreds of millions of rands.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Chair I see now it is almost five to four 
we are just about to deal with a new topic that is quite long.  We will 
not be able to finalise it even if we try.  Would this be appropriate to 
adjourn at this stage? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am jealous of the fact that it is…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I know Chair but when you come to this 
raid swops and everything it needs a far more fresher mind  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay no that is fine.  But we may have to start 
earlier tomorrow.  Now we do need to I know we talked about starting 
20 
earlier.  We need to really go back to that to try and cover as many 
witnesses as we can.  Because if we start for example at nine o’clock 
every day and finish nine o’clock instead of ten and finish at five 
o’clock instead of four that means we add two hours to the da y.  After 
five days that is ten hours. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 153 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Ten hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that means you know another witness or two 
witnesses.  But having said that I am aware of other considerations.  
So but I just want to mention that we do need to s ee what we can do 
bearing in mind that I appreciate other considerations.  With regard to 
tomorrow I would not like a situation where we finish with Mr Mahomedy 
and maybe an hour earlier and then we have to lose an hour or two 
earlier.  I do not know how long we will be with him so if there is any 
chance that if we finish  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  With him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  With [indistinct] normal with him there would be a 
witness ready that would be helpful.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We will look into that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what do you think about starting at least maybe 
half past nine tomorrow or you – Mr Mahomedy you … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It is in order Chair we can start at half 
past nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I do have – there is an unlikely possibility that 
20 
I might have to change that so I just want to mention so let us leave it 
at half past nine but if the situation that might demand my presence 
somewhere prevails then Mr Mahomedy we you will – would be advised 
and I will let you know and then we could start either at ten o’clock or a 
little later than that. 
15 MAY 2019 – DAY 93 
 
Page 154 of 154 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Just a little later yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay we will adjourn now for the day and 
then tomorrow subject to advice to the contrary or for another time we 
will start at half past nine.  We adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 16 MAY 2019
