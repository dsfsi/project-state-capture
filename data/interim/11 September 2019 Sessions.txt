PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 11 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good morning Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC: Thank you yes we are – Chair – ready 
Chair.  Chair I am not sure whether Chair would like to entertain the 
submissions on the videos now before we start this morning because Mr 
Hlaudi still wants to persist with that request.  Unfortunately he could 
not resolve it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe we should deal with them now before we 
continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With his evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chairman I let him then come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
20 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Chair we believe it is important that like we 
intimated yesterday before you that these videos ought to be played to 
assist in the evidence gathering before this commission.  As you are 
rightly aware is that Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng is here as an invited 
witness to this commission and secondly also there had been other 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 3 of 177 
 
witnesses who have implicated him their testimonies.  So in order to 
ensure that his testimony does not become assailed by mistruths and 
mis-conjectures and evidence that is not aligned with the objects and 
purpose of this commission I believe it is imperative that video 
evidence be admitted and this is also in line with the Commissions Act 
which is Section 3 of the Act.  I do not want to go and – the avenue of 
having to adduce case law before you Chair suffice to say that I think it 
is important that the videos be played and they are not very long, they 
are short videos and remember one of the … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is one that Ms Norman said is about 
10 
an hour in duration if I am not mistaken. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  No the one that is an hour duration we – I 
spoke to Ms Norman yesterday and we agree that that one we are not 
going to play but there are the shorter ones which… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Which will not take much of the time of the 
commission if those are played.  Because I believe it is important that 
they be played and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How many – how many of them are there? 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  It is about three of them I think.  Three. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And altogether would take about how much time? 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Altogether I think they will take give and 
take 25 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Chair. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 4 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talk to me about what each one of them is about? 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Okay primarily remember yesterday there 
was an issue about the letter of Marie Swanepoel about the issues of 
what she adduced in that letter pertaining to the matric certificate of Mr 
Hlaudi Motsoeneng.  And in order to corroborate his issues that indeed 
he has always been truthful and always been mindful of the fact that he 
does not have a matric certificate.  They are video recordings of 
meetings, gatherings at the SABC where people are addressed by even 
one of the former Group Executives of the HR Stakeholder that is Mr 
Keobukile Mosweu acknowledging in public that Mr Motsoeneng does 
10 
not have matric and that corroborates these issues so that that is all 
what we are trying to do is that we are trying to nail the sail to the 
mast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  In ensuring that enough evidence is before 
this commission because if we do not do that Chair we will not be doing 
this commission enough justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  That is one of the evidence. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  That is one of the – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us deal with that one.  As I – as I understand the 
20 
picture that has emerged as far as the issue of matric certificate – 
matric is concerned it is common cause that Mr Motsoeneng did not at 
any time pass matric.  So that is one.   
2.  From what he has said and from the correspondence from some of 
the correspondence that we have seen including the letter signed by Ms 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 5 of 177 
 
Swanepoel but I think there is another one that I saw last night which I 
think was not mentioned here.  Ms Swanepoel’s letter and the letter 
that I am talking about which I do not think was referred to yesterday 
make it clear that according to the authors of those letters Mr 
Motsoeneng had made it clear that he did not have matric.  Then there 
is the – there is another letter that was referred to yesterday that was 
written by somebody I forget the name which also – which also seemed 
to be consistent with that story.  Now that is not in dispute.  As I 
understand the allegation that he lied about his matric as I understand 
it the only basis that has been advanced for that or at least from what I 
10 
have heard so far.  I do not know if anything else will emerge later is 
what he wrote in the application for employment form namely where it 
says highest standard passed then he wrote Standard Ten.  And as I 
understand it that is the basis also on which the Public Protector’s 
findings seems to be based.  I may be mistaken.  It maybe it is not 
everything.  But that seems to be the position.  Now if the reason the 
basis for saying he lied is what he said in that form any video of what 
was said in a subsequent meeting does not appear to me would help 
much because what we have is he has conceded that writing that he 
had passed Standard Ten there was not true.  But he says he did it on 
20 
the advice of Ms Swanepoel and he says looking back he should not 
have accepted that advice.  And we heard all his evidence around that.  
So to the extent that the video will show me what people may have 
discussed many years in some meeting many years after the date of 
that form I do not think would help much.  Because he accepts and 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 6 of 177 
 
certainly I accept that it was not true to say he had passed Standard 
Ten.  But he simply says when you look at the fact that I wrote 
Standard Ten, I passed Standard Ten do not look at that in isolation.  
He says look at the circumstances and I am saying I was following Ms 
Swanepoel’s advice.  So that is my inclination about the – that video.  I 
do not know if you want to say anything? 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Chair have a bit of difficulty in taking to 
grasp whilst I respect your views on these issues but remember at the 
end of the day Mr Motsoeneng his character and reputation and dignity 
and integrity has been assailed not only before this commission it has 
10 
been assailed in the Public Protector’s Report.  It has been assailed in 
the Parliamentary Ad-hoc Committee Reports.  It has been assailed by 
media peddling lies about this matric issue Chair and I believe… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But remember … 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Whilst this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Yes okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am interrupting you.  I am sorry.  But remember that 
even Mr Motsoeneng at least before me he is not saying that writing in 
that form that he had passed Standard Ten was the truth.  Even he is 
20 
not saying that.  So all he is saying is I followed certain advice and that 
happened under certain circumstances and people should not just look 
at that only.  Now he is saying – he has said that yesterday here in 
public, everybody is listening including the media.  They are watching, 
they have heard it and documents have been referred to which reflect 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 7 of 177 
 
that a number of people from within the SABC say no, no, no Mr 
Motsoeneng never concealed the fact that he did not have matric.  So 
that has been ventilated.  Some of the letters have been read out here.  
So – so make – you can make your submissions but I am making these 
remarks so that as you make your submissions you can know what is 
going on in my mind and address it pertinently. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Okay.  Chair just lastly still pertaining to 
the issue of the matric.  I believe like I said the – because the videos 
they are not long or unless if – I am of the view that if you feel that 
they are going to take up the time of the commission which I 
10 
understand but if they can be received as evidence and then even when 
you as the Chair retire to make your findings you are able to relook at 
those videos and be able to come up with your own conclusion.  If that 
then can be part of also our way of assisting the commission pertaining 
to the evidence, the video evidence in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe what we should do – maybe we should not 
make any decision about what should happen to them about them now.  
Maybe I should hear the evidence maybe when I have had even all the 
evidence from everybody if then I can assess the situation.  And if I 
think that they would add value then maybe I could then say let us – let 
20 
them be shown. So maybe if it is fine with you maybe let us not deal 
with that matter now.  Let us wait until all the evidence has been led 
and then we take it from there.  Because as I speak to you it does not 
appear to me and of course I have not had other witnesses who will still 
come but it does not appear to me that anything is emerging that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 8 of 177 
 
suggests that Mr Motsoeneng was going around saying he has got 
matric.  You know.  Certainly he says I never went around saying I have 
matric and there are certain people who – who have written letters 
which seems to corroborate that already.  And maybe nobody is going 
to dispute that evidence which he has given you know.  I never went 
around saying I have matric.  On the contrary I was open from the start 
when I was approached by SABC and I said I do not have matric and 
the only thing is whether writing in that form that he had passed 
Standard Ten when one has regard to all of the circumstances is 
whether it changes the picture or not.  So maybe – maybe we should 
10 
not decide – maybe you should consider holding the application back in 
regard to that video and assess the situation later. What do you think? 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  I agree with your approach it is consonant 
with what I have also – I have been in discussion with witness.  But I 
just wanted to just an additional issue Chair is on the issue of purging 
of staff. Because remember one of the allegations is that Mr Hlaudi 
Motsoeneng was purging the staff.  In other words there was some 
derisory acts upon him that ended up in the SABC losing money as a 
result of the so called purging of staff.  And one of the videos also 
would be able to lay to rest that aspersion.  So – but like I said I am… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  I am mindful of your view and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  We can park the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can park – ja. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 9 of 177 
 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  For the videos to be examined or viewed for 
now until… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  At a later stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you have seen the videos you are in a better 
position than I am but certainly in regard to the first one those are my 
preliminary thoughts and – but it may be that when you look at those 
thoughts maybe they apply to all three but because I have not seen 
them I cannot say until you tell me this one is – the second one is 
about this, the third one is about that.  So – so – so did you think those 
10 
views might apply to all three?  The preliminary remarks that I have 
made. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Yes it does, it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They do yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  It does definitely will assist in the interest 
of Justice Ja Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is alright.  So I think then we – we 
I think we agreed that let us park them and then you can review – you 
can renew the application at a later stage when we have maybe a full 
picture. 
20 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Okay thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Motsoeneng yesterday we 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 10 of 177 
 
dealt with three policies at least that got changed during your time 
which we can – we covered.  But what I would like to know from you.  
Are you aware of The Policy And Regulatory Affairs Department within 
the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am aware? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of that – of the – of a department called 
Policy and Regulatory Affairs Department? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I am aware. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What does that department do? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Maybe through you Chair I just 
10 
want to clarify one or two issues Chair very short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  If you allow me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair I think I am here not to 
defend myself.  I am here to tell you the truth.  Whether wrong or right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am not here to come and 
defend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because the media the way 
they are reporting issues it seems as I am here to defend myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You are here Chairperson to 
hear the truth.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 11 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Your findings will come whether 
I was wrong or right that is you who will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So I just want to deal with this 
issues Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That I am concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When media report that I am 
10 
here to defend myself.  I am not defending myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am just telling the truth the 
way I understand it [indistinct] Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I am not blaming anyone 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And other point Chair is the one 
of the issue that I want to deal with especially about media 
20 
Chairperson.  I think the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  About? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Media Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think their role is to discredit 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 12 of 177 
 
me even now.  Because yesterday I spoke about me lecturing at WITS 
business school.  It is true Chairperson.  I have the documents. I will 
produce that documents.  I was invited and it does not mean that when 
I am saying I was lecturing I was employed by WITS.  Even in my 
affidavit I am able to say society – I mean it is normal Chairperson but 
they twist what I said in this commission Chairperson.  I just want to 
verify those issues because of the tweet Chairperson that came from 
someone from WITS Business School.  That tweet it is wrong 
Chairperson.  I have been invited more than three times I think at WITS 
Business School to lecture.  There is a video that demonstrates that.  
10 
Yesterday Chairperson after that tweet someone answered that tweet 
and play a video where the SABC itself play that video where I was 
lecturing at WITS.  They covered that story. It is there for everybody to 
see Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So that is why I am saying 
Chairperson the media the way they do things it is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because for them it seems as 
they are angels, we are very bad.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You know that is where I have 
problem Chairperson because we are human beings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is very important that the media should give a 
balanced – give balanced news and – and I – but I am – I am confident 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 13 of 177 
 
that even the clarification that you are giving or the elaboration where 
you say what was said that came from WITS Business School was not 
correct and that you actually have material and you say you were not 
invited just once you say it was three times and you say actually SABC 
even have or somebody has even a video. So they hopefully they will – 
you know report on that as well. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  Lastly 
Chairperson just to close the issue of visuals.  In my view Chairperson 
the journalists they argue about public interest that what they are doing 
is in the public interest.  I have a different view but by guided by the 
10 
act itself it cannot be burning school, burning clinics it is in the public 
interest.  My view is different it cannot be in the public interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  No Mr Motseoneng obviously nobody would say 
burning school is in the public interest.  But I think what you mean is 
what you are talking about is whether reporting on the burning of 
schools or showing the visuals of the burning of the school. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair I – no Chairperson I 
agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The distinguish ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But they – for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In their own minds – in their 
own view by showing these visuals is in the public interest.  That is 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 14 of 177 
 
what they argue here Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the showing of the visuals ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes they are saying it is in the 
public interest.  I am saying it is not in the public interest because it is 
also being identified by the act.  It is not.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In the public interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I just want to clarify that issue 
Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Especially you look – the role 
of SABC one of mandate is to educate.  How do you educate people 
encouraging them to burn schools or clinics Chairperson?  That is that 
in short Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I am – I have a strong suspicion that Ms 
Norman will be going there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To ask you some questions on your views in that 
regard. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  
Thank you Mr Motsoeneng I asked the question of the – what does the 
– what is the role of that Policy and Regulatory Affairs Department 
within the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Their role Chairperson is to 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 15 of 177 
 
deal with regulations within SABC including working together with 
ICASA. Even our proposal on the policies and so on during the 
consultation they will be part of that team and they will take the SABC 
views or opinions on the matter and contribute.  So they monitor the 
regulations within the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So in other words any policy that 
anyone within the SABC proposes must go through that department 
which department will then take it through to ICASA? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  Normally what we 
do Chairperson as I said yesterday we have summits at the SABC 
10 
where we will come with maybe policy or some of the issues.  So where 
we discuss all these issues and their role is after we have taken 
decision they will be able to inform ICASA on such matters.  Example 
when we are dealing with the policy when it comes to news, when it 
comes to content their role is to relate those decisions within the SABC 
to ICASA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then ICASA is to see whether 
constitutionally the policy that was being muted or is muted by whoever 
with the SABC is in line with the constitution and all the regulatory 
framework of the SABC? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now let us talk about the 90/10 
policy.  Did that policy – I call it a policy but the 90/10 directive or 
instruction did that in fact become a policy of the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  It is a policy and 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 16 of 177 
 
that policy arise from the Broadcasting Act. Because when you read 
Broadcasting Act it says that the role of SABC is to develop local 
content. Is to develop production houses but also it is to cater 11 
languages.  So when I was arguing about this local content is here 
Chairperson we are guided by a broadcasting act but also as human 
beings we want to make sure that people who benefit are South 
Africans first. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  No let us – I appreciate that but let 
us talk about this.  When you felt that the 90/10 policy must be 
developed did it go through the Department – the Policy and Regulatory 
10 
Department of the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  Reason being Chair as I 
said we have all these summit, we have ESCO meetings where the 
teams sit together.  We brief the team but also remember the police is 
the board issue.  It goes through the steps within the organisation it 
goes to the board for approval.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did it – are you aware whether it went to 
ICASA because remember when you outlined the role of that 
department you mentioned ICASA.  Did that go through to ICASA? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is the role of the – that 
20 
unit within the SABC to inform ICASA about all the decision that we are 
taking in the SABC.  I will take that they have taken to ICASA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because that is their role. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now that is one policy.  Let us talk about 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 17 of 177 
 
then the Violent Protest Policy coverage.  Did you regard that as a 
policy? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The Violence Policy is the act, 
is the law.  Is here Chairperson I think in my affidavit I also quote the 
act that you cannot glamourize such a visual it is unlawful to do that.  
We are guided by the act Chairperson.  We may be wrong Chairperson 
where I am saying that is why I was saying I am not here to defend I am 
just here to explain my understanding and what I did Chairperson.  And 
Chairperson you know people are shocked because they were thinking 
that I am coming here to defend.  To say I am not here to defend 
10 
Chairperson and I want to emphasise that.  You will decide.  I may be 
wrong I may be right that is not me to decide on the matters.  That is 
how SABC were operating and that is how we feel that we are supposed 
to do things the way we did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe I can just. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can just explain the difference between the act and 
regulations and the policy.  Now because she asked you whether the 
instruction or directive relating to not showing the visuals relating to 
20 
burning of property.  Whether that should not be shown.  Now the – you 
would find that there is the constitution of the country which deals with 
a lot of things.  Placing obligations on institutions and people and 
conferring rights on people.  Then you have got legislation, an act.  All 
of those are binding in regard to certain issues.  When they place an 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 18 of 177 
 
obligation you are – it is binding.  And where they give a right that right 
is a right that should be respected and people can go to court about it.  
And you might have regulations which are promulgated in terms of an 
act of parliament.  They deal with more details that an Act might not 
deal with and then you have got a policy.  A policy usually is - is a 
guide.  It is not rigid usually.  That is the main difference I think 
between an Act, a regulation and a policy but the policy must not be in 
conflict with legislation or with the Constitution. 
So a policy is supposed to say this is how we will normally 
deal with this kind of situation but it does not necessarily mean that 
10 
there can never be a deviation if circumstances require a deviation.  So 
- so that - that is - that is the understanding.  That is the distinction 
that I thought I might just mention. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe then you can go back to the question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so in other words the - there would be a 
difference between the policy and an Act but the two might be saying 
the same thing or - and so on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  You want to say something? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair I agree with you 100 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 19 of 177 
 
percent because my view is the policy should - which aligned any policy 
with the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson I agree with 
you 100 percent.  That is why Chairperson I am having this book … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And when we took these 
decisions I was reading this book Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Very well.  I may be wrong in 
10 
my reading … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I was guided by this book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Having then - when the 
Chair has explained to you Mr Motsoeneng how these two differ the 
instruction to people not to cover or to the journalists not to cover 
violent protests.  Now what I would like to understand did that 
instruction 
go 
through 
the 
Policy 
and 
Regulatory 
Framework 
Department so that they could assess the type of instruction that was 
20 
being given and how would it affect the existing policies and how would 
it relate to ICASA’s mandate? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson it is not the policy.  
It was a decision that we have taken at the SABC.  Myself and 
Dr Chizumba who was in charge for PBS and PCS your commercial and 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 20 of 177 
 
your public platforms.  So we discussed these issues before we 
released that press statement but we did not say they should not cover 
Chairperson because I want to clear this issue.  We did not say they 
should not cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was going to come back to that later on to say 
let us hear exactly what it - it - whether it is a policy or decision what it 
said should or should not be done. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  We - we - 
when we release a statement the statement is released by the 
spokesperson of the organisation.  I - I saw that statement saying - 
10 
talking about we are not going to show the - the people burning - what - 
building or whatever.  Burning - let me use this word burning but the 
intention of that it was people should be responsible when they report 
these issues Chairperson. 
You know because people they were having really different 
views especially media general.  I was called by a press club myself 
and Joe Thloloe.  I explained there to say look what we are saying here 
is we are saying do not show the physicality which means the 
physicality Chairperson it will be if someone just comes and burns this 
and we are - we are inside this room. 
20 
Do not show those visuals where people now are seen being 
burnt.  That was the intention Chairperson.  Even after that SABC has 
been covering such visuals.  It is just the responsibility part.  We are 
not burning anything Chairperson.  We are just saying let us be 
responsible and show that we are responsible when we deal with these 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 21 of 177 
 
issues.  It is not really burning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so are you therefore saying that if - are you 
therefore saying that that decision was not to the effect that if an SABC 
journalist is covering a protest and protesters set a building alight or a 
clinic or a school they should not show that per se.  You were simply 
saying if there is something else other than just the burning of the 
property like maybe somebody who was trying to come out of the 
building being caught in fire. 
Do not show that part.  Is - is that what - what you are saying 
the decision was about? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  The decision 
was just be responsible … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When you - you deal with these 
issues and that is not where you are instructing people do not cover the 
story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
That 
was 
not 
the 
issue 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I will allude to this 
Chairperson.  Sophie Mokoena and Nothando Maseko they were 
concerned about that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Immediately after releasing that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 22 of 177 
 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Early in the morning they 
arrived in my office … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To ask COO but what is this 
issues that you - you are talking about now.  We do not understand.  
Can you explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I explained to them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They did understand where I 
come from Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is why all the Pretoria 
riots they were covered … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  During my time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The issue is that let us be 
20 
responsible … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When we deal with these issues 
and Chair yesterday I said I have been a journalist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 23 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You know when people mobilise 
even calling us as journalists as to say you know tomorrow we are 
going to do one, two, three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was saying it is wrong … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So we as SABC including the 
journalists of SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They should not know that 
10 
because immediately when we become part of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You are not doing what you are 
supposed to do Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It has nothing to do with the 
burning as people are - are putting it Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I am on record.  I have 
explained several times … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson on those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what becomes important is to understand 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 24 of 177 
 
exactly what the ambit of the directive or decision was and to 
understand how the journalists who were supposed to comply with it 
whether it told them this is what you should not do and therefore they 
would know if I do this I will be in breach of this decision or whether it 
was difficult to say exactly what it - what it means. 
You say the - the idea was be responsible.  Now of course 
when you say be responsible the question would be what does that 
actually mean.  Now we - we have used one example which I seem to 
think you - you said you - it would fall within the decision - the ambit of 
the decision.  Namely if a building is burning and somebody was trying 
10 
to come out now is caught in the fire. 
Please do not show that part.  Did - did you say that would 
fall within what you say do not - if you are responsible you are not 
going to show that part where the person is burning? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So - so the - the question then would be how far 
- how far would this go.  When are you being responsible?  When are 
you not being responsible if the idea is not to say do not show the 
burning of property at all because of course just from observing 
publically there would be very few instances where people - properties 
20 
being burnt during a protest and - well maybe I should not say there 
will be very few but I hope there would not be too many instances 
where people are inside the - the building but what - what other 
examples could you give to say well it would have been in breach of 
that decision or in defiance of that decision if a journalist did A, B, C, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 25 of 177 
 
D? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did you not go that far in - in - (coughing) excuse 
me - clarifying it in your own mind? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No Chairperson.  The issue 
here Chairperson is where - in my affidavit I refer where the Act says 
you cannot glamorise violence.  You cannot show explicit visuals.  So I 
have clarified these issues.  What informs is the Act Chairperson 
because if we operate outside this Act it will be unlawful Chairperson.  
I do not want to say that because I am not Chairperson. 
10 
I am not in your position. You are - you have the right to say 
that but I am just saying it is - it is my understanding because I do not 
want to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your - your understanding? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  It will be 
unlawful because we are guided by the Act Chairperson because if we 
are going to do and operate outside this Act I have a serious problem 
Chairperson because this Act is not covering private media.  It is 
covering a public broadcaster Chairperson in my understanding.  So 
people they want to compete in the space equally with the private 
20 
media. 
That is where I think we have different views Chairperson and 
understanding of how we shall do - deal with these issues Chairperson.  
May - maybe Chairperson to come to - to your example that you did 
about someone going out and then someone now - the visuals show the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 26 of 177 
 
person … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Burning? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  So to be 
honest Chairperson that is not allowed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now - now that - that - I wanted confirmation 
that that situation would fall within what your decision was saying 
should not be shown and then my question was to see whether you are 
able to point out other - maybe two or three other examples of the kind 
of thing that should not be shown when you say be responsible. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson, this other is a 
10 
difficult one because publically you know there is language that you 
cannot - you - you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You cannot use.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  There - there are several … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But because I am at the public 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Platform … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Write 
another 
affidavit 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 27 of 177 
 
Chairperson what I may do because some of the issues to be honest …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Publically even myself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I do not want to deal with 
them but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  There are a few. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  Ms Norma. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  May I just refer to the - the - it is referred 
to as the Editorial Edit.  If I may just refer Chair to a bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  It is EXHIBIT CC05 to 
EXHIBIT CC16.  CC05 to CC16.  Chair I would not have asked that it be 
20 
placed before you.  I decided that maybe it is better if they are laid 
here and then every time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because they just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 28 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Five to 16.  That is why you have got a list 
of names on it.  You do not have it?

CHAIRPERSON:  Of the - the - what exhibit it is …

instruction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On - on the protest. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr - Mr Motsoeneng could you please just 
have a look whether you had sight … 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 29 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember he said he does not have to have a look. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, he does not have to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He - he remembers these things. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He can read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I said that if he does need … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If he does need then he can (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  He must just say so, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think read to him what you have … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  See what - what is contained. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  I would like you to 
turn to CC12 which is the statement of Mr Jakob Daniel Krige.  To his 
statement he attached the Labour Court judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got the Labour Court judgment in front of me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is where the edit is quoted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It quotes … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It quotes it, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It quotes it yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  At page 84. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  If I may just read 
Mr Motsoeneng what the Labour Court recorded. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 30 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but you are reading the statement issued by the 
SABC on … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On - on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On protest … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As quoted by the Labour Court in the judgment, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  By the - as quoted by the Labour Court.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair and then the Labour 
10 
Court in paragraph 8 just on page 83.  It says: 
“It is now well known that on 26 May 2016 the SABC 
issued the following news Editorial Edit known as 
the Protest Policy which stated:  SABC will no 
longer broadcast footage of destruction of public 
property during protests.  Johannesburg Thursday 
26 May 2016.  The South African Broadcasting 
Corporation (“SABC”) has noted with concern the 
recent turmoil arising from violent service delivery 
protests in various parts of the country.  The SABC 
20 
as a public broadcaster would like to condemn the 
burning of public institutions and has made a 
decision that it will not show footage of people 
burning public institutions like schools in any of its 
news bulletins with immediate effect.  We are not 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 31 of 177 
 
going to provide publicity to such actions that are 
destructive and regressive.  The SABC is cognisant 
of the fact that citizens have constitutional rights to 
protest and voice their concerns on various issues 
that they are not happy with but we also do not 
believe that destruction of property is the best way 
to voice those grievances.  These actions are 
regrettable and viewed as regressive on the 
developments made after 22 years of South Africa’s 
democracy.  Continuing to promote them might 
10 
encourage other communities to do the same.  The 
SABC would like to stress that we will continue to 
cover news without fear or favour.  We will not 
cover people who are destroying public property.  
The 
SABC 
Chief 
Operations 
Officer 
Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng stated that it is regrettable 
that these actions are disrupting many lives and as 
a responsible public institution we will not assist 
these individuals to push their agenda that seeks 
media attention.  As a public service broadcaster 
20 
we have a mandate to educate the citizens and we 
therefore have taken this bold decision to show that 
violent protests are not necessary.  We would like 
to encourage citizens to protest peacefully without 
destroying the very same institutions that are 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 32 of 177 
 
needed to restore their dignity.  The SABC would 
like to make an appeal to other South African 
broadcasters and the print media to stand in 
solidarity with the public broadcaster not to cover 
the violent protests that are on the rise and in turn 
destroying public institutions.” 
Is this the statement that you issued Mr Motsoeneng? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson it is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You know we even tried to 
10 
lobby our - our partners but they came for us but Chairperson I am still 
saying that statement demonstrates people who are responsible, people 
who are accountable on all issues that we - we - decisions that we were 
taking.  The issue there Chairperson we did not say well when you 
release statement I am just saying Chairperson because you know I 
cannot say to people go and burn. 
We are going to cover.  I was just running away from - 
because I knew that people they want - they were even calling us.  Now 
they are going to march and do - we just discouraging them but we are 
still covering those visuals when they - they go and cause the havoc 
20 
that they were - because we were still covering it Chairperson.  It is a 
responsible statement. 
I do not see any wrong about that statement Chairperson 
because we were still covering but when you do it - you know 
Chairperson even your children you - you know they can do this but 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 33 of 177 
 
there is a way that they must do it.  There is a way that you will talk to 
them and I am not saying people of South Africa are children 
Chairperson because media can say I said people are children. 
So I am not implying that.  I am just saying there is a way of - 
of talking but knowing when you do your - your work you do it 
professionally even informed by the Broadcasting Act Chairperson.  So 
I do not think that statement Chairperson really - I think it supports 
what I said earlier Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure Ms Norman has further questions for you … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On that issue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you very much Chair.  So I just 
want to understand that two of - of you within the SABC decided one 
day that thing has to stop.  It must not be covered and you issued a 
statement. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I have already 
answered that question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I said Chairperson that is 
communication that went through to media people of South Africa but 
20 
the reality we were still covering those visuals but we - we said to our - 
our people be responsible Chairperson because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They think that we then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Motsoeneng … 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 34 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the question is in effect who the people are who 
made this decision and I think Ms Norman was saying did you say it 
was two people? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are the people who made this decision if it was 
more than one? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson as the COO of the 
organisation it is my role to take such decisions.  I took that decision 
Chairperson and I stand by that decision wrong or right you will - you 
10 
will have your finding Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I think I did the right 
thing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  For SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I still stand by that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I take ownership … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson on what I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was your decision? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It was my decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 35 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I consulted Janine Matthews. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I consulted Dr Chizumba … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But we agree … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  On that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  So now this decision is taken 
10 
and you have taken full responsibility of this decision and anyone who 
differed with that decision had to be disciplined? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Not at all. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then can you explain to the Chairperson 
how come that you have the SABC eight that people that got fired that 
got suspended got charged as a result of failing to comply with that 
decision? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman I thought you - I thought you might have 
20 
questions prior to reaching that point. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I certainly do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Motsoeneng Ms Norman will not forget her 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 36 of 177 
 
question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later on she will - she will ask it again.  I do not read 
this statement that Ms Norman has just read out aloud to mean what 
you have said.  You have said the decision was not that the journalists 
should not show visuals of protesters burning property for example.  
You have said that - you said they must be responsible and we made 
that example that I raised with you to say okay. 
Were you talking about for example a building is being burnt 
during a violent protest and somebody is coming out of the building and 
10 
gets caught out in the fire and you say that part they must be sensitive 
they must not show that part and you said that would be one of the 
examples and you said there are other examples which you did not feel 
comfortable mentioning because this is a public forum. 
So my understanding of what your evidence is, is the decision 
that you took and conveyed did not say if people are showing - if 
people are burning property during protests do not show that.  Yours 
was to go beyond that if there is something else that is happening or 
that is connected with this burning or property.  My understanding of 
your evidence was correct? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is correct, ja.  Let us go back - let us go to the 
statement.  You must just say if you prefer to have it at hand now that 
we are going to it but if you are still comfortable if I just read the 
relevant portion that is fine.  Okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 37 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No Chair.  I am comfortable … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are comfortable? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I was involved also.  I 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay alright. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me - let me just read some relevant parts of - 
some parts of the statement. 
“The South African Broadcasting Corporation has 
noted with concern the recent turmoil arising from 
10 
violent service delivery protests in various parts of 
the country.” 
So the concern is turmoil arising from violent service delivery 
protests in various parts of the country.  Then it says: 
“The SABC as a public service broadcaster would 
like to condemn the burning of public institutions 
and has made a decision that it will not show 
footage of people burning public institutions like 
schools in any of its news bulletins with immediate 
effect.  We are not going to provide publicity to 
20 
such actions that are destructive and regressive.” 
Let us just take that.  That seems to me and you must tell me 
whether my reading of it is in your view incorrect.  That says we are not 
going to show visuals of the building of property during protests.  That 
is my understanding of it.  Is that your understanding as well?  Just 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 38 of 177 
 
that part.  If you say well if you read that part alone I agree but if you 
read it with the rest of something else that is said in the statement it - 
it changes the picture. 
Then we - we can go there but I just want to say if you - 
anybody who read that part would they be mistaken to say the SABC 
was saying to the public you are no longer going to see visuals of the 
burning of properties by protesters? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson my understanding 
on these matters are we release a statement Chairperson.  I agree with 
you Chair, firstly.  We - we release a statement but when you release 
10 
as an accountable and responsible person I cannot say we are going to 
- I cannot incite people.  Let me use this word.  I cannot incite people 
because if I say no we will show these visuals I will be inciting a 
community to do that same stuff that I know it is unlawful through the 
Act but also Chairperson why we release that statement people were 
calling us. 
Now they were marching to SABC because then they see Free 
State is burning Gauteng starts.  So they were saying no you have 
covered Gauteng.  You have covered that one.  You did not cover us.  
So we were just explaining to say no but this we cannot.  We were just 
20 
discouraging people but we - we knew that that is why I explained after 
Chairperson when people were asking these issues. 
I clarify I think at that point what we meant by this statement.  
It was not a malicious statement Chairperson.  We did that in good faith 
… 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 39 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To - to deal with such issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but do you - do you - do you accept - sitting 
there now as we talk and me reading this part - do you accept that it 
says what I am saying?  Namely the SABC is no longer going to show 
you - the public - it is no longer going to show you the burning of 
property by protesters? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I agree with you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I am also saying when you 
10 
go to other paragraphs where you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You spoke about people who 
march … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Peacefully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Which means we will show … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  What people are doing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
We 
were just - I 
mean 
Chairperson to be honest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I have - I think it is - it is good 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 40 of 177 
 
accountability.  I may be wrong.  I may be right.  I leave that to you 
Chairperson but that is how we - we view issues especially when 
people were starting to march to the SAB - to demand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Us to show them - especially 
Viani Chairperson.  You know what happened.  You know what 
happened library unrest and other places.  I am just giving you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Example Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
And 
I 
can 
allude 
today 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The Facebook International if I 
am correct I think someone told me this, this morning.  They also 
banned explicit visuals on the - on their platform.  I mean I am just 
saying there is background Chairperson on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  These issues, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that’s fine, I think at this stage, what I’m 
trying to establish is what anybody reading the statement would 
understand, so what the statement means.  It maybe that when you 
explained subsequently after it had been issued to certain people or to 
the media the explanation was something else, but I just want to say, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 41 of 177 
 
this is what it seems to mean but I think we have agreed that, at least 
as far as this part is concerned, that is what it said.  It said SABC will 
no longer show visuals of protestors burning property and that we can g 
forward and look at others. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chair, we agree Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We agreed on that ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I want to say Chairperson if 
you take what the Labour Court says, with due respect Chairperson, I 
think by calling it a policy it was wrong because it was a decision it was 
not a policy. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, then that was the one paragraph and it is 
at page 84 of this bundle, in the next paragraph this is what the 
statement said, 
 
“The SABC is cognisance of the fact that citizens have 
 
constitutional rights to protest and voice their concerns on 
 
various issues that they are not happy with but we also do not 
 
believe that destruction of property is the best way to voice 
 
those grievances.  These actions are regrettable and viewed 
 
as regressive of the developments made after 22 years of 
 
South Africa’s democracy, that might be fine, then the next 
20 
 
sentence, the next two sentences of that paragraph, continuing 
 
to promote them might encourage other communities to do the 
 
same.  The SABC would like to stress that we will continue to 
 
cover news without fear or favour.  We will no cover people 
 
who are destroying pubic property”, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 42 of 177 
 
 
Again we will look at other parts, just this part seems to make 
it quite clear that the SABC is not going to show the public the burning 
of property by protesters, are we agreed? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson I’m one person, if 
I’ve taken decision wrong or right I will just say my views, I don’t want 
to say I disagree or I agree with you Chairperson, we’ll come to that 
conclusion.  The statement is correct the way you are putting it 
Chairperson, yes it’s correct Chairperson I just want to elaborate, 
Chairperson, I still believe where I’m sitting now Chairperson in this 
seat that I did the correct – I was correct when I took that decision.  I 
10 
mean Chairperson when you destroy schools where our children going 
to – they are not going to be able to be in the school especially when 
we know there is unemployment, there is also shortage of resources for 
the same issues that we are dealing with educational issues 
Chairperson, so I think for me, I follow this Chairperson, I may be 
wrong but I follow what the Act says an I still believe I was correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I think – I don’t know of anybody who would 
not agree with you that the destruction of property, whether it’s public 
property or private property during protests is completely unacceptable.  
20 
I certainly agree with that part of what you are saying, it’s unacceptable 
but remember that this statement, while condemning the destruction of 
property and the burning of property during protests it says – I think we 
agreed, it says, 
 
“SABC will no longer show visuals of the burning of property”, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 43 of 177 
 
 
So there is that part but I want to look to two or other parts 
and after that you can indicate whether there is something else that 
would make you say although those paragraphs that you have read 
Chair, seem to say we are not going to show the burning of property, 
actually when you read the other parts, these other parts they change 
the picture to say the message was different okay, alright.  Now the 
third paragraph on page 84 reads, 
 
“The SABC’s Chief Operations Officer Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng 
 
stated that and it quotes, it is regrettable that these actions 
 
are disrupting many live and as a responsible public institution 
10 
 
we will not assist these individuals to push their agenda that 
 
seeks media attention. As a public service broadcaster we 
 
have a mandate to educate the citizens and we therefore have 
 
taken this bold decision to show that violent protests are not 
 
necessary. We would like to encourage citizens to protest 
 
peacefully without destroying the very same institutions that 
 
are needed to restore their dignity”. 
 
Now as I read this paragraph that I’ve just read it seems to 
simply no longer now talk about showing of visuals it simply seems to 
criticise and condemn the destruction of property, the burning of 
20 
property that this is unacceptable and as  I said as far as that is 
concerned, I don’t know of anybody who would not agree with saying 
the destruction of property and burning of property is unacceptable but 
I don’t know whether you have picked up anything from this paragraph 
that I’ve read now, which changes the message from saying we are not 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 44 of 177 
 
going, as SABC, going to show visuals of the burning of properties? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:      Chairperson it changes 
because what we are saying we are just condemning this burning of 
figures because people also should think that we are also part of South 
Africa, I am a citizen here so I will also have my own views that  will 
think that these views really, what is happening,  think even Chief 
Justice  Mogoeng Mogoeng, deputy Chief Justice he condemned this 
during the farewell of deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, he was 
even vocal than me so I don’t want to say now…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if it means anything, I can tell you that I 
10 
condemn the destruction of property and all violence that we see in our 
country at different times when there are protests, it’s unacceptable 
and it doesn’t define us, that is not who we are as South Africans so – 
and I believe that most people will agree with that, so that part is not 
controversial, I think.  So to the extent that this paragraph that I’ve just 
read, condemns the destruction of property, I think is non-contentious 
but I don’t think, and I’m giving you a chance to say something if you 
don’t agree, I don’t think it cancels what I’ve read before in the 
previous paragraphs which says as SABC we are not going to show 
visuals of the burning of properties, do you want to say anything on 
20 
that understanding on my part? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:      I’m with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    My understanding Chairperson 
is the same. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 45 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But as I said what informed that 
paragraph is because people now they were marching to the SABC, we 
were trying to find a way of discouraging them because now for them to 
burn, it was now a norm that they will rush to SABC and even demand 
that we will show the visuals.  I think we did it in goof faith but your 
understanding, Chairperson will still be my understanding but I will also 
want to justify Chairperson after Sophie and Nontando came to me I 
verified these issues Chairperson and I think Advocate Norman asked 
me about whether – if I’m correct, whether we did communicate with 
10 
staff about such decisions.  As the COO I communicate with people who 
reports to me so I’m expecting them to go and communicate with people 
to them Chairperson.  I believe that they did communicate from that 
angle Chairperson, that is my view Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   The last one Chairperson, and 
forgive me on this one because it just come into my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, is it still on the statement because I’m about to 
finish with the statement then we move on to something else. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Chairperson if I leave this one 
20 
Chairperson…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Say it ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson when my counsel 
was dealing with the issue of the – that form. What I want to clarify 
Chairperson, there is no dispute about that for that I wrote standard 10, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 46 of 177 
 
the dispute between me and Public Protector, what I’m - what I 
disagree with her is when she says I was employed at the SABC 
because I misled the SABC, that is where the dispute it.  I said she was 
wrong because I was not employed because of that form that 
I…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because of that form. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   I think -  yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you had already been employed by the time 
you filled the form? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s your point? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes that is my point 
Chairperson and I said I did not lie when I was employed, that is the 
issue, but the form Chairperson, I think we are in agreement 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes we are in agreement with that ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Sometimes I differ with my 
counsel Chairperson and he’s here to guide me and advise me 
Chairperson, and I told him Chairperson I’m not here to defend or to do 
whatever, I’m here just to tell the truth, right or wrong and he knows 
20 
Chairperson [indistinct] because he’s here Chairperson because I am in 
Court on other matters so that he can protect me on those issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Okay no that’s fine.  Just to complete the 
statement, the last part that – of the statement says, 
 
“The SABC would like to make an appeal to other South 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 47 of 177 
 
 
African broadcasters and the print media to stand in solidarity 
 
with the public broadcaster, not to cover the violent protests 
 
that are on the rise and intend destroying public institutions”, 
 
So I think I’ve now read almost the whole statement, I think 
the whole statement and I think you and I are bound to agree that the 
understanding which I’ve been talking about is correct but it may be 
that you explained – when you explained afterwards, you might have 
explained in a different way, is that correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Miss Norman do you want to take it from there? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you Chair, it’s quarter past 
eleven Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, maybe before we take the tea break – or 
maybe let’s take the tea break and then will come back.  We will take 
the tea break and resume at half past…[intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I think I have reason to increase our tea break 
let’s say twenty five to twelve, we’ll resume at twenty five to twelve, we 
adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I have taken longer because of other 
commission demands.  So I should have been back seven minutes ago.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 48 of 177 
 
I am sorry about that.  Maybe before we proceed let us finalise this part 
Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think it is an important part of – of matters 
relating to the SABC.  Relating to the decision or the statement what 
they – what I think the SABC 8 ended up calling the policy I think. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From – from what you have said I gained the 
impression and you must tell me if I am right – I gained the impression 
that you do not believe as you sit there that SABC should have made 
10 
any decision to ban the showing of visuals of the burning of properties 
during protests perse.  What you were opposed to was the SABC or 
SAB – the SABC complying with requests or demands from some people 
when they say we are going to be burning property come and show us 
burning property.  Am I correct, is my understanding correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You are correct Chair.  But also 
going back a little bit.  As I said earlier the Broadcasting Act I mean 
talks about glamourizing violence so this – all this information inform 
my decision to come to that conclusion Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But we did not really ban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson we did not 
really ban Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Am I right to think that it would have been 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 49 of 177 
 
wrong to ban the showing of visuals of anything of the burning of 
property to the protests?  Am I correct in taking that – the view that it 
would have been wrong and is that a view that you share?  The burning 
perse, the showing of visuals, burning the property. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You know Chairperson 
sometimes when you respect someone like maybe your father for 
example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Even if you disagree.  It is 
difficult.  But Chair – it is a difficult one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a difficult one. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair but let me try to 
explain Chairperson.  In my  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In your own words. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  In my view 
Chairperson it is unlawful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I mean I follow what the law 
says.  I am still saying today burning property whether private or public 
it is unlawful Chairperson I will submit that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And we agreed on that.  Ja but remember my 
question now is on the showing of the visuals of the burning of property 
during violent protests whether… 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Maybe to explain to that 
Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 50 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  For me it is the same thing 
Chair.  You show the visuals.  What are you showing?  You show the 
burning which is unlawful.  Yes Chair I will submit that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is the showing of the visuals so that the public 
can see what is wrong in our country is showing those visuals unlawful 
on your understanding? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The how Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It depends the how. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Elaborate. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  The how is 
Chair like I said you – you – let us say television this is life.  If people 
burn this building we are inside and then they show this visuals it will 
be unlawful but if someone maybe come in and you know that there are 
no people inside it is not unlawful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was [indistinct] Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Based on that I take you to mean that simply showing 
visuals of burning of property during protests on its own it is not 
20 
unlawful? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And you say you – in your own mind you 
say you were not intending through the decision that you took you were 
not intending to ban the mere showing of visuals of the burning of 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 51 of 177 
 
property as such. Is that right? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I agree with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  It was certain – when the – when the 
visuals show the burning of property in certain circumstances that is 
where the problem was as far as you are concerned when certain 
people start saying SABC come and show us we are going to burn 
property. Or when maybe there are people inside the building that is 
being burned that is the kind of situation you had a problem with. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  This is exactly what I explained 
Chairperson to Nothando Maseko and Sophie. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When they were coming to 
verify this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether you – do you want to… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just to proceed on that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much Chair.  Thank you.  
Mr Motsoeneng if somebody comes to the SABC and say please cover 
this I am going to burn a building.  That is unlawful, the act says you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 52 of 177 
 
cannot participate in an unlawful act, am I right? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So you do not need a directive for that.  A 
simple no we will not come we will not cover it would suffice? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good.  Now these – were you aware that 
these were service delivery protests? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was aware. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And these protests according to you 
and the note that you sent does not distinguish which protests must be 
10 
covered or which protests must not be covered as you have indicated to 
the Chairperson.  That you had the house how this is going to be done 
is what you were dealing with but this you would agree does not make 
that distinction? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I will disagree. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But where does it make it?  Where does it 
– where does it define the ban of violent protests that you wanted to 
actually ban? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think Chair earlier I did allude 
to the issue that people were calling us. And sometimes Chairperson I 
20 
am a citizen.  I know in the area the same so called comrades because 
they are unhappy within themselves they mobilise these people to go 
and do this issues.  Even when you ask them they will tell you.  I mean 
if you know the reality I mean that will inform you all this issues.  We 
can say protest but also we must be honest. What – what is the cause 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 53 of 177 
 
of this protest?  So some of us who deal with community daily 
sometimes we know what informs this decision Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  But then in your statement not 
only do you say you want to – not to cover violent protests but you go 
beyond that.  You identify that there are certain people who have 
agendas.  So it is not simply a statement of you saying I want to 
caution my journalists not to cover these instances but it goes beyond 
that because now you are in a situation – you actually say that we will 
not assist these individuals to push their agendas that seek media 
attention.   
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I know their agenda.  
Because they talk to me these people.  When they come Chairperson 
demanding this coverage they talk about no you have covered that one, 
that province, that province, that area. Chairperson I want to repeat in 
South Africa there are issues that we shall condemn from the onset.  
This is one of the issues that we should condemn because we cannot 
build monsters in our society.  We need Chairperson role model.  So I 
will die with this statement Chairperson and I am doing this with due 
respect Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then in your belief that you have to 
20 
condemn this I think you – you were not government.  These protests 
were not against the SABC.  These were service protests – service 
delivery protests that were directed at government and you are not 
government.  The SABC was not government at that point. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair my submission is we all 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 54 of 177 
 
citizens.  Government is us, we are government as citizens. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No but then Mr Motsoeneng I just want to 
understand.  How do you then use your powers as the COO of the 
SABC a broadcaster – how do you use those powers to deal with 
matters that affect government?  If somebody – if these people who are 
protesting because they needed water, electricity you knew that the 
SABC does not provide that.  Now there is not a single sentence in this 
statement that says there are these violent protests we urge 
government to please handle this matter or help people so that this can 
be avoided.  All you doing really is to condemn the protests and then 
10 
you say in the last sentence that the Chairperson has read to you.  The 
SABC would like to make an appeal to other broadcasters and print 
media to stand in solidarity with the Public Broadcaster not to cover the 
violent protests that are on the rise and intend destroying public 
institutions.  So you had moved away from being a broadcaster and you 
decided we are going to deal with this matter and nowhere in your 
statement do you call upon government to actually handle this matter. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I will submit I 
follow the law. This is what I will submit Chairperson and in the issue of 
– I mean it is a public broadcaster.  I do not need to ask government.  I 
20 
do not need to do that.  I mean I am public broadcaster there is 
mandating to cover government, to cover whatever that we must cover. 
So I do not need to go and tell government.  Let them take 
responsibility to deal with the issues.  That is not my issue to deal with. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  No the issue is not you telling the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 55 of 177 
 
people. The issue is you changing the mandate of the SABC to say to 
the SABC journalists do not cover violent protests. That is the issue. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I will submit Chair that 
sentence is wrong.  Because I have already explained I have never said 
they should not cover this protest.  So I will submit that I still stick on 
the issues that I referred to earlier. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let me come in at this stage.  Are you able to 
say as you sit there that to the extent that this statement that was 
issued by the SABC may be read to mean you were saying violent 
10 
protests must not be covered or may be read to mean the burning of 
property – the visuals relating to the burning of property during 
protests should not be shown it was wrong.  In other words to the 
extent that it can be read to mean that would you be able to say no, no, 
no, to that extent that it must be said to have been wrong. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson burning of 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is wrong.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is unlawful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  According to the act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Hm.  We long agreed on that you remember. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 56 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is – what I am saying is – you – remember 
you issued a statement to the public. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The public is entitled to read that statement and 
understand it what it means.  The SABC journalists themselves should 
be able to read that statement say this is what it means.  It says I must 
not do this, I must not do that, I must not do that.  Now that may or may 
not reflect what you may have intended but when they read it they 
would understand it a certain way.  Maybe subsequently there might be 
clarification which gives them a different picture I am not sure.  But let 
10 
us talk about somebody who picks it up and reads it.  So I am saying 
are you able to say insofar as this statement can be said to have said 
to the journalists do not cover the burning of property during protests 
then that part was wrong. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I will submit that in 
my understanding of that statement.  My understanding is we will cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Where the people are going to 
burn but we will not show. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Like I have already alluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The physicality of the – the 
burning because of some reasons that I will – I was talking about. 
Chairperson let me give you example.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 57 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In the past you can cover it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In the past because television 
was not live. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Currently television is live. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Which means if you cover – 
because when you cover it is just the visuals.  Maybe even the police 
10 
can come and look for those materials.  What I am saying Chairperson 
when the journalists go there they can cover it, have the records but 
not show those pictures because the act says do not glamourize 
violence.  You will show but responsibly so Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that seems to be a little different from what I 
thought we had achieved in terms of understanding and maybe 
understand – my understanding so far has been that what you are 
saying is you never intended that visuals of the – the mere visuals or 
the mere showing of visuals of the burning of property during protests 
should not be shown on television.  My understanding is that you were 
20 
saying you never intended to say that, number 1. 
2.  Your understanding of this statement is that well certain parts we 
reached as the same understanding but my understanding is that you 
were saying you never intended to say visuals of the burning of 
property should not be shown perse.  Your difficulty was other issues 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 58 of 177 
 
connected with that. 
1. If people are inside the building or if people are trying to get out 
they got caught out in the fire. 
Or if people say in advance to SABC come and show us we are going to 
burn property. That is my understanding that you were saying you were 
not intending to say visuals of the burning of property perse should not 
be shown. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson 100% I am with 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The only issue I think here is 
English.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You know Advocate want to 
catch me with something that I have already alluded to but I do – I 
understand that he is just doing her work so I do not have a problem 
with it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Almost I must stick to but I 
think it is English. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Especially not from her side 
maybe from my side Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I agree with you what you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 59 of 177 
 
are saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  So when you agree then 
with the Chairperson then it means you will agree that that sentence, 
second sentence in the second paragraph that says we will not cover 
people who are destroying public property.  If you agree then with what 
the Chairperson has put to you then it means that you are agree that 
this part of the instruction to – should not have been made.  It was – it 
was contrary to the policy of the SABC.  Because you are not talking 
about visuals you simply saying do not cover public protests where 
10 
there is destruction of property. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But Chairman I will submit that 
we shall not be selective.  We shall read the whole statement.  So by 
reading the whole statement you will come to conclusion to understand 
what I – what we meant and even after I explained it to the SABC staff 
what I meant I explain it to the public during those debates on the 
matter Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course earlier on we went through the whole of it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you remember that. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The two of us at least. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair maybe – let me 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 60 of 177 
 
move forward.  We have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no. that… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now could you just tell the Chairperson 
then if then a journalist goes out, covers the violent protests and those 
footages are shown what were the consequences? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The consequence of that I 
cannot say the consequence because there was no consequences.  
What we are saying Chairperson we just said people shall be 
responsible but if you have been given directives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Motsoeneng.  I know I am 
10 
interrupting you in the middle of a sentence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to say something to Mr Motsoeneng before 
we move to that part. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To this – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to say to the extent that you say that in 
making this decision you did not intend to ban so to speak the showing 
of visuals of the burning of property or covering the burning of property 
20 
to the extent that you say that is what your intention was.  It just seems 
to me now that you and I have gone through the statement it does not – 
it seems to me that the statement seems to say something else namely 
do not cover the burning of or property. We must not show visuals of 
the burning of property.  That is the impression I get from it.  And you 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 61 of 177 
 
know earlier on you and I went step by step to say here is my 
understanding and I think we ended up having the same understanding 
on what this says. But you did say where you explained it afterwards to 
journalists and to other people. So I just want make that point and then 
allow you to comment that it does seem that the statement might not be 
reflecting what you might – what you say you intended. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I think earlier we 
agree.  So I will submit that that agreement between me and you Chair 
still stands Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes still stands Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It stands ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I cannot move from… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes from that agreement ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  What we have agreed upon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  So you were going to 
explain what consequences were there if people failed to comply with 
20 
that directive. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No if people differ with you 
there cannot be consequence.  I mean it is normal Chairperson that 
people must differ with you.  I mean you should allow that people to 
differ with you but you have a responsibility as the accountable person 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 62 of 177 
 
but it does not mean that when people differ with you you can chase 
them away.  You cannot do that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Chair may I just take the witness to 
page 85?  This is the notice of suspension quoted in the Labour court 
judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think you can take me to page 85. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes by the way – by the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He – just tell him, read to him what you… 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What is there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he will deal with it and if he needs to look at 
anything he will say. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair at page 85 of the 
Labour Court judgment paragraph 17 the court recorded the following: 
“Three days later on 23 June 2016 Krige, Venter and 
Gqubule were called into a meeting with management 
and 
informed 
that 
they 
had 
been 
suspended.  
Disciplinary proceedings were instituted against all 
three employees and remained pending.  The 
20 
suspension notices of 23 June 2016 are identical in 
their terms and state:  Re Notice of Suspension.  It 
has come to management’s attention that you have 
allegedly refused to comply with an instruction 
pertaining to the Provisions of the SABC Editorial 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 63 of 177 
 
Policy as well as the Directive not to broadcast 
visuals/audio of the destruction of property during 
protest action and that you distance yourself from 
the 
instruction. 
 
The 
above 
alleged 
offence 
constitutes a refusal and or failure to comply with a 
reasonable 
and 
lawful 
instruction 
and 
same 
impacting negatively on the day to day broadcasting 
operations.  Please be advised that management 
regards the alleged offence as being of a serious 
nature and is furthermore resolved that the potential 
10 
of your presence at the workplace may interfere with 
the investigation into the matter therefore a decision 
was taken to suspend your services with the SABC 
with 
immediate 
effect 
pending 
institution 
of 
disciplinary action.  Your suspension is with full 
remuneration.  Please hand in your SABC access 
cards, laptops.” 
And then it goes on to tell them when the disciplinary – the further 
steps and then. 
“Yours 
faithfully 
Simon 
Thebele 
Acting 
Group 
20 
Executive News and Current Affairs.” 
The first question did Mr Simon Thebele report to you? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Maybe Chair I should explain.  
Mr Thebele was the Group Executive of news.  The direct line it is me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He reported to you? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 64 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He reported to you? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And were you aware that 
these journalists were – in whatever capacity they were holding at the 
time were suspended for having failed to comply with the directive that 
the Chair has taken you through paragraph for paragraph? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The information Chair that I got 
from SABC the information was leaking of the information of the SABC 
not the dispute between management and them.  And Chairperson I will 
10 
refer you to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry just repeat that.  I want to make sure I 
understand it. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The information that I have got 
Chairperson the disciplinary hearing it was because of the dispute that 
– no not the dispute Chair sorry not the dispute.  It was because the 
journalists they leak information.  They spoke to media when the policy 
of the SABC you are allowed to talk to media.  It was not about their 
differences when it comes to the visuals.  The issue was leaking 
information or communicating publicly so with the media.  The same 
20 
with me I communicated with media, I was chased away.  I was 
disciplined and the SABC get rid of me. The same SABC did that but 
the court rule in their favour.  So – but it was not the visuals.  It has 
nothing to do with the visuals.  But also Chairperson I can elaborate 
that really I will refer the Advocate to my affidavit and I will stand by 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 65 of 177 
 
that – my affidavit because even in that affidavit I explained I was not 
involved.  Even the finding of the court Chairperson says what I was 
supposed to do is to – is to overrule in my understanding I may use the 
wrong English but it is to overrule management on their decisions.  So I 
was not involved on the matter.  I cannot take the matter further than 
what I am saying Chairperson.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So what do you want the Chairperson to 
make of this suspension notice that it must simply be disregarded, it is 
not what you would have done or are you saying Mr Thebele did his 
own thing? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I was not involved. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Can we then move to the 
second – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you move Mr – I am sorry.  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to say something in regard to this but before I 
do that going back Mr Motsoeneng to the statement that was issued by 
the SABC relating to the decision that you made about violent protest 
and so on.  At some stage in the future somebody might stand in front 
of me there, a lawyer and say to me Chairperson do not accept what Mr 
20 
Motsoeneng said before you when he said his decision – when he said 
he did not intend to ban the showing of visuals of buildings during 
protests.  That was not the truth.  Do not take what he was saying 
because when you read the statement that he issued that is now a 
lawyer arguing before me before I write my report.   
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 66 of 177 
 
The lawyer might say this statement that was issued by the 
SABC is clear as to what was not supposed to be done.  It does not talk 
about journalists of SABC do not be party to criminality and agree when 
people say we are going to burn property.  Come and agree and come 
and show us.  It does not say anything along those lines if you read the 
statement. 
That is now a lawyer arguing to me.  He says there are clear 
statements in this you know - sentences in the statement which show 
that what was said was do not cover these protests.  Do not show the 
visuals of these protests and when you look also at the letters of 
10 
suspension of the relevant journalists it is quite clear - I just read a 
part that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman read. 
“It has come to management’s attention that you 
have allegedly refused to comply with an instruction 
pertaining to the provisions of the SABC Editorial 
Policy as well as the directive not to broadcast 
visuals/audio of the destruction of property during 
protest actions and that you distance yourself from 
20 
the 
instruction. 
 
The 
above 
alleged 
offence 
constitutes a refusal and/or failure to comply with a 
reasonable 
and 
lawful 
instruction 
and 
same 
impacting negatively on the day to day broadcasting 
operations.” 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 67 of 177 
 
So this lawyer now argues before me in some months to come 
and says make a finding that Mr Motsoeneng knows enough English to 
have understood what this statement means.  This thing that he did not 
intend to burn the showing of visuals has no basis when you look at the 
statement.  What would you say when somebody - if somebody says 
that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson let me submit to 
you - submit to you - to say to you when you read the Act it is unlawful 
except if that lawyer will be coming with - with his own law but when 
you read this Chairperson actually showing violence - glamorising 
10 
violence it is unlawful if we stick to - to the Act Chairperson.  The 
second point Chairperson I will submit that that statement it cautioned 
people about burning - what do you call it - whether building or - or 
clinics Chairperson. 
It just - it cautioned people.  I will submit that when you read 
the 
statement 
really 
I 
think 
Chairperson 
if 
my 
respected 
Advocate Norman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Submits that I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might not be her but I am just saying 
20 
somebody. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am just saying because she is 
in front of me Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 68 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
So 
I 
will 
submit 
that 
Chairperson I mean reading that statement not looking for what you are 
looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Just applying your mind … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Independently. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You will realise the importance 
of that statement but also Chairperson even after that - let us say 
people did not understand what we meant - even after that I have 
already alluded that I explained publically so and also SABC has been 
covering such protests and burning of those properties … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But responsibly so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is what I will submit Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I interrupted you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Then I am 
sure then Mr Motsoeneng you would agree that you had these 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 69 of 177 
 
journalists that were suspended and according to this judgment the 
SABC had stated that they were suspended because they did not agree 
with that policy or whatever whether you call it a policy or a directive 
and that they had - were also critical of management. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson, maybe I shall also 
say that we shall not leave the issue about the Constitutional Court 
which you are part of Chairperson.  The journalists came to you and 
you dismiss especially on the so called policy of SABC about violence.  
Maybe starting from that point Chairperson.  The Constitutional Court 
which all of us will respect dismissed those views but the Labour Court 
10 
Chairperson if I - I may put my side of the story. 
I think they went out of their way to deal with issues that they 
were not supposed to deal with because there the charges it was about 
putting SABC into disrepute by talking to media.  If has nothing to do 
with the decisions and that is why I am saying maybe when they went to 
court - Constitutional Court because when they went there they were 
trying to say the Constitutional Court shall rule that the policy of SABC 
it 
is 
unconstitutional 
which 
the 
Constitutional 
Court 
rejected 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the - you are right to say I was part of the panel 
20 
of the Constitutional Court that dealt with that matter but the - there - 
there is no recent judgment - if I recall correctly - judgment.  There was 
just an order.  I am not going to speak for the court while I am sitting 
here because I am not the court but it is - it is worth just mentioning 
what the scenario was at the time if I recall correctly. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 70 of 177 
 
The - the Labour Court had - when the Constitutional Court 
made its decision to dismiss the application to the court relating to the 
policy I think one, the - the Labour Court had pronounced on the issues 
that were dealt with in that judgment, one.  Two, I think the SABC had 
reinstated the - the SABC eight but three if I am not mistaken the SABC 
had withdrawn whether you call it the policy or the decision or the 
directive all - that is - that had happened and sometimes when - 
sometimes when the Constitutional Court dismisses an application 
without giving a full judgment sometimes it is on the basis that the 
whole thing has become academic. 
10 
I am not saying that in that case that was the reason.  I am 
saying sometimes that is what happens.  So - but I leave it at that.  
Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Yes, thank … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may - you may continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Did you Mr Motsoeneng 
on 31 May 2016 summon Mr Krige and Ms Pillay to a meeting to discuss 
matters that they were unhappy about? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I met them Chairperson but 
there is protocol within the organisation.  I informed the Head of News 
20 
the Head Radio that I - I want to meet them but just giving you 
background Chairperson.  The issue was - issue when they were 
dealing with the same issues that we - we are dealing with today 
because I said - they said no.  Now I am talking about the policy 
Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 71 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When I called them it was 
because of the policy.  They invited me for interview.  It was myself and 
Anton Heunis.  During that time after interview they said but we are not 
aware of this policy.  I remember very well.  Anton said to them no that 
policy is - even in the - you can Google it internet you will find it.  In 
the SABC you will find that the policy is there. 
That was the main reason to - to have that meeting and 
clarify the issues because it seems as management they were not 
communicating with them because when we take decisions - when at 
10 
board level or at Exco we are expecting the head of those units to 
communicate such decisions.  So that was the main purpose. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Both of them had testified before the 
Chairperson that at that meeting this is where you told them that: 
“If people do not adhere get rid of them.  We cannot 
have people who question management.  This is the 
last time we have a meeting of this kind.” 
And Mr Matthews added: 
“It is cold outside.  If you do not like it you can go.  
You have got two choices the door or the window.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before Mr Motsoeneng responds.  You must 
just say where you are reading that from. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry.  It is also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it minutes or is it something like (intervenes)? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is also quoted in the judgment Chair but 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 72 of 177 
 
both witnesses testified to it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In evidence, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But were there minutes, was there something that 
they said was recorded? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They had recorded … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That conversation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And I can just direct in their bundle where 
10 
their statements are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - I just wanted to make … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just for the record Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I just wanted Mr Motsoeneng to 
appreciate the whole context of what … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you are saying before … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He responds, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Ms Krige.  Sorry.  If I may just 
read paragraph 3 of Mr Krige’s affidavit.  I beg your pardon Chair.  
Page 3 paragraphs 9/10 and 11.  He says: 
“In 
attendance 
were 
Mr Motsoeneng, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 73 of 177 
 
Mr Jimi Matthews, 
Mr Simon Tebele, 
Mr Anton Heunis 
and 
Ms Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane 
and the spokesperson Kaizer - Mr Kaizer Kganyago.  
These meetings were formally recorded and should 
be archived in the office of the GE News.  Everyone 
was aware that the sessions were recorded.  I 
transcribed 
one 
session 
and 
my 
colleague 
Sandra De Lange also transcribed a session.  At the 
meeting Mr Motsoeneng stated we are cleaning up 
the organisation.  People are doing their own stuff.  
10 
There are many journalists outside that want to 
work for the SABC.  The environment outside is 
bad.  No person within the SABC is independent.  
The SABC is independent.  This is the new SABC.  
You must adapt to find a job elsewhere.  Editor’s 
forum 
must 
go. 
 
It 
is 
advertising 
for rival 
newspapers.  He added if people do not adhere get 
rid of them.  We cannot have people who question 
management.  This is the last time we have a 
meeting of this kind.” 
20 
Which is the portion that I read.  It is Krivani Pillay.  I beg 
your pardon Chair.  KP - KP3 - page 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I guess the first question must be whether 
Mr Motsoeneng … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Confirms that meeting. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 74 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Accepts that what is stated there as something that 
he stated is correct … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we can take it from there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I did allude earlier 
I am not here to defend or mislead the Commission.  Some of the 
issues that they are raising there it is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The only issue that - that 
everybody was aware that they were recording I was not aware that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They - they were recording.  
Maybe they were recording but I - I was - I was not aware.  I saw them 
taking notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  There is difference between 
taking notes and recording. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  So - so whatever they 
20 
have recorded is correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I cannot say it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is - it is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think … 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 75 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I can only talk about the issues 
that I know what I said in those … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think what you … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you should do to the extent that there may be 
something important out of what you read because he says … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of those things are correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He does not say everything. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those that you are interested in put to him to say can 
I take - can we take it that you did say this.  So that if he says … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is one of the correct ones then we can take it … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then we know it is recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Okay.  Did you tell them 
Mr Motsoeneng that you will clean up the organisation? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Did you also say that people were 
doing their own stuff? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you say to them that there were many 
journalists outside that wanted - that wanted work - to work for the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 76 of 177 
 
SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you tell them that the environment 
outside was bad? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you tell them that no person within the 
SABC is independent? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you tell them that the SABC is 
independent? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you tell them that this is the new 
SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you also tell them that you must adapt 
or find a job elsewhere? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I do not know that English 
Chairperson - adapt - but what I remember very well I said everyone 
shall adhere to the policy of the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Not that the adapt one.  I … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes.  That - that word … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I do not remember saying that. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Did you say that the Editor’s 
Forum must go? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And did you also say that it was - the 
Editor’s Forum is advertising for rival newspapers? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Did you say if people did not - do 
not adhere - which is what you have just said - get rid of them? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I just want to remember 
exactly what I said Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  May I …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Let me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is important, ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I will come back to - to it.  I just 
want to try to find the word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To try and remember. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Exactly what I said earlier. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I remember Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It was not a secret. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 78 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I said SABC we are going to 
transform come what - when it comes to the transformation issue.  I 
said to the SABC we are going to put the content that is in the public 
interest which is local content in South Africa and those issues I do not 
really need permission because this is what the Act says.  This is what 
the SABC will stand for. 
So I said you cannot question the obvious or question that 
you cannot do the policy.  It is like saying I cannot adhere to the law.  
It is - those issues I said.  It is public knowledge.  It is not secret.  I 
have been even publically talking about these issues Chairperson. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the one that - I think you said you do not know 
this English of adapt.  You said you do not know about that part.  Let 
me put it this way.  Did you say anything which was too the effect that 
anyone who was not prepared to adhere to this decision will have to 
find a job elsewhere or to that effect?  Do - did you say anything along 
those lines? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you remember. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think I shall give you 
20 
background because you cannot just say this without … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  A background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I said this because some of the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 79 of 177 
 
people within the SABC their mentality it was still old mentality and 
when you want to transform you must transform Chairperson and you 
cannot work with people that work against the issues that the 
corporation should achieve.  So I am not going to run away from what I 
said in those issues. 
There was background that I consider before coming to that 
conclusion.  Even myself Chairperson if I believe that these people I do 
not agree with them why should I - I stay.  I cannot work against people 
if I believe that really.  I said to them no.  If you believe that the SABC 
this direction that we are taking you are not support and you do not 
10 
agree with us what do you do. 
What is wrong if I said they must go and look other 
opportunities outside?  Yes, I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you - you - the answer is yes you said it but this is 
the context or background … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To it?  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Mr Motsoeneng you are 
aware that ICASA did find that that Protest Policy was unlawful and - on 
12 July 2016?  You are aware of that? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am aware Chair … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And I think - and in my affidavit 
Chairperson … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 80 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  As I said I know my affidavit 
and all these documents here.  I alluded to this issue Chair to say I do 
not know why they - you know media Chairperson.  Media is very 
dangerous when you just follow what they are saying because I think 
because everybody was fighting the SABC and so on.  They get in read 
their own Act in this Broadcasting Act. 
That is what says Chairperson you should not glamorise such 
visuals.  We stick to this.  They - ICASA - according to my personal 
view Chairperson as I said I am just giving my views here Chairperson.  
Actually I think Chairperson I will submit that they were wrong.  They 
10 
did not follow their own Act when it comes to that issue Chairperson.  
In any case Chairperson it was not a policy.  It was a decision. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair just - we have 
compiled a bundle of all the policies but the one that deals with the 
aspect that Mr Motsoeneng has just dealt with will be contained in 
CC35.10.  I will - we have just - that copy is a loose copy.  It is not in 
the actual bundle for - for purposes of today.  It will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC: 
 
We 
- 
we 
will 
just 
use 
these.  
Mr Motsoeneng you are aware of the policy.  You have quoted it in your 
affidavit but do you want to have (intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if it is quoted in the affidavit. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He has quoted it, yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 81 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is likely to know … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say he - he knows it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  May I just refer 
Chair to page 5?  He is referring to Regulation 3 because these are 10 
Regulations regarding the Code of Conduct for Broadcasting Service 
Licensees 
issued 
in 
terms 
of 
Section 
54 
of 
the 
Electronic 
Communications Act No. 36 of 2005 and the section that he refers to is 
- is Regulation 3 Violence and Hate Speech.  It says: 
“Broadcasting 
Service 
Licensees 
must 
not 
10 
broadcast material which, judged within context a, 
contains violence which does not play an integral 
role in developing the plot, character or theme of 
the material as a whole or sanctions, promotes or 
glamorises violence or unlawful conduct.” 
So it is not just a blanket prohibition because you have to 
look at a situation within a particular context. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson and I am not 
arguing about the law here because I am not a lawyer.  I am just saying 
my understanding as I said earlier the way I - I analyse and interpret it 
20 
for me it is unlawful to glamorise violence and when I - when I read this 
paragraph that the advocate is - is talking about I still stand with those 
views Chairperson that I was within the - the Act and I want to submit 
that the - that decision of ICASA they went against their - the Act itself 
Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 82 of 177 
 
That is my understanding.  I am not arguing about the - the 
law Chairperson.  I am just saying my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I have not had a chance to look at the Act as such 
but I did ask one of my researchers last evening to have a look at the 
Act and the report I got was that the Act itself does not seem to refer to 
glamorising and so on but that that comes from ICASA … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this - you said Ms Norman this - these are 
regulations? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes, yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  These are regulations … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Promulgated by ICASA to the extent that they are 
regulations.  For the point that you maybe wishing to make 
Mr Motsoeneng it might not make a difference whether it is the Act - it 
is in the Act or regulations as long as it is in the law because I think 
that was - that was your point. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I - I thought that the question whether or not 
your decision had anything to do with glamorising. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the word used? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Glamorising. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Glamorising? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 83 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Glamorising - glamorising violence.  I - I thought that 
that would not arise because your - I thought it would arise if your 
evidence was I said the SABC must no longer show visuals of the 
burning of property because I understood that that would be 
glamorising violence which the regulations say should not be done but 
your evidence is that you did not say visuals must not be shown. 
So it therefore seems to me that the issue of glamorising 
should not arise.  Do I misunderstand anything? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairman you - you are correct 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think the Chairperson - well in 
my reading I agree with you about what we have already agreed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But if you through Chair a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  “Contains violence 
which does not play an integral role in developing 
the plot, character or theme of the material as a 
whole 
or 
sanctions, 
promotes 
or 
glamorises 
20 
violence or unlawful conduct.” 
So Chairperson in my view all these paragraphs - in - in my 
understanding it is warning the SABC what you can do and what you 
cannot do Chairperson.  That is my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Do not promote violence.  Do not glamorise 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 84 of 177 
 
it.  Do not sanction it.  That is at least the - the paragraph b. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And the part that I think also 
integral which means … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  In - in my understanding issues 
that they do not really assist the - the country.  The way I - I interpret it 
Chair.  I may be wrong but that is my - my understanding but you are 
right Chairperson.  I think we have closed - closed the issue of 
10 
glamorising whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I would like to 
refer now to the Editorial Policies of the SABC.  That - this deals with 
the changing of reporting lines in the newsroom because according to 
the policy at page 22 Chair that policy is contained - if Chair would like 
to have reference to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it at … 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 17 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of EXHIBIT … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  EXHIBIT 18. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 85 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  CC … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  17 and 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If I may ask Chair to turn to page 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Firstly Mr Motsoeneng why was it 
necessary to have the policy changed to the effect that now news 
reported to the COO and not to the Group Chief Executive Officer? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that who the (indistinct) Editor in Chief … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Editor in Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The - the Group Chief Executive Officer in 
terms of the policy is - is the Editor in Chief.  So that changed and they 
all reported to the Chief Operations Officer. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson if I remember 
20 
correctly that policy changed in 2016 but even the previous they were 
still reporting to me.  In the past the Group Executive of News they 
were reporting directly to the GCO.  There has been changes not in 
2016 but because it is - it is a broadcasting Chairperson and the 
strategy was put the broadcasters together. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 86 of 177 
 
So that there is no (indistinct) when it comes to making sure 
that we - we generate revenue.  It is - it is that basket in - in one 
division Chairperson.  We put that together.  All the broadcasters they 
were reporting to me Chairperson and it is a strategy of the 
organisation and that strategy did work very well for SABC.  All the 
broadcasters they were reporting to me. 
 
Chairperson it can’t be submitted if the strategy change it was 
wrong because it’s just a policy it’s just how people see things, you 
may see that, no this one must report to the GCO I may say no, this 
must report to the COO, I mean to be honest you can’t hammer on such 
10 
issues because it’s just a policy it’s not even an Act, it’s how do you 
see -  I mean how do you align, how do you think SABC will do well if 
we do A, B, C, I may say to you Chairperson, in my view, and I’m not 
representing the Board on this matters, my understanding, previously 
when they were changing, I think it was during Dr Ngubane, when they 
were changing it’s because I’m a journalist, as the COO I know this 
environment of journalism.  When you put someone who doesn’t 
understand the environment of journalism it is a problem because if you 
are preferral to the person what he’s going to do, what the person know 
– I’m just saying Chairperson if – because we must go and check the 
20 
background what informs this decision Chairperson, so that I will 
submit it to you Chairperson, I don’t see anything wrong but I accept it 
Chairperson, I mean, someone can come and say this was wrong, I 
think it should happen and I come even myself to say, no this is what – 
I don’t see any problem. A person when in charge at that time we have 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 87 of 177 
 
our own view and strategy so and we will put what we believe it will 
work for the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Thloloe, when he was giving evidence here 
about his commission and his report said that the idea that the Group 
Chief Executive Officer should be the Editor in Chief, was an idea that 
was or may have been taken from the British system because there the 
Director General wold be a journalist and would have come through the 
ranks so it would make sense that the Director General should be the 
Editor in Chief and he says in their report, they recommended that, that 
should not be continued with, with SABC, in other words the Group 
10 
Chief Executive Officer should not be Editor in Chief and he gave the 
reason which seems to be similar to what you are saying.  He said 
because there’s no requirement that the Group Chief Executive Officer 
of the SABC should be a journalist, it can be somebody that is not a 
journalist and it is better that the person who has the final say on these 
matters should be somebody who – I don’t know if he said falls within 
the newsroom but I understood him to say it would be somebody who is 
– I don’t know whether it is head of news or whatever, but the point you 
are making which might be similar to what he was saying or similar to 
the motivation is that you were COO, you were a journalist so you 
20 
understood certain things about journalism and in your view it made 
better sense that you should be the Editor in Chief.  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair but not – that is my 
view but I was just alluding because when a structure is changing and 
you are affected they don’t – you are not part of such a discussion, I’m 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 88 of 177 
 
just saying maybe that is the reason why I was put there because they 
understand from the environment Chairperson.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so – but you seem to be implying that it was the 
Board that said the COO should be the Editor in Chief, is that correct, 
who’s decision was it? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson all the decisions, 
especially when you deal with policy, it’s a Board resolution it will be a 
Board resolution Chairperson.  What I don’t agree with the issue of 
Britain, Chairperson…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have misrepresented what was said here, so I 
10 
don’t want you to blame anybody 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You are correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I correct? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Okay Chairperson, my point 
Chairperson, you know I have a serious problem with people copying 
Britain and other countries and I have been very vocal to say, why 
these other countries can’t copy us, you see it’s this issue of quoting 
other people in [indistinct] and so on but no-one is quoting you.  
Chairperson this is what I’m saying, we need thinkers in South Africa 
because now Britain and us, Chairperson, we are very different so we 
20 
shall come through our own but also other countries they should follow 
us, we shall be people who are thinkers Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course to be a thinker also requires that you 
expose your thinking to other thinkers and you also get exposure to 
what other thinkers think but in the end you must make up your own 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 89 of 177 
 
mind, we agree on that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Hundred percent Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so not that you mustn’t have regard to what 
other people – what experiences other people have, you must have 
regard to that but you must also have regard to your own experiences 
as a people as a country and then decide  what is best for you in the 
situation which you are in. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    I think Chairperson the 
environment itself, it means that you are not [indistinct] what is 
happening but you apply what is going to work for you because there 
10 
are interactions between other countries and us so that one is normal 
Chairperson but we should be thinkers ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Also, so that other countries 
they can follow us, because let’s take the issue Chairperson, 
benchmarking, you know I have serious discussion with SABC to say 
but, why do you want to go outside, abroad every time for 
benchmarking, why these people they can’t use South Africa as a 
benchmark but here I’m just encouraging that, we shall be thinkers, I’m 
not saying we can’t go an engage other countries. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, maybe just for reference 
purposes in his Executive summary. Mr Thloloe at page 74 of Exhibit 
CC17.2 to 18 paragraph six, this is what he says, 
 
“Lastly the designation of the GCEO or COO as Editor in Chief 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 90 of 177 
 
 
is not appropriate for the SABC because the circumstances of 
 
the corporation are different from those of the BBC the model 
 
for the current structure”, 
 
Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I think we should deal with the responses 
you’ve dealt with the responses of Mr Kriege and Miss Pillay and I’m 
not sure if you listened to their evidence when they testified? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Partly Chair, partly I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you. Can I just take you to the 
10 
evidence of Miss Kabule and Mr Phiry…[intervenes]? 
CHAIRPERSON:     Maybe before you go there Miss Norman, just also 
to round off something that we have dealt with already.  You have said, 
Mr Motsoeneng that as far as you know and as far as you are 
concerned, the SABC journalists who were suspended and dismissed, 
their suspension and dismissal was – or was supposed to be about 
them speaking to the media about certain matters.  It was or was not 
supposed to be for their unpreparedness if that is what the case was to 
comply with a directive that they understood to mean, don’t show 
visuals of the burning of public – of property, that is what you have 
20 
said, am I right? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes now if, when one reads the notice of 
suspension and if one looks at the documentation and the evidence that 
has become before the Commission and what may still come, if one 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 91 of 177 
 
concludes that actually the letter of suspension and maybe whoever it 
is who made the decision to dismiss, I understand you to say you were 
not involved with that, if one finds that they actually dismissed them, 
not really for speaking to the media or communicating with the media 
but for their opposition to a directive or a decision that they believed 
said that they mustn’t show visuals of the burning of buildings during 
protests, is your stand that then  they should not have been dismissed 
for that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson news is a robust 
debate within news, I have been a journalist, I have been participating 
10 
[indistinct] even my bosses and myself about certain directions that I 
think it was wrong for the SABC to – like India, I’m not saying I’m right 
or wrong but that is the robust that is allowed in newsroom 
Chairperson, and I’ll tell you Chairperson because people use my name 
on certain issues and I’m saying this because if you go through the – 
my affidavit and the SABC affidavits, they confirm that I was not part 
but when Simon Tebele went to – no, no even in his affidavit but from 
the [indistinct] in Court his Advocate stand up and say, no his ration 
was from Claudi because I think they have been lobbying each other 
but that is what people have been using and my name Chairperson.  I 
20 
will never allow a situation where people are dismissed because of the 
difference amongst themselves, it’s normal in the newsroom, it’s normal 
in any environment. In any case Chairperson I’m the most person who 
has been engaging staff of the SABC, the records will show you even 
the SABC employees, they will tell you.  When they differ, which is 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 92 of 177 
 
normal, the way I do things but if you talk about consultation, trying to 
explain to them why I am taking this decisions and so on but I’m aware 
Chairperson that people use my name.  Example Chairperson, when 
Vuyo Mvoko was supposed to be dismissed Sophie Mokoena and 
Nontando rushed to me to say, hey Chief we her that you are saying 
that this person must be dismissed, I said, no I don’t know this issues 
I’m just giving one of the example.  I’m very firm Chairperson and if I 
have taken a decision I stand with my decisions and I said, no I’m not 
aware I didn’t say those issue maybe people were supposed to be 
dismissed when management they wanted to dismiss them and they go 
10 
there and use my name Chairperson and some people can allude to 
that, what I’m saying Chairperson, I will never allow such stuff to 
happen at the SABC because I know that is what journalists should do, 
debate robustly amongst themselves.  Where [indistinct] is when it 
comes to transformation Chairperson where I think we must transform 
we can’t talk forever, there Chairperson, I act. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well the may be instances where at a certain stage 
there is discussion and consultation and debates and there’s 
disagreements and there’s different views and then – but somebody 
needs to make a decision and says, I’ve heard all of you, I’ve heard all 
20 
views but now this is the decision I make.  Some of you might not like it 
but have had a discussion I’ve heard you, I don’t agree, this is the 
decision I make.  Now I assume that what you have just said does not 
detract from that, you accept that you may have that situation in any 
organisation.    
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 93 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I agree with you a hundred 
percent, that’s why I said earlier Chairperson where I took a decision 
whether wrong or right, I won’t mislead you on saying I didn’t took 
these decisions, I took these decisions I might be right or wrong you’ll 
decide that Chairperson, so someone must take decision and in my 
view I have taken popular decisions and unpopular decisions 
Chairperson.      
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes and with regard to the suspension and/or 
dismissals of the journalists you say you were not part of any decision 
to suspend or dismiss any of them, is that correct, or maybe some of 
10 
them yes but others not?   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Maybe Chairperson on the light 
note, because sometimes I’m a human being I want to just, you know 
refresh myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  On the light note Chairperson 
Simon Tebele who was the head of news before this issues happened, 
he 
came 
to 
my 
office, 
it 
was 
me, 
Anton, 
office 
manager, 
Pasha…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Anton is who? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Anton Heunis Chair, I think it 
was Mr Maguma, I was sitting we were drinking tea in the morning 
before we can start work.  He came to me and said, hey Chief, blood on 
the floor, I said hey blood on the floor, he said blood on the floor, I said 
what’s happening about blood, he said no, these people defy 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 94 of 177 
 
me…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No Chairperson he can’t say me because they report 
to him. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  He said no these people they 
defy me, I said about what, he said no Chief he discussed all the 
differences amongst themselves and then I said to him, you know how I 
operate, if you know people are not following the policy or they are 
doing stuff that they’re not supposed to do, you, you can’t come to me 
and report this issues, you must take action yourself, so you don’t 
report to me.  So you are appointed thee and you have delegation of 
10 
authority, operate within your delegation of authority because if you are 
going to cry to me I will act on you, Chairperson, that is what I said 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That is what you said to him? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes that is what I said to him, 
to say if you know, I mean you can’t come and report to me, those 
people they report to you.  So if you do wrong stuff that I believe you 
do wrong stuff I’m going to act on you.  So my disciplinary action 
Chairperson, if I was supposed to take any disciplinary action I will 
take against Simon Tebele, not those people because…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     They did not report to you. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   They did not report to me and I 
don’t see sit in those debates where they debate stories Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, so if…[intervenes]. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 95 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe – I’m sorry again Miss Norman, when I 
was reading the Labour Court judgment and it said who had filed 
affidavits on behalf of the SABC it seemed strange that it didn’t refer to 
any affidavit by you, that’s simply because of what one was reading in 
the judgment but is the reason why there was no affidavit by you to 
explain the SABC’s decisions about the SABC aid, is the reason why 
there was no affidavit from you simply because you were not part of the 
decision to suspend or dismiss them? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson you are correct 
but what is painful in that process, remember the Court says I must pay 
10 
the cost and I still believe Chairperson it was unfair because I was not 
given a time to tell my own story like I’m telling you today Chairperson 
and put my side of the story and when I checked that judgement it said, 
no but we’re supposed to stop it but even stopping that process of 
disciplinary hearing then I must explain myself but to come to 
conclusion Chairperson to say, no Hlaudi you were supposed to stop 
this you must pay the cost it is unfair and it affects my constitutional 
rights Chairperson because – that’s why I’m saying, and with due 
respect Chairperson, that is why I was saying it seems as also some of 
Judges are captured by what media says and maybe other people, they 
20 
come to conclusion, hey is that Hlaudi, I am in trouble, that is my view 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes Thank you, Miss Norman, oh I see it’s 1 
o’clock. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes it’s 1 o’clock yes thank you Chair, 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 96 of 177 
 
may we take the lunch adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well Mr Motsoeneng has been on that chair now for 
quite some time since yesterday but I think it’s important, I think the 
issues we are dealing with are important issues. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And it’s important that they be dealt with properly.  
So I think from your estimation yesterday it might have been that we 
might have been done with him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   True Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And I have intervened also to ask him quite a lot of 
10 
questions but that’s because I wanted to satisfy myself on certain 
things and to give him a chance to also clarify his position on a number 
of things.  So I think it’s nevertheless important because it relates to 
an important institution in the country as well.  So we are going to take 
the lunch adjournment, so Mr Motsoeneng I’m sorry that we haven’t – 
we’re not done yet so we’ll continue after lunch but I think that it’s in 
your interest too that these issues be dealt with properly.  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Chairperson, actually 
Chairperson I’m very glad because no-one has ever listened to my 
story.  People have taken a conclusion without me being part of their 
20 
conclusion Chairperson, I’m very happy Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you.  We’ll take the lunch adjournment 
it’s one o’clock well resume at two o’ clock, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 97 of 177 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Before we proceed 
counsel for Mr Motsoeneng has something that he wishes to raise with 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright thank you. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Good afternoon Chair.  Thank you for the 
opportunity.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  There is just some aspects which I have 
taken note of which I think we need to delve in to ensure that Mr Hlaudi 
Motsoeneng’s interests and rights are protected.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Remember earlier on in the morning I 
addressed you on the issue that he is here firstly as an invited witness 
and also secondly as an implicated person and therefore the threshold 
of his testimony is mostly persuaded by those two factors.  Given the 
fact that he is implicated the issues that need to be addressed 
20 
particularly pertaining to the solidarity judgment that the SABC 8 
judgment.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  The issues about the suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 98 of 177 
 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  And the letters firstly the notices of 
disciplinary enquiries. They are separate – there were eight different 
notices of disciplinary enquiry.  They were not all identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  I think those are the issues that need to be 
put across to him other than just the issue of the suspension letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  To assist the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  That is my address Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine but you will remember that at some 
stage when I asked him whether he played any part in the decision to 
suspend or to dismiss the journalist referred as SABC 8 I said some of 
them or – were you involved in the decision to dismiss some of them, 
suspend some of them or all of them.  It was precisely because I 
appreciated that we might well have a situation where he may have 
been involved in some and not others and I did not want you to put it as 
a blanket thing and then my understanding of his evidence is that he 
was saying he was not involved.  He did not take part in any decision to 
suspend or dismiss any of them.  That is my understanding of his 
20 
evidence.  You remember that part when I was asking him?  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Yes, yes I do recollect part Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  It is just that it is that they were – there 
kept on being to and froes surrounding the … 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 99 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Letter of suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Hence that is why I became a bit perturbed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Concerned ja. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  And anxious that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  That issue needs to be ventilated before 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Before we proceed this afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Why I am saying so because I have always 
seen a suspension as akin to an arrest.  Because when you arrest a 
person you do not normally – you might arrest them on suspicion of a 
certain offence but when you charge that person you might charge them 
with different offences. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Other than the one that you might have 
arrested him for. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  So I think those are the issues that need to 
be portrayed before this [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. If there are any letters of 
suspension or dismissals that you –you suggest the evidence leader 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 100 of 177 
 
also bring to his attention you may do so.  But it may be if he did not 
take part in the decision to suspend or dismiss it might be irrelevant. 
So – but you can just exercise, reflect on it.  If you think there is some 
importance share the information with the evidence leader. She might 
then put that to him.  If that is fine Ja. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Ja I say so Chair because there have been 
Rule 3.3 Notices pertaining to the testimony of most of those SABC 8 
with Ms Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  And then there is also Ms Pillay and… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  The [indistinct] I do not know if there are 
any who are still to testify before this forum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  But suffice to say that it is the issue of that 
they have implicated him in their affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Hence that is why I think it is important 
also. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no insofar as they implicated him I am sure the 
20 
evidence leader will put that to him and give him a chance to deal with 
it.  Of course to the extent that they may have said if that is what they 
said that he may – he was involved in the decision to suspend them or 
dismiss them he has said he was not.  Whether or not in the end that is 
what is accepted is another issue.  But I think the evidence leader will 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 101 of 177 
 
probably put that to him.  But when we – when the evidence leader is 
done you can make notes – when she is done and there are certain 
areas which you feel maybe were not touched that are important you 
can raise the issue again. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Okay.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just before lunch I was 
going to deal with those allegations by the various members of the 
SABC 3 but also Chair maybe we should with your leave I should just 
deal with the notices as they are captured in the judgment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Briefly so that then we can satisfy that 
complaint.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Chair if I may go back to 
Exhibit CC5 to 16.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Which exhibit? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The judge – Exhibit CC5 to 16 Chair where 
there is that labour court judgment.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I am still in the same place. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You still have it in front of youl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  We have – we read out the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 102 of 177 
 
one that appears at page 86 which is the Notice of Suspension and I do 
not think we should repeat it but then there is another one that where 
there is charges at page 87.  And this paragraph relates to  
“On 29 June all three employees received letters 
notifying them of the institution of disciplinary 
proceedings in the following terms: 
You are hereby notified to attend a disciplinary 
hearing to be held on Friday 1 July 2016.  Charge 1.  
Noncompliance with the duties of your contract of 
employment.  Alternatively contravention of SABC 
10 
rules and regulations in that you in your capacity as 
a reporter for radio news in Johannesburg allegedly 
liaised with the media that is the Star on 28 June 
2016 The Times 28 June 2016, ENCA letter drafted 
and signed by you and provided to ENCA and 
News24.  Letter drafted and signed by you and 
provided to ENCA without having had permission to 
do so.  In doing so it is alleged that you contravened 
Regulation 2D of the SABC’s Personnel Regulations 
that is an employee shall not without prior consent of 
20 
the Group Chief Executive make any comments in the 
media or … should these facts be proven it will 
constitute an act of noncompliance with the duties of 
your 
contract 
of 
employment 
on 
your 
part 
alternatively 
contravening 
SABC’s 
Rules 
and 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 103 of 177 
 
Regulations.  You will be entitled to the following:   
To 
be 
represented 
by 
a 
co-employee 
of 
the 
corporation or union representative who is an 
employee of the corporation should you be a member 
of a recognised trade union to call witnesses to 
testify in support of your case to cross-examine the 
employers’ 
witnesses. 
To 
have 
access 
to 
documentation that will be used by the initiator and 
to request the services of an interpreter should it be 
necessary.  The disciplinary panel will consist of 
10 
should you have any objection against any of the 
panel members or any other queries in this regard 
you are requested to contact the initiator.” 
And then there is a letter which was addressed to Mr Krige in 
paragraph 20 of the judgment.  The judge records the contents of the 
letter addressed to Mr Krige on 30 June which contained a slightly 
different charge.  It read: 
“You are herewith notified to attend a disciplinary 
hearing to be held on Friday 1 July 2016 at 9:00 at 
the SABC offices in Johannesburg in order to 
20 
investigate the following alleged offences brought 
against you. 
Charge 1:  Noncompliance with the duties of your 
contract of employment alternatively insubordination, 
alternatively insolence in that you in your capacity as 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 104 of 177 
 
the Executive Producer RSG News and Current 
Affairs during a radio news line talk meeting held on 
Monday 20 June 2016 you allegedly categorically 
distanced yourself from the instruction issued by the 
SABC Management not to cover the right to no 
movement marches in Cape Town, Durban and 
Aukland Park that is campaigning against the SABC’s 
decision not to broadcast violent protest.  Should 
these facts be proven it will constitute an act of 
noncompliance with the duties of your contract of 
10 
employment 
on 
your 
part

insubordination, 
alternatively 
insolence. 
Should

will consist of … you will entitled of the following to 
be represented by a …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think you need to… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. You do not have to read 
20 
that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Read that ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also with regard to what you have read I am not 
sure in relation to Mr Motsoeneng why it would be relevant. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 105 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because response yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think Chair so as not to be seen as if I 
was selective in the manner in which I put those.  Maybe just to deal 
with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think maybe what Mr Motsoeneng’s counsel might do 
is just make notes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of which ones he would have liked you to raise with 
him and then later on when you are done. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He will give you the note to look at. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then we can visit those areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have difficulty he can address me or I could 
allow him to re-examine Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Motsoeneng those – 
your responses to the Chairperson before lunch that you were not 
involved in any of those disciplinaries or notices or charges those that I 
read this afternoon does your answer apply to those as well? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair.  Because SABC is 
20 
guided by its own policy. There is a process before you can charge a 
person that you need to follow.  So I can only charge or discipline 
people who report directly to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So line managers according to 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 106 of 177 
 
the policy they will know whatever that they need to do to deal with that 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  May I just put before we 
deal with other matters the – the allegations against you as contained 
in the Rule 3.3 Notices that you received from some of the SABC 8 
witnesses who testified.  Chair is still at CC5 to 16.  It will be CC16.  
This is the evidence that Mr Mwaba Phiri had given before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that I meant to ask this earlier 
Mr Motsoeneng but I do not know if I have a – I had a particular reason 
not to ask it  You know quite a few times both yesterday and today you 
referred to the fact that I think you said the Act but I think we – it is the 
regulations – ICASA Regulations prohibit encouraging or glamourizing 
as it – that is the term it uses violence, is that right?  
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just in case it might be relevant what is your 
understanding of what this regulation prohibits when it says you may 
not glamourize violence in effect because that is what it says? What 
20 
would you regard as glamourizing violence in the context of a television 
station? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I think I did allude 
to the issue that South Africa including Africa Chairperson it is very 
important to have role models.  When it talks about glamourizing these 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 107 of 177 
 
visuals what the act deal with is the issue that those issues are not in 
the public interest. That is my understanding. They are not in the public 
interest.  Remember Chair we quoted that paragraph when it comes to 
– to that regulations but these regulations Chairperson you will find 
some of the issues that I am referring to in Broadcasting Act what you 
call in the SABC.  Some of them in the ICASA Regulations but in one 
act. This booklet that I was having Chairperson.  So it talks to each 
other what I am saying Chairperson.  And I want to put it again 
Chairperson as we agreed Chairperson my understanding still stick the 
same.  Yes Chairperson it does not change it what we have already 
10 
been dealing with Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see in terms of what we agreed I think we both 
would say if a television station simply shows visuals of pro – the 
burning of a building, property by protestors that does not or should not 
on its own constitute glamourizing violence.  It must mean something 
much more than that.  What it is I do not know but it could not be that 
this was meant to say a television station should not do that.  
Obviously they do it all the time and if ICASA thought that was a breach 
of the regulations action would have been taken all along.  So that 
would be my understanding of where you and I would be on this issue. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I want to submit – I 
want to say to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You see Chairperson let us just 
talk maybe generally before I can come to the point Chairperson.  We 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 108 of 177 
 
shall ask ourselves why media?  General not even SABC generally what 
you see on media is all negative stories.  No positive.  And earlier 
Chairperson you alluded to a very important issue about balancing all 
these stories.  Media is not even attempting to do that.  Their agenda is 
to make sure that they portray South Africa and certain individuals that 
they do not agree with them portrayed them in a certain way.  Also 
portray Chairperson and I am talking from my heart now.  Also portray 
us as a black people as if we are useless. Everything that we do is not 
really what we are supposed to do.  We do not know the how.  That is 
how I see media Chairperson.  Everything that they do even if you 
10 
watch television you can ask your own kids what are learning from what 
you have been watching television.  You – it is crime – it is all about 
these issues.  I am not saying people should not report about these 
issues Chairperson.  What kind of a society do we want to see 
ourselves?  So those are the issues Chairperson and I am against it 
Chairperson to push for the issue of glamourizing this violence or 
inciting those visuals it is correct.  I want to submit Chairperson to you 
it is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think what I was looking at is whether you 
are able to make any contribution to maybe a better understanding of 
20 
what the regulations have in mind as with your experience in journalism 
and in the media.  What they have in mind when they say thou shalt not 
glamourize violence because it cannot be or that is how I see it.  It 
cannot be that the mere showing – probably there must be something 
much more than the mere showing of what happened. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 109 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  My understanding Chairperson 
is you may show but it should not be a norm that every time when you 
watch television you watch just this burning of building or clinics or 
whatever.  I mean we shall try to balance the act Chairperson but not 
forgetting it. You should not show explicit visuals Chairperson that is 
my understanding.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  I am sorry I interrupted you Ms 
Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Mr Motsoeneng Mr 
Mwaba Phiri testified and he also submitted a statement to the 
10 
commission but I will just read the – summarise what he said in 
paragraph 1 – paragraph 6 at page MP – at page 2 of his statement. He 
has a sub heading that says: 
“Changes to Editorial Policy.” 
I will read on paragraph and I would like you to just comment so that 
we save time. 
“When Public Protector Thuli Madonsela released the 
report when governance and ethics fail on February 
17, 2014 the SABC newsroom was heavily shrouded 
by a fear that the main news maker Thuli would not 
20 
be allowed into the studios for any interviews.  Her 
report was negative about the SABC COO Mr Hlaudi 
Motsoeneng recommending corrective action to be 
done on him.” 
What is your response to that? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 110 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson Mr Phiri I think I 
know him when he was attending interviews applying for Group 
Executive. That is the relationship that I can I have seen him.  I have 
engaged him in that because I was one of the panels Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were part of the panel that interviewed him? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  Talking about 
the issues that he is raising – he is talking about I know nothing about 
those issues.  I know – I do not know those issues.  Even Chair I mean 
people have been talking about Hlaudi, criticing Hlaudi.  I have never 
said people should not put such a stories.  Even not the SABC that I am 
10 
in charge for.  I have never fight to say I want to be on the platform to 
respond on these issues.  So it is a non-issue from me Chairperson.  I 
do not know what informs him to say that but I deny such allegations 
Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then paragraph 7. 
“Given the fact that Mr Motsoeneng had been 
unilaterally handed reign over the SABC Editorial by 
the then Minister of Communications Ms Faith 
Muthambi and his autocratic attitude.  No SABC 
Editorial staff wanted to be in conflict with him.” 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Ai Chairperson.  How do I 
answer that?  Because I do not know.  What I know from SABC that is 
why Chairperson when my counsel was saying we should play those 
visuals I was looking to take you into the SABC exactly what is 
happening when I have been there at the SABC and what is the vibe 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 111 of 177 
 
within the SABC because these people they portray lies Chairperson.  
And I want to repeat they portray lies in this commission and outside 
because that is what – I mean in the SABC Chairperson they will tell 
you the most person who involves staff, who discuss with staff it is me.  
They were even calling me a Doctor Chairperson.  In the staff of 
careers of the SABC if you are sick they would say go to that doctor. So 
it cannot be correct Chairperson when people come and mislead the 
commission but to be honest Chairperson I think they are just creating 
vibe in my own view and I do not want to dwell with these issues 
because I do not know what he is talking about. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know which one of the witnesses but I 
recall that at least I think one it may be more than one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Said that you were feared at the SABC and you were 
very influential as I understood it.  So maybe you might say influential 
yes, feared I do not know or yes I was feared? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair I will submit to you that 
my view and their view the only test to test that is for you to view the 
visuals within SABC.  That will be the test Chairperson because I can 
say this and there they said this but what will be the test?  The test is 
20 
to go inside the SABC.  But I think even Doctor Ngubane partly he did 
respond about the relationship between me and labour including 
workers itself Chairperson.  Even today Chairperson I am not their boss 
there.  They still call me their boss.  Even today.  I mean the 
relationship – it is true Chair – no Chairperson I am very tough on the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 112 of 177 
 
decision that I have taken but it does not mean that people fear me.  
They were robust decision in the SABC where we discuss issues and 
interaction with staff itself Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So it is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But if Chairperson someone 
fear you what you going – what I am going to say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You may just hear me by 
walking here you fear me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was going to say well you might not even know 
if somebody feared – fears you.  You might not know the question is 
whether you have done anything wrong that makes them fear you?  
Sometimes people can have a certain attitude towards you not because 
you have done anything wrong but because of the way you are and so 
on.  And sometimes you have no control over or you might not have 
control over that. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair I agree.  You know as 
20 
Africans Chair I think you will know that even some people just walk in 
there [indistinct] hey Nomondo [African language].  It is just perception 
of people Chairperson to be honest as you are saying you cannot really 
say this – I mean if people fear you I do not know how because I was 
not feared at the SABC I was engaging the staff of the SABC. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 113 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  And then in 
paragraph 15 he says: 
“The 
newsroom 
was 
at 
time 
abuzz 
with 
Mr 
Motsoeneng’s close ties with President Jacob Zuma” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you might wish to raise your voice I think. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh I am sorry Chair because I am looking 
down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you are looking down. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Paragraph 15 sorry Chair.   
“The 
newsroom 
was 
at 
time 
abuzz 
with 
Mr 
Motsoeneng’s close ties with President Jacob Zuma 
and inviting a person like Mr Malema was going to be 
seen as an affront to our boss’ reputed relation with 
President Zuma.” 
Do you have any response to that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Is the same Chairperson person 
who is saying this.   
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson it is very difficult 
to respond on these issues because I have never talked to this guy on 
the Editorial issues of the SABC. So to be honest I can just deny 
Chairperson.  
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 114 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then if you may then 
move to the statement of Ms Thandeke Gqubule-Mbeki.  She says at 
paragraph 6.2 of her statement: She had headed 6.1 is Political 
Interference in the news agenda and mandate of the SABC: 
“My dismissal and that of the group known as the 
SABC 8 for their objection to the protest policy 
introduced by Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng former COO of 
the SABC in 2016 and his cohorts.  The Editorial 
Policy of 2016.” 
What is your answer to that? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson the policy of the 
SABC goes through all the processes that I have alluded to.  Your sub-
committee of the board including the approval of the board.  If you 
check the minutes of the SABC which are there in those documents you 
will realise that it went through all the processes.  It was presented in 
the board meeting by – because my job is to present at the sub-
committee.  But when it goes to the board the Chairperson of that sub-
committee or a member presents the policy.  So it has nothing to do it 
is not a Hlaudi issue it is a SABC issue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then in paragraph 14 she says: 
20 
“We visited the Inspector General of Intelligence and wrote to him 
Doctor Dintwe severally.  We were promised a report but never received 
one.  It has been over two years of correspondence with his office to no 
avail.  He however did tell us that five intelligence agents were sent 
and deployed at the SABC at the request of Mr Motsoeneng.” 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 115 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson with due respect 
that paragraph is misleading.  I know about the matter and I have 
alluded it into my affidavit that it is true that they were called because 
SABC it is a national key point but the person wrote a letter it was the 
Chairperson of the Board Professor Maguvhe because when it comes to 
security agents there is a process. 
They do not just do - staff cannot go there to say hey this is 
what I want you to do.  There are protocols that they must follow but 
they came.  Reason being as a national key point but the person who 
wrote it was Professor Maguvhe.  It is true that they interacted with me 
10 
and other senior managers within SABC to get more information about 
the vetting issue example. 
How do - how do we deal with vetting issue?  The private 
companies that are working at the SABC whether they are vetted and 
by who.  Chairperson those were - were issues.  Nothing wrong about 
such issues Chairperson.  They were there but I cannot talk on - I 
cannot talk.  They should talk themselves.  Even their findings about all 
those issues.  I am just clarifying this point Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair and then I move 
onto Mr Jakob Krige.  His statement is CC12.  He in paragraph 14.4 he 
20 
recorded that at a meeting that you held with him when you introduced 
this decision he - he queried it and wanted to know whether any 
research had been done before you took the decision and your 
response was I do not believe in research. 
You must defend the organisation.  No journalist is 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 116 of 177 
 
independent.  The COO has the final responsibility for news. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That question was not about the 
- it was not a policy issue Chairperson.  The issue of that program 
which happened even before democracy and you shall ask yourself why 
do you have a program that has been running since - before 1995.  It is 
still even running currently.  In the - in the SABC we always change the 
programs but this one it has never changed. 
So we must change that program because Chairperson and 
the person who is talking there if - if I remember well he was in charge 
for RSG and I have been vocal publically so about that radio station to 
10 
say it seems as this station it is an island operating outside SABC and 
Chairperson I can tell you I do not know Afrikaans but I was informed 
by Jimi Matthews and other people who listened to that program to say 
but there is a problem here. 
If you do not listen to this RSG we are going to have serious 
problems because it seems as they are not part of South Africa.  They - 
they push certain agendas.  Remember there is those guys in the 
Northern Cape where they are saying they have their own land.  So 
RSG I said we must stick and monitor them and get involved.  So my - 
my issue when it comes to that issue it has been informed by 
20 
information that I have got from senior management just - not just 
people outside including senior management to say watch the space 
there about that program Chairperson because I do not know Afrikaans. 
I use the information that I have got from people but 
Chairperson the issue here is people are fighting for editor’s forum.  I 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 117 of 177 
 
think they call it - if I am correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They call the - the program 
Editor’s … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Forum. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Forum.  My view was this 
program you cannot advertise newspapers and also Chairperson it is 
informed by what I have been saying to journalists of the SABC.  I said 
to them I want to see journalists of the SABC being on the street, being 
with news - newsmakers.  You shall not follow the newspapers.  Though 
10 
newspapers they shall follow the SABC. 
Even the analysts Chairperson I said why do you prefer 
mostly analysts from outside and I am not saying they shall not talk to 
analysts from outside but I am saying you also have people inside 
SABC who are capable to deal with these issues and when it comes to 
this issue of analysts Chairperson I said you cannot use one voice. 
I said no I - I disagree and I am not going to allow you to use 
one voice.  You wake up in the morning.  Every day is one person who 
is analysing and I said I want a woman in those programs and it did 
happen Chairperson.  Women were appointed as analysts in those 
20 
programs but this program Chairperson I still believe we could not allow 
a program. 
Why is this program untouchable when other programs have 
been changing Chairperson?  Sometimes Chairperson in broadcasting 
you may have even change the program that is doing well believing that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 118 of 177 
 
what you are going to put is going to take even higher audience rather 
than that program.  So it has other history that program Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I know maybe just to deal with 
the issue of newspapers because they referred to SAFM.  There 
Chairperson I said my problem with these newspapers you promote 
them every day in our platform but they do not promote us in their own 
platform.  So we cannot advertise for them.  That is where row-row 
Chairperson - I can hear people Chairperson.  I say row-row. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Is it not his name? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now what is - what is row-row? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Row-row is like chaos. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is like chaos Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes row-row is like … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can see how bad I am with - with certain … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It is like chaos because this - 
these journalist - these people they were fighting for these newspapers 
to be promoted.  They even went and had - and Chairperson I am not a 
racist - to mobilise other White people to oppose this decision but I 
could not allow the situation where you have a program that has been 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 119 of 177 
 
there before 1995.  I mean all the programs has changed. 
Everything has changed at the SABC why you have this RSG 
operating as if it is an island.  You can see Chairperson even yourself 
people when they were talking - when they were here.  We must also 
check the background of the people.  What they stand for?  What 
agenda they are pushing within the organisation.  We are a public 
broadcaster. 
Everyone shall align to what we are saying Chairperson and 
that is not like dictating … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To people but I am accountable.  
I must account. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and the he says at paragraph 16.1 
that at a pre-election workshop that you all attended this is what you 
said. 
“The SABC is independent.  No individual is 
independent. 
 
There 
is 
an 
agenda 
for 
the 
corporation driven by three directors, the CEO, 
COO and CFO.  Do not focus on negative stories.  
Important that you balance stories.  Tell human 
20 
stories. 
 
Is 
politicians 
not 
human 
beings?  
Reporters at SABC do not want the world.  When 
they report they mislead listeners.  Go to America 
there is poverty.  They do not show it.  They do not 
show when the soldiers die.  I will take you to the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 120 of 177 
 
BRICS countries.  We can go to a hotel.  You will 
see South Africa is better.  Look at your Editorial 
Policy.  We have removed news and replaced with 
content.  If you as SABC mess up the organisation 
you mess up your life.  I am in charge.  News is 
now part of operations.  We change the world.  We 
must have news with content.  I am in charge.  You 
must adhere to my instruction.  President Zuma is 
the President of the country.  I do not regard him as 
ANC.  You cannot treat him the same.  We will give 
10 
him more time and you can question everyone 
Mantashe et al except our President.  We need to 
respect him especially you SABC.  I expected you 
to align you with my instruction.” 
Did you say that or do you recall saying that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson what advocate is 
reading - Advocate Norman - is correct.  When it comes - I think what is 
key there Chairperson if you - you listen it is - I said balance which all 
of us I think we are - we are in agreement and I want to clarify 
Chairperson that I know President Zuma but he is not my friend.  So I 
20 
am not close to him like people saying I am close to President Zuma. 
I - I now him Chairperson and I have been in struggle 
Chairperson.  Some people they will never - they do not know this 
because I do not brag about it but mine behind the scene Chairperson.  
That is why people they do not know about these issues.  So 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 121 of 177 
 
Chairperson when it comes to President Zuma I follow this Act not him 
any individual. 
There were times where media and SABC generally they were 
calling him names on live programs.  I said to them whether you like 
President Zuma or you do not like him he is the President of the 
country but even if you do not like him mind your language.  It is very 
important.  Respect him as the President.  I will say the same to you 
Deputy Chief Justice if the people use wrong language. 
I will say do not use this language.  It is not acceptable and I 
am on record even on the public platforms Chairperson dealing with the 
10 
issue of the language and dealing with the issue Chair I know advocate 
did not put this question to me about - during the - the workshop - 
elections workshop.  I said to them you see you must make sure that 
there is difference between the President of the country and the 
President of the ANC. 
There is a difference Chairperson.  When you - you deal with 
your own ANC issues in Lithuli House now that head is ANC but when 
you deal with the country you are the President of the country.  This is 
what I - I was saying to - at workshop but the issue there Chairperson I 
said to them the President of the country he must account to the public 
20 
because people are raising issues because we are going for elections. 
They are not asking ANC.  They raising the issues about 
Government.  The same service delivery.  I said he must be given more 
time on those issues to explain and not because it is Zuma.  Even when 
I was Executive Producer during President Thabo Mbeki I did the same 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 122 of 177 
 
thing 
Chairperson. 
 
Even 
when 
I 
was 
journalist 
during 
President Mandela. 
I did the same thing.  Let them explain.  So I am the 
President of the African Content Movement today Chairperson.  I still 
accept that.  I cannot get time equally so with President Ramaphosa 
even now.  I still accept that.  So that was the issue Chairperson to say 
separate ANC issues and Government issues and I even made an 
example with the same people of the ANC the former Secretary General 
Minister Gwede Mantashe including President Zuma and said but 
equally remember this one is representing the country. 
10 
You cannot give them equal time Chairperson.  Nothing wrong 
about it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then Ms Krivani Pillay from 
paragraphs 15 to 18.  I will just summarise what she said because you 
have touched upon the Editor’s Forum.  That you removed a program 
that had been there since 1994 and she - she allege - alleged that you 
did that unilaterally and by doing so she says you silenced the diversity 
of views. 
 
You have already touched on this slightly but could you just 
directly respond to it? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Now by cancelling the program 
that I believe it has been pushing apartheid views on the SABC.  It 
cannot be compared by me silencing views.  In any case Chairperson 
just to demonstrate I said to the SABC people and I make an example.  
I said if the Minister is going to unveil the houses - building of the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 123 of 177 
 
houses that project. 
There are stories within people.  You go and interview them.  
The voices of the people.  This is what the Broadcasting Act says.  I 
said (indistinct) but go and make sure that you do and you talk to 
people.  It can be - I was making sure that I silenced the views of 
people.  I am the most person Chairperson.  When you talk about 
content that is what I stand for. 
The voice of ordinary citizens of South Africa.  That is 
misleading. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Maybe if you could just go 
10 
back to your statement now.  Sorry we have not being there … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Earlier today but it is CC30. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I am comfortable … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You are comfortable, alright. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Advocate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because I would not want you to say I had 
skipped - I have marked most of your evidence that you have given 
goes right up to - I will tell you now.  Sorry Chair.  If I may just take 
him … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are - are you done with putting to him what 
some of the witnesses said? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The versions, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  While you are looking for where you will 
continue from … 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 124 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Where we left off from yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To mention this Mr Motsoeneng which I have - which I 
have just seen in - in the booklet that is titled SABC Editorial Policies. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 13 of that document and it is at page 30 in 
the bundle. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  EXHIBIT CC17 to … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  17 and 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To CC18 in relation to - we go back to the issue of 
visuals for violence and so on.  It says here: 
“In addition to the requirements of the Code the 
SABC’s policy on violence is as follows.” 
And then it has got bullet points.  I will not read all of them 
but I will read two.  The first one from the top and the second one from 
the bottom.  The first one from the top says - in other words it says: 
“The SABC’s policy on violence is …” 
Bullet point one: 
20 
“To broadcast programs or scenes containing 
images of violence if they are needed in order to 
portray legitimate information or context.” 
I thought I would just mention that this is something that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 125 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We did not touch on it but it seems that it would be - 
we did not quote it before but it seems that it is something that should 
be taken into account together with whatever we dealt with earlier 
about … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The policy. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Can I - with due … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to say something? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Respect Chair.  Can I ask you 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Again to repeat what is there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It says - this is like in - in bold. 
“In addition to the requirements of the Code the 
SABC’s policy on violence is as follows.” 
Bullet point one: 
“To broadcast programs or scenes containing 
images of violence if they are needed in order to 
portray legitimate information or context.” 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You are reading from the policy 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 126 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Of the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think Chair the policy cannot 
override … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
I 
would 
that 
submit 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That is why my decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sometimes I will not follow the - 
the policy because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  That policy is not aligned … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  With the Act Chairperson and 
before I forget Chairperson although it is not relevant to the issues that 
you … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I just need to deal with the 
policy generally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
We 
- 
within 
the 
SABC 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 127 of 177 
 
Chairperson.  The problem within the SABC Chairperson why we have 
been having all these other problems is our policy is not even aligned 
with the business of the SABC because even when you are talking 
about advertising post Chairperson and so you alluded to the issue that 
there must be a policy guided whether the advert … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And the appointments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But most of the SABC policies 
Chairperson … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But which we dealt with when i 
was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  It was to align the policy to talk 
to business.  One example Chairperson the policy will say you need 
three quotations to - to acquire the rights from FIFA.  How many FIFA’s 
did we have?  There is only one.  So you cannot have three quotations.  
I am just giving example and demonstrating that the policy of SABC it 
must be aligned with its own business and I know that is informed by 
20 
Treasury Regulations Chairperson and I was saying to the SABC in this 
- matters like this we need exemption from Treasury because you 
cannot get three quotations and if you do not get three quotations it is 
irregular because that is what your policy says.  So those are - are just 
issues Chairperson that I was … 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 128 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Saying the - the policy of SAB it 
should be aligned … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  With the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you see I think you seem to assume that what the 
policy says here which I have read is necessarily in conflict with what 
we read earlier on.  Saying do not (intervenes). 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Glamorise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do not glamorise … 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Violence.  It does not seem to me that it is 
necessarily in conflict because this one does not say you may 
broadcast scenes containing images of violence as you like.  It does 
not say you can do that willy-nilly. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says: 
“It should be broadcast if or they should be 
broadcast those scenes of violence if they are 
needed in order to portray legitimate information 
20 
and context.” 
So it might not say exactly the same thing but it is not 
necessarily I think in conflict because what … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What this says it seems to emphasise that there must 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 129 of 177 
 
be some legitimacy in the information you want to put up out there or 
the context. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair I agree with - I agree 
with you Chair but not the unlawful one.  As the Act says Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Like you were saying earlier 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Where you were saying - I was 
talking about the physicality … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Of those visuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think it will talk to such issue 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but remember we made the distinction between 
the fact that all of us - many people will say there should be no 
destruction of property.  There should be no burning of property 
20 
because that is unlawful. 
There should be no debate about that and then the only thing 
we are looking at is, is there a time when it is unlawful or contrary to 
the policy of the SABC or the regulations to show visuals of the burning 
of property and destruction of property and what we looked at earlier on 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 130 of 177 
 
in - in terms of the Regulations of ICASA was saying it is not allowed to 
glamorise violence and you remember earlier on we talked about what 
your understanding is of - of that and this says now the policy of the 
SABC is that scenes of violence maybe broadcast but there is a 
condition to it that is if they are needed in order to portray legitimate 
information and context. 
So - so I am simply saying maybe as you listen to it you 
might take the view that it is in conflict with the - the prohibition that 
we talked about earlier which says do not glamorise but it does not 
appear to me that it is necessarily in conflict.  They might all be going 
10 
the same direction but maybe one goes further than the other. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think Chair I will submit that it 
also talks to my issue about what kind of visuals because everything 
that you do it shall be in the public interest Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  There is 
just a few paragraphs in some of the pages and I will mention those 
paragraphs which we did - we have not just upon.  For instance there is 
your evidence at page 9 of your statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  You are back to his statement. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Back to the statement Chair.  CC30 - 3-0 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  I think I need to get this out of the way … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 131 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page of his …? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  CC30 Chair page 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 9? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC: 
 
You 
deal 
in 
those 
paragraphs 
Mr Motsoeneng 
with 
your 
own 
disciplinary 
hearing 
before 
Advocate Etling as you say and then you mention a few employees that 
when you deal with the allegation that you had purged some staff 
10 
members within the SABC and then the first person that you deal with 
is Mr Diphoko.  What - what do you say about that in reference - sorry - 
to the Public Protector’s Report? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson I want to repeat 
again I - I do not understand the findings of the Public Protector 
because Montlenyane Diphoko Chairperson when I was in discipline 
and the Public Protector directing SABC to discipline me which they did 
it was only turned by the court.  Montlenyane Diphoko came to the 
disciplinary hearing under oath publically so and said I am shocked. 
I have never been in that Office of the Public Protector.  I 
20 
have never been interviewed by the Public Protector.  I am not the one 
who said Hlaudi purged me because he has never purged me.  I think I 
do not want to take it long Chairperson because the testimony is there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 132 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And Montlenyane Chairperson 
is just one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Most of them they said no they 
have never been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and - and you also dealt with Mr - is it 
10 
Mr Bernard Koma? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to mention something. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think there are at least two areas where 
Mr Motsoeneng in sentences used two negatives with the result that I 
think what was said is not what he intended to say but … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This - this happens and it is not about English.  I hear 
a lot of people speaking isiZulu and they put two negatives.  They - and 
it does not work. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in paragraph 32 he says: 
“In the said inquiry Montlenyane Diphoko attributed 
his departure from the SABC to Mr Phil Molefe and 
he - he vehemently denied that I never - I was 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 133 of 177 
 
never involved in his purging.” 
So it is two negatives … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think what you mean is he said … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were never involved but when you say … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The way it reads. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He denied … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I was never involved.  It means you say he 
10 
denied that you were not involved.  Meaning he said you were involved 
but as I say … 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It happens in - even in isiZulu.  I hear a lot of people 
and they - it goes where they do not understand.  They - they think 
have said the right thing but it is two negatives. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even in news in isiZulu.  You listen you say okay or 
eve when people are just speaking they combine two negatives. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know what they are trying to say but they are not 
saying the right thing … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think you meant he said that you were not 
involved. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 134 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think the other one is in - on paragraph 36 
where you said: 
“Bernard Koma also disputed that I never purged 
him.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you meant he disputed that you purged him 
because he said … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not involved in purging him. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I have skipped 
just a few pages before that.  Pages 5, six, seven, eight because they 
deal with MultiChoice.  So I would rather deal with that last - with your 
leave.  Thank you and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At paragraph 39 - 39 and 40 there you - oh 
sorry.  (Intervenes). 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, yes Chair.  So- sorry 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 135 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chair, sorry Chair, 
Chairperson I think this is the opportunity to me to clarify issues, I want 
to elaborate on this issue of purging. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of purging? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes, staff of the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Because it’s the creation of 
the public protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     But the truth Chairperson I 
10 
have submitted even the resolutions of the Board and all – and I was 
not even involved Chairperson, I have given those matters in my 
affidavit and I attach such resolutions, and those people Chairperson 
they did not complain about me, their affidavits will explain that, so 
that’s why Chairperson I am saying I think this Commission is very 
important, for all of us in South Africa, because some of us who had 
been punished I think they can even kill us but for no reasons 
Chairperson, when it is not true, because Public Protector Officer 
Chairperson is a very critical and important for all of us, but when a 
Public Protector come with such decisions and we are punished before 
20 
she is a Public Protector her view stands.  Chairperson it should not be 
allowed, because it pains us, because reality is Chairperson the 
affidavits are there, people are saying we have never been asked, but 
you should ask yourself Chairperson why the Public Protector came 
with such a remedial action to destroy our lives and destroy our 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 136 of 177 
 
children’s lives.  I think it is unfair Chairperson. 
 
I just want to comment on this issue Chairperson because even 
the SIU Chairperson, I am in court today with them, and I am saying 
Chairperson they have tarnished my name, tainted my name, not even 
doing investigation, using the Public Protector’s report, which is wrong 
Chairperson because the money that they are claiming they are not 
going to win that Chairperson because there we know what happened.  
The resolutions of the Board even people who were not there but they 
are 
abusing 
their 
power 
and 
abusing 
the 
taxpayer’s 
money.  
Chairperson we must deal with these issues Chairperson, the reason 
10 
why Chairperson I don’t even want to defend, even if my issues were 
they wrong or right, it is just that we must tell the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   And the truth must prevail 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  And again you qualify that the Public 
Protector you refer to is the previous Public Protector? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Chairperson thank you very 
much, yes, I don’t want to be in trouble here, it is the previous one 
Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing) you mean you are in trouble enough with 
the previous one, you don’t want to be in trouble with this one. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Chairperson I am very careful 
these days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing) okay. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 137 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  Then in paragraph 39 
and 40 you emphasize the point that the SABC 8 they were charged for 
misconduct mostly for bringing the SABC into disrepute by your 
superior and not you, and even the Court could not find your 
involvement, that’s what you say in paragraph 39. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Okay, and then in paragraph 40 you say 
the so-called SABC 8 was charged for talking to the media without 
permission.  What is amazing is that the Court had ordered SABC to 
take them back but in my case I was dismissed for the same reason. 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, then in paragraph 42 this is where 
now you deal with the violent protests policy, from paragraph 42 we 
have dealt with this extensively with the Chairperson and I am not sure 
whether you want to add anything more but those three pages they deal 
with that issue, except for paragraph 49 where your complaint seems to 
be different because now it is directed at the SCA judges, I don’t know 
whether you want to deal with that but Chair we did alert Justice Navsa 
to this paragraph telephonically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Chairperson with due respect 
to Chairperson I believe that Judge Navsa went beyond the facts in 
front of him, but there were other judges, I am just saying, because he 
is the one who has written judgment, by tarnishing me about the issue 
of matric, in my view he was influencing the decision that the Court has 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 138 of 177 
 
already taken that I must go for disciplinary hearing, because if you are 
a judge, especially from the Supreme Court of Appeal, you make such a 
comment the Chairperson of that hearing can unfairly dismiss me, not 
because of the facts that I am presenting in front of him, because he 
has been influenced by the command of the Judge and with due respect 
Chairperson I respect the Courts, but I believe the judges are human 
beings, they also make errors like all of us in their work, but I am 
saying Chairperson it is unfair, the proof today is what I have presented 
in this forum Chairperson and I respect the judges Chairperson, even I 
have been dismissed Chairperson, during my disciplinary hearing 
10 
because one of the charges was I said the judge that was dealing with 
the SABC8 in my view he was conflicted, which is true I said that, but 
that information I was given by the lawyer of the SABC to say the Judge 
was conflicted and at that time Chairperson I was voluntarily taking 
leave because of the Court decisions, I was called by the SABC and the 
legal team to come and give affidavit, because now I was – I don’t know 
legally they were joining for the cost when I was not part of that.  I hear 
that message and then in the press conference I said this is what I 
heard from the SABC that the Judge was conflicted but I did not 
mention the Judge by name, I did not even know this Judge by name, I 
20 
just said if it is true that the Judge was conflicted because the wife was 
working for a firm and that – the Judge was supposed to declare that 
my wife is working for this firm. 
 
It is the same issue where during the interviews of Chief 
Justice Moegeng Moegeng people who were doing interviews, some of 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 139 of 177 
 
them they attack  him why he did not declare about his wife when the 
wife was appearing in front of him, so it is painful Chairperson, I have 
been killed, and I want to use this word Chairperson, by some of the 
judges because of their comments and other people portray me as a 
(indistinct) Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you.   Then in paragraphs 52 to 56 
I think you’ve summarised that by saying that some of these things 
against you are not true, and then you mentioned in paragraph 57 and I 
must mention to you Mr Motsoeneng I put this paragraph, I read it out 
10 
to Dr Ngubani and what you said in paragraph 57: 
“All SABC Board chairpersons, Dr Ngubani, Prof Maguvhe, and 
Ms Ellen Tshabalala were given a mandate to get rid of me as I 
was a stumbling block for the Board members who wanted to 
eat.” 
But what I did not put and I see now when I read this last night that 
paragraph 58: 
“They refused to take political instructions for my removal and 
they were a target as well Chairpersons, the minutes of the 
SABC will confirm what I am saying.” 
20 
Now who gave this mandate and could you explain to the Chairperson 
what was this mandate all about? 
MR 
HLAUDI 
GEORGE 
MOTSOENENG: 
 
 
Chairperson 
maybe 
Chairperson Ngubani, the former (indistinct) I mean is normal, 
sometimes you forget these issues, maybe he is protecting the African 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 140 of 177 
 
National Congress because he is a member of the ANC, now I have 
moved away, so sometimes it is understandable, but after what the 
Chair said in this Commission I did call him Chairperson to remind him 
about the pressure that I was supposed to be removed.   
 
Actually he is the one who has been defending me publicly so I 
mean it will attest to the issue that I was correct but I think it is just 
that he forget about that issue, but also Chairperson in the minutes of 
the Board meetings if we receive those Board meetings, the former 
Chairperson, Ellen Tshabalala came into a board meeting, he was 
called by politicians, the mandate, the first mandate was to get rid of 
10 
Hlaudi, he spoke about that issue in a board meeting, so all of them 
including Professor Maguvhe Chairperson they didn’t budge to that 
political pressure or any influence from outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I have seen some minutes of some SABC board 
meetings here, but the ones that you are talking about are they here, I 
see Ms Norman shakes her head that they are not here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   No I have not seen them Chair, because I 
deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you be able to give the legal team of the 
Commission such information as would enable them to go to the – to 
20 
SABC and say we want minutes of the Board meetings of the following 
dates, because you think those would be the dates where those would 
be reflected? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     I think there are two ways 
Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 141 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Because on record, on the 
minutes of the SABC the person who spoke about the issue in the board 
meeting it was the former Chairperson, Ellen Tshabalala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   It is recorded, the second point 
will be the minutes are there or former Chairperson Ellen Tshabalala 
she can be called to come and deal with such issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no it’s one thing to call her but I am more 
interested for present purposes whether there might be minutes that 
10 
reflect that discussion or if it is not minutes, I don’t know if it was 
meetings would have been mechanically recorded, as far as you know 
would that be minutes that might reflect that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is it possible that that part might not have been 
minuted? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     No, if my memory serves me 
well Chairperson there are minutes on record dealing with that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     And – but you know minutes 
20 
Chairperson it does not give you everything, because minutes you just 
summarise the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   I think I can say minutes, if 
they are not there in the minutes the – we shall get transcripts, yes it 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 142 of 177 
 
will be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, oh the meetings of the Board would, there 
would be transcripts available? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so maybe if you can then later on either directly 
to the Commission or through your legal representatives just indicate to 
the legal team of the Commission that it would be minutes of meetings 
that were held between whatever date and whatever date, if you don’t 
remember the exact dates of those meetings, so that when the SABC is 
approached they will be able to say look for minutes that fall between 
10 
this date and that date. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Maybe just to elaborate 
Chairperson the reason why Mr (indistinct) said I warn the ANC is 
testimony to what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes because that is where 
even Ellen Tshabalala said no but when we are here we are all 
members of the ANC but me I am here to do what I am supposed to do 
which is the right thing and I must protect, not Hlaudi, all the 
employees of the SABC. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm, okay, alright, so if that can be followed 
up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes thank you Chair.  Just for record 
purposes in paragraph 7 and 62 of Mr Motsoeneng’s affidavit he 
mentions 
certain 
information 
that 
he 
has 
requested 
from 
the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 143 of 177 
 
investigators of the Commission, but it is not stated what information 
he did not get, or did not receive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    I think we also were given thousands of 
documentation by the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    It is difficult without narrowing it down 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Some indication ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Some indication as to exactly what – that 
10 
he is looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think even provide where he can some 
narrowing of information so that it would be easier to look for it.  Mr 
Motsoeneng? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Chairperson I want to say 
that I have worked well with the team, your team, the investigators, I 
don’t want to lie, I may raise those issues that I did not get one, two, 
three, but they have been trying their best to assist me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     But one portion that I am 
20 
aware of which also they are aware of, I asked Chairperson the re-
diffusion meeting I think I was also referring to those issues where I 
was part and SABC were dealing with those issues and then they said 
no they do not have such.   They give them their minutes, when they 
knew that they have got those (indistinct) because SABC what they give 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 144 of 177 
 
you Chairperson they are hiding information, they give what suits them, 
they do not give you the truth. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, just make sure that whatever it is, 
whatever information you think is really relevant to the Commission that 
you know of that should be obtainable from the SABC just make sure 
the legal team gets the – gets exactly what they must ask for and then 
they will ask for it and I am sure that we should get it.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, thank you Chair.  And in paragraphs 
59, 60 and 61 you’re quoting from minutes of a special meeting of the 
10 
1 s t of July 2011, but what I could not find Mr Motsoeneng is the 
transcription certificate and who transcribed these minutes of the Board 
and whether somebody had recorded using a particular device and then 
transcribed because it, because even the format is different.   Chair 
that would appear from pages 131 to 163. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Page 131. 
CHAIRPERSON:  131. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    To 163, that would be under divider 
number 6.  Maybe – do you want to page through Mr Motsoeneng, or 
20 
are you happy, you know what I am talking about. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  131 to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    To 136 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  136. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 145 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    I beg your pardon, to 163. 
CHAIRPERSON:  163. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what is that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     This appears to be a 
transcript, it purports to be a transcript of a special meeting of the 
Board of 1 July 2011, it is completely different from all the minutes that 
we had received and I wanted to find out from Mr Motsoeneng as to 
whether he is the one who transcribed this and whether he obtained it 
from the SABC? 
10 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Chairperson I have this 
transcripts long ago, when I was still at the SABC, it – I received the 
transcripts from the secretary of the SABC Board, Theresa Geldenhuys, 
that is the transcript ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where you got it from? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is now the Special Meeting of the Board of 
1 July 2011, I think that is what they allude to in page 131. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    So did she give you a recording only just 
or just this transcript? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    I think she gave me a 
recording Chair but I could not play it, I could not, she gave me a 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 146 of 177 
 
recording and transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she gave you both. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes, but for me I could not 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The recording you could not listen to it, you could not 
play it. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Yes, I could not listen to it, 
but I think SABC they have the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, what is the gist of this transcript 
10 
that you, what is the issue that you want to convey to the Chairperson 
by putting up the transcript? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     I want to say to you 
Chairperson ...(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that was about the resolution for your 
appointment if I am not mistaken. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    No Chair, this is about, it goes with the – 
in those paragraphs it deals with the fact that there were moves to 
remove him or to answer to him at least. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, alright.  Yes, let him tell us. 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     Chairperson I think some 
people when they were appointing me they were thinking that this 
matricless will just do what we want, that is ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now you talk about some of the people in the 
Board, on the Board? 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 147 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    Yes Chairperson because we 
were having discussion and sometimes they will tease hey Hlaudi you 
know you don’t even have matric, you know it seems as if it is a favour 
from where I was analysing it and interpreting it, and Chairperson I am 
very firm, and I – you can’t influence me if I do not agree with you 
easily.  What people would sometimes they influence me I agree with 
them because they are correct Chairperson, but I think if people were 
thinking that it is a favour and for me I believe I deserve it and I was 
capable Chairperson because in all these issues Chairperson, and that 
is where the Public Protector also miss a point.  When I went to her I 
10 
said no after joining the SABC as the Acting COO I realised that the 
executive sometimes they could not challenge the Board, or give the 
Board correct information because sometimes people are afraid of 
dismissal Chairperson to challenge and then you are afraid, I said to 
her that is what I realised that some of the Board resolution they were 
impossible. 
 
Example Chairperson when they were presenting in Parliament 
most of the time they were saying no digital migration will have 18 
channels but where this information will come from, which means it is 
management.  Maybe they wish, they want 18 channels but reality if 
20 
you cannot sustain three channels how can you say you are going to 
have 18 channels and then I said to the Public Protector I think I 
accept that when people were presenting in Board they also misled the 
Board, not me, because I am the one who if I disagree I disagree, the 
Board knows that Chairperson.  That is why sometimes I was fighting 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 148 of 177 
 
with the Board, they chase me away, I come back.   
 
So that is the reason Chairperson.  One day Chairperson I was 
called in a meeting by a Board member but in any case the Board 
member he was thinking that the GCEO is there, which is correct, I 
mean according to the protocol of the SABC a Board member will call 
the GCEO.  Unfortunately when the GCEO is not there it was me.  I was 
calling a meeting.  In that meeting is where a board member call 
business people outside SABC to come and discuss the business of the 
SABC, it is these issues of tenders and so on, to come and discuss 
these issues, so they called me, and when I came people didn’t know 
10 
that it is me, so I went and then they introduced people, and I am not 
going to mention their names Chairperson, I don’t want to do that, 
because I am not here to – because I did not accept, I did not agree 
with them and we agree including the Board member. 
 
So I was called in that meeting, we were discussing this issue.  
The first point that I raised in front of a Board member, I said you as 
business people, and these are big companies Chairperson, I said even 
if we talk here but you shall not take it as a given, because a Board 
member is – he is in this meeting, we as management we take 
decisions, so they oversee, so don’t think that you are going to get 
20 
whatever. 
 
I put it clear Chairperson even in Boards I reported the matter 
to say I was concerned that a Board member called a meeting, but I can 
say Chairperson I did not have difficulties with the Board member, we 
understand each other, but I am just demonstrating that I stand for 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 149 of 177 
 
what I believe in, what is correct, no one can bulldoze me, because 
wrong is wrong Chairperson, you cannot give me wrong instruction, 
because if it is a wrong instruction I will say no I cannot do it, so this 
issue of the transcript Chairperson it seems, because it is quoted there 
you know what do you like Hlaudi, then there were discussions, and 
then the person said ja I like Hlaudi a lot but I think he should not sit in 
our meeting because he and Robin Nicholson hey very close, they are 
tight these people we cannot serve our interest. 
 
What is serving our interest?   You cannot serve your own 
interest, you must serve the interest of the Corporation. 
10 
 
It goes further Chairperson, to say that we must pay 
(indistinct) these people are stumbling block, Hlaudi is a stumbling 
block.  At least the Chairperson they succeed to remove Nicholson, 
they did not succeed to remove me, until they left the SABC, but what I 
am demonstrating Chairperson if you read that transcript, and I do not 
want to mention their names, if you read that transcript it talks to the 
issue of people going to the SABC as board members because they are 
the blockade by a political party or political parties and they want to 
pay their own comrades and also serve their own interests.  It is wrong 
Chairperson that is what I have been fighting within the SABC 
20 
Chairperson.  These people that are tarnishing my name I have been 
fighting for a good cause, for a public broadcaster. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you said something about – excuse me about you 
and Mr Nicholson when you said whatever you said, I thought you 
meant that the two of you maybe would fight at board meetings and that 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 150 of 177 
 
is why whoever was speaking was suggesting that maybe you should 
not come to the board meetings maybe because they cannot make 
progress because the two of you would be arguing or fighting over 
certain issues, but maybe you meant that the two of you stood together 
against certain things, yourself and Mr Nicholson, which is it, or is it 
something completely different? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     I think Chairperson after 
people realised that they cannot bulldoze me they realised that hey we 
have have appointed the wrong person here, actually we were not 
supposed to appoint this one, and Mr Robin Nicholson Chairperson I 
10 
want to use his word because he was sometimes teasing to say he is a 
bully but not in a bad way, I mean you stand your ground, so Nicholson 
will stand his own grounds about issues that he does not believe in 
Chairperson.   I think they were just trying to remove people like us so 
that they can serve their own interest and pay their own comrades and I 
believe that people have been doing that, making sure that I am out at 
the SABC and also Chairperson if you check the statement of Krish 
Naidoo it attests to that history of the SABC Chairperson, but also 
Chairperson I must say that other board members they had been 
supporting me. 
20 
 
They have been agreeing with us that no the board should not 
get into the operation of the SABC Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you Chair. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:     And also Chair the tarnishing 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 151 of 177 
 
of my name when it comes to media is also there, they are saying no 
we can control media, yes Chairperson, it is there in that transcript, 
they can control ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is also in the minutes mmm. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:    I am not putting as a fact 
here, maybe this tarnish they have been controlling media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you Chair.  And then from 
paragraph 66 to 72 you deal with the Gupta family.  You already dealt 
with this yesterday when you mentioned that you had visited the 
10 
family’s, the Gupta family’s home several times and you had dinners 
and lunches there, that is what you said, but what you say in paragraph 
72 is this: 
“I have met other influential business people but strangely I 
have never been queried about them.” 
Is this – are you directing this to the Commission that it has asked you 
to deal with this aspect or are you just saying that generally nobody 
asked you about other influential people? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think it will be unfair for me to 
direct this to commission. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Commission has nothing to do 
with this Chairperson.  What I was just alluding it is not the commission 
who is saying Hlaudi but these people who did this.  The commission 
has never said that.  I was just saying people generally they will say 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 152 of 177 
 
these people met the Gupta’s bla, bla but we meet – we are always 
having many meetings with other business people Chairperson this it 
has nothing to do with the commission. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And in paragraph 70 you 
stated that you never received any gifts or money or forms of 
gratification from the Gupta family. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe just one question I have.  You 
stated yesterday how you then took Ms Mokhobo to the Gupta family to 
meet them and for her to be congratulated.  Did you do the same with 
10 
other people that you were doing business with the SABC? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  No Chair.  I took her because 
as I said yesterday it was part of handover, introduce her to other 
business people not the Gupta’s only.  I think I met – I introduce her to 
other people.  She did the same thing to me Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  The issue about the Gupta’s 
Chairperson because I must tell you the truth.  I said I was looking to 
capture them.  And this capturing Chairperson it will also address the 
negativity of media generally to say but as media we need to find a way 
20 
of portraying also good stories about South Africa because not 
everything is bad about South Africa.  And also Chairperson we are 
having that partnership you know that with New Age.  I saw an 
opportunity to say these people they have this nice jets, helicopters 
why we as SABC we must pay.  So those were the issues Chairperson 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 153 of 177 
 
that I was trying to make sure that at least SABC also benefit from this 
partnership. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You refer to the jet did you want SABC people to 
benefit from the jet?  You use it as well or what? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying you referred to the fact that they had a 
jet or private jet and I am asking whether why that one is important 
whether you had in mind that since you had a partnership with them 
about the New Age you SABC should be able to use the jet as well or 
10 
what? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson because normally 
we pay.  I mean you know it is expensive to fly to Cape Town and 
everywhere and everywhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But I was thinking that because 
we have this partnership we can say but we are partnering in this 
project I mean if we have trips why can you not – we use your – your – 
what you call it? – your jet because for us maybe they can say no but 
you will put fuel it is fine we do not have a problem.  So it minimize the 
20 
cost of the SABC.  The same issue Chairperson that I did with 
Multichoice partnership because in my view I was saying well although 
Must-Carry says that you must carry SABC but partly I think you are 
also benefitting why can you not invest and assist the SABC which they 
did Chairperson. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 154 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Now that you on Multichoice 
we move from paragraphs 22 to 25 you deal with Multichoice matters 
and ETV and could you just link that to the broader Multichoice issue 
that you deal with from paragraph 73 onwards.  Could you tell the 
Chairperson why and on what basis was Multichoice approached and up 
to the conclusion of the agreement with Multichoice briefly? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair maybe through your 
permission Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I also received notice from the 
10 
commission Mr Kruger put – implicating me in some of these aspects.  
So – but Chairperson you will decide.  In my view because I am 
implicated on that matter I am – I think the implicator, the one who is 
implicating me he must give evidence first so that I can respond on his 
evidence.  Because he is implicating me, he is the one who is talking 
about other issues there in this Multichoice issue Chairperson.  I think 
it will be fair for me to come to respond because already he is 
implicating me.  Rather than me to go and then he implicates me he is 
going to come after me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what you can do is you can tell the commission 
what you know about the transaction and – and if after he has given 
evidence there is a need for you to come back and deal with what he 
said about you then you can be given a chance, how is that? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 155 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so in other words if you are asked questions and it 
is something you know you answer that as far as I know this is the 
position.  But when he has given evidence and to the extent that he 
implicates you and it is something you have not dealt with you can 
come back and be given a chance to deal with it. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think it will be unfair 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aha.  Tell me why? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Reason being the man is 
implicating me on certain aspects. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you do not know what he has to say about it? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know what he says? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I have seen a portion 
Chairperson of what he is saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But because he is implicating 
me he must tell the story so that I am able to respond because I do not 
20 
want to respond piecemeal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  As stuff Chairperson.  He is the 
one who has implicated me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 156 of 177 
 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I want him to come and give 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So that I can come and reply 
Chairperson because there are some issues that he is raising there but 
I do not want to – because I cannot give commission Chairperson 
without dealing with these issues. But because he has – if he did not 
implicate me, come after, no problem Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman I am not sure what you may have to say 
about that. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair indeed there is – there is – there 
are allegations and especially in particular in paragraph 47 of Mr 
Kruger’s statement where he says: 
“However a change of Ministers again put the STB 
control system further in dispute when Minister Faith 
Muthambi with full support from Mr Motsoeneng 
decided to go against the government and ANC 
recommendations that a STB control system be 
implemented in the DTT network.”   
So that is the extent as far as I can recall.  Chair it – what is means 
20 
then is that Mr Motsoeneng’s evidence on this aspect would have to be 
heard again after tomorrow after Mr Kruger testifies tomorrow and then 
possibly continue with him then he addressed what Mr Kruger says.  
But it just disrupts the entire plan really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 157 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Not to finish evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will tell you Mr Motsoeneng what my thinking is 
without having really looked at what he has to say.  I look at the fact 
that you say I am here to just tell the commission what I know and to 
explain my decisions the way I understood them and the commission 
will decide you know if I was right or wrong but I will tell the 
commission what I know and it is the truth.  I look at it from that angle 
and from the angle that it is not really like in a court case you know 
where you are facing each other you know.  It is an inquiry.  But I am 
not wanting to make a ruling.  I am not wanting to make a ruling at this 
10 
stage.  I am just sharing with you what my thinking is because based on 
that it may be that we can make progress.  What I was thinking was you 
might be able to say, look I am able to – I will answer what I can but in 
regard to certain things maybe that somebody else might say about me 
I might have to come back and deal with them but in terms of that which 
I can deal with I am happy to deal with.  That – that was my thinking 
that you might be able to say what I know I can tell you but if I – do not 
ask me about certain things because I do not understand exactly what 
he is saying about me.  Maybe he should come and explain what he 
says about me then I can come back.  I am just thinking aloud what I 
20 
am thinking. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Excuse me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see whether that might help us to make progress. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry excuse me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 158 of 177 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Counsel for Mr Motsoeneng would like to 
address you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – let us hear. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Ja thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  For the opportunity.  Chair remember one of 
the issues which is quite pertinent in terms of Section 34 of the 
Constitution is the right to access a forum and this is the only time that 
10 
Mr Motsoeneng can be able to address this forum, this inquiry and I am 
aware that we are using an inquisitorial approach here and I will 
suggest to the commission and through to you Chair that he can 
address the Multichoice issues as contained in his affidavit excluding 
the testimony of Mr Kruger and then when Mr Kruger has given his 
evidence only then can he take a stand.  Because we are not sure 
whether Mr Kruger is going to implicate him or he is going to retract or 
amend his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  We do not know what can happen on the 
20 
witness stand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  So I will suggest that we proceed with what 
is contained in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 159 of 177 
 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  And then put in hiatus the issues of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Mr Kruger’s testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Those would be my submission Chair.  
Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman what do you think about that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair I think that would – that would be 
10 
the best way of dealing with it but again Chair the 3.3 invites the 
implicated person to give a version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To a particular issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which is what we have done as the 
commission which is the implication that is contained in those few 
paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I do not think it would hurt Mr Motsoeneng 
20 
to just deal roughly with that allegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because if it in untrue he can easily say 
whatever it is that Mr Kruger says there it is untrue and then he can 
elaborate if he wishes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 160 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But really the implication does not – 
because it defeats the whole purpose of a version to a Rule 3.3 
because it would mean now that before a person can respond to a Rule 
3.3 Notice that person must allow the implicator to actually give 
evidence first.  I mean it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But has he not responded to the statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  Unfortunately Chair he has filed a 
supplementary – Mr Motsoeneng has filed a supplementary statement 
on Monday this week but that supplementary statement does not deal 
10 
with the versions like as I have been putting the…… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The implications.  He does not say insofar 
as Kruger says this is what I say.  Mr Kruger say this is what I say.  
Insofar as Ms Pillay says this is what I say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that does not – it is still a very general 
statement and I believe that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The work of the commission would be best 
20 
served if he deals with the Multichoice issue now and as you have 
suggested earlier Chair to the extent that he feels that he might want to 
elaborate after Mr Kruger has testified then he may just do that by way 
of an affidavit and check and decide whether he should come back to 
testify to that. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 161 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – another approach which may be in line with 
what his counsel has indicated might be to say if he did not deal with 
those allegations in his supplementary statement or affidavit is to say 
is that he be asked to do so. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because part of having the benefit of a written 
response is to see what will be admitted and what will not be admitted. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Be denied.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I am thinking that if there is not such a 
written response that maybe we – he be asked to provide such a written 
10 
response but in the meantime maybe in line with the suggestion from 
his counsel you – we cover what we can on the understanding that he 
will file a supplementary statement that will deal with what he did not … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Answer. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and then depending on what the other person 
will say he might have to come back. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And deal with it.  If obviously if the other persons 
20 
comes and says no I think I was mistaken or something like that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That falls away 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No true Chair.  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if it is fine let us deal with it on that basis that he 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 162 of 177 
 
will be – you will ask him about the parts that do not relate to what he 
must still file in a supplementary affidavit about. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh okay.  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Sorry just briefly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  There is one issue.  When Mr Motsoeneng 
was served with a number of Rule 3.3 Notices pertaining to a number of 
10 
witnesses they were coming in a cascading fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  And we were not sure now whether to 
respond immediately or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  And we wrote a letter through the 
instructing attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  To the commission to say that we cannot 
have this Rule 3.3 Notices in a piecemeal fashion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Because it sort of restricts him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Because when he is about to answer one 
another then another one is in the inbox. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 163 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Another one comes in yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Rather give us all the statements that 
implicate him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Then we will in one swift action. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Reply to them also. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  That we will deal with all the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Hence that way has always been our 
approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  That is what we intimated and indicated to 
the secretariat of the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV MACGREGOR KUFA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  I think  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair maybe just on that.  It is impossible 
to wait for all the 3.3’s because the commission does not know who is 
20 
going to implicate who. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So as the statements come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Notices get issued. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 164 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The sooner they arrive. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  True otherwise… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You never know whether you have got all of them 
now. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because other implicated persons do not respond. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes Chair that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the reality of the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine but I think what can be done is that an 
arrangement can be made in terms of which by a certain date he will 
file a supplementary affidavit or statement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dealing with everything that he has not dealt with. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Shall we then proceed Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay thank you.  Yes Mr Motsoeneng you 
heard the Chairperson’s directive.  Those matters that you do not wish 
to deal with then we could deal with them separately in writing as your 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 165 of 177 
 
counsel has suggested to Chair. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chair I am in your hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is – I think you are in – you will not 
be unhappy with this arrangement I think. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Not at all Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So what will remain is just that a deadline be agreed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the two legal teams as to when that will 
10 
happen. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When that will happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Yes Mr Motsoeneng I had 
asked how did – we know of the Multichoice and the SABC agreement 
could you just tell the Chairperson what brought that about?  What was 
– the initial stages of the 24 hour channel planning and could you just 
take the Chair through that? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson thank you very 
much.  I think it is very important to give background about the 
Multichoice issues.  Multichoice and SABC we have been working 
together when it comes to sports rights.  When it comes to other issues 
relating to broadcasting issues.  But the issue that was a concern not 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 166 of 177 
 
for me, not for SABC but for all people of South Africa.  It was why 
SABC is not having a 24 hour news channel.  Why E-TV is having a 24 
hour news channel.  Those were the issues and the background what 
informs and is not here Chairperson it is not a partnership here.  Yes it 
is not a partnership.  Firstly after pressure from the public including the 
Portfolio Committee to say why you do not have such channels.  I think 
the former GCO Lulama Mokhobo and Doctor Nguban approach the 
Multichoice to say but we have many channels there why can you not 
cater for SABC also so that we also compete with other broadcasters 
because we are competing Chairperson we are broadcasters.  They 
10 
went and engage Multichoice.  I think I did allude that Chairperson 
yesterday and the board they were not happy about that process but 
they rectify that process.  And after that the board approve that a 
channel.  The only issue that was outstanding it was the financials of 
the SABC because the agreement between the former GCO Lulama 
Makhobo and the Multichoice they were allocating – they were funding 
SABC 50 million for 5 years. But that 50 million they were saying the 
first year it is 50.  It goes down by 10, 10 until it is zero.  Because in 
their view they were thinking SABC will sustain itself through 
advertisers, sponsorship and all those adverts because that is how we 
20 
broadcasters generate revenue Chairperson.  So…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before – I am sorry before you proceed Mr 
Motsoeneng I just want to understand and you must appreciate that one 
is not in the sector.  If E-TV could have a 24 hour channel or if 
somebody else could have 24 hours news channel why would SABC not 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 167 of 177 
 
have its own news channel without going to somebody else to find a 
partner or find some assistance of some kind.  Was that because it 
would have been too expensive or what? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson as a public 
broadcaster SABC it is SABC mandate to have more channels and 
serve the public interest.  News channel is one of the public interests 
that people of South Africa are looking at so that that information can 
be spread in the country even outside the country as it is happening 
now because the channel is not just in South Africa it is across the 
borders of other countries.  So Chairperson I said we are competing.  
10 
We are a broadcaster – we are a public broadcaster so a partnership 
Chairperson that was not the view when especially it comes to this 
issue because I think people who approach they approach to say we 
want our own 24 hour news channel Chairperson.  And if you are happy 
about that Chairperson can I move on? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am not sure that I understand it.  Here is SABC. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Public broadcaster, big institution has the support of 
government.  It wants a 24 hour news channel why must it go to 
Multichoice? 
20 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Oh okay Chair I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order to – to achieve what it wants namely to have 
a 24 hour news channel? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson we do not have a 
bouquet like Multichoice they have many that is why you have many 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 168 of 177 
 
channels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which are already existing? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson the only issue 
that we have is only 3 channels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  During the migration that is 
where the question that you are talking about it will arise.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  To say but you have this 
transmitters now why do you want Multichoice? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  But currently only Multichoice 
can spread news for SABC Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so now in order to have a channel do you need 
to be licenced by ICASA or somebody and because they may have 
licenced somebody else like Multichoice and given them permission to 
have many channels it would be difficult to get – to go to ICASA and 
say we want a channel of our own.  That is where I am trying to 
understand why – why if I want a car why must I go to Mr Motsoeneng 
and say Hey I want to buy a car why do I not just buy a car – the car 
20 
myself without talking to him? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Chairperson maybe to put in a 
language that I think all of us will understand.  Let us take three 
channels – SABC. We only have those three transmitters which means 
you cannot go beyond those three channels in that platform of the 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 169 of 177 
 
SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  You can only do that during a 
migration because now you will be allowed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh technologically you could not do it?  You could not 
– SABC could not have another channel of its own during the period of 
what analogue is that what it is called? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the position? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Multichoice was – already had a number of 
transmitters or channels. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And SABC could acquire another channel by having 
an agreement with Multichoice? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now I understand. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  And also Chairperson I think 
the important background is this channel it is a pilot project for digital 
migration. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Which means when we migrate 
those channels are not going to sit in the bouquet of Multichoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  They will move to SABC. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 170 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, okay, alright.  So that is why they had to go 
to Multichoice? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the Chairperson and the GCEO? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Continue. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  So Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – was the problem of R50 million which was 
going to go down every year until it came to zero?  Ja I think when I 
interrupted you you were talking about that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson.  So the board 
said no they cannot have this channel because it is not sustainable.  I 
think we even make a request from Treasury to fund the channel.  The 
former Minister Pravin Gordhan reject that proposal and the former 
Minister Dyna Phule [?] said because there is no money now you can 
do whatever that you need to do if you could do it so that you have 
channel but she was not saying go and do 1,2,3.  She was saying 
broadly so Chairperson.  I decided Chairperson to approach Multichoice 
after we failed – after [indistinct] Doctor Ngubane failed to acquire the 
20 
amount that can sustain the channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The R50 million. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I think also Chairperson to 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 171 of 177 
 
clarify I think it was 50 SABC.  He said no it is not sustainable I think 
they top up with another R20 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Which was R70 million but it 
was not sustainable Chairperson. That chapter was closed Chairperson.  
He said no there is no channel.  After the chapter has been closed as I 
was saying Chairperson you need thinkers and you need to have people 
with certain skills to deal with innovation of channels.  I went back to 
Multichoice to say to them look we still need 24 hour news channel but 
I consulted Doctor Ngubane before I can do that Chairperson.  And 
10 
Doctor Ngubane said hey Hlaudi you are crazy man, young man you are 
crazy.  Do you think when Multichoice could not give us money they will 
give you money?  I said Chairperson give me an opportunity I will do 
that.  I think I can achieve this funding.   
Chair - I was just talking Chairperson and then Dr Ngubane 
said no it is fine.  You can go and engage them.  I went and engaged 
them Chairperson.  It was not easy Chairperson.  We were fighting 
because when I approached the COO of MultiChoice he said to me 
Hlaudi sometimes it seems as if you are mad and I said this is a good 
madness because it is in the interest of the SABC. 
20 
Reason being Chairperson when I motivated these issues of 
us I said you as a private sector now you are also benefitting directly 
so or indirectly so because our three channels they are sitting in your 
bouquet and people are watching our channels and they are most 
watched channels.  He said no, but there is Must-Carry Regulations.  I 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 172 of 177 
 
said no I am aware about regulations but I think you can assist the 
SABC for digital migration. 
You can fund a 24 hour news channel so that when we 
migrate at least SABC you - we have these channels and also partly 
because you have benefitted because of Must-Carry Regulations and to 
deal with Must-Carry Regulations Chairperson because when there was 
that process of talking to people the Government view was SABC all 
people of South Africa shall be able to watch SABC because they do 
not want SABC to - to - people on satellite not to see what Government 
is doing or the - the events in the country generally. 
10 
They want to make sure that it is broadened.  SABC is 
available everywhere.  That is why you have that Must-Carry 
Regulations Chairperson.  So after that Chairperson after that 
discussion we discussed - we did not conclude immediately because 
Chairperson I remember the man walked out.  Just walked out and then 
I was laughing alone. 
I said no he does not know me.  I am going to fight this battle 
Chairperson that they must assist the SABC and then I think you know 
tempers sometimes it goes up but at a certain point you will find 
yourself and then I asked my PA to call him to say we must talk not 
20 
about just 404 including sports rights.  All those issues Chairperson 
and then he came and then in that meeting we find each other - found 
each other because I explained to him why we should have this channel 
and I was also aware that MultiChoice is paying for E.TV Channel that 
is sitting in that bouquet and other channels. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 173 of 177 
 
They are also sitting there - news channels.  So I said no you 
must assist a public broadcaster.  I do not think it is a bad thing to 
assist a public broadcaster Chairperson which Chairperson at the end 
of the road they agreed with us.  So the negotiations we started the 
negotiations within SABC looking for funding Chairperson.  So that they 
can - because even if we are having the - the many channels in that 
SABC Chairperson you will never succeed if you do not have funds. 
You must secure funds and you have channels.  That is the 
background Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Very much for the background. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I was going to suggest that we adjourn 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then possibly tomorrow we could start 
at 9 o’ clock … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To try and cover all the other aspects with 
Mr Motsoeneng. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 174 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Before we call the next witness whose 
flight has to - departs at half past two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So what is means I - we really have to try 
and finish that witness quite early … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But with your leave Chair but I still think 
that even if we were to start at 10 o’ clock we should be able to cover 
because it is just now a few … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Matters that are left to - to deal with 
Mr Motsoeneng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We - we could start a little early.  I do have two 
or so Commission Meetings. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the next - which starts in the next few minutes 
… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or quarter past or half past. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe - but we can still do 10 o’ clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe Mr Motsoeneng we thought we - you would be 
able to finish today but we had too many questions for you and we are 
not done.  So would you be able to come back tomorrow? 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG: 
 
Chairperson 
through 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 175 of 177 
 
Chairperson I was thinking Chairperson if we finalise the MultiChoice … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  When I come tomorrow I deal 
with other matters Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  Because I think it is - it is 
easier to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLAUDI GEORGE MOTSOENENG:  I do not know what the 
advocate is going to ask me but I think (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The only challenge Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair because of the continuous hearings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The only time we are able to see 
witnesses and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To consult other witnesses is after … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, is only after four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  That is the only challenge we 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You know sometimes we - quite often we go 
beyond four and go to five. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 176 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometimes we have gone … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To even six.  I think one or two occasions we have 
gone even up to seven. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Seven, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One week - one week we went - we sat on a Saturday 
and sometime before the end of September we will sit on another 
Saturday as well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we - we do go beyond 4 o’ clock sometimes but I 
10 
think Ms Norman has that challenge but also I have some other 
Commission Meetings that are - are urgent.  I would have liked that we 
- we - we do as much as possible. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise I could even have gone up to six if 
everybody was fine.  So maybe because of that let us - let us start 
early tomorrow if that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Might just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Enquire if they are available Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  They - they will make 
themselves available for tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, fine.  They will make themselves available? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
11 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 161 
 
Page 177 of 177 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, thank you.  Let us start therefore at 9 o’ 
clock tomorrow.  So that we can cover as much as possible … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And finish as early as possible with regard to his 
evidence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We are going to adjourn.  Then tomorrow 
we will start at 9 o’ clock.
