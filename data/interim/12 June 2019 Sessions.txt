PROCEEDINGS ON 12 JUNE 2019 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Part of the work streams that 
have been presenting evidence before you.  Tomorrow the aviation work 
stream will begin its work for the next few weeks.  We obtained the 
statement finally in its signed form, attested form last night and at – as 
at yesterday it was not clear who would be implicated but Rule 3.3 
Notices will be issued at the conclusion of the evidence.  Can I hand up 
Exhibit EE1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well yes you may.  Normally Rule 3.3 Notices are 
issued before if you propose to have them issued after we should 
10 
explain to the public why? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Chair the direction from 
the Chair was that a series of witnesses be called.  Those witnesses 
fall outside the normal planning of the legal team and the investigation 
team.  It was only late last week that it was planned therefore for Mr 
Nxasana in the absence of other witnesses who were unavailable to 
come today.  The time was set aside for consultation on Monday the 
investigators having done quite some preparation over the weekend.  
Mr Nxasana was not available on Monday and therefore had to come 
from Durban to Johannesburg today – yesterday when his statement 
20 
and evidence was prepared in consultation with the legal team myself.  
It was not clear until yesterday evening when the statement was finally 
attested to who would be implicated and to what extent.  It was not 
possible to obtain from the various judgments and court records read 
over the weekend with any certainty who should be implicated and for 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 3 of 136 
 
that reason and because this witness falls into a different category from 
those that are planned from the outset we would ask your leave to 
issue 3.3’s after the conclusion of the evidence today? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well does his evidence not really relate to matters 
that have already been dealt with in courts and judgment - judgments of 
the high court and the constitutional court and… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where those who may be implicated have been 
aware of those – of what he says about his tenure at the NPA and they 
have had a chance to respond to those.  Does it cover anything new? 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In his statement? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The statement does Chair.  It – 
the focus is not entirely on the litigation that has gone through the 
courts concerning the circumstances under which the contract of Mr 
Nxasana came to an end and what the courts have said about it and 
there are various other applications that have come before court 
including the constitutional court in relation to the termination of their 
services.  The evidence of Mr Nxasana deals with a much broader set 
of issues and it was only on full examination of those issues that the 
20 
extent and the basis upon which implicated persons are indeed 
implicated can properly be dealt with.  So there are different issues.  
The various court cases are a matter of record and I will in due course 
ask leave to place on record publicly excerpts from the judgment of the 
constitutional court in relation to the matter that finally came before 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 4 of 136 
 
court where the constitutional court’s attitude to the independence of 
the NPA and matters related to the independence are set out.  But apart 
from that those particular issues that led to that litigation in the courts 
are not central to this statement.  He deals with other matters in 
addition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well as you say he was among a number of witnesses 
that I said should be called.  Other witnesses were witnesses who have 
been implicated by certain witnesses and other witnesses were not 
necessarily implicated but would need to come before the commission 
to give their version which could corroborate or not corroborate 
10 
previous witnesses and – and he – he falls under Law Enforcement but 
he – I had considered that he – his evidence – he needs to give 
evidence.  But I conceded that what was important relates to in regard 
to his evidence – relate to his tenure at the NPA.  Certain matters 
which have been in the public domain as far as I am concerned those 
are the matters I had in mind and particularly how he left the NPA.  
Now that has been dealt with extensively in affidavits that were filed by 
him and by the former president and other persons in the high court 
and in the matter that culminated in the constitutional court.  I think it 
was brought by Corruption Watch and maybe other parties.  But there 
20 
may be other matters that the legal team you know had you know also 
thought of once he was to be called.  So I would like the full set of 
affidavits in the Corruption Watch matter to be placed before me as 
soon as possible to give me a full picture of the situation.  So obviously 
you can – you can cover whatever the legal team or you think should be 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 5 of 136 
 
– should be covered in relation to his evidence but in particularly I was 
interested in his tenure at the NPA.  Some of the matters that may be 
important for the commission in the light of his terms of reference there 
have been all kinds of allegations and evidence about the NPA and then 
of course the circumstances under which he vacated office. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I thought I would just make clear what I had in 
mind but from the legal team’s point of view you – you are at large to 
cover much more than that if you believe he has got more in – more 
evidence that relates to matters falling under our terms of reference. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The investigators have done an 
enormous amount of work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  From the day in which it was 
decided that Mr Nxasana should be requested to give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The documents to which you 
have referred particularly the court documents. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Have been collated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We do have them here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 6 of 136 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And are able to put them before 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was however necessary to 
leave the public domain to one side and concentrate on the allegations 
relevant both in the court applications and other matters relevant as 
the evidence of the commission has been put before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In order to get the detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of exactly what allegations he 
makes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And who should be  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Served with notices in regard to 
the detail that you will hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of particular concern to the 
legal team are the questions as to the independence and effectiveness 
20 
of the National Prosecuting Authority and the question will be raised as 
to what extent if any there has been political interference in senior 
appointments in the National Prosecuting Authority and the effect this 
has had on the efficacy of the organisation and this is a matter 
addressed pertinently by Justice Madlanga in the constitutional court 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 7 of 136 
 
judgment and I will ask leave to put excerpts on record in due course at 
the conclusion of the evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well I think you should put in the whole judgment 
and draw particular attention to particular 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Parts of the judgment that you think are particularly 
important. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That judgment is in your bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ye. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  After the divider at page 85 and 
10 
following. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is a very instructive judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In regard to the issues that the 
commission is dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  Indeed of course the main point 
of Mr Nxasana’s evidence has to be about the independence of the NPA 
and whether there has been interference with it and by whom and in 
what circumstances would that interference be justified?  Is it 
20 
permissible, is it not permissible?  So more than anything that is – that 
is the most important thing everything else is about that.  You know all 
the evidence has to revolve around that whether… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was interference and if so what form it took and 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 8 of 136 
 
under what circumstances. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And not only Mr Nxasana 
but other witnesses will deal with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And their answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair bundle EE1 is out of 
sequence because he bundles for the aviation tranche of evidence have 
already been prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ye.s 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As bundle DD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So this is a little out of 
sequence but I think the circumstances left us with no choice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  May the witness be sworn? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or may he… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please swear him in. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Give the affirmation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or administer the affirmation. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111

REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Mxolisi Sandile Oliver 
Nxasana. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection with making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I have none. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise you right hand and say, I truly affirm? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I truly affirm. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Nxasana would you bring the 
microphone closer to you please?  You have in front of you a bundle 
marked EE1, do you see that?  It is Exhibit EE1? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I have. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you go to page 27 
please?   
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I am on page 27. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Whose signature is that at the 
20 
bottom of page 27? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I confirm that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that your signature? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes it is my signature. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you attest to this affidavit 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 10 of 136 
 
last night? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I did. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the statement from page 1 
to 28 are you satisfied that that correctly reflects the contents of the 
evidence that you are going to give and wish to give? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair I do confirm 
that this is my statement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And subject to any typographical 
errors or other errors we may come across of which we do not yet know 
the contents are true and correct? 
10 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The contents are true and 
correct I confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius before you proceed I notice that the 
witness did an affirmation now but the statement is – I noticed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I noticed that the witness – the witness affirmed a few 
minutes ago but the affidavit is – is an affidavit and it is under oath.  Is 
everything in order with that? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I notice that now Chair.  This 
morning I asked the witness Mr Nxasana which he would prefer – which 
20 
course of action he would like to take today I was – my attention was 
not drawn to the fact that this was an oath nor did I have – pay any 
attention to it quite honestly Chair.  But perhaps the witness might 
explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we can – we can ask – Mr Nxasana? 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 11 of 136 
 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair it is an option that 
was open to me I was asked a question then I opted for an affirmation 
but I do not have a problem giving evidence under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In line... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Either it is fine.  This you did as an oath and it is fine 
and now you did an affirmation both are fine I just want to check that? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes it is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are both fine? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Nxasana it is common 
knowledge that you are a former National National Director of Public 
Prosecutions. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in that capacity you carried 
out the duties of your office in Pretoria? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Before we deal with the 
period of your own office and before we deal with the brief history of 
the NPA at least to your knowledge before you came to the NPA please 
tell the Chair what your qualifications are and what profession you 
performing at the moment? 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 12 of 136 
 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I hold a B.Proc 
Degree and an LLB Degree both degrees which I obtained from the 
University of Zululand. I served articles of clerkship and I was admitted 
as an attorney in 1997 and from that date of my [indistinct] I practiced 
from my own account until 2013 when I was appointed as the National 
Director of Public Prosecutions.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You left the National Director of 
Public Prosecutions post in May 2015, is that correct? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And since then what work have 
10 
you been performing if any? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I have gone back to set 
up my practice again and I am practicing in Durban for my own account 
as the attorney. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So you are an attorney in private 
practice [indistinct]. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  In Section A of your 
statement at page 1 you have given a brief timeline in order to 
illustrate a point that is pertinent to the work of the commission.  You 
20 
set out in paragraph 3 a timeline and in that timeline you note who has 
been the National Director of Public Prosecutions for what period since 
April 2001.  Would you place that on record please? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you Chair.  To the 
best of my recollection Chair the – Mr Bulelani Ngcuka was the first 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 13 of 136 
 
National Director of Public Prosecutions.  I think from April 2001 until 
31 August 2004.  And Doctor Silas Ramaite in an acting position was 
the Director of Public Prosecutions – National Director of Public 
Prosecutions from August 2004 to January 2005.  Then in – on 1 
February 2005 to 7 February 2009 Advocate Vusi Pikoli was the 
National Director of Public Prosecutions.  After him Advocate Mokotedi 
Mpshe in an acting capacity was also appointed as the National 
Director of Public Prosecutions from 1 May 2009 until 31 October 2009.  
After him on 1 December 2009 until 8 May 2012 Advocate Menzi 
Simelane was the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  Then on 20 
10 
December 2011 until 30 September 2013 Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba was 
also – was appointed to act as the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions.  Then on 1 October 2013 I took up the position until the 
31 May 2015.  I was the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  I 
was succeeded by Advocate Shaun Abrahams on the 18 June 2015 until 
13 August 2018.  On the 1 August 2018 to 31 January 2019 Doctor Silas 
Ramaite again was appointed to act in that capacity.  Then from the 1 
February 2019 to date we have a permanent National Director of Public 
Prosecutions in Advocate Shamila Batohi.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The statutory term of office of 
20 
the National Director of Public Prosecutions in terms the National 
Prosecuting Authority Act what is that? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is ten years. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Has any of the NDPP, 
National Directors of Public Prosecutions since its inception ever 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 14 of 136 
 
completed a ten year term of office? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Unfortunately not Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Chair the constitutional 
court in the judgment we referred to earlier has made some pertinent 
remarks in regard to security of tenure in relation to the independence 
of the NPA and that issue will be dealt with in due course.  For the 
moment Mr Nxasana you recall certain events in relation to some of the 
appointments 
and 
dismissals 
of 
National 
Directors 
of 
Public 
Prosecution that is not necessarily to give a complete record of the 
evidence it is merely to highlight and raise questions at this point in 
10 
time Chair.  Would you tell the Chair of the events of which you have at 
least indirect knowledge from paragraphs 4 onwards? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair 
the issues are of public knowledge.  Advocate Bulelani Ngcuka as the 
first National Director of Public Prosecutions was subjected to a 
commission of inquiry after allegations were made against him that he 
was an apartheid spy and after he was cleared by the commission that 
was headed if my memory serves me well by Judge Heffer he then left 
the NPA.  Then Advocate Vusi Pikoli was also subjected to the same 
process of a commission of inquiry.  I know at the time he had 
20 
reinstated charges against the former President Jacob Zuma and also 
had instituted criminal proceedings against the then Commissioner Of 
Police and the President of Interpol at the time Mr Jackie Selebi – 
Commissioner Jackie Selebi I mean.  Despite also his – despite him 
being cleared at the Ginwala Commission of Inquiry he was 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 15 of 136 
 
nevertheless removed from office.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I know that the inquiry that was chaired by 
Doctor Ginwala was an inquiry under the Prosecuting Authority Act as 
opposed to a Commission of Inquiry under the Commissions Act.  I am 
not sure about the Inquiry that was chaired by Justice Heffer in relation 
to Mr Ngvuks whether it was a Commissioner of Inquiry under the 
Commissions Act or whether it was an inquiry under the – just an 
inquiry under the National Prosecuting Authority Act.  But I think the 
point you make is not about those technicalities it is simply that certain 
inquiries precede that. 
10 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Precede that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their departure.  But it is just important to  
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To make a distinction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – when we are not sure ja. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes thanks Chair for 
bringing that to my attention. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is common to both 
proceedings however is that the inquiries whether judicial or internal to 
the NPA Act according to the best of your recollection anyway in 
principle at least clear both Mr Ngcuka and Mr Pikoli? 
20 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then how was Mr Pikoli 
finally removed, can you recall?  Without going into too much detail. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I remember that 
despite him having been cleared but at the time I think it was President 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 16 of 136 
 
Kgalema Motlanthe was the President of the Republic of South Africa.  I 
think the matter had to be referred to Parliament after the Commission 
of Inquiry but I think they took a decision that she should not be 
retained at NPA. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have told the Chair in your 
timeline summary that Advocate Mpshe was not in the position on any 
permanent basis. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius did he complete the story in 
relation to Mr Ngcuka, his resignation after the inquiry, did he complete 
10 
that part?  What happened to Mr Ngcuka after? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to Mr Ngcuka? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ngcuka yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he complete the story about what happened after 
the inquiry chaired by Judge Heffer? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  How did his term of office 
come to an end to the best of your recollection?   
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  My, my… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that is after the Judge 
20 
Heffer inquiry? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  My understanding Chair 
is that Mr Ngcuka resigned. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then in relation to Mr Pikoli 
you said to the Chair that the matter came before Parliament and 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 17 of 136 
 
subsequent to that his – or as a consequence of that his term of office 
came to and end? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It came to an end – I 
understand that at times he did make attempts to take the matter to 
court but I think he was drained out and he could not pursue the matter 
and ultimately a settlement agreement was reached and he left the 
NPA. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Alright.  The details 
Chair are understandably not placed before you in their thoroughness 
but will be in time.  Then in relation to Menzi Simelane what is your 
10 
recollection? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  My recollection Chair is 
that when Menzi Simelane was – Advocate Menzi Simelane was 
appointed as the National Director of Public Prosecutions he was the 
Director General of Justice before that and at the inquiry – at the 
Ginwala Inquiry he was called to testify and the Ginwala Inquiry made 
some critical remarks about his testimony amongst other things that his 
evidence was contradictory and when he was appointed by the 
President at the time as the National Director of Public Prosecutions 
the I think it was DA if I am not mistaken who then challenged his 
20 
appointment and ultimately the matter came before the constitutional 
court.  The constitutional court declared he – the appointment irrational 
and reviewed it and set aside. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He was then I understand 
replaced in an acting capacity by Advocate Jiba? 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 18 of 136 
 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and we will talk of that in 
a little more detail in due course.  I understand you were then 
appointed when? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I was appointed on 
the 31 August 2013 with effect from the 1 October 2013. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Do you recall any 
litigation before our courts in relation to a directive to the President to 
make a permanent appointment? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I do. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To the post of NDPP?  Would 
you just tell the court – tell the Chair briefly about that please? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I think the 
organisation called CASAC had taken the matter to court compelling the 
President to make a permanent appointment.  I think at the time the 
reasons they advanced was that the office of the NDPP was such a 
critical office that we cannot afford to have an acting and NDPP at the 
time and that the position had to be filled on a permanent basis. And 
the court if my memory serves me well delivered the judgment and gave 
the President who was President Zuma at the time and ultimate time to 
20 
fill the post by a certain date – a particular date. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  When that evidence is 
placed before the Chair in the fullness of time and all its details certain 
questions arise and they arise as a matter of observation now and that 
is firstly your comment that appears to be entirely correct that no 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 19 of 136 
 
National Director of Public Prosecutions in the whole history of the 
National Prosecuting Authority has ever fulfilled a full term of office? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Secondly the history of 
encumbrance in that office appears to be filled with inquiries and 
allegations relating to their fitness to hold office and very often having 
been cleared of any wrongdoing or any adverse finding nevertheless 
their terms of office have come to an end? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair 
especially with regards to the – with regards to Mr Bulelani Ngcuka and 
10 
Advocate Vusi Pikoli. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ja.  Given your own experience 
in relation to the National Prosecuting Authority and the post of the 
National Director of Public Prosecutions what is your view as to the 
effect of this history on the stability and effectiveness of the NPA? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair my view is that 
from this history and also what I experienced at NPA my view is that 
there has been political interference as well as external interference 
that impacted on the decision making in the NPA. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And would that have any effect 
20 
on public confidence in the NPA? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No doubt it did have – it 
does have effect on public confidence in the NPA. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And what role does 
Parliament play to your knowledge in relation to the National 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 20 of 136 
 
Prosecuting Authority? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair there is a Portfolio 
Committee on Justice because NPA is also a – a – a unit falling under 
justice although it is independent.  It plays political oversight over the 
justice as well as NPA. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will make some comments 
later in your evidence in relation to the role of Parliament and in 
relation to matters within your own knowledge. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we will do that later in the 
10 
statement. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have also mentioned that 
Parliament played a role in relation to Mr Pikoli? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But perhaps we should place 
that evidence before the Chair in the fullness of time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – the story might not be perceived to be 
complete when you talk about inquiries in relation to the NPA.  If you 
do not mention that recently there was also an inquiry relating to 
20 
somebody who had acted as the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions.  So if one states simply facts of course you what – what 
you were talking about were those who had been permanently 
appointed as National Director of Public Prosecutions namely Mr 
Ngcuka, Mr Pikoli and of course yourself but there is also somebody 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 21 of 136 
 
who had acted quite a number of times and I know you will talk more 
about some of the events.  Then there was an inquiry in relation to her 
and it is public knowledge that that inquiry reached certain conclusions 
and I think the matter may be going to Parliament for what it is worth.  
It may be that it is important to just state those – back those facts.  Ja. 
Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair there will be reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Further in the evidence to at 
least two other inquiries. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair but your comments are 
noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The appointment of a National 
Director of Public Prosecutions is you state governed by the 
constitution.  You deal with that in paragraph 11 of your statement.  
Would you just tell the Chair very briefly about the provisions regarding 
the appointment of a National Director of Public Prosecutions? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry if you just hold for a 
moment.  May I say perhaps unsurprisingly Chair the live stream is 
down and I have been asked to request a ten minute adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  We will take a ten minutes adjournment 
to enable the technicians to attend to the problem.  We adjourn. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 22 of 136 
 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Nxasana 
before the break you were at paragraph 11 of your statement and you 
had – I think - made the point that the appointment of the National 
Director of Public Prosecutions is governed by the Constitution. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If I may take the liberty Chair 
10 
just to place on record the relevant sections of the Constitution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You refer Mr Nxasana to Section 
179 of the Constitution which provides in Subsection 1: 
“There is a single National Prosecuting Authority in 
the Republic structured in terms of an act of 
Parliament and consisting of a, an National Director 
of Public Prosecutions who is the Head of the 
Prosecuting Authority and is appointed by the 
President as Head of the National Executive and b, 
20 
Directors of Public Prosecutions and Prosecutors as 
determined by an act of Parliament.” 
Who appoints the Directors of Public Prosecutions other than the 
National Director? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They are also appointed by 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 23 of 136 
 
the President. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Are they?  Then powers of the 
Prosecuting Authority are set out in broad terms in Section 179(2) 
which states: 
“The Prosecuting Authority has the power to 
institute criminal proceedings on behalf of the state 
and to carry out any necessary functions incidental 
to instituting criminal proceedings.” 
Subsection 4 of Section 179 reads: 
“National 
legislation 
must 
ensure 
that 
the 
10 
Prosecuting 
Authority 
exercises 
its 
functions 
without fear, favour or prejudice.” 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then Subsection 5 deals with 
policy and the functions of the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  
How is policy in relation to prosecutions formulated and by whom? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that Mr Pretorius with regard to 
who appoints who the National Director of Public Prosecutions is 
appointed by the President. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have just said also the Directors of Public 
Prosecutions are appointed by the President.  Is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Directors of Public Prosecutions are those the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 24 of 136 
 
NPA Officials who are in various provinces or some are heading the 
NPA in provinces but others are not necessarily heading NPA in 
provinces but fall within some or other office of the NPA or in the 
courts.  What is the position?  What is the structure? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Okay Chair.  The National 
Director of Public Prosecutions is the Head of the Prosecution in South 
Africa and then we have – during my time four and I think that is still – 
that is what is still in existence.  Then have four Deputy National 
Directors of Public Prosecutions.  We then have Special Directors of 
Public Prosecutions.  Then we have all of these that I have mentioned 
10 
are based at the Head Office in Pretoria – of the National Prosecuting 
Authority.  Then in the divisions – in the regions – we have the Heads 
of the Prosecutions who are the Director of Public Prosecutions.  All of 
them are appointed also by the President on the recommendation of the 
Minister of Justice – I think – in consultation with the National Director 
of Public Prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you have talked about Directors of Prosecutions 
and a Head of Directors of Prosecutions.  Is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  The Directors of 
Public Prosecutions are Head of Prosecutions in the regions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So each Director of Public Prosecutions … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Public Prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is Head of certain region insofar as the NPA is 
concerned? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  If … 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 25 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the regions are not necessarily demarcated 
in accordance with provinces or are they necessarily demarcated 
according to provinces? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  A decision had been taken 
to align them to provinces … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because initially that was 
the whole idea that the Directors of Public Prosecutions should be 
aligned to the – to the provinces. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That they – they are Heads 
of Public Prosecutions in the provinces … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But we have exceptions 
like in Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In Gauteng we have – we 
have two Directors of Public Prosecution.  That is one for the South 
Gauteng … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And one for the North 
Gauteng … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But I – when I left – at the 
time when I left they were in the process of aligning them so that it will 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 26 of 136 
 
have one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  One Director of Public 
Prosecutions.  We will have one Premier for the province.  We will have 
one President … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Judge President.  We wil 
have Director of Public Prosecutions and in the Eastern Cape as well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because of the … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Number of High Courts? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The number of High Courts 
and the – and the fact that the area is so wide to cover … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  We had two Directors of 
Public Prosecution.  Hence we also had two Deputy – Deputy Judge 
Presidents … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Like in Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Those are the only – those 
are the only exceptions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as a general rule when one hears the term 
Director of Public Prosecutions when it is used in the context of the 
NPA one should be thinking of somebody in charge of prosecutions in 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 27 of 136 
 
the area falling under a certain High Court or in a – in a province but 
accepting that there are provinces where there are two Directors 
instead of one? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where there are two in the same province that is 
Directors of Public Prosecutions one of them would be the Head? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they – they … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They – they are equal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no Head or they are both co Heads? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They are both co Heads, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So is the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions at the top … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then four Deputy … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  National Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  National Directors of Prosecutions? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And all those are at the Head Office in Pretoria of the 
20 
NPA? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you have Special … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Special Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Directors of Prosecutions.  Is that right? 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 28 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and those two are or how many would there be 
of Special Directors of Prosecutions – Public Prosecutions? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  When I left – because this 
is not provide by the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Act? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think they were appointed 
in terms of a proclamation … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  By the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So the number might change from time to 
time? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The number might change 
from time to time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because at the time it was 
Advocate Lawrence Mgwebi for the Specialised Commercial Crime Unit 
… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And at the time it was 
Mr Dawood … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Who was the Special 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 29 of 136 
 
Director for – what is this unit that deals with witnesses? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sexual – oh – protection of witnesses? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Witness protection, yes.  
Witness protection … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Office 
for 
Witness 
Protection and we also had a – another post of the Special Director 
which I recommended that it be frozen.  At the time Abrahams – 
Advocate Shaun Abrahams was acting when I arrived at NPA … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And that was the Special 
Director for Priority Crime Litigation Unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Now in terms of the hierarchy it is the 
National Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is the Deputy National 
Directors of Public Prosecutions and then is it then the Special 
Directors below that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Well they (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they are on the same level as the Directors? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  As the Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They are on the same level 
but there is that power play … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Between 
the 
Special 
Directors and the Directors. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 30 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  About who is at Head Office … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And who … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is not at Head Office? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think that power play – 
you know – it played itself out  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the matter we will talk 
about earlier … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  A bit later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But legally they are on the same …? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  They are on the same level 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is just that they are 
Directors. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
They 
are 
Special 
Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Below the Directors do you have Deputy 
Directors … 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 31 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Public Prosecutions? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  We have Deputy Directors 
of Public Prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then those … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could be a number – there could be a number of 
them? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  There could be a number 
of them … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And some of them at the 
Head Office.  They are all over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Well 
they 
also 
rank 
themselves – the Deputies – as senior and Deputies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, there are different levels? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  Yes they have 
different levels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Prosecutors that one finds in the High Courts 
20 
and in the Magistrate’s Court would they simply be Prosecutors or some 
of them would be Deputy Directors and maybe even Director - 
Directors? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
The 
Prosecutors 
who 
normally prosecute in the High Courts they are the Advocates who are 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 32 of 136 
 
based in the DPPs Office – the Director of Public Prosecutions Offices 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And anyone – you might 
find – you might find anyone prosecuting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  (Intervenes) from an - an 
Advocate to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To a Senior Advocate  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Deputy Director, Senior 
Deputy Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They – they fall under the Office of … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The DPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of a particular DPP … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the province? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay and … 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then the Prosecutors that 
you find in the lower courts … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  By lower courts I mean 
Regional Courts going … 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 33 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Down to the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  District Courts. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  To the District Courts.  
Those are Prosecutors that fall under the Chief Prosecutors in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the particular court? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In the particular court.  
The Chief – the Chief Prosecutors they – they – under them I think they 
cover a certain area … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of jurisdiction? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Of jurisdiction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Under whom they have 
Prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Below 
the 
Chief 
Prosecutor will be the Senior Public Prosecutors, (intervenes) 
Prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prosecutors, ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then Prosecutors and – in 
20 
their … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In their ranks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Basically in – in the province where they operate the 
Prosecutors – Chief Prosecutors and whoever they fall under the DPP 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 34 of 136 
 
of the Province? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  All of them, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of them? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and the President appoints the DPPs … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The DPPs, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But below that does he go that far? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No he does not go that far. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He stops there? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  He stops there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then who appoints the DPPs – the NDPP? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or who appoints them? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The Deputies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Deputy Directors? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The Deputy Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is the NDPP and the – 
20 
and the Minister - the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Minister in consultation with the NDPP? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  With the NDPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  You refer to 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 35 of 136 
 
Section 179(5) of the Constitution.  That is the subsection which deals 
with the powers and duties of the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions.  Perhaps we should place that on record and then I - you 
may make any comment that you wish.  Subsection 179(5) reads: 
“The National Director of Public Prosecutions a, 
must determine with the concurrence of the Cabinet 
Member 
responsible 
for 
the 
administration 
of 
Justice after consulting the Directors of Public 
Prosecutions Prosecution Policy which must be 
observed in the prosecution process.” 
10 
It appears then from the Constitution that is the National Director’s 
primary responsibility or at least responsibility in the first instance to 
determine policy in regard to prosecutions.  Is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What does that mean in practical 
terms?  What policies are determined? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair it means that the – 
the NDPP must consult with the Directors of Public Prosecutions.  The 
policy to be followed in prosecuting matters that is how to go about 
prosecuting matters and what is expected of the Prosecutors in 
20 
handling matters when they are prosecuting them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would include – would that include when to 
prosecute and when to not to prosecute and when to withdraw charges 
or prosecution? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is – that is correct 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 36 of 136 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall the content of the 
policy in broad terms whilst you were the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions? 
MR MXOLISISANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I cannot remember anyone 
specific offhand. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps – perhaps that is a task 
for the investigators … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In due course. Section 179(5) 
goes on to state that: 
“The National Director of Public Prosecutions must 
issue policy directives which must be observed in 
the prosecution process.” 
And Subsection C of Subsection 5 reads: 
“The 
National 
Director 
may intervene 
in 
the 
prosecution process when policy directives are not 
complied with.” 
Is that correct? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair.  That 
means Chair as the National Director of Public Prosecution you can 
mero motu on your own intervene when you believe that prosecution 
policy and directives have not been followed in a particular matter or 
when any of the parties involved in the matter approaches you as the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 37 of 136 
 
National Director of Public Prosecutions and make representations that 
you review the decision to prosecute him or her or a decision not to 
prosecute a particular individual. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You refer to Section 179(6) of 
the Constitution in your statement at paragraph 13.  What does that 
deal with? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  (No audible reply). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words who exercises 
final responsibility over the National Prosecuting Authority? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is the Minister of 
10 
Justice and currently it is the Minister of Justice and Correctional 
Services. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Services, right. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But I must also explain 
Chair that whilst he – the Minister – exercises final responsibility over 
the NPA the Director General of Justice is the accounting officer of the 
National Prosecuting Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I take it that he – he is being accounting officer is 
limited to how money is spent or is - does it go behind that as far as 
you understand the position? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Well as far as I … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps there is a public 
interest in your question and its answer.  Once again we are down … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And offline.  I have been 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 38 of 136 
 
requested to ask for 10 minutes. This is also important I think for the 
record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is important that we should have it on 
record. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps we should take the 
short adjournment now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is – it is about the time for tea.  I was not 
going to take it because we just had 10 minutes but we are forced to 
10 
take it now.  So we will take an adjournment until half past 11.  
Hopefully it will be sorted out … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the meantime.  We adjourn. 
HEARING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am told that the technical problems have been 
sorted out at least for now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At least for now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us proceed. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Nxasana if 
you go to paragraph 14 of your statement you deal with Section 9 of the 
National Prosecuting Authority Act which is the legislation which 
directly governs the National Prosecuting Authority and you refer … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 39 of 136 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To the Section which sets out 
the requirements of the person who may be appointed as National 
Director of Public Prosecutions.  What are those requirements? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair is that the person 
must possess legal qualifications that entitle him to – him or her – to 
appear in all courts in the Republic of South Africa and also that that 
person must be a fit and proper person with due regard to his or her 
experience conscientiousness and integrity to be entrusted with the 
responsibilities of Office of the NDPP. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and particularly relevant to 
10 
your particular case are the provisions or were the provisions of 
Section 12 of the Act which we will deal with when we come to the 
Constitutional Court matter involving yourself and others. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where certain subsections were 
declared unconstitutional. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us then deal with Section C 
which details the circumstances preceding and surrounding your 
appointment as National Director of Public Prosecutions in 2013.  
20 
Would you tell the Chair about those circumstances please? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair.  Chair as I have 
pointed out that I was conducting my own private practice in Durban.  
Then during 2013 - I cannot remember the exact date and the month – I 
received a call from Mr Michael Hulley who was the President’s Legal 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 40 of 136 
 
Advisor – former President Jacob Zuma’s Legal Advisor at the time – 
who wanted to see me and I obliged.  He came over to see me at my 
office in Durban.  We had a discussion with him.  He told me that he 
was looking for a candidate to fill the position of the National Director 
of Public Prosecutions as he was mandated by President Zuma.  He 
had with him three names that he told me that he had been given – 
were given to him by colleagues in Durban but when he bounced off 
those names to those colleagues they were of the view that I was the 
person who could do the job and my name was not amongst the list.  
Hence he then came to see me.  He expressed then the – he asked me 
10 
if I was willing to take over the – I would be willing to take over the 
appointment … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before you go there Mr Nxasana 
in relation to the process by which you had been selected did he 
mention anything other more formal than bouncing your name off other 
colleagues? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No sir. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Sorry proceed if you will. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then Chair it – I was 
surprised.  I was shocked and surprised because not in bad way that I 
20 
never thought that one day I would become a Prosecutor because I had 
chosen to become an Attorney but it also at the same time humbled me 
that my colleagues especially from my division saw something in me 
that I could head an institute – institution of that magnitude.  Then I felt 
that - I remember that I even remarked to him that if my colleagues 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 41 of 136 
 
have confidence in me so why not – why should I not have confidence 
in myself.  Then I was willing as everyone would be willing to serve the 
country.  I thought that the – my colleagues saw some qualities in me 
that entered me to be appointed to that position.  I then agreed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you subsequently meet with 
the President at the time? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  A meeting was then 
scheduled to meet the President at his official residence in Pretoria and 
I remember – I think it was around August if I am not mistaken if not 
before that.  I went up to meet the President at his official residence in 
10 
Pretoria.  Present at the meeting was the President, Mr Hulley and I 
think there was also the lady who – who I was later told that she was – 
she 
was 
also 
the 
Legal 
Advisor 
to 
the 
President 
– 
Ms Bonisiwe Makhene. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Spell that surname please. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Spelt 
M-A-K-H-E-N-E, 
Makhene. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well based on what Mr Hulley said to you it seems 
that what you are saying is he said to you your peers suggested that 
20 
you might be the right person. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm – and you – you had not applied for any position? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 42 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  What happened at that 
meeting? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  At that meeting - before I 
went to the meeting Mr Hulley assured me that I was not going to an 
interview of any sort.  The President wanted just to see me, interact 
with me and I should relax and that is exactly what happened.  It was 
not an interview.  It was an interaction and what I remember quite 
vividly what the President asked me of was that did I have courage to 
10 
take up that position.  To which I responded by saying yes I do and I 
even said to him that knowing that he has been through hardships I 
thought that he meant that I would be able to take decisions 
independently and firmly.  Then I said yes I have that courage and also 
I remember he even said something in isiZulu that it is like that position 
might be like the people stabbing you with arrows something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can say it … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In isiZulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In isiZulu and then seek to translate – interpret it for  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  People who might not understand isiZulu. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I think if I remember well 
he said that position is like (isiZulu) which I understood him to be 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 43 of 136 
 
saying that it was a – a very difficult task to handle and he described it 
as like a – arrows … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A position where … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  A position where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Spears would be directed at you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Spears would be directed 
at you yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is – that is the (intervenes). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Literally yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a position where spears could be directed at you. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is there anything else about the 
meeting that you wish to tell the Chair? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then Chair as about I was 
leaving – about I was leaving the meeting - I think the meeting lasted 
for not more than 30 minutes because I remember it coincided because 
I had to wait there.  It was a date when I think the former Deputy 
President of the country – Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka - was there I think to 
20 
meet the President before she was going to take up the position in the 
– in – I think was it in The Hague if I am not mistaken - had a long 
meeting then I had to wait.  There were also other Ministers there that 
were waiting to see the President.  As I was leaving I think it was 
Mr Hulley who asked if the – I had anything to – to say and my 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 44 of 136 
 
response was that my father who is now late was a trade unionist and I 
know that he would mention that the President - Jacob Zuma – was his 
comrade at the time.  I felt that was necessary to bring that to the – to 
their attention.  I think that was because – I think that was prompted by 
a question that – I think the question was – was I related to 
Sizwe Nxasana if I remember well.  Then I said to them Sizwe is my – 
is my brother in isiZulu.  Well in English he is my cousin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is he – I know what you are talking about when you 
say in isiZulu and in English because in the Zulu culture – you know – 
if you are of the same surname – you know – there – there is some kind 
10 
of connection that you – that is recognised even though you might not 
be related in any way in the English sense.  I think that is what you are 
talking about. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With him are you related in any way in the English 
sense? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No we are Black relatives.  
Our – our … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are Black relatives? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Our 
grandfathers 
are 
brothers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 45 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
What 
happened 
then 
on 
30 August 2013 pursuant to this meeting?  Did you … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh the 30 t h … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Have further contact with 
Mr Hulley? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja.  30 August 2013 I 
remember I was running a trial at Umlazi Court in a civil trial then I 
received a call from Mr Hulley who then asked me to send – to send 
him my CV which I then did. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did he tell you anything of the 
President’s intentions? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  He told me that the 
President was under pressure to appoint and he intended appoint – to 
announce my appointment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Was 
your 
appointment 
subsequently announced by the President? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Although Mr Hulley had 
told me that the – the President was going to announce the 
appointment probably over the weekend or on a Monday I think 
20 
circumstances – he told me that circumstances forced him because the 
information leaked from the President’s office which then precipitated 
the President to make the announcement the next day which was 
31 August 2013. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Do you know whether the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 46 of 136 
 
position prior to your appointment of National Director of Public 
Prosecutions was advertised in anyway? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No I do not know.  I had 
not seen any advertisements myself. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And apart from what you have 
told the Chair are you aware of any more formal or any other - for that 
matter – selection process? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair.  I have no idea if 
there were other selection processes or whether there were other 
candidates interviewed but Chair I think I must pause to mention that 
10 
later on I discovered that Advocate Jiba as she was acting she was 
promised 
by 
the 
then 
Minister 
of 
Justice 
and 
Constitutional 
Development – Minister Jeff Radebe – that she was going to be 
appointed on a permanent basis. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  We deal with that later.  
For the moment though were you ever subjected to an interview in the 
formal sense where you were asked questions about your own history, 
your own qualifications your professional history? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Except for the meeting? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Your attitude? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Except of the meeting that 
we had on the – when I met President Zuma, Mr Hulley and 
Ms Bonisiwe Makhene – nothing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So there was no 
interview that one could describe as a formal job application interview 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 47 of 136 
 
in relation to your appointment? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Unless 
they 
were 
to 
ascribe that meeting as the formal interview - none. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well did have the characteristics 
to your knowledge of what one would expect in the ordinary sense a job 
interview to entail? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  What I can – what I can 
say Chair is that recently there has been an – an interview to appoint 
the direct – the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  If that is what 
you mean that was not done. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That process was not 
done. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were you required to fill in any 
application form setting out your personal history, your details and 
similar matters? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You did however complete a 
security clearance application? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes I did.  I completed it 
20 
only after I was appointed and I was in the office.  I think it was around 
December 2013. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you sign any other document 
apart from your security clearance application prior to been employed? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I would have signed the – 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 48 of 136 
 
my employment contract as well as the oath of office before Judge – 
Judge President Mlambo. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you did of course as you said you were asked 
to furnish your CV which you did? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You then would have arrived at 
the NPA during October.  Is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of 2013? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct – excuse 
me – that is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What did you find on your 
arrival? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I received a warm 
welcome from the personnel at NPA.  At one stage the Minister of 
Justice – Mr Radebe – also came to the Head Office to introduce me 
and I can say I was warmly received. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to your assumption of duty but after the 
announcement of your appointment had you been in touch with the 
Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions who was acting before 
you came to arrange for what would happen when you arrived or there 
was no communication? 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 49 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
Chair 
there 
was 
no 
communication.  I did not know anyone at – at the – at the Head Office 
except that when I arrived there I – I identified the person who I know 
in the leadership as Advocate Pinky Mokgatla because she – she 
attended – I think – the university in KZN – in Durban – and she 
qualified there and she practiced there as an advocate and she was 
also my colleague in the Black Lawyers Association.  That is where I 
knew her from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But to answer the question 
10 
there 
was 
a 
time 
when 
the 
– 
the 
CEO 
at 
the 
time 
– 
Advocate Karen Van Rensburg – and the Deputy CEO that was 
Ms Beryl Sisulu they phoned me and they wanted to come and meet 
with me just to give me a briefing of what I would – I should expect 
when I get to the NPA.  They came down to Durban and we met I 
remember in one of the hotels in Umhlanga.  Then was we were in the 
meeting I then subsequently get – received a call from a person who 
introduced herself as Advocate Jiba who was acting who wanted to see 
me as well and she then appeared to be around Durban.  I had to 
hastily go and meet her.  I did not know how – whether it was a 
20 
coincidence that she knew that they had come down the CEO and the 
Deputy CEO but I later learnt that they – they got a hiding because 
they came down to see me from – from Advocate Jiba.  We met and 
when I met Advocate Jiba she was in the presence of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions in KZN – Advocate Moipone Noko – and the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 50 of 136 
 
gentleman who I knew very well from KZN in Durban who at the time 
was Colonel BW Mahlangu – Colonel Mahlangu – at the time.  We 
exchanged pleasantries with him because he is a Mahlangu and my late 
mom’s surname is Mahlangu and we used to call each other cousins 
until his involvement in all of this thing and which I did not know then 
we stopped having that relationship. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You deal with some of those 
issues in due course. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps we should take it step 
10 
by step.  The Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions at the 
time of your appointment was Advocate Jiba? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was there any formal or even 
informal handing over process where the two of you sat down and 
exchanged details of the state of the NPA, the prosecutions current 
policies and the like? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you instruct Advocate Jiba to 
conduct a formal hand over process with your appointment? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  I did Chair and she did not 
comply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to the date of your assumption of duty 
when would that have been?  In a week’s time or when you asked for 
her to do a hand over – a week’s time, two weeks’ time or much later? 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 51 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I – there were a lot 
of things happening Chair because when I – I think it was around 
December – if I am not mistaken – December 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the time we know from other 
evidence and the Chair will be informed perhaps in relation to these 
matters and more detail in due course but we have heard that at this 
time there were investigations being conducted in regard to the conduct 
of General Booysen in KwaZulu-Natal.  What has been called the Cato 
Manor death squad investigations? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were you given any information 
about those investigations on your assumption of office? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair.  I was not given 
any information. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  How did you learn of the 
investigations – if at all? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Apart from the fact that 
coming from Durban I knew that there was an investigation whilst I was 
still in private practice because the matter was at the court that I 
20 
appear frequently.  That is the Durban Court but when I assumed office 
I did not know what the status of that matter was and I was not 
informed about it.  I only learnt about it when I read the newspaper.  I 
cannot remember where I was coming from but I was travelling.  I was 
on plane – on the plane reading if I remember a – the Business Times.  
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 52 of 136 
 
Then I saw that there was a decision by Judge Gorven in KZN. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  G-O-R-V-E-N. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
G-O-R-V-E-N, 
yes 
– 
criticising the manner in which Advocate Jiba handled herself in the 
matter but of particular concern was also that the NPA was appealing 
the decision of Judge Gorven.  Then I became worried because as the 
Head of the institution and taking into consideration the – the 
seriousness of that matter I thought that it was appropriate that I be 
familiarised with what was happening.  I immediately summoned the – I 
think it was Advocate Jiba – and asked her to tell me what was 
10 
happening in the matter and summon the prosecuting team.  They came 
over to my office in Pretoria and we went through the evidence there 
and then I got the impression - Chair I think the matter – I think they 
have spoken about the matter previously but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Of particular importance is 
that what I also found in the matter is that when Advocate Jiba 
authorised the racketeering certificate but perhaps I must explain that 
the racketeering certificate can only be authorised by one person in the 
whole country that is the National Director of Public Prosecutions 
20 
himself or herself and the National Director of Public Prosecutions 
cannot delegate that authority to anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in terms of the National Prosecuting Authority 
Act? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Hm. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 53 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or in terms of the legislation (intervenes) … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In terms of the legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – to … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Racketeering? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In terms of the legislation 
to racketeering.  Then in this matter what I found is that Advocate Jiba 
authorised the racketeering – she signed the racketeering certificate 
10 
and authorised the – that – that General Booysen be charged with 
racketeering which was then the subject matter in court.  Judge – 
General Booysen challenged the – challenged that and Judge Gorven 
found in his favour that there was no evidence justifying the 
authorisation of the racketeering charges against General Booysen but 
when I questioned Advocate Jiba why she had to sign that obviously 
bearing in mind that she was exercising her authority at the time before 
I – I came there.  Her – her response was that she relied – if I quote 
her she said – I relied on the so called experts – racketeering experts 
and then I pointed out to her that it is … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was she pointing to certain specific people as 
experts? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  She pointed at 
people – the prosecution team who were present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 54 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Then I said to her perhaps 
it would have been better. I did not expect – I would not have expected 
her to go through the – the bundles and bundles – in fact it was the 
boxes of evidence but if I were her I said I would have asked them to 
point me to the relevant evidence that points to racketeering – to the 
relevant evidence that implicates General Booysen and to my surprise 
what they then produced … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  When you say she said she relied on … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Someone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The persons that she referred to as experts in 
10 
racketeering. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was she saying that in relation to concluding whether 
or not a racketeering charge should be one of the charges against 
General Booysen? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she was saying as to whether there was enough 
evidence or not to justify … 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Her … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A charge of racketeering she had relied on them? 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your understanding (intervenes)? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA: 
 
That 
was 
my 
understanding Chair. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 55 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes.  then Chair I think it 
is – it is on record that what was there in the – in the file – in the 
docket was a – a mere unsigned statement not commissioned from one 
witness who left the country as in Greece – he is in Greece - and also 
the other statements were statements of – were hearsay statements 
which were not only hearsay but twice removed hearsay statements and 
Your Worship my feeling was that there is no way I then took them 
through and I explained to them, I convinced them that there is no way 
that you would succeed in appealing the decision of Judge Gorvan and 
10 
I then instructed them to withdraw the notice of appeal which, they then 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made a comment earlier on about who has power 
to authorise or sign racketeering certificate or authorise that a person 
be charged with racketeering and as I understand your evidence you 
were saying that it’s only the National Director of Public Prosecutions, 
in the whole country who can authorise that a person be charged with 
racketeering, is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And to show that authorisation he or she signs a 
20 
certain certificate, is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I thought there was a point you wanted to make 
about that, I assume that Ms Jiba had signed that certificate if she did 
sign it at a time when she was acting National Director of Public 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 56 of 136 
 
Prosecutions?  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct and 
because of – because she was acting National Director, she had the 
power. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She had the power. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     She had the power to 
say…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there is no issue about that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     The issue is that, Chair,  
the point I’m making is, before she signed the racketeering certificate 
10 
she had to satisfy herself that there was evidence to justify her to sign 
the racketeering certificate and I found her response to my question, 
really puzzling that she could only rely to the – she could only rely 
upon what she has been – she was told by the so-called experts, the 
prosecutors that were leading the matter because – I think that was the 
reason why the legislature made that provision that it must only be the 
National Director of Public Prosecutions, that is the – the National 
Director of Public Prosecutions is given the responsibility to satisfy 
himself or herself that because of the – of the consequences flowing 
from being charged with racketeering. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So part of the point you are making is, there must be 
a reason why the legislation said only one person in the whole country 
can make the decision whether a person should be charged with 
racketeering and that must be because of the seriousness of the charge 
of racketeering and its consequences on a person and that although 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 57 of 136 
 
any prosecutor and any Director of Public Prosecutions should satisfy 
themselves or himself or herself before deciding on any charge against 
anybody.  This one is particularly serious…(intervention). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     It’s very serious yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the NDPP must take care to satisfy himself that 
there is – or herself that there is proper and sufficient evidence before 
authorising it, that’s part of the point you are making. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That’s the point I’m 
making Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You mentioned to the Chair, Mr 
Nxasana that during the course of the conversation with Advocate Jiba 
you suggested that she might have considered actually examining the 
evidence and asking the prosecutors to point out the evidence to her on 
which she based her decision. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That’s is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What – do you recall her 
response to that intervention by yourself? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Chair her response was 
that she relied on the – if I quote her verbatim, she said, “I relied on 
20 
these so-called experts -  racketeering experts”.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand you to say the persons to whom she 
referred as experts were in the same room, in the meeting. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What was their response when she said that, did 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 58 of 136 
 
they say anything about whether there was evidence or were they 
conceding that there wasn’t evidence? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Chair the team as far as 
I can recall, the team appeared to be divided on the issue but they 
were of the opinion, I don’t know, because they were quiet, they did not 
respond to when she said she relied on what they had told her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     But then we went 
through the matter and I made it clear – it became very clear that there 
was no evidence in the docket to justify the racketeering, in fact, Chair, 
10 
I went as far as to  - if I may be allowed this latitude, I went as far as 
to advise them that, you see I come from Durban and most of the – and 
some of the victims of the so-called Cato Manor death squad were 
people that I knew personally, I even told them at that meeting and I 
told the that perhaps I was trying to display any feeling that I might be 
taking sides, I wanted to display to them that if there was any person 
that is really very close to what is happening in KZN, it’s myself other 
than them because even the people who died under the so-called – the 
alleged death squad, are the people that I knew and I counted to them, 
the names of those people that I knew very well.  I was trying to 
20 
convince them and I said to them, you see I understand that you 
mustn’t be carried away by this racketeering charges, you may also 
consider the predicate charges, predicate offences, murder, accessory 
to murder, conspiracy to murder if there is any but really in the docket 
there is none – there is no evidence of racketeering against General 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 59 of 136 
 
Booysen and if the docket still remains the same as I left it, my view is 
still the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So in summary you learnt from 
sources other than sources in the NPA that Judge Govern had issued a 
judgment in which he was critical of the NPA stance in relation to 
charges against General Booysen. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     I read from the 
newspapers. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You read from the newspaper? 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You then instituted your own 
inquiries within the office as Director of National Public Prosecutions. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You called Advocate Jiba who 
had signed the racketeering certificate to account basically. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You suggested to her that it 
would have been appropriate for her to satisfy herself directly by 
reference to witness statements and other evidence that there was 
20 
indeed a basis for issuing the certificate. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You then understood from her 
responses that she hadn’t had direct access or required direct access 
to evidence but had rather relied on the opinions of others. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 60 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is absolutely 
correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You then conducted the 
exercise yourself. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you came to a different 
conclusion. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is so sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see some of the witnesses who have come 
before me have suggested that what has happened in some of the 
10 
cases is that people who were fighting corruption were being charged 
by the NPA with various crimes in circumstances where there was no 
evidence to support those crimes.  The suggestion being that they are 
being the decisions to charge certain people may have been influenced 
by reasons other than legitimate legal reasons.  Now I have to ask you 
this question, were you - did the persons that Ms Jiba referred to as 
experts in racketeering, did they at any stage say to you, here are 
some documents which supported our opinion that General Booysen 
should be charged, either on that day at the meeting or at any stage 
afterwards, did they ever say to you, no, no, no our decision or 
20 
recommendation to the acting NDPP was justified because of this and 
that and that? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Chair I did ask them to 
produce at least evidence – at least prima facie evidence against 
General Booysen but they then referred to the statement of – I don’t 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 61 of 136 
 
know if I may mention the witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you may, I think we may have been told – I 
think we have been told yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     They then produced the 
statement of a Mr Danikus he was a Greek national, it was an unsigned 
statement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Won’t you spell that name 
please? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     It’s D-a-n-i-k-u-s, 
Danikus, Chair that was an unsigned statement, then when I asked for 
10 
any statement implicating General Booysen they then produced a 
statement, I cannot remember the name but I will try to recollect it was 
a person who apparently was a security guard for a Stanger Taxi 
Association who, in his statement, was alleging that a Mr Mhlongo who 
was a member of the executive committee of Stanger Taxi Association 
was – had collected monies from the Association and told the 
Association in this security guard’s presence  that , that money was 
required by the General and that he was present when Mhlongo and the 
Chairperson at the time was Mr Zondi of the Stanger Taxi Association 
went to meet with the General at the gateway.  Chair that is the 
20 
General it doesn’t even describe that it was General Booysen, that is 
the problem but he doesn’t say that he overheard the conversation 
between even that General and Mhlongo, that was the only evidence 
that they said that it implicated General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this person who had signed this statement, you 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 62 of 136 
 
say he was a security guard simply said, he was present when 
somebody collected money and said it was for a certain General or the 
General…(intervention). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Wanted the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Wanted the money yes- wanted by the General. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not mention who the General was is 
that…(intervention). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and that he was present also – or that the 
10 
Chairperson of the Taxi Association took it to meet with the General 
and that he was present when he met with the General or that didn’t 
come out clearly? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     It didn’t come out clear 
but I think he was in the vehicle as the VIP protection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but also he didn’t say who the General was? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are those the only two documents they produced? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     At the time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they did that in that meeting? 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     In that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In Ms Jiba’s presence? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     In Ms Jiba’s presence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Ms Jiba didn’t point to anything else she might 
have been told or shown in regard to what evidence there was. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 63 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     No. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
    
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Perhaps Chair, that is why 
if I follow the matter, I think when it came before you, if I’m not 
mistaken, I think that is why then subsequent I heard that Advocate 
Shaun Abrahams re-instated the charges, but I understand that people 
were sent to Greece to obtain a statement, again I’m told that, that 
statement is written in Greece and it was translated by someone here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I think it’s important that, while you are here, we 
get as much evidence as you have to inquire into these things – these 
10 
matters because it’s quite a serious suggestion or allegation when it is 
said that the NPA or certain people within the NPA abused their powers 
to charge people who should – against whom there was no evidence 
and that they were motivated by certain illegitimate considerations 
because if there is no evidence to support those allegations against 
those people or against the NPA then let us know but if there is 
evidence then let us know, the nation deserves to know exactly what 
the position is because the NPA is a very important institution in the 
country and in the fight against crime and the nation needs to know 
exactly what the position is and if there are people who did that, we 
20 
must know if there is evidence that shows that that’s what they did and 
they will come before the Commission, put their side of the story and 
the Commission will make decisions and findings in due course and it 
was important that somebody like you comes before the Commission 
because you were – for a certain period of time occupying this very 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 64 of 136 
 
important position of NDPP and you left under certain circumstances 
and in the public domain there are all kinds of things that are said but 
also there are judgement, Court judgements that have dealt with that.  
It’s important that somebody like you comes and tells the Commission 
exactly what you know and what happened while you were NDPP so 
that the Commission can have as full a picture as possible before, in 
due course, it makes findings. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes I appreciate that.  
Sir – Chair can I make also this observation because – so that my 
evidence here is not taken out of context. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     I haven’t suggested that 
there was no evidence at all against General Booysen’s co-accused. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That – just to make that 
one very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR 
MXOLISI 
SANDILE 
OLIVER 
NXASANA: 
 
 
 
 
Yes 
because…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are saying with regard to the…(intervention). 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   To the racketeering 
charge against Booysen, Chair there was not a shred of evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying anything in regard to any other 
charges I can’t remember whether that was the only charge he was 
facing, are you saying anything about any other charges he may have 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 65 of 136 
 
been facing other than the racketeering charge, I just can’t remember if 
it was just racketeering charges. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Because in the main 
Chair, perhaps just to unpack this matter Chair, you know I even 
suggested Chair that if I was prosecuting that matter or directing that 
matter I was going to – I said to them, you could have approached one 
of the co-accused and turn him a 204 witness because most of the 
evidence I said to them, you know, I’m based in Durban and come from 
Durban and all that you are telling me here is what is in the public 
domain in Durban.  We hear a lot of things about Cato Manor at the 
10 
time and I told them that we would hear that when the members of the 
Cato Manor Unit had killed a person, they would plant a firearm and 
then General Booysen would come and take over the scene, so to say.  
Those were the allegations but then I said to them, these are just 
allegations and without the evidence in the docket you cannot 
prosecute because we don’t prosecute with emotions and I tell you this 
is what I would also hear about the Cato Manor Unit and Chair, there 
was also evidence also, in the – there were allegations, not evidence in 
the docket that one member of the Cato Manor Unit shot and killed a 
teenager at, I think, Empangeni (indistinct) when they were looking for 
20 
a suspect, I don’t know whether the suspect was  related to this young 
man but I think they recklessly opened fire and killed an innocent 
young man.  That’s a simple investigation, I’ve never been an 
investigator in my life but, I mean you can take – collect evidence, 
match cartridges, spent cartridges, take the firearms for ballistic 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 66 of 136 
 
examination purposes and link the person or even use the adoption of 
common purpose to charge whoever, that is why I pointed out  to them 
that they mustn’t get carried away with this racketeering charge but of 
particular importance which I brought to their attention that, if you want 
to charge a person with racketeering you have to prove that there has 
been a pattern and this pattern has been continuously happening for  a 
particular period and I said, if they want to allege that Cato Manor as 
the unit which was based at Cato Manor, Chair knows where Cato 
Manor is, in Durban, and my difficulty was that at the time General 
Booysen was not even a member of that unit because he was the head 
10 
of the Hawks in Durban based, the now called (indistinct) building in 
Durban and then to allege that he was managing the enterprise when 
he was based there, they were not going to succeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Just to explain the reference 
you made to Section 204, Section 204 is a Section of the Criminal 
Procedure Act, I understand, that is used to enable a co-accused to 
assist the prosecution and perhaps receive indemnity in the Court’s 
discretion as a result. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And that’s what you were 
referring to. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is what I was 
referring to. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Earlier as having been as step 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 67 of 136 
 
that could and perhaps should have been taken. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair, 
that is what I was suggesting. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The time at which you took 
office, October 2013 was a time when the former President Zuma was 
still being investigated, is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Were you briefed on the status 
of that investigation? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Not at all Chair, in fact 
10 
Chair I’ve never even touched the docket relating to the former 
President Jacob Zuma.  I understand that the docket was still in the 
possession of Advocate Jiba and Mr Hofmeyr, if I’m not mistaken. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Was – is it correct that the investigation was still 
going on at that time because remember in 2009 charges were 
withdrawn, did the investigation continue after they had been 
withdrawn? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Chair my response for 
the question of the investigation, I understand quite clearly that the 
20 
investigations had ceased to – by then but I understand that the matter 
was pretty much very alive because there were challenges at the time.  
Then my response is in regard to that, that there were people still 
challenging the decision to withdraw charges against the former 
President Jacob Zuma. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 68 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words you are not necessarily saying 
there 
were 
investigators 
who 
were 
still 
continuing 
to 
investigate…(intervention). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you do not know? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     No I’m not – I don’t know 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja you simply know that the matter…(intervention). 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     There were Court 
challenges. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   There were Court challenges relating to the dropping 
of the charges. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes perhaps my question should 
have been re-phrased to more accurately reflect what you say in 
paragraph 29 Mr Nxasana when you say you were not briefed on the 
status of the investigation rather on whether the investigation itself was 
continuing. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct.   
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right if we can move on then 
please to the events leading up to your own suspension.  During your 
first year in office, it was not much more than a first year in office, but 
during that year, did you learn anything about the attitude towards you 
and the conduct towards you on the part of Advocates Jima and 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 69 of 136 
 
Mgwebi, that’s Laurence Mgwebi and Nomgcobo Jiba? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes Chair, Chair as I 
pointed out that I was appointed on the 31 s t of August 2013 with effect 
from the 1 s t of October 2013.  In a sense it means that I had this whole 
month of September still in Durban to wrap up before I took office.  
Chair I started to learn that during that period of September, because 
the announcement was made by the President that, there were people 
that were running around, driving around in the township where I grew 
up from that is Umlazi in my area and that these people, many people 
were stopping people, asking them about me, about my history 
10 
especially about my involvement in a matter that was publicised of 
murder around 1985.  It didn’t puzzle me at first because I thought that 
it was part of the vetting process but this thing gained its momentum 
until I got to the office.  I then learnt there were members within NPA 
who were very much responsible also for that.  I then subsequently 
received unsolicited statement in the form of an affidavit from one 
member of the NPA by the name of Terrence Joubert wo was, at the 
time, I don’t know if he still is, a risk specialist at NPA he was based in 
Durban.  He sent me an email and in the email there was an affidavit 
that affidavit forms part of the bundle here where he then – where he 
20 
was basically telling me that there was a campaign by Advocate Jiba 
that – to dig the dirt about me so that the intention, the whole purpose 
was to embarrass me so that the President will then remove me as the 
National Director of Public Prosecutions and she would then stand a 
chance of being considered to either continue to act or to be appointed 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 70 of 136 
 
permanently, it is there but it also – this affidavit – in this affidavit he 
also states that there were police – two police members that were 
assigned to the DPP, that’s Deputy – Director of Prosecutions in KZN, 
Advocate Noko who was stationed there at his office who had received 
vehicles from the provincial office at the time the Commissioner was – 
Commissioner Mmamonnye Ngobeni and that those people that were 
there, those two gentlemen they were then tasked with going around 
finding any dirt about me but he also went as far as recording this 
Colonel Mahlongo.  Yesterday I tried to get this recording, I only 
managed to get it very late because it happened in – I think 2013 or 
10 
2014 where basically I could hear the voice of Colonel Mahlongo and 
Terrence Joubert, Joubert was playing along.  He did not – Colonel 
Mhlongo did not know that he was recording him.  He was basically 
saying that Jiba had mandated him to go about digging dirt about me.  
They went so far as to that recording saying that I think Terence 
Joubert had undertaken to hook him up with people from the Road 
Accident Fund because the allegation was that because I was 
practising as an attorney they were alleging that I had embezzled 
clients monies when I handled the Road Accident Fund claims and also 
I do not know how they got it from and it is true that my wife at some 
20 
stage was also – was employed at the – at the Road Accident Fund 
office in Durban.  All of that it is there that my wife was also employed 
there and that Terence Joubert was going to hook him up with the 
gentleman at Road Accident Fund so that they could give them 
evidence implicating me in all of that.  They also refer in the murder 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 71 of 136 
 
charge that Terence Joubert could hear him saying that that murder 
charge that you have in your position referring to Colonel Mhlongo that 
was – it is there – it is there I have it in the record here. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because these are serious 
allegations perhaps we should do you the favour of allowing to go 
through your evidence in the sequence you settled it in your statement.  
You talked about people in Umlazi informing you. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This was before your 
appointment actually became confirmed or… 
10 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It was confirmed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before you took office. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  After its confirmation but before 
you took office trying to as you put it dig up information about your 
past. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is the one set of facts that 
you place before the Chair. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You also mentioned earlier in 
your evidence the approach to you of two NPA officials. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now what did they tell you?  
That is in paragraph 33 of your statement. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 72 of 136 
 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is the one that I am 
referring to.  That approach I meant the – the affidavit that I received 
from Mr Terence Joubert. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the other person? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The other person was Ms 
Queen Mlongo who was stationed at the – the NPA offices attached to 
the Asset Forfeiture Unit in Durban. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What did she tell you? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She told me that Colonel 
Mglongo was bragging saying that – in fact she also had recorded him 
10 
unfortunately we have lost the phones now and the recordings but I 
listened to the recording myself.  And in that recording he was bragging 
that he claimed to know me very well and he made a lot of false 
allegations about me in that recording but of importance is that he was 
saying that he had been promised the appointment of the Brigadier – he 
was accusing me of wanting to charge General Mdluli and that General 
Mdluli if he is not charged General Mdluli was going to make sure that 
he is appointed as the – he was going to be promoted as the Brigadier. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just take that slowly 
because that is a lot of information. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you proceed Mr Pretorius just one line.  
At the time going back to Mr Joubert’s affidavit – at the time you got 
that affidavit was Mr Joubert known to you? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair no he was not 
known to me. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 73 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you received an affidavit from somebody that you 
had never met, that you did not know? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes but he is an 
employee of the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And my details are there 
for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Because I received on 
the … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the email. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Official NPA email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So you have said in your 
statement that almost immediately after you were appointed two NPA 
officials approached you.  We will deal with Mr Joubert in a moment.  
The other person how do you spell her name? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  It is Queen. Queen 
Mhlongo.  Mhlongo it is Mhlongo. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ngo.  Right.  Did she tell you 
20 
anything about Advocates Jiba and Mwebe? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair except that – I just 
see if I can refresh my memory.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please do.  Look at 
paragraph 33 of your statement.   
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 74 of 136 
 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes, Yes Chair this is – 
that is the – the evidence that I have just given that paragraph 33 talks 
to that about the plot to oust me.  That Colonel Mhlongo was the main 
person that was used by Advocate Jiba to run the compaign. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Advocate Mwebe? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Both of them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm you talk about two officials of the NPA one of 
them I understand to have been Mr Joubert. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you are talking about.  Was the other one the 
10 
person that you refer to as Queen Mhlogo? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  She was – she was 
attached to the Asset Forfeiture Unit based in Durban at the time. But 
she is no longer with the NPA.  She is the private… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Sector now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did they approach you together 
as a team or did they approach you separately? 
20 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No independent of each 
other Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  These were two separate 
independent…

Page 75 of 136 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Approaches to you? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around about the same time? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Around about the same 
time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During the month of September before you – no, no 
after you had commenced your duties as NDPP? 
10 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes after I had 
commenced my duties yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And Chair I think I must 
also mention that both – I think they were – Terence Joubert and – 
although he was a Risk Officer Specialist.  I think his office was also in 
the same building as the office where – of the Asset Forfeiture Unit of 
the NPA in Durban.  That is the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where Ms Queen Mhlongo… 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was working [indistinct] 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes it is – yes – it – at – 
is it 185 Building, Southern Life Building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 76 of 136 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  These approaches to 
you at whose instance were they made?  Did you call on them to speak 
to you?  Did they come of their own accord?  What was the case? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair they came of 
their own accord. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And separately? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And separately. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In fact Chair what I have 
not mentioned here in the affidavit is I have referred earlier to an 
10 
incident when I said I was warmly welcomed at the NPA and during that 
– I referred to a – to the day when Minister Radabe came to introduce 
me.  I gave a speech also there.  We were at the auditorium.  Chair I 
then said – I remember saying that Minister I am no – NDPP has ever 
finished his term of office and I can assure you that I will finish my term 
of office.  In fact the NPA Act even permits me to take an extra period 
of not more than two years and I am sure that I will be here for the 
period of 12 years.  I was saying that in jest.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  But what then happened 
20 
is that later on I – a lady was then seconded to my office as my 
secretary and at a very late stage she then said to me that she related 
her story to me that she said she was present at the – when I gave that 
– at that welcoming event.  Then she said there was a gentleman she 
was standing by the door and a second gentleman immediately passed 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 77 of 136 
 
a comment after I made those remarks and said you will be surprised 
that you will not even last for a period of three months.  As we 
continued working together then in the office and she then happened to 
meet and know that apparently that person who made those comments 
was Mr Lawrence Mwebe.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so this lady who was employed by the NPA said 
a person who was standing behind her. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At… 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Or next to her. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh next to her? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time when you made the speech. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After being introduced by Minister Jeff Radabe at the 
NPA to the NPA staff. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Said you will be surprised that you will not even finish 
three months? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then that same lady later came back to you and 
said that person was Mr Lawrence Mwebe? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes when she got to see 
him when we had interactions with them in my boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 78 of 136 
 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  And she identified him as 
Lawrence Mwebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You have spoken then 
about the two NPA officials who approached your unsolicited and 
separately? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  With information. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  About what other people in the 
10 
NPA were doing to unseat you? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that more or less an accurate 
summary I do not want to put words in your mouth unnecessarily.  We 
are going to go to the detail in a moment.   
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Ja but again also Chair 
perhaps this might also become relevant I – also during the – just to go 
back.  During the – that September period of 2013 when the 
announcement had been made before I took office I received – I 
remember I received a call from Advocate Mdladla commonly known as 
20 
Advocate Sthembiso Mdladla commonly known as Sticks Mdladla.  I 
know that he was then subsequently one of the members of the Cassim 
Commission of Inquiry he was also a member.  He phoned me in the 
morning and said to me apparently he made mention of a Mr Mwebe.  
He said he understand Mr Mwebe wanted to speak to me because he 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 79 of 136 
 
fears or hears told him that – he has been told that when I came to NPA 
I will deal with him.  Chair it took me by surprise as I pointed out 
earlier on that I did not even know him. I did not even met him I did not 
know anyone except the person that I later identified as Advocate 
Pinkie Mokgatle.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The information that the lady gave you about the 
gentleman that was standing next to her was that information solicited? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You said that Mr Terence 
10 
Joubert gave you an affidavit that is part of the bundle? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In summary what did Mr Joubert 
tell you in that affidavit?  Or what did that affidavit say?  You deal with 
that in paragraph 36. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  In summary Chair 
apparently Advocate Jiba was going to Durban.  I think it was on the 
day that I met her.  And the protocol is that Terence Joubert as the Risk 
Officer Specialist in Durban is – was responsible for security and risk. I 
think he was the head in Durban.  He was the one who was going to 
20 
fetch Advocate Jiba from the King Shaka International Airport and drive 
to her destination.  But then Mr Joubert says that he then subsequently 
when he had made arrangements to go and fetch Advocate Jiba he 
received a phone call from the Advocate Jiba’s secretary advising him 
that he was not – he was no longer going to be – it was not going to be 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 80 of 136 
 
him who was going to fetch Advocate Jiba and it was now going to be 
Colonel Mhlongo.  And then he said he found that very strange because 
he talks about the security, the protocol and the security risk attached 
to all of that.  And then he made mention of a situation where – he then 
made mention of these two police officers that were deployed to the 
DPP’s office in Durban Advocate Noko and that is when he challenged 
that because of the security risk and that they were not vetted 
apparently his boss from the head office a Mr Ramahana flew down and 
came down and castigated him for that.  Then he in this affidavit he 
then talks about the – the plot now that apparently Jiba was running a 
10 
campaign to get me removed as the – he said to Mhlongo – or he said 
Mhlongo told him that … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mhlongo told who? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh sorry Mhlongo told 
Joubert. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That Jiba said to him – 
Jiba does not trust this guy the – who is the new NDPP Mr Nxasana and 
that Mhlongo must go out and get some – and dig some dirt about him.  
So that… 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is you? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  About me? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  The whole intention was 
to embarrass me and that she did not know me but the whole intention 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 81 of 136 
 
was to embarrass me so that the President will remove me or will fire 
me as the National Director and she will then be considered to either 
continue to act or to be considered on a – to be appointed on a 
permanent basis. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the affidavit of Mr Joubert 
talks of a conversation between Colonel Mhlongo and Mr Joubert? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And relates what was told to Mr 
Joubert in that conversation by Colonel Mhlongo? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have related some of 
that? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was anything mentioned in that 
conversation according to Mr Joubert about the Road Accident Fund? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have – is that what you 
have just told the Chair about? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is what I have just 
told the Chair and also the – the issue about the cases that I had faced 
20 
in about 2015. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Sorry 1985. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what – was anything said 
about the example prior example of Mr Stanley Gumede would you 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 82 of 136 
 
explain that briefly to the Chair. 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Oh yes.  Chair yes.  In 
that affidavit also Mr Joubert refers to – he says that Colonel Mhlongo 
also told him that Mr Stanley Gumede who is the Regional Magistrate in 
Durban was the person who was considered for the position before 
myself.  But that Advocate Jiba ran the campaign to discredit him and 
one of the things in that affidavit that which Joubert alleges is that Jiba 
or – Jiba then – they convinced a one advocate here – they call him 
Makosi in Durban to – to complain about the manner in which Mr 
Gumede had treated her in court as a result Mr Gumede had to face a 
10 
lot of complaints and he was investigated by the Magistrates 
Commission.  The matter was all over the media and the President that 
[indistinct] the President not considering him as the candidate.  Then 
he says that they were using the very same tactic that they used 
against – and he was responsible Mr – Colonel Mhlongo in that 
campaign authorised by Jiba. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now you have told the Chair that 
this conversation between Mr Joubert and Colonel Mhlongo was 
recorded? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You informed the investigators 
that it had been recorded but as of yesterday we had not been or the 
investigators had not been able to obtain the recording? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You managed to obtain the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 83 of 136 
 
recording? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yesterday after I had left 
you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  And you now have that 
recording? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair we have not had an 
opportunity firstly to hear the recording, secondly and importantly to 
transcribe the recording.  I am not averse to playing the recording 
should you require Chair in fact to do so but on the assumption that we 
10 
have not been able to precognize the witness in relation to the 
recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long is the conversation in the recording? 
ADV MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Chair I think it is less 
than eight minutes if I am not mistaken or five minutes ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe during lunch break I do not know if there 
could be a chance for you to hear it I would not be insisting that it be 
heard today if you would rather let it be heard some other time but… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well it is just perhaps 
inconvenient for you Chair to hear the recording which may be unclear 
20 
in part without it being properly transcribed.  But without a transcription 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is not up to us to preconize 
the witness in the sense that we… 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 84 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No I would prefer that you hear it first so that you 
have an idea about its value. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Indeed Chair we will do that over 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before I allow it.. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Long adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:    If – once you have heard it and if you say you take 
the – your submissions that it can be heard then we can look at hearing 
it but if there are circumstances that justify that it be heard on another 
day then that should be arranged.  I am sure Mr Nxasana would make 
10 
himself available.  But obviously to the extent that it is possible we 
would like to try and finish his evidence. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so it is just a balance to be struck. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is this a convenient time then? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment now it is one 
o’clock we will resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair we have had a polite 
request from counsel representing Advocate Jiba to place opposition or 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 85 of 136 
 
an argument before you. I am trying to get hold of counsel concerned – 
Advocate Ngalwana.  May we stand down for five minutes so I can 
establish where his whereabouts are? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will stand down for about five minutes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
HEARING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius you - do you want to deal with the fact 
10 
that we only resume now? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  You – you 
will recall this morning prior to the witness being called and sworn and 
giving testimony it was drawn to your attention that in all the 
circumstances which were placed before you Rule 3.3 Notices to 
implicated parties had not been given but would be given immediately 
after the conclusion of the witness’ testimony.  On that basis you 
requested to allow the witness’ evidence and you did so.  Since then 
Advocate Ngalwana 
on 
behalf 
of 
Ms Jiba 
has 
approached 
the 
Commission and made certain requests of the Commission.  In essence 
20 
that any evidence concerning Ms Jiba be excluded pending the issue of 
a notice to allow Ms Jiba to consider her position and take legal advice.  
Now Chair the purpose of the Rule certainly as we understand it or at 
least the principle purpose of the Rule is to give an implicated person 
an opportunity to place a version before the Commission and to make 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 86 of 136 
 
application to cross-examine.  In other words to contest the evidence 
given by a witness and in any approach that you will be requested to 
make that principle should remain sacrosanct.  There is another 
potential purpose of the rule and that is if there is any prospect of 
unlawful and I stress unlawful as opposed to inadmissible evidence 
being given perhaps of a confidential nature or of a top secret nature 
then that implicated person would have an opportunity to deal with it.  I 
do not believe we are dealing with that category of issue in this matter.  
Certainly not in the evidence that the witness intends to give.  So that 
is the principle purpose of the Rule to allow a version to be put and to 
10 
allow cross-examination to take place and it should be respected at all 
times.  There can be no doubt about that.  The Rule maybe departed 
from in appropriate circumstances and our submission is such 
circumstances existed this morning and you Chair accepted that.  There 
are two principles embedded in the rules of fairness with which this 
Commission is obviously bound and in the rules which give expression 
to those principles of fairness.  The one is that no party may because 
that implicated or otherwise disagrees with the evidence that a person 
is going to give and who has received notice of that evidence hold a 
trial or a contest outside the Commission’s proceedings and say you 
20 
cannot lead that evidence because it is wrong or I disagree with it or 
because it is false.  The proper place for that contest to take place is in 
this forum in public and indeed that is what the law requires that this 
Commission to take place in public.  So a witness gives evidence that.  
That evidence is contested after that witness has been – had given 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 87 of 136 
 
evidence.  There cannot be a trial outside which would influence that 
witness’ evidence.  That is the first principle.  The second principle is 
that – and it is also sacrosanct – is that any implicated person must be 
given a full and fair opportunity to contest the evidence of a witness 
and to cross-examine subject to the rules and the discretion that you 
have embedded in those rules Chair.  So those are the two sacrosanct 
principles.  The question is can they be met in this case.  If there are 
circumstances which indicate that the evidence that this witness is 
about to give is somehow unlawful or cannot be lawfully put before a 
Commission that is one set of issues.  I do not believe those exist here.  
10 
If however it is merely a matter of managing a fair opportunity to 
respond either by way of putting up a version or by way of allowing 
cross-examination then that can be managed in any order that you 
might make Chair and the rules provide expressly for such a 
circumstance.  I think that is Rule 3.6.  There are two options then 
having 
considered 
the 
position 
that 
I 
would 
suggest 
require 
consideration.  The one is to allow the evidence - but to exclude any 
reference to any implicated party because of course all implicated 
parties must be treated in the same manner not only Ms Jiba – to allow 
that evidence to be given without reference to any implicated party and 
20 
then to recall the witness at a later stage once notice has been given.  
That is the one option.  It may not be entirely practical.  It is the 
cautious option.  The second option is to allow the witness to testify 
subject to appropriate arrangements being made on representations by 
Mr Ngalwana either now or at a later stage to ensure that there is a full 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 88 of 136 
 
opportunity to place a version before you and to cross-examine in due 
course. The tape that we mentioned earlier may possibly fall into the 
category of that evidence that may not be led at all and perhaps 
representation should be allowed on that before the tape is played but 
that concession we are happy to make but otherwise Chair the stark 
choice and the approach to adopt is left with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I said in the morning when you mentioned that 
Mr Nxasana was called in – or pursuant to my directions one of the 
things I said was that I wanted to hear his evidence in regard to his 
departure from the NPA and I said of course then his tenure at the NPA 
10 
because he having been National Director of Public Prosecutions at a 
certain stage and there been suggestions and allegations and some 
evidence that there may have been interference with the NPA and that 
some people in the NPA may have used their powers to charge and not 
to charge certain people in an unlawful way or they may not have been 
motivated by proper reasons.  It would be important to hear his 
evidence.  So one, I confirm that Mr Nxasana was called pursuant to my 
direction.  That is the first point.  The second point, you did raise in the 
morning the issue that Rule 3.3.  Notices were not given in advance – 
were not sent out in advance because the legal team only got a signed 
20 
statement of the witness yesterday or last evening.  I was concerned 
about that but I indicated that in terms of my focus it was – I expected 
the witness to deal with largely matters that have been the subject of 
judgments and some litigation that would be – that would have been in 
the courts but of course when a witness gives evidence he gets asked 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 89 of 136 
 
questions and he gives evidence and he may elaborate and so on.  So 
– and – and I was prepared to let him continue and in doing so the 
provisions of Rule 3 – of the Rules of the Commission make – they 
provide that where a party who – an implicated person believes that he 
has not been given enough – enough notice that party may approach 
the Commission for such order as may in effect give redress to the 
situation.  Of course this is a situation where the notices were not 
given in advance at all.  That is important to look at.  I think what 
should happen is I should allow Mr Ngalwana to say something if he 
wishes to say something.  He represents Ms Jiba and then we take it 
10 
from there but it may well be that where notice has not been given at 
all.  It may be that that must be looked at carefully as opposed to 
where notice was given but there is a complaint that it is inadequate – 
the notice given is inadequate or – so maybe subject to whatever you 
might wish to say I would like to hear what Mr Ngalwana has to say but 
maybe that we should see what can be done.  The idea is always to try 
and be as fair as possible to everybody but taking into account 
practicalities that we have to deal with.  Mr Ngalwana. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Thank you Deputy Chief Justice.  Thank 
you for the indulgence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Of the two options or perhaps should I 
confirm that I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  I stand here on the instructions of Majavu 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 90 of 136 
 
Incorporated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  For Ms Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  None of the legal – members or the legal 
team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Are in Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  So I am the only one who is here.  So I 
10 
have been asked to make these representations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Of the two proposals made by the evidence 
leader … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  I have not taken instructions but I would 
imagine the one that would endure itself to Ms Jiba and the legal team 
might be the first one which is to allow the witness to testify further 
because he is quite right.  We cannot stop the witness from giving 
evidence in a public domain but then not to give evidence that would 
20 
implicate Ms Jiba and all the – and the other persons whom – who are 
not represented by me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Now Mr Pretorius referred to what he terms 
the principle of Rule 3.3. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 91 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Just briefly I wish to deal with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Can I take us to Rule 3.3 itself and with 
your indulgence DCJ I just want to briefly read it because it is 
important to understand the text of the Rule so that one can appreciate 
the textual context and the principles … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That lies behind it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  It reads as follows: 
“If the Commission’s legal team intends to present 
to the Commission a witness whose evidence 
implicates or may implicate another person it must 
through the Secretary of the Commission notify an 
implicated person in writing within a reasonable 
time before the witness gives evidence.” 
I stress on the word “before”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  3.3.1: 
20 
“So must be given reasonable time before the 
witness gives evidence that he or she …” 
These are the things about which notice had to be given to the 
implicated person. 
“…that he or she is or maybe implicated by the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 92 of 136 
 
witness’ evidence.” 
I understand that the evidence leading team only learnt last night about 
the content of Mr Nxasana’s evidence and so there would not have 
been an opportunity to give prior notice.  Two: 
“In what way he or she is or maybe implicated and 
furnished with him or her with the witness’ 
statement or relevant portions of the statement.” 
Three: 
“Of the date and when - and the venue when the 
witness will give evidence.” 
10 
Four: 
“That he or she may attend the hearing at which the 
witness gives evidence.” 
Five: 
“That he or she may be assisted by legal 
representative when the witness gives evidence.” 
Six: 
“That if he or she wishes to give evidence himself 
or herself to call any witness to give evidence on 
his or her behalf or to cross-examine the witness 
20 
then he or she must within two weeks from the date 
of notice apply in writing to the Commission for 
leave to do so and that the Chairperson will decide 
the application.” 
3.4 then says: 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 93 of 136 
 
“An application in terms of in terms of Rule 3.3.6 
must be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the 
Commission within 14 calendar days from the date 
of the notice referred to in Rule 3.3.  The 
application must be accompanied by a statement 
from the implicated person responding to the 
witness’ statement insofar as it implicates him or 
her.  The statement must make it clear what parts of 
the witness’ statement are disputed or denied and 
the grounds upon which those parts are disputed or 
10 
denied.” 
And lastly this is the last part I am going to read. 
“If an implicated person believes …” 
And this is the part that I understand the DCJ was dealing with. 
“If 
an 
implicated 
person 
believes 
that 
the 
Commission’s legal team did not give him or her 
notice referred to in Rule 3.3 within a reasonable 
time before the witness could or was to give 
evidence and that this may be prejudicial to him or 
her he or she may apply …” 
20 
That is the implicated person. 
“…may apply to the Commission for such order as 
will ensure that he or she is not seriously 
prejudiced.” 
That is why I am here.

CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  There is nothing in Rule 3.5 that says that 
application must be in writing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  And of course since the legal team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you might wish to look towards the end of the 
Rules … 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For something that might say any application 
provided here needs to be (indistinct) application. 
10 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I seem to think there is something along those lines 
but … 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anyway you – you … 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  I – I appreciate that DCJ … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  But given … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Circumstances … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  When one learns of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Evidence that might implicate a person … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 95 of 136 
 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  On the morning effectively five minutes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Before the beginning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  It is impossible … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That one would be able to put that in 
writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Now this – the Rule as I have read talks 
10 
about the statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Of the witness likely to implicate the 
implicated person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Notice of the statement being given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  It does not say notice of evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Being given. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  So it is to the statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That the implicated person is to respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 96 of 136 
 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  The reason I make this submission is this 
Mr Pretorius in his second option that Mr Nxasana may testify on all 
and sundry including evidence - as I understand it – evidence that may 
implicate Ms Jiba subject to Ms Jiba been given an opportunity in due 
course to come and place her own version before the Commission.  
Now the Rules 3.3 to 3.5 as I have read it does not seem to me to 
countenance such a proposition because it deals with statement.  It 
does not with evidence and if a witness is permitted to make or to give 
evidence that implicates a witness who has not been given notice and 
then is given an opportunity to come and place evidence later the 
10 
damage is long done because as we all know we are all members of 
society.  We watch television.  We read newspapers.  Whatever is said 
by a witness especially in this Commission - at least it has been my 
observation – is any allegation - not even proven evidence - any 
allegation that is made against a person is taken by society to the truth 
before it is even tested and so by the time in due course Ms Jiba comes 
to test that evidence it is too late.  Now Chairperson there is a fear that 
the legal team and Ms Jiba has and I appreciate your explanation of 
how Mr Nxasana came to testify today.  It is the timing of the evidence 
the concern is that the President has relieved Ms Jiba of her duties as 
20 
the Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions but that that 
decision still needs to be considered by the National Assembly.  Now 
there is a debate about whether the National Assembly needs to 
approve the President’s decision or it is simply a rubber stamp.  I have 
not studied that but it certainly has to be considered by the National 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 97 of 136 
 
Assembly and so the fear is that any evidence that implicates Ms Jiba 
without her having been given prior notice may colour those 
considerations by members of the National Assembly.  We do not know 
yet when the National Assembly will consider this.  We have the State 
of the Nation Address coming up in a couple of days’ time.  I do not 
imagine that is a platform for this sort of thing to happen.  So in short 
Deputy Chief Justice we without having taken instructions but I imagine 
this might be a practical way to go about it.  The first option that 
Mr Pretorius suggested which is to lead Mr Nxasana in evidence except 
the evidence of the implicated people who have not been given notice.  
10 
There was one last thing which I forget now.  Well if I forget it could not 
have been that important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  DCJ unless there are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Other questions that you want to put to me 
those are my submissions for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I just want to confirm again that as far as I 
know the only reason Mr Nxasana is here is because I gave directions 
that a number of witnesses be called and he was among those and – 
20 
and it was not the first time that I said he should be called.  Already 
last year I had said he should be called and I think some attempts were 
made but it did not happen. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Early this year I had said he should be called and 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 98 of 136 
 
some attempts may have been made and did not succeed. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he might have had nothing to do with … 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Him being here and Ms Jiba maybe or his evidence 
been at – at a particular time nor would the legal team really or the 
Commission have anything to do with that and from my side as I 
indicated earlier on and you were not here with all the allegations 
about what has been happening at the NPA this Commission cannot 
finish its work in regard to the law enforcement agencies what has been 
10 
happening without hearing evidence of somebody like Mr Nxasana. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just – I just want to clarify that. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes.  No thank you DCJ.  Deputy Chief 
Justice that thought has come back to me while you were just 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  It is the extent of the evidence that 
Mr Nxasana now maybe led on by Mr Pretorius.  There has been a 
suggestion that if the evidence covers matters that are already in the 
20 
public domain or matters that have already been dealt with in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In judgment. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Affidavits and in judgments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA: 
 
That 
Ms Jiba 
would 
have 
had 
an 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 99 of 136 
 
opportunity to deal with those in any event.  So they should be no 
impediment to Mr Nxasana testifying to those issues.  The difficulty 
with that ordinarily I have – I would have no difficulty with it but the 
difficulty in these circumstances … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Is I do not know what evidence he is going 
to testify to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That is already in the public domain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That is the one thing and so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  One needs to do to perform this exercise of 
looking … 
CHAIRPESON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  At what is already in the public domain to 
which Mr Nxasana will testify to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  And so one would not raise any objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  So the exercise that needs to be performed 
is look at what is in the public domain and what is new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Standing now here before you I do not 
know what is new what is in the public domain … 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 100 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  And so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  It seems to be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Reasonable and practical to allow the legal 
team to perform that exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Had we known that Mr Nxasana is going to 
be testifying today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  We probably would have performed that 
exercise already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  We cannot now be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Penalised … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  And be expected to sit in the Commission.  
I could sit … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  On a watching brief … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  To listen to what is been led to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 101 of 136 
 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  But since I do not know what is already in 
the public domain I cannot stand up and object or tug my learned friend 
by the sleeve of his jacket and say well hang on a second. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That is not in the public domain because I 
do not know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  And so Deputy Chief Justice I would 
request … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That the first option that Mr Pretorius 
suggested … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Which is and I would add this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That that evidence should subtract any 
evidence that implicates Mr Nxasana with it is in the public domain or 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Jiba. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Ms – did I say? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say Mr Nxasana. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Oh I am sorry.  Mr Nxasana does not seem 
to here implicate.  Any evidence that implicates Ms Jiba should be held 
back.  I am not saying it should excised or not dealt with.  It should be 
held back.  The opportunity for dealing with such evidence at this forum 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 102 of 136 
 
will come.  It may be next week.  I do not know what the – what the 
schedule of the Commission is.  It may be next week.  It may be in two 
weeks’ time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  By that time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  The legal team for Ms Jiba would have 
performed all these exercises … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  And therefore … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  The matter can continue without any 
discomfort from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Ms Jiba’s team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As we speak what I am inclined to allow is 
Mr Pretorius first option which you – you have no problem with but 
when I say that I am inclined to say there should be no problem if the 
evidence includes evidence or it includes matters that have been dealt 
with in court judgments or affidavits filed in – in court on matters that 
20 
are in the public domain already in respect of which whether it is 
Ms Jiba or the former President or Mr Mrwebi where they would have 
had a chance to deal with.  In regard to the point you make namely that 
as you stand there you do not know what those may be because you 
have not had a chance to have a look I am wondering whether there will 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 103 of 136 
 
be no problem if we proceed on the basis that Mr Pretorius would be 
cautious to look at – to deal – to lead the witness in regard to matters 
that fall with that - within that and you might not be aware of it as long 
as it can be shown that there – there are matters that are dealt within 
judgments or in affidavits that have been in court and so on and then to 
the – and therefore that for now there should not be any new matters 
dealt with that implicate the persons who have not been covered in that 
way but that when Mr Nxasana comes back everybody who is implicated 
has had a chance then they can - he can cover all new matters.  That is 
the inclination I have.  What do you say about that? 
10 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes Deputy Chief Justice far be it for me to 
doubt my learned friend Mr Pretorius’ intentions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Or integrity – I even hesitate to bring in the 
word integrity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  I am quite confident that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  He will do precisely that and steer off … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Away from new matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Might it not be a sort of belt and racist job 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 104 of 136 
 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  To request Mr Pretorius to when he puts 
such questions to Mr Nxasana that have previously been or dealing with 
matters that are previously of reason … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  On affidavit or in judgments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Perhaps prefix the question.  I know it may 
be a tough ask … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Because he maybe he did not prepare it 
10 
that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  To prefix the question with Mr Nxasana in 
the matter of so and so in the judgment without citing a particular 
paragraph … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  This matter was dealt with can I ask you 
this question then ask him or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  In a particular affidavit in a matter this was 
20 
dealt with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  So that when I keep my note … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  I know exactly which judgment to go to … 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 105 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  To satisfy myself and the legal team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  That that matter was indeed – had indeed 
been dealt with previously and that it is not new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I – I think what we would be important is that 
the witness’ evidence is limited to those parameters. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether Mr Pretorius refers to which affidavit and 
which matter and so on and so on if he – if he can.  I am sure there is 
10 
no problem but if he is not able to as long as in due course you can be 
informed … 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say that related to that.  That related to that.  So 
as long as that can be done it should be fine. 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  No I am happy with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are?  You would be happy with that? 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  I think we proceed.  Mr Pretorius… 
ADV VUYANI NGALWANA:  Thank you Deputy Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Ngalwana.  Mr Pretorius what do you … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Say that is the inclination I have but you have 
(intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just a little more briefly than 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 106 of 136 
 
what has occurred so far.  The first thing is you will make an order.  I 
will abide by that order.  I cannot abide by suggestions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In regard to what would be 
appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no but I want to hear what you have to say 
about suggestions. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So let me do that then.  
Firstly it is important to place on record this issue of timing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is a suggestion that the 
witness’ evidence has been timed intentionally or unintentionally … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I do not know how you time 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Evidence unintentionally … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In order to prejudice Ms Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let me state quite clearly that is 
not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I can give the Chair an 
assurance and … 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 107 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And as you know Chair it was at 
your direction that this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I have made that quite clear. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That this happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event the timing was not 
a choice of the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The timing was imposed … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
On 
the 
witness 
by 
the 
Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At your request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He had nothing to do with it at 
all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The third is that in any even the 
20 
consequences of evidence being led under oath or under affirmation at 
a public inquiry of this nature would inevitably affect other issues in 
other jurisdictions and that must be so.  Those consequences can never 
be an excuse or a grond for not leading evidence that we are obliged to 
lead here by virtue of statute but that is not an issue that we need do 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 108 of 136 
 
any more than note for the present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second point that we would 
like to emphasis as a legal team Chair is the very nature of a public 
inquiry.  It involves encouraging witnesses to come forward, to give 
evidence within its terms of reference.  It is inevitable the statute 
contemplates that the terms of reference contemplated the regulations 
contemplated the rules contemplated that persons will be implicated by 
evidence adverse to that – to that persons interests.  It is the very stuff 
of this inquiry that evidence would be led implicating other persons in 
10 
many cases negatively or adversely.  That principle cannot be 
undermined by any order that you would make Chair or anything that 
the legal team could agree to.  Provided witnesses are treated fairly 
and those rules are there for that purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Chair all we submit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the principle must remain 
sacrosanct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That witnesses must not be 
prevented from giving such evidence as they are entitled to give 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but remember Mr Ngalwana also made it clear 
that they are not seeking to prevent the leading of evidence … 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 109 of 136 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just the timing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No that is – that is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then a solution that we will 
reach … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That principle will be met but the 
public out there is listening to this argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It can never be the case that the 
public should be discouraged … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  From coming forward to give 
their evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fear that prior to their giving 
evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They will somehow come under 
20 
some sort of judicial or other attack and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Somehow their influence will – 
their evidence will be influenced in that way.  So the principle that must 
remain sacrosanct – we submit – is that witnesses must believe that 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 110 of 136 
 
they are free to come here and give evidence whatever its 
consequences and however damaging it may be to other people and I 
believe in the solution we have reached that is sacrosanct.  It is 
subject only to one duty and that is the duty of the Commission to act 
fairly and that we are trying to do in that case.  The last point that I 
would like to make Chair is that I will obviously abide by your ruling but 
the intention is not to deal with anything beyond the interactions that 
gave rise to the many court applications and decisions of the court and 
in fact insofar as a judgment deals with a particular issue one may 
assume that that is in the public domain.  It is a matter (indistinct) 
10 
thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to emphasise again that the Commission 
seeks to strike a balance between various or among various interests 
and one of these is that it seeks to ensure fairness to all parties 
including implicated persons.  I have made it clear over the past year 
or so both in media briefings and in this venue that implicated persons 
will be dealt with fairly as well.  They must be dealt with fairly and that 
nobody will have findings made against them just because of what the 
media maybe saying about them or against them.  Any findings that will 
be made will be made on the basis of evidence led in the Commission 
20 
and throughout we continue to try and be fair to everybody.  I thought I 
must just emphasise that and again to the extent that there may have 
been any thinking that Mr Nxasana – Mr Nxasana’s being here is timed 
by anybody to coincide with anything.  Again I indicate that he was 
called because I gave directions that he and certain other witnesses 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 111 of 136 
 
whom we are not mentioning now be called and I have been told that 
some of them are not available.  So they will – may have to be called 
later.  So we will continue to have situations where a person who is 
implicated or not implicated but a person who in the view of the 
Commission has knowledge or information that may be helpful in the 
inquiry of the Commission maybe called to come and give evidence.  So 
it is not the last time that a person is called to give evidence because 
the Chairperson so directs but fairness to all implicated persons is very 
important but as I say there is fairness that must be taken into account 
together with all practicalities and constraints that the Commission has 
10 
– within which the Commission must operate.  So what I am – these are 
just remarks that I consider important to make.  With regard to how we 
proceed I confirm that we are going to follow the option – option one 
that Mr Pretorius mentioned with which Mr Ngalwana does not have a 
problem subject to the remarks he made and on the understanding that 
I believe we – all three of us have achieved here in this open hearing in 
terms of also matters that may be in the public domain by way of court 
judgments and affidavits filed in court and Mr Pretorius in leading the 
evidence of the witness will be – will bear that in mind as he leads the 
evidence of the witness.  Of particular importance in this case is that 
20 
the legal team was not able to give notice even to say Mr Nxasana 
would be giving evidence.  Sometimes there may be a situation where 
notice was given of – in terms of Rule 3.3 of the Rules of the 
Commission but the 14 days did not lapse.  That might fall under a 
different considerations.  So Mr Nxasana will have to come back at – on 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 112 of 136 
 
a later date to finalise his evidence that would cover any matters that 
will fall outside of the parameters that I have indicated as discussed 
here at the opening hearing with Mr Pretorius and Mr Ngalwana.  That 
is how we are going to proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would like to take a five minute adjournment and 
then we will – we will continue.  We will just take a five minute 
adjournment.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Chair a housekeeping matter, 
I’ve decided to deal with something that I had intended to deal with at 
the conclusion of the witnesses’ evidence and that’s the Constitutional 
Court judgment, one can safely assume that matters commented on by 
the Constitutional Court and contained in the judgement, particularly 
are matters in the public domain.  They do not, in any event, implicate 
Ms Jiba or any other individual apart from the former President in any 
sense at all and those are merely comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well you are, of course, not suggesting that what 
20 
you mean is whatever it is you are going to refer to is something that 
has been said by the Court and is in the public domain…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And all parties concerned have 
and an opportunity to present their versions, argue fully and the result 
of all that process in the highest Court is what I’m going to refer to.

CHAIRPERSON:     Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Chair in addition to that Mr 
Nxasana himself raises a concern that he’s here at some personal cost 
and at the request of the Commission, volunteered to come forward and 
given that his evidence may now stretch over to another day it’s a 
matter of some concern and I would just wish to place that on record it 
was communicated to me during the recent short adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes maybe before you proceed let me talk to him.  
Mr Nxasana, it appears that it’s inevitable that you may have to come 
back, now Mr Pretorius tells me that you are concerned about that.  It 
10 
doesn’t mean you’ll come back tomorrow so you may have intended to 
spend only today at the Commission but in terms of when you come 
back your availability would be looked at as well.  Does your concern 
remain, notwithstanding? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes Chair it remains 
Chair, notwithstanding.  Chair as I have explained that I run a practice 
and unfortunately I’m a sole proprietor of my practice, my practice is 
suffering as I am here.  In fact, I’ve been here, not only today, two days 
already. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Including yesterday. 
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Including yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     And they say that it is 
inevitable and it’s anticipated that I’ll have to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes – no I think it’s unfortunate that this is the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 114 of 136 
 
situation and I appreciate what you are talking about when you are a 
sole practitioner in a legal firm when you are not there you are not 
earning income and there are people that you have to pay at the end of 
the month, there are bills to be paid but the legal team may have to 
have a look, I mean, if somebody goes to give evidence in Court, 
there’s provision for witness fees and I would imagine that the 
Commission should have similar provisions that are applicable to it.  I 
don’t know what limits there are but I would have imagined that they 
should be – their rate should be such that it should, as far as personal, 
place the person – the witness in the position he or she would have 
10 
been in if she had not been called to come and give evidence but I 
think that probably at this stage there’s nothing more one can say other 
than that, that avenue should be explored that might not fully cover 
your situation but it might go to a certain point, is that right? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes I think that must be explored, I can see no 
reason why there wouldn’t be a similar provision applicable to the 
Commission but the legal team can look into that and you can be in 
touch with them. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Thank you Chair.  
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Well look at the applicable law. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes look at the applicable law ja, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Chair the final 
matter is that, Mr Nxasana is booked on a flight at 7 o’clock so if we 
may because we’re going to come back another day anyway, adjourn at 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 115 of 136 
 
the normal time. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja that’s fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:     One second Mr Pretorius, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Nxasana 
at page 11 of your statement you deal with the circumstances giving 
rise to your ultimate suspension by the President.  For the moment 
we’re not going to deal with the evidence that you intended leading 
concerning the circumstances which say – which you say would have 
explained or would explain the President’s actions because those are 
10 
matters which implicate other parties. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes but just for 
correction I wasn’t ultimately suspended, just for the record. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes there was an intention to 
suspend and that was the subject matter of litigation. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   I’m sorry if I put it that way. You 
also deal with the step that you took to ensure that in any process that 
20 
occurred in relation to your employment you attempted to ensure that 
you would receive a fair hearing. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You deal with the inquiry that 
was intended to be held under Advocate Nazeer Cassim. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 116 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   We won’t go into that for the 
moment simply because I’d like to keep the evidence in its proper 
sequence. You then deal with the situation at the NPA during your term 
of office which has been a subject of comment by the Courts and 
concerns the conduct of persons who are implicated by your statement. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   I’m not going to test the fine 
distinctions between what are facts within your knowledge that haven’t 
been canvassed in Court and what evidence has been canvassed in 
10 
Court, that’s perhaps too fine a distinction to draw at this stage.  So 
what I’d like to do is, just to place on record as is common knowledge 
that you ultimately entered into what has been termed, a settlement 
agreement. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   That settlement agreement 
involved payment to you of a sum of money. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   That issue came before the 
Courts and what came before the Courts were not only the terms of the 
20 
settlement agreement but the fact of the settlement agreement, the 
circumstances in which it took place and its lawfulness. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   That litigation of which you 
were a part but not the principle applicant finally found its way to the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 117 of 136 
 
Constitutional Court. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And in a judgment of the 
Constitutional Court which is contained in the bundle at page 85 the 
Constitutional 
Court 
dealt 
with 
the 
evidence 
placed 
before 
it…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     One second Mr Pretorius, thank you, you may 
proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The Constitutional Court dealt 
with the evidence that had been placed before it, dealt with the 
10 
judgements of the Court below and came to its own findings in relation 
to the issues before it, principally matters relevant to the National 
Prosecuting Authority and in particular relevant to the eventual ending 
of your term of office. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is so Chair.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And I’d like to go there directly 
if I may, to deal with, firstly some general comments made by the 
majority of the Court under the hand of Madlanga J, Justice Madlanga 
and if one can go to paragraph six.  The Constitutional Court and its 
majority there says, and that’s at page –sorry Chair, that’s at page 92 
20 
of the bundle where the background is dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph six reads, 
 
“The event that are at the centre of these proceedings are in 
 
the public domain, the judgment of the High Court notes that it 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 118 of 136 
 
 
was common cause before that Court that since September 
 
2007 the recent history at the NPA, and it quotes the judgment 
 
of the High Court, has been one of paralysing instability”, 
 
That is the quote, that judgment gives detail of that history. If 
we may go then to paragraph seven it reads, 
 
“In 
July 
2014 
within 
about 
only 
nine 
months 
of 
his 
 
appointment, a process calculated to remove Mr Nxasana 
 
commenced”,  
 
That process would have been the substance of your evidence 
today. 
10 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   In the main at least, 
 
“The then President, the judgment continues, Mr Jacob Zuma 
 
informed Mr Nxasana of his intention to institute an inquiry 
 
into his fitness to hold office, this was followed by a notice 
 
that the former President was considering suspending Mr 
 
Nxasana pending finalisation of he inquiry.  The former 
 
President said that suspension was necessary in order to 
 
maintain the integrity and good administration of the NPA”, 
 
Your evidence would have dealt with that contention in some 
20 
detail because you, in your evidence, would have today, and will in the 
future give evidence regarding what you regard as the true reasons for 
what occurred. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The notice also specified that 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 119 of 136 
 
the inquiry sought to establish whether certain issues were consonant 
with the conscientiousness and integrity of an incumbent in the office of 
the National Director of Public Prosecutions as required by the NPA 
Act, we’ve referred to that section of the constitution already Mr 
Nxasana. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The issues were,  
 
“Mr Nxasana previous criminal conviction for violent conduct 
 
allegedly unbecoming and divisive comments which had the 
 
effect of bringing the NPA into disrepute made by Mr Nxasana 
10 
 
 
and reported in the media and alleged non-disclosure 
 
of facts and circumstances of prosecutions which Mr Nxasana 
 
had faced previously”. 
 
Now in your evidence you will go into some detail in regard to 
these issues, in particular the lack of particularity that you alleged in 
Court proceedings you had been subjected to. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And in fact reference is made to 
that in the latter part of paragraph eight on page 94 of the bundle 
where the Constitutional Court says, 
20 
 
“Mr Nxasana approached the High Court seeking an order 
 
compelling former President Zuma to provide the required 
 
particularity 
and interdicting 
the 
former 
President 
from 
 
suspending 
him 
until 
he had 
furnished 
him 
with 
this 
 
particularity”, 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 120 of 136 
 
 
That particularity, Mr Nxasana is that to which we have just 
referred. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The application was not – that 
application was not pursued to finality, the former President changed 
tact in late 2014, he proposed that the dispute between him and Mr 
Nxasana be mediated, Mr Nxasana acceded to this proposal, is that 
correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And then paragraph nine which 
10 
is on page 94 of the exhibit EE reads, 
 
“It appears from a letter written on 10 December 2014 by 
 
attorneys acting for Mr Nxasana that former President had 
 
engaged Mr Nxasana to get him to agree to vacate office.  In 
 
the letter Mr Nxasana made it plain that he did not want to 
 
vacate office as there was no basis for him to.  He stated that 
 
he would, however, consider stepping down only if he 
 
was fully compensated for the remainder of the contract 
 
period”, 
 
Is that a correct record of the facts as far as you are 
20 
concerned, I will give you an opportunity to expand on it in a moment. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes that is a correct 
record. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   At issue in the litigation -  in 
part at least was whether you had requested the former President to be 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 121 of 136 
 
allowed to vacate office or whether you were compelled to vacate office 
against your will but subject to certain conditions.  If I put it correctly, 
it’s now your opportunity to place the issues in dispute before the 
Chair. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Okay thank you, Chair, I 
at no stage did I make a request o vacate the office to the former 
President Mr Jacob Zuma and that letter of the 10 t h that is referred to 
here, I was also involved in drafting that letter confirming the 
discussion that we’d had with the President and the company – 
President and Mr Harley together with my legal representative, 
10 
therefore the Court found, correctly, that I did not make any request, I 
never made that request. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The position is summarised in 
paragraph 12 of the Constitutional Court judgment and that appears at 
page 95 of Bundle EE – Exhibit EE it reads, 
 
“It must be noted that right from the onset and throughout the 
 
entire negotiation process that culminated in the settlement 
 
agreement, Mr Nxasana unequivocally stated that he did not 
 
wish to resign and that he considered himself to be fit for 
 
office, instead his preference was for former President Zuma’s 
20 
 
allegation that he was no longer fit for office, to be tested in a 
 
formal inquiry as proposed by the former President”, 
 
Is that the proposed Cassim inquiry? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The summary of the judgment 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 122 of 136 
 
continues, or the judgment continues rather, 
 
“Throughout he protested the existence of a factual or legal 
 
basis for him to vacate office, also he disavowed any 
 
invocation by him in Section 12 (8) of the NPA Act to 
 
voluntarily vacate office.  It is so, of course that he did 
 
indicate that he would resign only if he was paid the full salary 
 
for the remainder of his term of office”. 
 
Does that fairly summarise the position as far as you are 
aware? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is correct, it fairly 
10 
summarises the position. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Then there are some general 
comments Chair, which I think it is appropriate to place before you 
because the evidence that will be led by the legal team deals 
pertinently with these issues and these comments of the Constitutional 
Court are instructive and very important for the work of the Commission 
and if I may place them on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes you may do so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   At paragraph 18 the 
Constitutional Court says, 
20 
 
“The importance of the office of NDPP in the administration of 
 
justice is underscored and amplified by no less an instrument 
 
than the Constitution itself.  Section 1794 of the Constitution 
 
requires that there be National legislation which guarantees 
 
the independence of the Prosecuting Authority. Lower down the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 123 of 136 
 
 
paragraph it reads, Section 1794 provides that National 
 
legislation must ensure that the NPA exercises its functions 
 
without fear, favour or prejudice, that legislation is the NPA 
 
Act.  Predictably Section 32(1) A of the NPA Act requires 
 
members of the Prosecuting Authority to carry out their duties 
 
without fear, favour or prejudice and subject only to the 
 
Constitution and the law”. 
 
Paragraph 19 reads, 
 
“This Court has said of the NPA’s independence “there is a 
 
Constitutional guarantee of independence” and any legislation 
10 
 
or executive action inconsistent there with would be subject to 
 
Constitutional control by the Courts.  The reason why this 
 
guarantee of dependence exists is not far to seek.  The NPA 
 
plays a pivotal role in the administration of criminal justice 
 
with a malleable corrupt or dysfunctional Prosecuting Authority 
 
many criminals, specially those holding position of influence 
 
will rarely, if ever answer for their criminal deeds.  Equally 
 
functionaries within that Prosecuting Authority may, as Casak 
 
submitted be “pressured” into pursuing prosecutions to 
 
advance a political agenda.  All this is antithetical to the rule 
20 
 
of law a founding value of the Republic.  Also Malleability,  
 
corruption 
and 
dysfunctionality 
are 
at 
odds 
with 
the 
 
Constitution and junction of prosecuting without fear, favour or 
 
prejudice.  They are thus at variance with the Constitutional 
 
requirement of the independence of the NPA. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 124 of 136 
 
 
It continues, at the centre of any functioning Constitutional 
 
democracy as a well functioning criminal justice system, in 
 
democratic alliance, Jacoub ADC J observed that the office of 
 
the NDPP “is located at the core of delivering criminal justice”, 
 
if you subvert the criminal justice system, you subvert the rule 
 
of law and Constitutional democracy itself.  Unsurprisingly the 
 
NPA Act proscribes improper interference with the performance 
 
of prosecutorial duties.  Section 31 (1) B provides, subject to 
 
the Constitution and this Act, no organ of State and no member 
 
or employee of an organ of State nor any other person shall 
10 
 
improperly interfere with, hinder or obstruct the Prosecuting 
 
Authority or any member thereof in the exercise, carrying out 
 
or performance of its, his or her powers, duties and functions”. 
 
And then the Court makes some further comments relevant to 
your evidence Mr Nxasana and generally relevant to the evidence that 
will be led and the concerns raised by this Commission.  At paragraph 
21, which is on page 98 of Exhibit EE it reads, 
 
“Improper interference may take any number of forms without 
 
purporting to be exhaustive it may come as downright 
 
intimidation, 
it 
may 
consist 
in 
improper 
promises 
or 
20 
 
inducements, it may take the form of corruptly influencing the 
 
decision making or functioning of the NPA.  All these forms and 
 
others are proscribed by an Act that gets its authority to 
 
guarantee 
prosecutorial 
independence 
directly 
from 
the 
 
Constitution.  Paragraph 22 reads, another guarantee of the 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 125 of 136 
 
 
NDPP’s independence is provision for security of tenure.  In 
 
Section 12 (1) the NPA Act provides that the NDPP shall hold 
 
office for a ten year non renewable term of office.  It is now 
 
well established in terms of this Court’s jurisprudence that 
 
security of tenure is an integral feature of the Constitutional 
 
requirement of independence. In justice alliance, and the 
 
reference is given to that case, this Court held that 
 
“international standards acknowledge that guaranteed tenure 
 
and conditions of service adequately secured by law are 
 
amongst the conditions necessary to secure and promote the 
10 
 
independence of judges”, these necessary conditions must of 
 
course be true of the independence of the NPA as well.  In a 
 
unanimous judgment in McBride Bossialo AJ said, amongst 
 
fact said that amongst the factors that are relevant to the 
 
independence of offices or institutions which in terms of 
 
constitutional prescripts must be independent are “the method 
 
of 
appointment, 
the 
method 
of 
reporting, 
disciplinary 
 
proceedings and the method of removal from office and 
 
security of tenure”,  
 
And we’re here dealing with Mr Nxasana in your case with the 
20 
removal of yourself from office and the circumstance’s in which that 
took place and the lawfulness of that set of events.  There is further 
comment relevant to the previous comment in paragraph 23 which 
reads, 
 
“The NPA Act has two other salient features that help shield 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 126 of 136 
 
 
the 
NPA 
from 
improper 
interference 
namely 
the 
non-
 
renewability of the ten-year term of office of the NDPP and 
 
certain safeguards on the removal of the NDPP from office”, 
 
And then the various methods that provide for – are provided 
for termination of the office of the NDPP are dealt with.  It goes on to 
say in paragraph 24 that, the manner in which your office was vacated 
Mr Nxasana was not Constitutionally compliant and you recorded in the 
judgment as having accepted that, is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That’s is correct ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And then paragraph 25 certain 
10 
salient comments are made concerning the conduct leading up to your 
vacation of office and paragraph 25 reads, that is on page 100 of the 
judgment, 
“The facts set out above point to one thing and one thing only, 
former President Zuma was bent on getting rid of Mr Nxasan 
by whatever means he could muster, his was an approach that 
kept on mutating, it was first a stick then a carrot a stick once 
more and eventually a carrot.  There was firstly notification 
that Mr Nxasana would be subjected to an inquiry with a view 
to establishing whether he was still a fit and proper person to 
20 
hold office.  Concomitantly there was a threat of suspension 
pending finalisation of the inquiry albeit with full pay.  This 
was followed by former President Zuma’s proposal that there 
be mediation.  When there was no progress on this the inquiry 
was instituted, whilst the inquiry was in its preliminary stages 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 127 of 136 
 
the former President pursued a parallel process in which Mr 
Nxasana was first offered in a draft settlement agreement ten 
million rand.  As indicated earlier he did not accept it.  What 
plainly evinces how desperate former President Zuma was to 
get rid of Mr Nxasana, is that this was followed by a draft 
settlement in which the amount was left blank.  Mr Nxasana 
was being told to pick whatever figure, indeed Mr Halie said 
that he would “await the final amount from Mr Nxasana” and 
then the question is asked in paragraph 27, instead of settling 
for so huge an amount, why did the former President not 
10 
simply pursue the inquiry, did he not believe that the evidence 
that had motivated him to come up with the idea of an inquiry 
was sufficiently cogent, if so why did he not just abandon the 
inquiry and leave Mr Nxasana in office, after all he was 
exercising his powers as President and not involved in a 
personal dispute which he could settle as he pleased.  It is 
difficult to comprehend why he would have settled on so huge 
an amount from public coffers to boot.” 
It continues in paragraph 28, the inference is inescapable that he was 
effectively buying Mr Nxasana out of office, in my book conduct of that 
20 
nature compromises the independence of the office of NDPP, it 
conduces to the removal of troublesome or  otherwise unwanted NDPP’s 
through buying them out of office  by offering them obscenely huge 
amounts of money”. 
 
Then in addition to those comments, certain comments are 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 128 of 136 
 
made in regard to your own conduct in accepting the amount of the 
settlement and I’ll come to that in a moment Mr Nxasana but as far as 
you know, is that a fair summary of the facts that were at least placed 
before – and I’m excluding any opinion now that may have emerged 
from the judgment, I’m just relating the facts. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes, it’s a fair remark that 
is contained here. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   I know that you are more 
empathic with the minority judgment. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which we will come to in a 
moment and explain the differences, but your evidence then not only 
deals with the termination of your office as NDPP but the real reasons 
that you allege existed which caused your office to be ended.  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And that evidence would 
implicate certain individuals. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Certain individuals yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And it is to those individuals 
that notice will be given and in relation to whom you will give evidence 
20 
in due course.  
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     That is so Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   But as I understand that 
evidence it is such that there is an explanation for the conduct which 
led to your, the termination of your services? 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 129 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   I must put before you the 
comments of Justice Madlanga in paragraph 85 of the judgment, those 
are clear on page 123 of the bundle Chair.  In the latter part of 
paragraph 85 Justice Madlanga says the following: 
“Effectively although Mr Nxasana strongly protested his fitness 
for office he was saying he was willing to be bought out of 
offices if the price was right.  As much as I sympathise with 
him I do not think that is the reaction expected of the holder of 
so high and important an office.  An office the holder of which 
10 
if he or she is truly independent is required to display utmost 
fortitude and resilience.  Even allowing for human frailties, 
because Mr Nxasana is human after all, I do not think the  
holder of the office of NDPP could not reasonably have been 
expected to do better.  His conduct leads me to the conclusion 
that a just and equitable remedy is not to allow him to return to 
office.” 
Having decided as the Constitutional Court did that the termination of 
your services was unlawful the further question arose in relation to 
which the majority and the minority disagreed.   
20 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And that was whether you 
should be allowed to return to office.  In fairness you should be entitled 
to comment now that that evidence is on record, or that judgment is on 
record. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 130 of 136 
 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes Chair.  Are you asking 
me to comment? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, if you wish to. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Yes, thanks. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   It’s an adverse comment and 
therefore in fairness you should be allowed to put your own opinion 
before the court, before the judge, before the Chair. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Firstly Chair as things 
were going on and that have been going on after I left office I felt that 
had this matter come before the Constitutional Court after this 
10 
Commission was constituted and after the other Commission of Inquiry 
had been constituted I strongly believe that the majority in the 
Constitutional Court would have come to a different conclusion.  That is 
my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in relation to whether you should be 
reinstated or not? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    Perhaps ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Not in regard to the main issue in regard to remedy, 
20 
in other words. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:    To remedy, Chair I felt 
that the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I’m sorry, I may be confusing you. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Yes. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 131 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to make sure that I understand where you 
locate your comments, you have just said that you felt or feel that had 
the Constitutional Court considered that matter after this Commission 
and after the Mokgoro Inquiry ...(intervention)   
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   Mokgoro Commission, 
inquiry yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They may have come to a different conclusion. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   That’s my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m just asking whether the conclusion you are talking 
about is with regard to whether you should be reinstated or not or are 
10 
you talking about the main conclusion on the matter. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:   I believe that the 
conclusion would have been the same as the conclusion reached by the 
minority judgment that I should be reinstated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   If we have time we will get 
there in a moment.  Just to place the judgment of the majority in proper 
context its reasoning at least in part is in paragraph 87 which appears 
on page 124, bundle EE, EXHIBIT EE, it reads: 
“The narrative at the beginning of this judgment shows that for 
20 
a few years there has been instability in the office of NDPP, 
and therefore in the leadership of the NPA.  With the Court 
challenge to Mr Nxasana’s vacation of office and to the 
appointment of Advocate Abrahams that instability persist to 
this day.” 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 132 of 136 
 
The second judgment, that’s the minority judgment, accepts correctly 
that it would be open to the President to initiate an inquiry into the 
manner in which Mr Nxasana vacated office renders him unfit to hold 
office.  The order proposed by the second judgment thus has the effect 
of prolonging the instability.  The second judgment proposed that you 
should be allowed to return or as a matter of law that your contract 
should continue, in fact that is effect of the judgment. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:     Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Relying on the former President 
of the Labour Court reasoning that where a dismissal is invalid and 
10 
unlawful nothing needs to be done, the employment contract just 
continues, Zondo, JA, I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing)  Well there has never been a Zondo , JA.   
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   President of the Labour Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Zondo, JP. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   JP yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The order proposed by the 
second judgment that has the effect of prolonging the instability, so it 
20 
seems that part of the reasoning of the majority was that the instability 
by allowing you to return and the majority felt it had a discretion in that 
regard, which should be exercised in favour of the conclusion that you 
should not be allowed to return, the concern was one of stability at the 
NPA.   
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 133 of 136 
 
 
And then one of the further results of the judgment of the 
Constitutional Court is that the appointment of Advocate Abrahams was 
declared invalid and the President was directed to appoint a 
replacement for Advocate Sean Abrahams. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If I may then just briefly go to 
the order, you were ordered then to repay the amount received by 
yourself less tax, is that correct? 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then in the minority 
10 
judgment after a long debate over the consequences of a declaration of 
invalidity in regard to termination of an employment contract the 
conclusion is reached at paragraph 112 by the minority, which is at 
page 134 of the bundle Chair, where Justice Jaftha stated: 
“In the present matter there is nothing exceptional or 
extraordinary that warrants the exercise of remedial power to 
prevent Mr Nxasana from returning to office.  His return will 
certainly not cause a constitutional crises or a national crises.  
On the contrary his return would enable the President to follow 
the law if he wishes to remove him from office and Parliament 
20 
would play a vital part in that process, and more importantly 
preventing Mr Nxasana from returning to office without 
pronouncing on the validity of his employment contract would 
not only be unfair to him, but would also create considerable 
uncertainty on the parties rights and interests.  This would be 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 134 of 136 
 
antithetical to the Rule of Law which promotes certainty.” 
And in relation to a just and equitable order the Court found at 
paragraph 128, in the minority page 140: 
“As mentioned allowing Mr Nxasana to go back to his job would 
also meet the objectives of the Constitution and the Rule of 
the Law if he his involvement in the impugned settlement 
agreement brought his fitness to hold office into question he 
may be removed in Section 12 of the NPA Act.” 
For all these reasons says the minority: 
“I do not support the conclusion that Mr Nxasana ought not to 
10 
resume office following the setting aside of the invalid and un 
lawful termination of his appointment.” 
That is in summary what the Constitutional Court found after all the 
evidence had been placed before it, had been considered by the lower 
courts and was finally considered by it and we all know the result.   
 
What remains is for your evidence to clarify the circumstances 
which led to steps being taken to remove you from office, and those will 
be the subject of the further evidence of Mr Nxasana.   
 
Is this a convenient time Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is, subject to just mentioning that the last part 
20 
that you talked about in regard to the judgment comes from the minority 
judgment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what you said at the end might be misunderstood 
as if you are saying that’s what the Court said but what you intended is 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 135 of 136 
 
to say some of the things you have said come from the majority 
judgment and the last bit comes from minority judgment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes the last quotes were all from 
the minority judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay yes we can adjourn now, so Mr 
Nxasana we will adjourn, and it’s on the basis that you would be asked 
to come back and the legal team and yourself liaise with them with 
regard what witness fees or what fees is maybe payable when a witness 
has come to the Commission and because of that he is not able to work 
and earn income.  For somebody who is self-employed it is quite 
10 
important, I am hopeful that there is a provision that would – should 
take care of that, but – you will be asked to come back. 
MR MXOLISI SANDILE OLIVER NXASANA:  Thank you Chair, I will 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but other than that thank you for availing 
yourself and then arrangements will be made as to when you will come 
back and the legal team of the Commission will make sure that 
implicated persons are given Rule 33 notices. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I might just add Chair that 
the Commission’s Act under which we operate was passed at the time 
the currency was still in pounds, so that may favour the witness. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing).  Ja so he might prefer that the 
remuneration be in the currency as stipulated in the Commissions Act 
of 1947. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I think the Interpretation Act may 
have something to say about that, but we did examine it. 
12 JUNE 2019 – DAY 111 
 
Page 136 of 136 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, no thank you very much once again, you are 
excused.   
 
We adjourn, and tomorrow we will start at – what time should 
we ...
