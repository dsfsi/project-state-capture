PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 02 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SONI SC:  We are ready Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Thank you.  Please 
administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Clinton Oellerman. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Not. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR OELLERMAN:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
MR OELLERMAN:  So help me God.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  I do not know 
whether to welcome you Mr Oellerman or not. 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.  Yes thank you. Yes Mr 
Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson can I 
briefly introduce the evidence that Mr Oellerman is going to 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 4 of 224 
 
be giving? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Oellerman has prepared a report and you 
will recall Mr Chairperson arising from Ms Ngoye’s affidavit 
in the Siyangena Review Application questions arose about 
the property transactions that Mr Montana has entered into 
and some of which you have been on air which evidence was 
led in the last two days.  And the question really is, is there 
a connection between the Siyangena contracts and those 
property transactions.  Now what Mr Oellerman has done and 
10 
the question really is, how do we present all of that evidence 
to you and of course to the public in the manner that 
facilitates a proper understanding of all the evidence.  One 
could lead the evidence of 20 witnesses about its sale and 
so on but these are – this is documentary evidence.  Mr 
Oellerman has been at the heart of collecting the documents 
relating to the properties.  And based on that he prepared 
initial reports which dealt with the – the different stages of 
the transactions in respect of each party.  Then about three 
weeks ago Chairperson we were trying to find out how we 
20 
could get the evidence of Mr van der Walt then we found out 
that he had left the country.  And it is then that we required 
of Mr Oellerman who through a subpoena acquired the 
documents that Mr Loubser presented yesterday.  And that 
threw a quite different light on the properties transactions 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 5 of 224 
 
and the possible link with the Siyangena contracts.  Now we 
thought to present that in a manner that puts all the facts in 
perspective and without forming conclusions at this stage it 
puts the facts in perspective Mr Oellerman would draw up a 
report of his investigation as at this stage.  So that is the 
evidence that he is going to lead he’s prepared a detailed 
report and I will go through the report with him.  Now 
Chairperson as a preliminary to that and again in the interest 
of fairness to everybody after Mr Oellerman prepared the 
report reports were served on all if I may call it that 
10 
implicated parties or parties who are possibly mentioned.  
Among them are TMM and Mr Ferreira.  The reports were 
served on them and on Monday or on Tuesday we received a 
note from Mr Ferreira’s and TMM’s lawyers to say but you 
should not lead the evidence of Mr Oellerman because we 
want to present our own evidence on the matter.  But it was 
by way a letter.  The commission wrote back Chairperson to 
say, if you do not want Mr Oellerman’s evidence to be led at 
this stage bring an application as you are entitled to do in 
terms of the rules to say, well postpone it until this date and 
20 
this – the prejudice will be suffering and our approach would 
be if you want more time we will gladly give you more time.  
In fact, we will consult with you next week and you can – we 
can lead all the evidence at the same time.  We received a 
letter this morning or late yesterday Chairperson to say, well 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 6 of 224 
 
they want to apply to cross-examine Mr Oellerman and Mr 
Loubser.  So I place that on record just to indicate that there 
were 
allegations 
that 
it 
would 
be 
unfair 
to 
lead 
Mr 
Oellerman’s evidence at this stage and when we asked for 
the proper procedure to be followed the response is, well we 
want to cross-examine.  Now that is an application that will 
obviously be made to you Chairperson and I will just alert 
you to it but that is where we are at this stage and as far as 
the commission’s legal team in the PRASA stream is 
concerned we are entitled to lead the evidence of Mr 
10 
Oellerman at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much.  Okay.  Let us 
continue. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Mr Oellerman you have heard I have 
explained to the Chairperson the genesis of the report. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can you indicate to the Chairperson in – in 
what your role is in regard to the reports? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess this is – the beginning is his 
20 
relationship with the commission. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is the beginning.  Yes. 
MR 
OELLERMAN:  So 
Chair 
I am 
appointed as 
an 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 7 of 224 
 
investigator at the commission.  I am currently one – leading 
the investigation with the PRASA team looking into various 
contracts involving PRASA and allegations around state 
capture. 
 
The – my involvement with the – with this particular 
matter comes from numerous documents which we looked 
through during the course of our investigation.  Various court 
papers, affidavits which had been obtained in other matters 
prior our investigation.  One of which was of Ms Martha 
Ngoye 
who 
has 
also 
testified 
here 
before 
– 
at 
the 
10 
commission as well. 
 
And one of the affidavits which we – which we looked 
at during the course of investigation was her founding 
affidavit in the Siyangena matter where PRASA had brought 
an application to have the Siyangena contract set aside.  
One of the key matters which Ms Ngoye raised in the 
affidavit on why the contract should be set aside were 
related to certain financial dealings between the PRASA’s 
Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr Lucky Montana and an 
attorney Mr Riaan Van Der Walt who had represented 
20 
Siyangena on various matters in the past. 
 
In fact, Ms Ngoye in the affidavit went so far as to 
say that a criminal docket had been opened at – at Brooklyn 
police station as a result of what they referred potentially 
corrupt activities.   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 8 of 224 
 
 
These activities actually refer to related or to 
financial – the financial dealings which she referred related 
to four property transactions involved Mr Montana and Mr 
van Der Walt in which four properties were purchased.   
 
First of all, it was – three properties were purchased 
and one property was purchased from Mr Montana.  The four 
properties evidence has been led at the commission on 
these properties.  That is the Parkwood property, a property 
in Waterkloof, a property in Sandhurst and a property in 
Burlingham. 
10 
 
What is also mentioned is whilst these financial 
dealing were taking place Siyangena was at the same time 
during the same period engaged in extending or having an 
addendum to their contract concluded with – they were in 
negotiations with PRASA to have that contract extended to 
the value of just over R8 million I think it is R294 million.   
 
And because of this it was alleged that the – these 
relationships in which these parties as contractor and 
service provider raised significant red flags because of what 
– of these financial dealings that were involved as well. 
20 
 
We 
have 
then 
subsequently 
reviewed 
the 
documentation, 
obtained 
further 
documents 
during 
the 
course of the investigation, interviewed a number of people, 
looked at affidavit and sources of information attached to 
their affidavits and that just culminated in a summary report 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 9 of 224 
 
which I have then put there. 
ADV SONI SC:  And in regard to the documents provided by 
Mr Loubser what was the significance of those documents Mr 
Oellerman? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes Sir.  As Mr Soni pointed out we 
initially tried to make contact with Mr van Der Walt.  We 
subsequently learned that he is no longer in the country.  We 
then made contact with Mr Loubser who after we had 
provided him a summons gave us a number of documents 
which he had secured from their offices. 
10 
 
With – in amongst those documents were bank 
statements related to an entity called Precise Trade as well 
letters which or correspondence between Mr van Der Walt 
and Mr Loubser and his partners which set out a number of 
explanations regarding these property transactions. 
 
And there were also references to certain – certain 
contracts which had been entered into with entities via Mr 
van Der Walt and those entities had paid money into Precise 
Trade’s bank account.  And a review of the bank account and 
Mr Loubser’s explanations it was clear that references had 
20 
been made in Mr van der Walt’s handwriting on which 
entities deposited which monies on which dates. 
 
One of the entities mentioned was TMM which has a 
close association with Siyangena and Mario Ferreira who 
also has a close association with the two entities. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 10 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in your report you – you detail a 
number of issues and you seem to have dealt with two of 
them at this stage namely just the general background and 
then the sources of information.  Now that would I be correct 
that part of your report is from paragraph 1 to paragraph 11, 
is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Soni before you go into the 
contents of the report with the witness, we need to have the 
– his report admitted. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Absolutely right Chairperson.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you ask that I admit it as Exhibit SS18 
together with the annexures thereto? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes as you please Chairperson I am 
indebted to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The preliminary report by – the preliminary 
report on the commission’s investigation into Mr Lucky 
Montana’s involvement in property transactions in 2014 and 
2015 compiled by Mr Clinton Oellerman that is O-e-l-l-e-r-m-
a-n-n for the benefit of the transcribers is admitted together 
20 
with its annexure as Exhibit SS18. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And again, just for references 
purposes it will be contained in Bundle H Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it will – it is contained in Bundle H. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 11 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in paragraphs 11 to 15 you deal with 
the sources of the information and you have already dealt 
with that various transactions [00:14:23] you got from Mr 
Loubser and so on.  In particular the bank statement that he 
gave you.   Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I gather – I am sorry.  I guess also we 
need to get this out of the way.  We need to ask Mr 
10 
Oellerman to confirm that it is his – his report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Oellerman do you confirm that Exhibit 
SS18 which begins from page – I see that it says page 3. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should be page 1 is it not?  It should be 
page 1 because the other things are the index. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson what I suspect has happened 
and I only just saw it now that you have pointed out is there 
is a… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, there is an affidavit? 
ADV SONI SC:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Oh, but then – then where is 
page 2?  Oh, there is page 2. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, Mr Chairperson. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 12 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No then I understand.  Okay I think what 
we will do is you see the from outside there is no indication 
that there is also the affidavit so I think that we should say 
Exhibit SS18 would be the actual report and we make – what 
shall we make the affidavit?  Because it needs to be – we 
will make it Exhibit SS18a. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The affidavit of Mr Clinton Oellerman 
on the 17 June 2020 which accompanies his report will be 
admitted as Exhibit SS18a. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we – we need him to – have you 
already confirmed, did they ask you to confirm and you 
confirmed Mr Oellerman your report or not yet? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Not yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you confirm that Exhibit SS18 is your 
report? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Soni. 
MR OELLERMAN:  And Chair can I – I can also just confirm 
20 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That the report is titled preliminary 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 13 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:  And the litigations are ongoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. No, no that is fine. 
MR OELLERMAN:  And the report will be updated as the 
investigation continues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  I think by the very 
nature of – of – well actually I do not even know whether it 
should be called a report.  Maybe that is what may be 
confusing.  As I understand it is – it is just you saying what 
you came across as you were investigating. 
MR OELLERMAN:  At this stage yes, correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja at this stage and later on if and when 
you have more information that changes the situation – the 
picture or that confirms the picture you will put that 
information before the commission. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  And just on that point Mr Oellerman the idea 
is you point out later in your so-called report is that 
eventually you will present everything in a final report. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct yes Chair. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  After hearing the other side and so on. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes there are additional investigations 
going on as well which involved detailed flow of fund 
analysis of various parties so that will all be incorporated 
into the final report.   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 14 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Then from paragraphs 18 to 23 you deal with 
the background and you have dealt with that already in 
general terms that whilst these property transactions were 
being negotiated and processed there was this parallel 
process of Siyangena acquiring major contracts with PRASA. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And if I could just summarise what that is 
and you could just confirm whether that is correct?  In June 
2014 there was a R2.4 billion contract, is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Between Siyangena and PRASA.  And then 
in September 3 months later there was the R800 million 
extension of that contract. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson although it is not contained in 
this, I have just put some context to it.  You will recall 
Chairperson that Ms Ngoye stressed on the first occasion 
she gave evidence and then again when she gave evidence 
earlier this week that that contract they only discovered the 
R800 million contract when they stopped Siyangena from 
20 
carrying on some work and Siyangena rushed off to court 
and got an interdict preventing PRASA from doing so.  And in 
support of their claim for the R800 million they produced this 
contract which PRASA saw for the very first time.  And I just 
place on record because it is contained here that it was Mr 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 15 of 224 
 
Montana who had signed that contract on the 30 September 
on behalf of PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  The R800 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I still want to be reminded whether my – 
but I want your confirmation that my memory is correct that 
there was this one contract or addendum to a contract that 
Mr Montana had signed without any knowledge of anyone 
else at PRASA.  Is that the one or is that another one? 
ADV SONI SC:  That is it.  That is the one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where – do you recall whether there is 
nobody who witnessed his signature there or whoever 
witnessed was not somebody from PRASA? 
ADV SONI SC:  We did not canvass that with Ms Ngoye 
because as I understood they were simply not aware of the 
contract Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think – I think there was – I think it 
was during Ms Ngoye’s evidence earlier in the year when I 
20 
heard evidence about a document or an agreement or 
addendum that I think no-one else at PRASA knew anything 
about it except Mr Montana because he had signed it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I looked at – I wanted to see who 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 16 of 224 
 
had signed as a witness.  I cannot remember whether there 
was nobody who had signed as a witness to Mr Montana’s 
signature or there was somebody and I have the impression 
that I may have asked Ms Ngoye whether she knew the 
signature or something. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And either I did not – I asked her and she 
said no she did not know who it was or maybe I did not ask 
her.  I intended to ask and never asked. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I – can I ask this Chairperson?  We 
10 
have the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can we look at it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later in due course. 
ADV SONI SC:  At tea time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Look at it and then we can canvass it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Oellerman does what I am talking 
20 
about ring a bell with you? 
MR OELLERMAN:  It does Chair.  It appears to be the same 
contract but I would also just like to confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That we are – have the same thing.  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 17 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright okay.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  We will check that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Because I – it may be that there 
is some significance in the fact that none of the witnesses to 
Mr Montana’s signature was a signature of somebody from 
within PRASA. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There may be some significance to that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – ja okay. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  But we will look at it just now 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then Mr Oellerman we go into the four 
properties.  Now can I just put this in context. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  In what one may call the main part of the 
report you simply summarise all the facts relating to each of 
the properties, would that be correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  And the purpose of that is to give a broad 
overall picture without being bogged down by individual facts 
and individual documents and so on. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  But in order to show that all what your 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 18 of 224 
 
summary in the main report is based on documentation that 
is in your possession you have attached more detailed 
reports in respect of each of the properties. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chair.  So what – what I 
did was for each property there is an individual report where 
all the source document is attached to that particular report.  
So that there will be four of those reports.  They are 
annexures to the main report.  The main report then sets out 
a summary of what transpired more generally giving context 
to the – the individual reports. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  So you for example would have heard the 
evidence yesterday of Mr Karen De Beer. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now that deals with the Waterkloof property 
and all her affidavit and the other matters she dealt with are 
contained in the annexure to – to your main report. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And let us just get that formality out of the 
way.  There are four annexures to your report, am I correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  And each of these annexures deals with 
their properties? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  The first annexure is OR1 with which 
property does that deal 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 19 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:  That would be the sale of the Parkwood 
property. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right. And then OR2? 
MR OELLERMAN:  OR2 is the Waterkloof property. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  And OR3? 
MR OELLERMAN:  OR3 is the Sandhurst property. 
ADV SONI SC:  And OR4? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh I am sorry Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was able to see OR1.  Where is OR2?  I 
10 
see OR3.  OR2 okay.  I think the problem is that when I – 
you know the divide in pages where you have OR whatever 
written it is better if they are the same colour. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has different colours.  So when I see 
the first one OR1 and I see it is this green light colour in 
colour when I look for OR2 I am looking for a green – a 
similar colour. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So those – so they must not change 
20 
because if I see pink, I think it must be something else. 
ADV SONI SC:  Something else, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but if it is the same colour. 
ADV SONI SC:  No absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It helps. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 20 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  Especially if they are marked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they are – if the – if you – if you use a 
certain colour to divide different sections of the lever arch 
file it is better to use the same colour. 
ADV SONI SC:  The same colour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And otherwise because I am busy looking 
for this colour. 
ADV SONI SC:  No sure. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what the colours how they have 
been doing it in the past. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I miss this colour because now this is 
cream, white or yellow.  Okay thank you.  Now I have found 
OR2 and OR3 you are about to go to OR4. 
ADV SONI SC:  OR4 and which property does OR4 deal with 
Mr Oellerman? 
MR OELLERMAN:  OR4 is the Hurlingham property Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson can I get this out of the way?  
You asked me about the addendum.  It is annexure FA209 
but we have collected in a file which I will hand up to you at 
a later stage and I am but before I do that may I just point 
this out?  That the annexure is signed by Siyangena Mr 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 21 of 224 
 
Reddy who was mentioned at being at that meeting you 
might remember that Ms Ngoye talked about with the DG.  
She and Mr Dubek were at that meeting.  And it is signed by 
Mr Montana and there appeared to be two witnesses and it 
may be that – and it is not something I recall immediately but 
I will check the record but it is signed but it may be that 
when you asked Ms Ngoye she could not recognise those 
persons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do I have it here or I do not have it here? 
ADV SONI SC:  You do not have it now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  I will hand it up in their file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  But we would need to 
know whether the people who signed as witnesses are 
PRASA people or not. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Or 
whether 
all 
the 
witnesses 
were 
witnesses of the other party to the agreement. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Then – Mr Oellerman when for example 
Ms Karen De Beer gave evidence and when Mr Green gave 
evidence yesterday it showed a number of different parties 
seemingly being involved and then eventually the Deed of 
Transfer records that two of the properties were transferred 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 22 of 224 
 
to Precise Trade and one of the properties was transferred to 
Ms Montana himself.  What one needs to do for the 
Chairperson and for the public as a whole is to just try and 
summarise in a sense very briefly all the various steps in the 
transactions so that right at the end one can say but why 
would all of these things happen and a contract is – and 
these are not small contracts.  More than R10 million each of 
them. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Is – there is a different party to whom the 
10 
property is concerned.  And we will deal with that.  But when 
you are doing your summary of each of the properties if you 
could keep that in mind. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  So you then talk about the four properties 
and that the first part is an introductory part.  We have heard 
evidence on that and we need not deal with that – the 
various properties we know there are four properties.  So if 
you could start at paragraph 27 and deal with the Parkwood 
property. 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:  Sure.  So just with regard to the 
Parkwood property, this was a property that Mr Montana 
owned himself and he subsequently sold that property to 
Precise Trade.  Initially he bought the property for about 
R1.85 million ...[intervenes]  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 23 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that in 2008? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct Chairperson.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR OELLERMAN:  His bank had valued the property around 
2012 for about R2.5 million.  However, in May 2014, Precise 
Trade made him an offer for R 6.8 million for the property 
which, as I say, was about R3 million more than what his 
bank had valued the property at the time.   
 
And in the detailed report we had correspondence 
between Mr Montana and his bank where that sets - where 
10 
he had set that out.   
 
Mr Montana, obviously, accepted the offer and the 
property was paid for through Precise Trade to a number of 
payments over a period of time. 
ADV SONI SC:  Just on that point.  There are two unusual 
features that you are alluding to.  What are those? 
MR OELLERMAN:  So firstly the property is valued at around 
R3.5 million.  Mr Montana gets a very generous offer of 
R6.8 million for the property.   
 
I mean even factoring in some escalation over - of 
20 
property value over 20 months, it seems the property the 
value had increased significantly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR OELLERMAN:  And he, obviously, accepted the offer 
...[intervenes]  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 24 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  ...for the property 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was within less than two years. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the evaluation made by the bank. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So and the bank valued it at three point? 
MR OELLERMAN:  R3.5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Roundabout August 2012. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So... so was it... did he get about 
double the - or close to double ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the value of the property. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  H’m. 
MR OELLERMAN:  And there is also – I mean there is no 
real evidence that significant additions had been done to the 
property because subsequent to Mr Montana signing the 
deal, the addendum to the offer to purchase by Precise 
20 
Trade was signed in which some onerous obligations were 
placed on Mr Montana to fork out for improvements to the 
property at his own cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  So on your investigation in regard to 
Mr Montana’s involvement in these properties, the sale of 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 25 of 224 
 
this property of his to Precise Trade which is Mr van der 
Walt’s company, marks the first property transaction between 
Mr Montana and Precise Trade.  Is that right? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of these properties ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...that you have looked of the four? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then, this is... this happens in 
2014. 
10 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR 
OELLERMAN: 
 
The 
offer 
was 
made 
roundabout 
May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About May 2014? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you will later on will round off the last 
one of the four properties - the last one of the transactions 
20 
happens sometime in 2015.  Is that right?  Or towards end of 
2014? 
MR 
OELLERMAN: 
 
The 
properties 
are 
all 
concluded 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  By end of 2014? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 26 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:  End of 2015.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By end of 2015? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  The properties or the initial offers are 
made ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR OELLERMAN:  ...2014. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Although the property transfers and 
conclusions run into 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  The actual sales ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...occur - all occur in 2014? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the transfers - some of the transfers or 
the transfer of one of them might go into ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...2015. 
MR OELLERMAN:  So just as an example.  I mean, in the 
Parkwood property, the offer was made in August 2012 but 
the transfer was only affected in February 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 27 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  So the offer was made in 2014? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Sorry, 2014.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  2014.  And then the transfer was effected 
in February 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  But in the end, part of the 
point about Mr Montana’s involvement in these transactions, 
in the sales of properties with Precise Trade and Mr van der 
Walt is that, during 2014, there are - there were various 
agreements or tenders or business being done, being 
10 
conducted between PRASA and Siyangena.  And - ja, okay.  
Thank you. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And just to put that in perspective.  The 
R2.4 billion contract was signed on the 30t h of June 2014.  Is 
that right. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And the addendum was signed on... in 
September by Mr Montana on the 30t h of September? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  2014 again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So... so the Parkwood property is sold in 
May, the sale agreement is concluded in May between 
Montana and Precise Trade.  Is that right? 
 
And then in June, then that contract is concluded 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 28 of 224 
 
between PRASA of which Mr Montana was the CEO and 
Siyangena? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Then the remaining three properties, the 
transactions would have happened between August and 
October 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now Mr Oellerman, until Mr Loubser gave 
you the documents, were you aware of how payments had 
10 
been made or who had made payments and so on? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Not at that stage.  It was part of the 
investigations at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. H’m. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  But he then gave you the documents.  Now 
one of the documents that he gave you was the bank 
statement of Precise Trade. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is... yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Is it? 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson, that appears at Bundle G.  It is 
Exhibit SS16 and it is at page 190.  It may be useful for you 
to have it in front of you Chairperson.  I say that with respect 
because there are matters that I want to deal with here. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 29 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  I think if you do not 
already have, it would be convenient to have... I do not know 
whether or not to call it a table which say like May Montana’s 
tables. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Montana’s sells his Parkwood property 
to Precise whose sole director is Mr van der Walt who is an 
attorney representing ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Siyangena. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  June 2014, PRASA concludes or provides, 
gives a tender to Siyangena for so much but also the 
question of who signs that agreement. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For that ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, that contract. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
then, 
go 
throughout 
the 
year 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...to say, “Here is what happens about 
properties.  Here is what happens in terms of business 
between Siyangena and PRASA”. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 30 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who gets involved, and that is where 
we need to also look at the... at what was happening to the 
legal department.  I have got Ms Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo.  
Some 
of 
the 
things 
that 
were 
happening 
to 
them 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, we can... Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...with... they need to be factored in there 
as well. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ah, I see. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson, it has just occurred to me.  We 
should do two things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  And that is to have a table but also have a 
pictorial representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Because it gives one a bird’s eye-view of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  ...the whole thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly.  Ja, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Because the otherwise ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...put it all together. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 31 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  But we will do that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And we will do it soon as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  If Ms Renata is on top of these 
things, she could do it while we are continuing and by tea-
break it should... it would be ready. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is just about 2014 up to 2015. 
ADV SONI SC:  2015.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is those items. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  I would have liked to have it 
before he finishes his evidence if possible. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not necessarily the pictorial one. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just the timetable ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the table.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, if you look at the bank account Mr 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 32 of 224 
 
Oellerman, you will see that the green ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am so sorry.  You referred to a bundle 
that has been handed up.  Is that the one I should look at 
now? 
ADV SONI SC:  That is... Yes.  Yes, Chair.  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is Bundle G, Exhibit SS16, page 190.  It is 
an annexure to Mr Loubser’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, you deal with, in paragraphs 4 and 5... 
10 
paragraphs 31 and 32, you say that the agreement provided 
for a deposit of R2.5 million.  Is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  At page 32. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Soni.  You referred to 
paragraph 32. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you... of his report? 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Of Mr Oellerman’s report, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  And you make the point that in terms of the 
agreement, the amount, the deposit was to be paid on the 
18t h, before the 18t h of June.  Ah, so sorry.  The deposit was 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 33 of 224 
 
to be paid by the 4t h of June and payments had to be made 
between June 2014 and February 2015. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And is that what happened in regard to the 
payments? 
MR OELLERMAN:  No, it appears not.  It appears that 
payments from Precise Trade differed to what was set out in 
the purchase agreement.  They were made over a series of 
payments.  The deposit itself was not R2.5 million but 
R2.225 million that was made. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  And can I then just ask you to look 
at the bank statement which is at Bundle G?  And can you 
read into the record the deposits made into Precise Trade’s 
account on the 18 t h of June 2014? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Chairperson, there are two deposits that 
are reflected.  The one... the first one is for R1.85 million... 
R1 850 000.  Below that is another deposit for R4 million. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And if you look at the, I just point out 
that the handwriting against those numbers it says TMM 
loan. 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, that is correct.  
ADV SONI SC:  H’m. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Mr Loubser indicated in their interactions 
with him that Mr van der Walt had communicated to them in 
their correspondence that that - that money was deposited 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 34 of 224 
 
by TMM and these... those were his, Mr van der Walt’s own 
handwriting inscriptions that are reflected on the bank 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just remind everybody who TMM is 
in relation to Siyangena. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, so... I think Ms Ngoye covered it 
quite extensively in her evidence as well.  TMM has a close 
association with Siyangena within the documentation that we 
10 
have seen.  There is correspondence where Siyangena 
confirms that TMM assists them in the execution of their 
contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does - did you investigation reveal that 
Siyangena appears to be a subsidiary of TMM or not really 
but they might be owned by the same person or persons or 
they might have common directors? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Ja, at this stage, I would say they have a 
close association with... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR 
OELLERMAN: 
 
...between 
the 
two 
companies 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR OELLERMAN:  TMM plays an important role in the 
execution of the Siyangena contract. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 35 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is - or the relationship is confirmed 
in the correspondence ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is close... 
MR OELLERMAN:  ...to PRASA which we have seen as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  And Mr Ferreira’s roles in TMM and 
Siyangena? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct.  So from the documentation that 
we have reviewed, he plays an active role in both TMM and 
10 
in Siyangena. 
ADV SONI SC:  And just again.  One of the documents that 
Mr Loubser handed in yesterday was an agreement between 
TMM and himself - oh, sorry, and Mr Ferreira on the one 
hand and Mr van der Walt on the other hand, being a joint 
venture for certain developments.  You have seen that 
document? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, I have seen the document and I can 
confirm that is one of the documents that was given to us by 
Mr Loubser.  The document, essentially, appears to be an 
20 
agreement where opportunities for investments would be 
sought by Mr van der Walt and presented to TMM or to Mr 
Mario Ferreira acting on behalf of TMM. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, the first withdrawal from this account 
as on the papers we have, is made on the same day as 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 36 of 224 
 
payment is made of those two amounts of R1.8 million and 
R4 million by TMM. 
MR OELLERMAN:  The what? 
ADV SONI SC:  What is that payment for?  Can you...? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That appears to be for the deposit which 
is reflected in the purchase agreement.  Although, the 
handwriting inscription next to it, appears to read as 
guarantee. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And you read the explanation that Mr 
van der Walt gave to Mr Loubser and Mr van Wyk when they 
10 
asked him questions?  Mr Loubser sent... I mean, annexed 
four letters at the exchange. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And in terms of Mr van der Walt’s 
explanation, what was that R2.25 million ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  It appears to be a... for his existing... 
one of his existing properties, the guarantee which the bank 
had called up, that payment would be made towards that 
guarantee of one of the existing parties.  That would be 
directly into his other property that he owned. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  And the Parkwood property transaction has a 
clause which says that the R 2,5 million may be paid to 
extinguish the bond on - the existing bond on Mr Montana’s 
Waterkloof property. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct, Chair. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 37 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Now, can I just ask you if you look 
at the further withdrawals from the account and I refer you to 
that made on the 18t h of August, the first one made on the 
18t h of August.  Would that... would it be correct to say that 
was for R110 800,00 Mr Oellerman? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct.  I have it as the 18t h of July.  
18t h of July 2014. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry.  It is the 18t h of July.  Sorry. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And what is it reflected as on the bank 
10 
account itself? 
MR OELLERMAN:  There are three payments that are... or 
two payments that there are there, both on the 18t h.  The one 
is 
R110 800,00 
and 
the 
one 
directly 
below 
that 
is 
R350 00,00.  And they reflect the same information.  It says 
Montana payment, both of them. 
ADV SONI SC:  And in terms of the schedule that Mr van der 
Walt gave to his partners, is he saying that that was in 
respect of... 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Property.  
MR 
OELLERMAN: 
 
Yes, 
this 
corresponds 
with 
the 
explanation that was given by Mr van der Walt to his partner 
on how payment of the property was effected. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then the third payment reflected is of 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 38 of 224 
 
twenty-four thousand, on the 24t h of July 2014.  That is for 
R400 000,00.  To whom does the bank account reflect the 
payment being made? 
MR OELLERMAN:  The... it is reflected as TLM which we 
understand to be the initials of Tshepho Lucky Montana. 
ADV SONI SC:  And in Mr van der Walt’s explanation, is he 
saying that that is part of the Parkwood? 
MR OELLERMAN:  It is consistent with his explanation and 
the schedule of payments which he provided that was made. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then just one other... well, two others that I 
10 
want to refer you to... or three others.  Sorry.  Can I ask you 
to turn to page 191?  You will see in the third ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Soni.  Sorry.  H’m I was just 
making a note.  What page should we... I go to?  On this... is 
it on the same bundle? 
ADV SONI SC:  It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the statement? 
ADV SONI SC:  It is part of the bank statement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Report... bank statement. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is the next page of the bank statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 191. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 39 of 224 
 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
Now, 
there 
is 
an 
entry 
on 
the 
5t h of December 2014 
and 
that 
is 
for 
a 
withdrawal 
of 
R400 000,00.  Is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct, Chair.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  The reference is again TLM and it is 
consistent with the information provided by Mr van der Walt. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then the next withdrawal is on the 
15t h of January 2015.  And what is that for? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is in the mount of R300 000,00 and 
10 
the description there is TL. 
ADV SONI SC:  And the explanation that Mr van der Walt 
gave? 
MR OELLERMAN:  It is consistent with the series of 
payments that were made for the Parkwood property. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then finally ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what would the TL stand for in...? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Well, it... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we know? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Well, Mr Montana’s names are reflected 
as Tshepo Lucky Montana.  So that... above you will it is 
TLM.  Here it seems to be reflected as just TL.  Tshepo 
Lucky.  Possibly 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 40 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes-no, what I am thinking is that all along 
until now, it looks like they used TLM to refer to Montana. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now there is TL.  It might not be Montana. 
MR OELLERMAN:  It might not be but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to find out whether we know whether 
this refers to him or whether it might be somebody else. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Well, the schedule that was provided by 
10 
Mr van der Walt, indicated an amount of R300 000,00.  This 
is consistent with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the same day? 
MR OELLERMAN:  It does not always reflect the dates in the 
schedule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR OELLERMAN:  But he reflects the payments and how 
they were made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course, the bank would have the full 
names, is it not? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 41 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:  Ja, it would be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  We could get the information from the 
bank. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we can know exactly who TL is. 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Obviously, 
if 
we 
are 
going 
to 
get 
information about TL, we may as well get information about 
TLM. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we know that we have got that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But obviously, if Mr van der Walt has said 
TLM referred to Lucky Montana, that makes sense. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we may as well get everything from the 
bank. 
MR OELLERMAN:  It is on the way, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  May... may I just make this point, 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV SONI SC:  And it is contained in the issue you have 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 42 of 224 
 
raised that we see a withdrawal from here and it is said to be 
a payment to Mr Montana but we do not know into which 
account it was made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. H’m. H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now it may have gone to Mr Montana’s 
account but it may have gone to somebody else’s account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then it just becomes that much more 
clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And Ms Solomon has indicated that we 
would need to put all those pieces of the puzzle together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly.  Yes, exactly.  Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then finally oh sorry, not finally.  On the 5 t h 
of February 2015 now, there is a withdrawal of R300 000,00 
from that account.  Is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct.  And the reference here 
again, it is TLM. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
on 
the 
face 
of 
it 
if 
before 
20 
15 January 2015, whenever there is a withdrawal in favour of 
TLM, of Mr Montana, they have used TLM and after the date, 
they have used TLM again but on the 15t h of January, they 
have TL.  One would think that it might not be the same 
person. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 43 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is important.  Normally, you would 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...you will be consistent. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So but... you are looking into it and 
...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  That is under way, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And now finally in regard to the Parkwood 
property. 
 
There 
is 
a 
withdrawal 
on 
the 
20t h of February 2015, of R2 million. Is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:  The reference there reflects Erf 359, 
Parkwood which is the direct reference to the property. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson, I will just remind you because 
sometimes one needs to keep this in mind.  You will recall 
this is an entry I have raised with Mr Loubser because Mr 
20 
van der Walt had said, “this was a R 1,3 million... oh, oh, 
sorry, 
not 
this, 
but 
on 
that 
same 
date, 
allegedly, 
a 
R1,3 million loan had been given to Mr Montana.  I am just 
trying, in a sense, to present as much of the picture as 
possible without creating too much confusion.   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 44 of 224 
 
 
But that is the difficulty which, in a sense, you have 
alluded to Chairperson, that at the end of the day, you 
cannot take this at face value.   
 
You have got to connect it with what Mr van der Walt has 
said and you have got to connect it with the end-user’s bank 
account. 
 
Now, these are the payments that were made in respect 
of the Parkwood property.  Is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Correct.  Or at this stage, that is how we 
understand to be. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, of course... and you are quite right Mr 
Oellerman that... that is the... what Mr van der Walt has said 
what the bank statements portray and so on.   
 
Now, after the Parkwood agreement was concluded for 
R6.8 million, there was an addendum to that agreement.  
Could you very briefly tell the Chairperson about that? 
MR OELLERMAN:  Yes, sure.  So there were three... ja, the 
addendum was concluded between Precise Trade, Mr van der 
20 
Walt and Mr Montana which, as I have alluded to a little bit 
earlier, required of Mr Montana to make a number of 
improvements at his own costs to the property.   
 
And that had to be done over a period under... before 
the property was registered.  Mr Montana then, it appears, 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 45 of 224 
 
undertook to continue with having those improvements done 
over the period.   
 
What 
essentially 
happened 
is 
that 
correspondence 
between Mr Montana and Mr Loubser shows that rather than 
Mr Montana paying for it, he would send contractors invoices 
to Mr Loubser... 
ADV SONI SC:  No. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Sorry, to Mr van der Walt and request 
that he make payment.  In fact, there is reference to one 
particular ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you are referring to Mr Loubser two 
times when probably you meant Mr van der Walt. 
MR OELLERMAN:  Mister...  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just for the record.  You mentioned on 
each occasion to Mr van der Walt. 
MR 
OELLERMAN: 
 
Correct. 
 
So 
Mr 
Montana 
was 
corresponding to Mr van der Walt and there is documents 
and correspondence which shows that rather than him paying 
for the improvements for the kitchen and etcetera, there 
were a number of improvements that were listed in the 
20 
documentation.   
 
Mr Montana submitted the invoices to Mr van der Walt 
and requested that he make payment.  And as I indicated in 
one of the correspondence, he actually says he is under 
pressure to pay the contractor.  Please, can you pay as soon 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 46 of 224 
 
as possible?  So it would ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:   Now these are the payments that were 
made in respect of the Parkwood property, is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct.  At this stage that is how we 
understand it. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  No, of course, and you are quite 
right, Mr Oellerman, that that is the – what Mr van der Walt 
has said what the bank statements portray and so on. 
 
Now after the Parkwood agreement was concluded 
for R6,8 million there was an addendum to that agreement, 
10 
could you very briefly tell the Chairperson about it? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Sure.  So with the – an addendum was 
concluded between Precise Trade, Mr van der Walt and Mr 
Montana which, as I alluded to a little bit earlier, required 
of Mr Montana to make a number of improvements at his 
own cost to the property and that had to be done over a 
period before the property was registered. 
 
Mr Montana then it appears undertook to continue 
with having those improvements done over the period.  
What essentially happened is that correspondence between 
20 
Mr Montana and Mr Loubser shows that rather than Mr 
Montana paying for it, he would send contractors’ invoices 
to Mr Loubser – sorry, to Mr van der Walt and request that 
he make payment.  In fact, there is reference to one 
particular …[intervenes] 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 47 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you referred to Mr Loubser two 
times when probably you meant Mr van der Walt. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Mr van der Walt, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just for the record you meant – on each 
occasion you meant Mr van der Walt. 
MR 
OELLERMAN: 
 
 
Correct, 
so 
Mr 
Montana 
was 
corresponding with Mr van der Walt and there is documents 
and correspondence which show that rather than him 
paying for the improvements.  For the kitchen, etcetera, 
there were a number of improvements that were listed in 
10 
the documentation.   
 
Mr Montana submitted the invoices to Mr van der 
Walt and requested that he make payment and as I 
indicated in one of these correspondence, he actually says 
he is under pressure to pay the contractors, please can 
you pay as soon as possible? 
 
So it would appear that the addendum itself, rather 
than Mr Montana paying, he submitted those invoices to Mr 
van der Walt to pay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Mr Oellerman, may I just ask in regard to 
20 
the improvements?  When you look at the bills that Mr 
Montana sent to Mr van der Walt, what is the appropriate 
amount 
that 
had 
to 
be 
paid 
in 
respect 
of 
those 
improvements? 
MR OELLERMAN:   So the amounts 
add up quite 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 48 of 224 
 
significantly to over a million, so the one invoice was 
R525 000 and then there is a number of additional invoices 
for various improvements that were made throughout.  
There is even invoices for certain items from a particular 
chain store for installation of certain equipment for about 
40 000 which Mr Montana also submitted those as proof 
that he paid them.  He wanted Mr Loubser to reimburse for 
that.  Sorry, again, Mr van der Walt and not Mr Loubser. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now when one looks at the Parkwood sale 
as a whole – and I am just asking you as a general 
10 
impression.  What does it suggest?  You have a sale for 
R6,8 million and then there are these improvements that 
ought to be made and that is recorded as an addendum. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   For Mr Montana’s account but Mr van der 
Walt pays.  What is the picture that emerges?  I am not 
asking for a conclusion. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   But how should one interpret that? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Well, I mean, if that is indeed the case 
20 
that Mr Montana sold a property for a significant amount 
above what would be market value at the time and then 
despite these improvements being required of him, to 
increase the value of the property, one could say, he does 
not foot the bill for that.  Well, then he has benefitted 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 49 of 224 
 
significantly from this particular transaction and it would be 
– it would appear to be out of the ordinary for a transaction 
of this kind. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now just for the reassurance of the 
Chairperson and whoever is interested in what you have 
said, you have made a number of comments, this is what 
the contract provides; this is contained in communications 
and so on.  Are each of those matters contained in 
annexures to OR1. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct, yes, Chair.   
10 
ADV SONI SC:   So if one looks at what you have said in 
your summary of the Parkwood property and one turns to 
OR1 you would find certainly documentary backing for all 
the points you have made. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright, can we then turn to the Waterkloof 
property? 
 
Now 
you 
were 
not 
here 
yesterday, 
Mr 
Oellerman, but Ms Karen 
de 
Beer gave some vivid 
evidence and quite unusual evidence and if I could just 
summarise it, Chairperson, just so that we have context.   
20 
 
She says well, Mr Montana lived five houses from 
her, he came and he made an offer and that fell through 
and so on.  We do not need to go into the details but for 
me what was significant, is he eventually said – she said to 
him, look, I want to paint the inside, I want to leave the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 50 of 224 
 
house in a good condition for you and he says no, no, no, 
do not worry, do not go through that expense.  I am just 
presenting her evidence.  And she found it quite unusual  
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   But, in any case, the sale went through 
not in the name of Mr Montana – sorry, transfer was not 
effected in the name of Mr Montana but in the name of 
Precise Trade.   
Now you have investigated the various stages in 
this, could you summarise very quickly for the Chairperson 
10 
the different stages in the completion of the contact. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Because – and I ask in this context, Ms de 
Beer says she did not engage in the detail, she left that to 
her lawyers. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Right. 
ADV SONI SC:   So if we could just fill in that. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Sure.  But perhaps then also for 
completeness sake, Chair, I can say that what we found in 
this Waterkloof property is also a consistent theme which 
20 
appears throughout the other two properties, the Sandhurst 
property and the Hurlingham property.  
 
So 
it 
appears 
that 
Mr 
Montana 
initiates 
the 
purchase, he goes and views the properties and all three 
properties, it transpired to be the same.  So he would go 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 51 of 224 
 
and view the property, meet with the estate agent, and if 
he liked a property then he would say he is interested in 
the property and sign an offer to purchase. 
 
Shortly thereafter Mr Montana would request that 
the offer to purchase be changed to that of Precise Trade 
or in another instance, the Minor Trust.  A different party. 
 
Both 
in 
the 
Waterkloof 
and 
the 
Sandhurst 
properties, that is exactly what transpired, it went through 
a series of offers to purchase and it was agreed that the 
property would be registered in Precise Trade’s amount. 
10 
 
In the Hurlingham property he attempted to have it 
registered in the minor Trust but the owner of the property 
pushed back and resisted and eventually the property was 
in 
his 
own 
name 
but 
the 
steps 
that 
preceded 
the 
registration are consistent in that Mr Montana is at the 
forefront central to the property acquisition, identifies the 
property, views the property, goes through the process and 
then it appears once the property no longer him to be the 
purchaser but someone else to be the purchaser or Precise 
Trade to be the ultimate purchaser. 
20 
 
So those are essentially what had happened in the 
Waterkloof property but as I indicated it is a consistent 
theme across the other three properties. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Although the Hurlingham property was 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 52 of 224 
 
unsuccessful and the property was registered in his name. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  Now in the Waterkloof property 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to keep track of the timeframes.  
May 2014 Mr Montana sells his property to Precise Trade 
for about double the value of the property.  June a major 
contract is concluded between PRASA and Siyangena and 
Siyangena is represented by Mr van der Walt, as an 
10 
attorney, is that right or not at that stage? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Mr van der Walt definitely was an 
attorney which had represented Siyangena in the past 
because I understand over a period of about eight years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Because he had …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Then it seems about 
August/September another property, namely the Waterkloof 
property, Mr Montana gets involved. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Gets interested in buying the property 
which later ultimately gets bought by Precise Trade. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Precise Trade, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he seems to – he identified the 
property and sought to have it – he wanted to buy it and 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 53 of 224 
 
then later on was it the previous trust and then ultimately 
Precise Trade. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I just want to give that timeframe. 
ADV SONI SC:   Absolutely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, and I think you talked about an 
addendum 
involving 
Siyangena 
around 
September, 
October? 
ADV SONI SC:   On the 30 September, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On 30 September. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now in this property a new entity is 
introduced namely the Minor Property Trust.  Have you 
investigated what that is? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, that is a trust where Mr Montana’s 
children are beneficiaries. 
ADV SONI SC:   By the beneficiaries? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   And who is the trustee? 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:   It is Mr Johan Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who are the other trustees, do you know 
or not really? 
MR OELLERMAN:   I believe he is the only one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The only one?  Oh, I did not know you 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 54 of 224 
 
could be one trustee. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, no, there is a second trustee, 
Chairperson, it is contained in the annexures but there is a 
second trustee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:   But Mr Smith played the key role. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he is the one who plays the – ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   In all of these… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, just to qualify what I am saying is 
10 
that he represented the Minor Trust in his transactions. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now just again where these – was this 
report served to the best of your knowledge on Mr Smith to 
say 
look, 
your 
name 
is 
going 
to 
come 
up 
at 
the 
Commission? 
MR OELLERMAN:   I believe it was, yes, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   And to your best of your knowledge there 
has been no response from him? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Not that I am aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ordinarily you would have been 
20 
informed if the Commission did a receive a response from 
him? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now this property was sold for R11 million 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 55 of 224 
 
and there was a deposit, so – sorry, Ms de Beer said she 
became - Mr Montana had made a proposal to her about 18 
months earlier before this had happened.  She wanted to 
have nothing to do with him unless a deposit was paid.  
She insisted on a R3,5 million non-refundable deposit.  
 
Now at paragraph 43 of your report you say that 
there was that deposit that was paid – it is paragraph 43 
and 44.  And you say it was paid on the 23 September 
2014.  Can I ask that we look at the bank statement, 
Chairperson, and again, just for identification sake, this is 
10 
EXHIBIT SS16 and it is on page 190, Mr Oellerman.   
 
You will see on the 23 September 2014 there is a 
deposit made into Precise Trade’s account.  Do you see 
that? 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   And there is a handwritten indication 
where 
that 
money 
come 
from, 
what 
does 
that 
handwritten…? 
MR OELLERMAN:   It says TMM loan. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that we know was Mr van der Walt 
20 
telling his partners. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   That was the source of that money. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   On the 23 r d there is a withdrawal and what 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 56 of 224 
 
is the amount of that withdrawal? 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is for R3.5 million. 
ADV SONI SC:   That is the same amount that was 
deposited on that very day. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, it corresponds with the amount, 
with the deposit and the reference reads: 
“Minor Property Trust loan.” 
ADV SONI SC:   And that was when Mr Smith was involved 
in this. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   And then there was a further payment of 
R7,5 million that was due and as set out in Mr van der 
Walt’s explanation to his partners that was paid. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct, it was paid directly to the 
attorneys by TMM, as he explained it. 
ADV SONI SC:   So he said to the attorneys, to the 
conveyancer - to Karen de Beer ’s conveyancers? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then there is a further – oh, sorry, 
Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the tea break. 
ADV SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson.  Sorry, I get 
carried away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not keep your eye on the time. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 57 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the tea break and we 
will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Soni?  Do not forget your mic. 
ADV SONI SC:   Mr Oellerman, may I ask in regard to the 
Waterkloof property, when you look at the documents or 
the official documents it shows an offer by Mr Smith then it 
shows a transfer to Precise Trade, is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   But why should we say that Mr Montana 
was involved, you deal with in paragraphs 52 onwards of 
your report, is that correct?  I am talking about now the 
Waterkloof property. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   And Ms de Beer dealt with it quite 
extensively 
yesterday 
but 
could 
you 
summarise 
his 
involvement as set out in your report? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes.  So, I mean, as I indicated earlier, 
he was – he is quite central to the transaction that he 
20 
initiated the purchase of the property.  Throughout the 
transaction he seems to have remained in contact with the 
seller.  He walked through the property, she took him 
through the property, there is correspondence where Ms de 
Beer – and I think she has given evidence to that effect 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 58 of 224 
 
where she even informed her neighbours that the new 
owner of the property is going to be Lucky Montana.   
She was quite convinced that, you know, despite 
the fact that the property was going to be registered in a 
different entity’s name that he was still the person that was 
going to be the person who takes over the property from 
her and in addition to that, there is regular contact with 
her, the keys, etcetera, that were handed over, it appears 
that he remained throughout the process to be involved.   
 
If it was purely a question of I am scouting for 
10 
property for someone else, one would not expect to see Mr 
Montana remaining in the picture and being constantly 
included in communications, being constantly in contact 
with the seller of the property, etcetera, it would then just 
be a purely commercial transaction between the entity and 
the purchaser and their lawyers, etcetera, etcetera.  But Mr 
Montana clearly remained in the picture throughout the 
process. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now what is not contained in your report 
and it is not – it is just an observation, is a point made by 
20 
Ms de Beer yesterday that she offered to paint, he declined 
the offer and then he made – or was intending to make 
major improvements and you still see scaffolding – that is 
her evidence, you see the scaffolding there.  What do you 
make of all of – that is obviously not added into your 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 59 of 224 
 
report. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   But what do you make of that? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Well, I have actually visited the 
address and I can confirm that.  I mean, the property 
appears to be almost abandoned at the moment, it looks 
like a construction site and there is scaffolding there, it is 
clearly under – was under construction but it seems to 
have just been abandoned and no further work has been 
done to the property so under the circumstances it appears 
10 
to be a neglected piece of property. 
ADV SONI SC:   And the amount paid for the property was 
R13.9 million? 
MR OELLERMAN:   R13 million, yes.  So with an 
investment like that one would expect to – if you were 
going to do improvements, you want to protect your 
investment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is really quite strange that 
anybody can buy property for R14 million, R18 million and 
starts 
making 
some 
changes 
to 
the 
property 
or 
20 
improvements and then just abandon it like that and Ms de 
Beer said that has been the case for six years. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, as I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She said she has regularly driven past 
and looked at the house because she liked the house and 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 60 of 224 
 
she feels so bad to see it like that now.  For six years it 
does not seem to have been occupied. 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
I 
may 
have 
misled 
everybody, the amount is R11 million, not R13 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   That is the Sandhurst property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, there is another one – but there is 
another property for 13 million, this one was 11, or 10, 5? 
ADV SONI SC:   Originally but it was eventually sold for 
11. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 11 million, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   You might remember she said she was 
willing to accept 10,5 just to get rid of the property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Oh, I thought she ultimately – 
it was ultimately sold for 10.5 because she made – she was 
prepared to make that discount. 
ADV SONI SC:   But the amount was 11 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was 11 million, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   Then let us go, Mr Oellerman to the 
Sandhurst property.  Now in relation to this property who 
20 
were the key role players again?  Who sourced the 
property, whom was it transferred to? 
MR OELLERMAN:   So again, Mr Montana is the person 
who sourced the property.  He identified the property, 
indicated that he would want to buy the property.  But this 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 61 of 224 
 
property, again, through a similar process which I outlined 
earlier, rather than Mr Montana being the ultimate person 
to whom it was transferred, it was again transferred to 
Precise Trade.  The interactions – the seller is a Mr Kohler, 
the interactions with the estate agent and Mr Montana sort 
of rather than the property going through the normal 
course of events one would expect be transferred to, the 
original person would put in the offer, he requested that it 
be ultimately transferred to the entity Precise Trade which 
is how the transaction evolved from then. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   And to your affidavit – I mean, to your 
report, and that is OR3, you annex a number of emails 
which are communications between Mr Montana and the 
seller, a Mr Kohler, is that correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct.  So again, as I said 
earlier, rather than him leaving the scene after the request 
has been made to transfer the property to Precise Trade, 
he is clearly in communication with the seller on a regular 
basis, so he remains actively involved, it would appear, 
from the documentation that has been reviewed. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   And when they wanted to change the 
electricity bill, to whom do they write, the Kohler? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, they wrote to Mr Montana and had 
set out there what the significance would be for the 
electricity, it would be cut off and how Mr Montana – they 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 62 of 224 
 
directed it to Mr Montana as if he was going to be taking 
over the property. 
ADV SONI SC:   And there is one payment for the fees that 
is in issue.  When the fees for the transfer fall due to 
whom does Mr Kohler right? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Again he wrote to Mr Montana.   
ADV SONI SC:   And what happened after he wrote to him? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Well, Mr Montana apologised for the 
delay and said he was not aware of any problems but he 
said he would attend to it and shortly, the next day, I 
10 
believe, payments were made. 
ADV SONI SC:   Can I just ask you to turn to bundle G 
again, EXHIBIT SS16, page 191.  If I can ask you to look 
at the entry right towards the bottom on the 25th February 
2015.  Do you see that? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that is a deposit into the Precise 
Trade account.  What is the amount of that deposit? 
MR OELLERMAN:   The deposit is R1 105 084.92, Chair. 
And next to it is inscription TMM loan which is in the 
20 
handwriting of Mr van der Walt, as pointed by Mr Loubser. 
ADV SONI SC:   And what happens on later that day? 
MR OELLERMAN:   On the same day the exact amount of 
R1 105 084.92 is made as a payment to the transferring 
attorneys Borchardt &Hansen for the property. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 63 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  On the 25 February 2015, 
there is a deposit of R1 105 084.92. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Into Precise Trade’s account and then 
on the same day exactly the same amount is withdrawn or 
is – is that – it says withdrawal? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, it is withdrawn, it is a payment 
that is made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but do we know – because there is 
no reference to TLM there, do we know…? 
10 
MR OELLERMAN:   Well, the payment is a payment made 
out of the account and the reference is Borchardt Hansen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Which were the conveyancers or the 
transferring attorneys that were handling the sale of the 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh, 
those 
were 
the 
transferring 
attorneys or conveyancers? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  In regard to the property. 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and I guess that part of what 
maybe underway is something that will show that it went 
into their account. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct, yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 64 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and what they did with it.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   Mr Oellerman, it has just occurred to me I 
may have misled you.  That is the payment in respect of 
the Waterkloof transfer. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   The one in respect of the Sandhurst 
transfer is the one on the 4 February 2015 and I must 
apologise for that, it is my fault, I drew your attention to 
the wrong one. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Now this question arose out of my 
question, when the payment for the transfer fees were due, 
the seller wrote to Mr Montana, you remember? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct.  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then you said Mr Montana apologised 
and is this the transfer that took place on the following day 
on the 4 February because Mr Montana wrote to Mr Kohler 
on the 3 February to say I am sorry, I will sort it out by 
tomorrow. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes.  So if you look at paragraph 72 of 
20 
my report there, I state there that Precise Trade paid the 
transfer costs of the exact amount which is reflected, 
R1 105 537.30 on that day. 
ADV SONI SC:   And the transferring attorneys or the 
conveyancers were Snyman Attorneys, is that correct? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 65 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct and there is a reference it says 
Empire Place, which is the property. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson, it was my misleading the 
witness and I apologise for that.  There were just two and I 
just mixed them up but I just want to place it on record that 
the one deals with the Waterkloof transfer but the one that 
Mr Oellerman is now talking about on the 4 February 2015 
is the one related to the Sandhurst property.  That is 
correct? 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Now is there any picture that emerges 
especially any special feature that emerges in respect of 
the Sandhurst property transaction? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Well, when you say special feature, in 
my – from the documentation that I have seen and the 
affidavits that were submitted it is just a consistent theme 
that emerges is that Mr Montana, as I have said earlier, he 
initiates the property deal.  The owners actually think he is 
the person who would appear that is behind the deal but 
the transfer is made to Precise Trade.   
20 
Mr 
Montana 
remains 
involved 
throughout 
the 
process but payment is not made at all by Mr Montana, 
payment is effected through Precise Trade or other party. 
ADV SONI SC:   Let us then turn to the Hurlingham 
property, Mr Oellerman. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 66 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now at paragraphs 79 to 86 you deal very 
briefly with the bare facts in relation to the transactions in 
writing that took place.  Could you briefly tell the 
Chairperson what those reflect? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, Chair, so the Hurlingham property 
again Mr Montana was the person who viewed the property 
and made an offer for 13.5 million for the property.  The 
request was then made subsequent to that to have the 
property offer to purchase changed into the name of the 
10 
Minor Trust represented by Mr Johan Smith.   
 
What transpired after that was a sequence of events 
where the conveyancing attorney resisted that and as well 
as the owner which ultimately resulted in Mr Montana being 
the registered owner, property was transferred into his 
name and although it must be said, although the property 
was transferred into this name, from the documentation 
and evidence that we have gathered until this point, does 
not appear that he paid any amount towards the purchase 
of the house. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Now in respect of this property at 
paragraph 84 you say: 
“After the deposit was paid, and amount of R11,5 
million 
was 
made 
by 
a 
company 
called 
Midtownbrace (Proprietary) Ltd.” 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 67 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now on the basis of the investigations you 
have done in respect of Midtownbrace.  Who is the person 
involved with Midtownbrace? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Midtownbrace is a company that is 
actually 
registered 
in 
Botswana 
but 
again 
from 
the 
documentation that was provided to us, we were able – by 
Mr Loubser, we were able to identify that and Mr Andre 
Wagner was involved in this particular transaction and that 
an agreement was similar to other agreements that Mr van 
10 
der Walt had put together, a similar agreement was put into 
place as an investment opportunity and the funding for 
Hurlingham property, the bulk of the 11.5 million was then 
transferred to the Midtownbrace company in Botswana to 
the 
conveyancing 
attorneys 
and 
to 
effect 
the 
final 
outstanding amount of the property. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now you have tried to obtain a statement 
from Mr Wagner. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   And what has happened to that? 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:   He has recently provided us with an 
affidavit, we are busy working through the affidavit and 
following up on the information that was provided to us. 
ADV SONI SC:   But does he say anything of significance 
in the affidavit? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 68 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:   He does confirm that the agreement 
was put together by Mr van der Walt, that it was initiated 
by Mr van der Walt as an investment opportunity for 
properties, to develop properties, and that the deal was 
such that they would benefit from the sale of his properties 
once the properties have been put together. 
 
Again, this was a property – he also indicates that 
due to zoning issues they were not able to develop the 
property has been essentially abandoned.  I have visited 
the property as well and it is probably in a worse condition 
10 
than the Waterkloof property, it is quite derelict to be quite 
honest, it is property that is completely abandoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure you took pictures of both the 
other one that we talked about at Waterkloof? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As well as that one you – there would be 
pictures of how they look like now. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Very good, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR OELLERMAN:   With our updated reports we will 
20 
include all these in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
ja. 
 
I 
wonder 
whether 
the 
investigation that you have conducted may have revealed 
whether the abandonment of these properties may have 
happened after the media became interested in some of 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 69 of 224 
 
these properties or not? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Chair, that certainly has happened but 
I cannot say it is a direct consequence of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, it might be difficult to say 
unless it is somebody who was watching at the time what 
was happening. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR OELLERMAN:   So the explanations being given are 
issues which, for example, zoning or incorrect plans that 
10 
have not been approved, things like that.   
Whether there is a concerted effort to remedy that, I 
cannot say I have seen evidence of that, at this stage.  But 
certainly, the two properties in question are in a rather dire 
condition. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now the interesting thing about the 
Hurlingham property is, as I understand it, Mr Wagner has 
instituted summons in the Gauteng High Court for, as he 
put it, to protect is rights. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   It is he who paid the money. 
MR 
OELLERMAN: 
 
 
Correct, 
through 
Midtownbrace 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:   Well, that is what he says. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, yes, through Midtownbrace, yes, 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 70 of 224 
 
that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that matter has not been resolved yet. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Not to my knowledge, no, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   And in his affidavit to you, does he 
indicate the nature of the dispute relating to this property? 
MR OELLERMAN:   It is not covered in huge detail but 
essentially, I mean, because of the issues of the condition 
of the property now because their plans to develop could 
not be approved as a result of various hurdles that they 
experience but essentially he is now faced with a situation 
10 
where he needs to protect his own investment as a result 
of what has happened.   
Property, I think, in my discussions with him, I think 
he indicated last that the best offer they got so far was in 
the region of 4 million which is significantly less than his 
investment. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now the property, though, is registered in 
Mr Montana’s name, unlike the other two properties that 
were purchased. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Now in regard to the three properties 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in regard to the having property, was 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 71 of 224 
 
Mr 
van 
der 
Walt 
not 
involved 
in 
terms 
of 
your 
investigations? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, it is –his involvement has been 
consistent throughout. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Including on this one? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but not Precise Trade or he was 
involved …[intervenes] 
MR OELLERMAN:   The property would – the deal never 
got that far because of resistance received from the 
10 
conveyancers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Of the seller. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:   They would not allow Precise Trade or 
the Minor Trust to initially …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Oh, but the plan was exactly that? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct.  Certainly, they already went 
on that – they embarked on that route. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:   Because there is correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:   And an affidavit which we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Where it was set out. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 72 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That post to Mr Montana signing the 
initial offer to purchase it was followed up by a request to 
have the Minor Trust to sign an additional offer to purchase 
and that was resisted, the evidence …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that is why it ended up being 
registered in Mr Montana’s name. 
MR OELLERMAN:   It would appear so, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the pattern was the same as with 
regard to the two other properties where Mr Montana 
10 
identifies the property and makes the initial approach. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then later on wants to bring in 
Precise Trade. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Correct.  And he is still involved in the 
property, Mr van der Walt, because he put together the 
deal with Midtownbrace. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR OELLERMAN:   As the major investor in the property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:   So the documents provided to us by Mr 
Loubser clearly indicate that there is a joint venture 
agreement between Mr van der Walt who was representing 
Precise Trade and Midtownbrace. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 73 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Just in regard to Midtownbrace, do any of 
the person involved in the Siyangena matter feature in 
Midtownbrace? 
MR OELLERMAN:   In the company itself?  No.  I 
interviewed a Mr Wagner who indicated that it was his 
company and that he was approached by Mr van der Walt 
who had known him for many years going back to university 
days, who put the deal together. 
ADV SONI SC:   So that is Mr Wagner ’s account? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Now as not – and I am just going by 
reports on this, was not a company in which Mr Mario 
Ferreira having an interest namely Triple Trade Invest 04 
(Proprietary) Ltd.  Did they not acquire some of the shares 
in Midtownbrace?   I know you may not know but I am just 
saying that is what is in the media space. 
MR OELLERMAN:   I am aware of those reports but as far 
as the investigation at the moment, we have not confirmed 
that at that moment. 
ADV SONI SC:   But those are matters that clearly call for 
20 
further investigation and that is why it is relevant to the 
Siyangena dispute, if I can put it as such, Chairperson. 
 
Now you have been at pains to point out that you 
have the bare facts, the legal triggers involved but in your 
report your look at Mr Montana’s role in each of these 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 74 of 224 
 
transactions.  Could you briefly summarise that in respect 
of each of the transactions?  Let us start off with the 
Parkwood and the Waterkloof property? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes, Chair, I think I have covered most 
of it already, I think I have indicated – and it is – a lot of it 
was covered by Ms de Beer in her evidence as well.  I think 
she went as far as to say that although there were other 
properties involved, she saw they were just alter egos, I 
think were the words that she has used in her affidavit and 
yesterday as well of Mr Montana and that he was the 
10 
central figure.  As far as she was concerned, she was – or 
he was her buyer, the purchaser of the property and he 
remained constant in contact with her throughout the 
process. 
ADV SONI SC:   Sandhurst? 
MR OELLERMAN:   Sandhurst, again, Mr Montana was the 
one who signed the first offer to purchase so he presented 
himself as the buyer of the property and again as he then 
requested or requests were made for the property to rather 
be transferred to – in the name to Precise Trade, there is 
20 
still evidence – there is significant evidence that he 
remained in contact with the sellers of the property and 
continually – was continuously in the picture right through 
until the property was transferred. 
ADV SONI SC:   And Hurlingham? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 75 of 224 
 
MR OELLERMAN:   Hurlingham is the last property which 
we have just covered, very, very similar.  The only thing 
that happened in this place is that they were not – he was 
unable to convert the request to have the property 
transferred into a different entity’s other than himself, 
being the Minor Trust and this property was transferred 
into his name and remains in his name up until now. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then at paragraph 104 of your report 
you conclude that whatever the documents – the official 
documents may show, it was Mr Montana who played a 
10 
crucial role in the purchasing or the transactions relating 
to those properties. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Absolutely, it is quite clear from the 
documents, particularly emails, correspondence and the 
affidavits of people that have been interviewed up until 
now that he was active in the whole process.   
 
It would appear that there is an attempt to conceal, 
if I can use that word, his involvement thereafter, but he is 
quite clearly involved in these properties’ transactions. 
ADV SONI SC:   Then you deal with the next topic in your 
20 
report, which is – because we know Mr Montana is a key 
figure – then you deal with the other key role players, 
could you just identify them and summarise what their role 
is, the first one being Mr van der Walt. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 76 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe before you do that please we 
– you said earlier on that the three properties if one works 
on the basis that with regard to the three properties, 
Waterkloof, Sandhurst and Hurlingham, that effectively the 
buyer was Mr Montana even where in regard to the two 
Precise Trade was the entity that on paper bought you 
know and if one says in effect Mr – in reality Mr Montana 
was buying these properties and became the owner and so 
on in substance it would mean that within a period of about 
what, 12 months or thereabout he bought properties to the 
10 
value of what – over R30 000 000, over R24 000 000. 
MR OELLERMAN:   It is around R36 000 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over R36 000 000. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Ja look certainly the impression that 
the sellers gave is that Mr Montana was the owner of the 
property, that is certainly how they understood it to be.  As 
I said Ms de Beer said those, the other organisation, 
Precise Trade was just an alter ego of Mr Montana, she 
understood that the property was his. 
 
Yes, so what happened post the sale of these 
20 
properties is under investigation, but as I say the sellers of 
the property was certain under the impression that Mr 
Montana was the person who was going to take occupation 
or be the owner of the property. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
We 
know 
that 
Waterkloof 
and 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 77 of 224 
 
Hurlingham 
you 
did 
say 
that 
they 
are 
not 
in 
good 
conditions. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
Sandhurst 
what 
happened 
to 
Sandhurst, did he occupy? 
MR OELLERMAN:   For Sandhurst, I visited that address 
as well? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
MR OELLERMAN:   I visited that address as well, the 
Sandhurst property.  It does appear that it is a property 
10 
that is occupied, however on the days which I visited it we 
did not find anyone there, we left them a letter requesting 
that they get in contact with us.  They have not done so as 
yet, but certainly the property, there’s a fairly big wall and 
gates so you just cannot get a full picture of the property, 
but there were cars parked there and you could clearly see 
the property is occupied, the yard looks in a reasonable 
condition etcetera, so it is certainly not in the derelict 
condition of the other two properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.   It will be important to 
20 
establish whether after the transaction who occupied the 
Sandhurst, ja. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And up to when or whether the same 
people who occupied immediately after the transfer are 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 78 of 224 
 
they still the same people who are still occupying. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry Chairperson if I could just remind 
you, you might remember Mr Green yesterday when he 
gave evidence said that in 2017, he had sold the Sandhurst 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, yes, he sold it from Precise 
Trade to somebody else. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Also, what would be important is to 
10 
establish who occupied it before it was sold in 2017. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.   And of course, who 
got the money for the 2017 sale. 
ADV SONI SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would be important to get to know 
that. 
ADV SONI SC:    Indeed Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Let’s deal then with this issue about the 
other role players Mr Oellerman. 
MR OELLERMAN:   So we have identified Mr van der Walt, 
obviously to the Precise Trade entity which he created as – 
for the purchasing of these properties and which two 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 79 of 224 
 
properties were transferred to.    He was also the director 
of Loubser van der Walt at the time and as we understand 
it acted as an attorney for Siyangena for a period of time.  
Also apart from Mr – we have obviously identified Mr 
Montana as well as being central to these property 
purchases, and then Mr Mario Ferreira who has links to 
Siyangena as well as TMM and on Mr van der Walt’s own 
version to his partners was involved in these property 
transactions through an investment initiative and joint 
venture agreements.  The same would go for Mr Johan 
10 
Smith who acted for – on behalf of the Minor Trust who 
were linked to these transactions. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now these, your report has been served 
on all of these people. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   And one of the things that you as an 
investigator needed to look at is how do you get this whole 
picture before the Commission, before the full picture 
emerges and one did not by way of this report is that 
correct? 
20 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Okay, now you have invited all of these 
persons to indicate what their links are to the different 
companies and so on, and we I take it will await their 
response and if they don’t respond then we will require 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 80 of 224 
 
them to respond as per the Commission’s powers. 
MR OELLERMAN:   As I understand that is correct Chair.   
Obviously, there is also additional investigation that has to 
proceed with these matters as well, as I indicated at the 
outset.  This is a status of where we are at the moment. 
ADV SONI SC:   And those investigations include what the 
Chairperson said earlier, namely we need to look at who 
we know withdrawals were made purportedly in respect of 
the properties, but to whom were the actual payments 
made.  I mean I can always say I am paying to Mr Montana, 
10 
but pay to somebody else, so those are the investigations 
that still need to ...[intervenes]  
MR OELLERMAN:   Absolutely that is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now you conclude then that these matters 
are raised and what do you expect the persons whom you 
have mentioned now, Mr van der Walt, Mr Smith, Mr Mario 
Ferreira, Mr Wagner and all of them to – how do you 
expect them to respond. 
MR OELLERMAN:   The intention is for them to examine 
the information that is being compiled here along with 
20 
other individuals who have given evidence related to these 
particular matters and to provide an explanation on their 
involvement in the property and give us detailed versions 
of their account of how these transactions emerged. 
ADV SONI SC:   And in the eventual outcome of this, you 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 81 of 224 
 
set it out at paragraph 19. 
MR OELLERMAN:   Yes once we have all these the 
investigation 
is 
complete 
and 
we 
have 
everyone’s 
responses.  This will be packaged as a complete report for 
the Chairperson to evaluate as part of the evidence that 
has been gathered in the PRASA investigation. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, Chair that is the evidence we would 
like to lead in respect of Mr Oellerman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes no that is fine.   That table is it 
ready? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   We will give you a typed copy Chairperson 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but in the meantime ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:   Just for your – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I just want to have a look before Mr 
Oellerman leaves the witness stand.  Okay no that’s fine, I 
think prepare – let me have a typed one maybe tomorrow. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let it go according to date sequence. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What happens first involving who. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what happens next involving who so 
that’s why it becomes important for example where a 
contract is signed to say from PRASA’s side who signs it. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 82 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe also from the other side who 
signs it. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I see here the note is the 8 t h of 
June contract is signed by Montana. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, both the 30 t h June and the 30 t h of 
September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so both of them, so – and the June 
one comes about a few weeks after the Waterkloof 
10 
agreement in May. 
ADV SONI SC:   The Parkwood agreement? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Parkwood, ja, Parkwood, I am sorry, and 
then August of course you have August/September you 
have I think that’s when you have the Waterkloof? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then you have got the 
addendum also signed by Mr Montana. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SONI SC:   4 t h of September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For close to R800 000. 
ADV SONI SC:   R900million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, she wrote here – Ms Fangata is not  
used to millions, she wrote R794 634, she didn’t even write 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 83 of 224 
 
R794 000 000, she wrote thousands.  R900million you 
said? 
ADV SONI SC:   R800million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   R800million ja, so if I can get a typed 
one that really says – because it would be handy, you say 
this happens first, then this happens after. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This happens first and then this happens 
after. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the values, the amounts and all 
depending on the occasion.   Okay no thank you very 
much.  Mr Oellerman thank you for coming to give 
evidence, thank you for your investigation and of course 
you may come back later on when your investigation is 
complete. 
MR OELLERMAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the meantime, the people who 
have been served may come forward to put their side of the 
story.   
20 
MR OELLERMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, unless Mr Soni still has 
something for you, I am ready to excuse you. 
ADV SONI SC:   No, I have nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused thank you. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 84 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Thank you Mr Oellerman.  Mr Chairperson 
the next witness is Mr Fani Dingiswayo.  We have been 
threatening to call him for quite a long time, but he has 
eventually got his day in the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure he says finally my day arrives.    
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, call him.  I think these files we need 
to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:   It does not look like, Chairperson can I 
ask for a few minutes, it seems he may be outside, I am 
10 
sorry, I thought he was here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will have a – we will take ten 
minutes, we will resume at twenty past, or shall we make it 
half past? 
ADV SONI SC:   Make it half past Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Soni. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson.   Chairperson 
Mr Dingiswayo is now here, may he be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 85 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Mfaniphela Moses Dingiswayo. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth, if so please raise your right hand and so help me 
10 
God. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So help me God. 
MFANIPHELA MOSES DINGISWAYO:   [d.s.s.]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Soni? 
ADV SONI SC:   Mr Chairperson in light of the concerns 
you raised yesterday in regard to the numbering, the 
numbering in this bundle, which is Bundle F Chairperson 
has been changed so you will see Chairperson on the right 
hand side is each affidavit starts with number one, we have 
for the purposes of today put the numbers sequentially as 
20 
you have required and we will attend to it so that it looks 
neater and perhaps even in red but for today could we look 
at the left hand side, those are the numbers so they are 
sequential then, and we don’t have the difficulty that we 
had yesterday Chairperson. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 86 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You when you say the numbers on the 
left hand side ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:   On the top left hand side where I have 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it the one that says PRASA Bundle 
F154? 
ADV SONI SC:   That’s right yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For example here – okay so – okay no 
that’s fine so that is alright, okay, alright, for purposes of 
this bundle any reference to pages will be to the number – 
10 
will be not to the red numbers, it will be to the black 
numbers which appear on the left hand side of each page. 
ADV SONI SC:   Indeed, and which are handwritten 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well this is not handwritten I think 
on mine. 
ADV SONI SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not handwritten but it is black 
numbers, maybe they just made sure mine looked like that 
and yours – ja they are not handwritten, they – I think it 
20 
must be a matching. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   What we will do Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On mine, I don’t know about the witness 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 87 of 224 
 
but ... 
ADV SONI SC:   He has the same numbering Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   But Chairperson what we will do is after 
this part of the evidence has been led, we will just put 
everything in order, but at least we know the record will 
properly reflect this and I would reflect it on the documents 
we will discuss with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, no that’s alright. 
ADV SONI SC:   Mr Dingiswayo you have made an affidavit 
10 
in regard to this matter. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   I am going to – so to summarise – well I 
am going to give an outline of what is contained in your 
affidavit but just for formality sake do you confirm the 
correctness and truthfulness of what is said in this 
affidavit? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes Chair the affidavit I see it runs 
from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, let’s first identify 
20 
where the affidavit is found.  It is found in Exhibit – in 
Bundle F starting at page 95. 
ADV SONI SC:   95 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that’s the index but there’s – the 
index to – no it’s not the index, it is – ja it is the index. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 88 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the actual affidavit starts on page 
96. 
ADV SONI SC:   96. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And runs up to page 121. 
ADV SONI SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And again, for the record I am looking 
at, or I am using the black numbers on the top left side of 
each page and not the red numbers on the top right side of 
the page. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   And it is Exhibit SS8 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That affidavit it is annexures – or has it 
got annexures? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes it has, it has quite a few. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and its annexures there it is 
admitted as Exhibit SS8 and it is contained in Bundle F. 
ADV SONI SC:   As it pleases Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes, so is that the – is that your 
affidavit? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct Chair, this is my 
20 
affidavit and the signature that is on page 121 is my 
signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and I think Mr Soni had asked you 
something and I interrupted him, do you confirm that its 
contents are correct? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 89 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I do confirm Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now Mr Dingiswayo what are your 
professional qualifications? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chairman admitted attorney, I was 
admitted in 1999, and I practiced until 2013 when I joined 
the Passenger Rail Agency as a General Manager : Legal 
Services.  To date I am still there as General Manager. 
ADV SONI SC:   And to which department – this is at 
PRASA, is that right? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, the department I 
worked in is called Legal Risk and Compliance.  I – so I am 
responsible for the legal side, a counterpart of mine is 
responsible for compliance and the other sub-sets of that 
department. 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 And 
you 
fall 
under 
the 
general 
administrative, your general administrative head is Ms 
Martha Ngoye? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes my – I report to Ms Ngoye. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position you occupy now that you 
20 
have just told me about the same position you occupied in 
2014/2015 or it is different? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is still the same? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It is the same position. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 90 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  We will return to that question a little later 
Chairperson because Mr Dingiswayo is at present under 
suspension.  But that I want to deal with at a later stage.  
But I just place it on record so it is not as if it – we are not 
aware of what his status is.   
Now Mr Dingiswayo you begin at paragraph 4 of your 
affidavit to make a general observation about concerns that 
you have in relation to PRASA and there are two or perhaps 
three concerns. 
10 
 
The first one relates to the undue influence that 
certain persons exercised or still exercise at PRASA. Could 
you tell the Chairperson what you mean by that and identify 
who those persons are? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair in – in an institution like PRASA 
and I think it is the same with a number of your institutions 
it is – they are holy cows.  So they are – I mean I remember 
one of the first transactions that I had to deal with related 
to Siyaya and somebody just whispered in my ear that do 
not scrutinize too closely.   
20 
So you learn if you have friends in the institution or 
if people receive you favourably you will learn very quickly 
that there are some holy cows and it is something that is 
very much known in the institution.  Everything that relates 
to those service providers is treated favourably from 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 91 of 224 
 
procurement even where sometimes the procurement is not 
done properly but that is part of the favourable treatment of 
that 
particular 
service 
provider 
to 
contracting 
you 
– 
Chairperson you would remember that in the report entitled 
Derailed one of the things which are supposed to be a 
normal thing that were noted by the Public Protector is that 
contracts do not go to the legal department for vetting and 
drafting.   
 
So 
you 
would 
find 
that 
kind 
of 
trend 
from 
procurement to contracting to contract management.  And it 
10 
is – it is key contracts in the organisation.  It is even when 
you – you have meetings with those service providers they 
give you looks that – that tell you that if you are not towing 
the line after this meeting, I am going to report you. 
 
So it is something like that.  You get the sense very 
early that there are certain people that you cannot do your 
work properly because the – the work is to ensure that the 
organisation complies with the law but also to make sure 
that the interest of the organisations are – the legal interest 
of an organisation is protected at all times. 
20 
 
So – and the management of the legal risks.  So it is 
– you then find that you – you cannot do that work properly 
in relation to those service providers or companies. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now I am going to come back to that in a 
moment.  But as I under – as I heard you, you say that 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 92 of 224 
 
when you got there or soon after you got there you were 
told when we were looking at a Siyaya contract. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now who does Siyaya – well we know it is a 
company. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  But who is behind Siyaya? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Well I later learnt Chair that the – a 
gentleman behind Siyaya is a gentleman called Makhensa 
Mabunda.  Mr Mabunda according to information that I – I – 
10 
was gathered later had worked with Mr Lucky Montana at 
the Department of Public Enterprises.   
They were if I am not mistaken DDG’s.  I think Mr 
Mabunda was in finance and I forget what Mr Montana was 
doing.  Then Mr Montana moves to the Department of 
Transport to be a DDG in Public Transport.  When that 
happens, it appears that Mr Mabunda has an interest in 
business and he is involved in – at the project of Taxi 
Recapitalisation which fell under the – the purview of Mr 
Montana at the department.   
20 
So he is one of the people who – I think he was a 
CFO of the agency that was doing the work in that space of 
Taxi Recapitalisation.  Mr Montana leaves the Department 
of Transport joins – joins PRASA and Mr Mabunda continues 
to get work from PRASA and this is very key work.  In effect 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 93 of 224 
 
I can say that the entire technical division of PRASA was 
outsourced to – to his entity because at the – there is a 
division called PRASA Technical.   
He has got a lot of – of advisory work that he does 
there.  I mean this entity Siyaya has a lot of advisory work 
that it does there and the contract that I was referring to 
about that somebody whispered to me was a strange 
contact.   
It was with an entity I think called Siyaya Fuel and 
this entity was being paid something in the order of I think 
10 
about 20cents for every litre of petroleum products that 
PRASA was consuming.   
Now you would – if you think about it that included 
Autopax and Autopax probably had at that time a lot of 
functional buses.  I mean today the fleet is very small but at 
the time it was sizable fleet.  Our long-distance trains then 
when we had a long distance – an operating long-distance 
service they – they traversed and a large part of the 
network with using diesel.   
So each and every litre that we – we poured of 
20 
petroleum products they would 20 cents.  I tried to – no 
although as a lawyer the deal is made.  I think we were 
trying – they were trying to get some security of sorts from 
a bank and the bank needed us to – to confirm something 
about – about this and it looked – this contract looked very 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 94 of 224 
 
strange to me because I thought that we could as an 
organisation 
get 
very 
favourable 
treatment 
from 
the 
suppliers who are known of these products but we had to go 
through this organisation.   
So that is when somebody said, look do not look too 
closely at it.  So it is that kind of a thing.  It is – you know 
the outsourcing of them almost the entire technical function 
of PRASA and PRASA is a highly technical entity.   
I mean the – the locomotives, the rolling stock, all of 
that is technical.  The network that we – it operates on is – 
10 
is technical.  So you need a lot of technical capacity to deal 
with it.  So yes, I think at the time when we were looking at 
the contracts, they had benefitted in the order of a billion 
through those contracts.   
And then there is other associations like Swifambo 
that came up that they seemed to have a hand in that.  So 
yes it is that kind of a thing. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I just say to you, you  may not have 
heard 
this 
because 
you 
have 
mentioned 
Siyaya 
and 
Swifambo in the same breath. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now Mr Molefe when he gave evidence this 
week, earlier this week. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Monday and Tuesday he said that he had 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 95 of 224 
 
been told by a Mr Mashaba that Mr Mashaba had been 
approached by Mr Mabunda. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  To be the face of Swifambo. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Are you aware of that or does that all within 
what you know about these matters? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chairperson that is in the Swifambo 
Review 
Application. 
 
That 
discussion 
that 
happened 
between Mr Molefe and Mr Mabunda – sorry Mr Mashaba.  
10 
So I am aware of – of that discussion.  I think what came as 
a very strange thing is that Siyaya came – like I said they 
were – they were taking over the technical division.  One of 
the people that were in Siyaya was a lady called Brenda 
Malongete who was working for a law firm DM5. 
 
Now what came as a shock to me is that this lady is 
the one that was drafting the agreements between PRASA 
and Swifambo. 
 
So now you had somebody who came to PRASA 
through Mr Mabunda advising PRASA on a contract with an 
20 
entity that is closely associated with – with Mr Mabunda. 
 
So it – yes it is – I am aware of it from that context 
and then I got shocked that this is – this is the situation 
where we – I mean it is – it is a very – Chair I must be 
assisted I am on suspension so I am not used to talking a 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 96 of 224 
 
lot.  So if I go on and on, I am hoping that Counsel will 
assist me and bring me back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Counsel knows what you are going to say 
so he will know when … 
MR DINGISWAYO:  To stop me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – to ask you the next question. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when to interrupt you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  But Mr Dingiswayo I have consulted with 
you on a number of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Soni.  On a lighter note I do 
not know whether Mr Dingiswayo mean that when you are 
not on suspension and you are working you speak a lot but 
now that you are on suspension you do not speak a lot so 
this is the opportunity. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair you have very little human 
interaction when your – all your colleagues and other family 
members are at work. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So. 
ADV SONI SC:  But I have not interrupted you because you 
know what this commission is about. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 97 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:  You know PRASA intimately. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And to the extent that matters are relevant. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And you have not mentioned it in your 
affidavit please feel free to mention it.  Now I had heard of 
the name of Ms Brenda – what is the name? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Malongete. 
ADV SONI SC:  Malongete. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  But I had not realised what the connection 
was until now.  So please what – whenever you can assist. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  It does help because as Mr Molefe said it is 
up to the commission to join all the dots. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now just on the question of persons of 
influence that is how the question… 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Of Mr Mabunda came about.  May I ask 
you was there any other person of influence who struck as 
being an influential role player at PRASA? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  The other person Chair – I mean there 
were – there are quite a number of – of people.  I mean the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 98 of 224 
 
– PRASA was nicely divided amongst but I will just speak 
about the major role players.   
The other major one would have been Mr Roy 
Moodley.  He is the owner of a company called Royal 
Security and I think Ms Ngoye would have taken you 
through the relationship between PRASA and an entity 
called Strawberry Worx. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I see that you are 
speaking quite some distance away from the microphone. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Oh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that might be fine.  I want to check 
with the transcribers whether they can hear you properly.  
Can you hear the witness?  Yes okay ja – be closer to the 
microphone.  Okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Thank you Chair.  So the other person 
Chair who – who… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – maybe I could just say the transcribers 
if – because sometimes I will not ask them.  If there is 
anyone of us whom you cannot hear properly try and send a 
message that must go up to the evidence leader who can let 
20 
me know.  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Thank you Chair I was saying that the – 
the other person that was influential was a gentleman by 
the name of Roy Moodley and it is – the security – Royal 
Security that he owned and associated with Strawberry 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 99 of 224 
 
Worx.  Through the investigations that were launched by the 
board it came out that he may be associated with Siyangena 
as well. 
 
I mean these – these people would be said to have 
some free reign in the PRASA building.  For an example the 
– in the Siyangena case that sometimes when you know 
there is a delay in payment – well this is something that I 
was told that Mr Mario Ferreira would be spotted in the 
building.  So you do not understand how they have gained 
entrance and all of those things.   
10 
 
And later on, the other entity that he was associated 
with Mr Roy Moodley was associated with is Prodigy.  And 
on that same thing of – of him having free access to the 
building I remember being called by the CFO I think around 
– the acting CFO then was Ms Yvonne Page.  She was 
calling me around – in December saying that there were 
people from Prodigy in her office who were there uninvited. 
 
Now I mean I remember I said to her, just call 
security and tell them to get rid of those people.  How did 
they – how did they end up there in the first place?  
20 
Because she was – she was saying she was being forced to 
do a reconciliation of how much had been paid to Prodigy 
and how much was owing and make that payment then. 
 
So you had that kind of a thing.  And this is after Mr 
Montana had left.  I mean this is I think 2017 when this 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 100 of 224 
 
incident happened.  So which also gives you the impression 
that those people that were important at – during the time of 
Mr Montana carried on being special even after he had left. 
 
The trends are the same.  The people who get 
vilified in the organisation for doing their work are the 
same.  I am on suspension.  Mr Montana I probably will get 
there at some point dismissed me and the – the more it 
looks like things are changing.  I do not want to say they 
stay the same because my observation is that it seems as if 
there is a level of desperation that is kicking in in our 
10 
institution including – including at PRASA to do those wrong 
things you know the desperation has increased. 
 
During the time of Mr Montana, he kind of created a 
parallel structure where he had a lawyer in his office who 
was just serving him.  And then he had at another point this 
firm DM5 doing quite a lot of work for the organisation. 
 
He – that firm was not getting instructions from the 
legal department.  They were getting instructions directly 
from SCM at some point and others from Mr Montana 
himself.   
20 
 
So he had created a nice parallel structure where he 
can do some of these deals in.  Now we cannot afford the 
parallel now because of our cash flow constraints.  Now the 
pressure has come back inside for the people inside to be 
party to doing wrong.  For the people in the inside to 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 101 of 224 
 
basically afraid and it is something that I think is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Afraid of doing the right thing? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair let me put it in general terms that 
it is just to sow fear.  Now when someone is afraid, they are 
malleable.  Whatever you ask them to do they will do.  So it 
is just that thing of sowing fear.  And at the end the end – 
the intended end is really that to say, if I say jump you say 
how high?  You do not say but why am I jumping and all of 
those things?  Because people are just afraid. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson I see it is one o’clock I… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us take the lunch break.  We will 
resume at two. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  Now, in 
paragraph 4 of your affidavit and I know we are there but we 
20 
move a little faster Mr Dingiswayo.   
 
You first say there were certain peoples of influence.  
When you point out that when you got there, you were told:  
“Be careful about this Siyaya matters.  Do not scrutinise too 
carefully.”   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 102 of 224 
 
 
Now, I take it you did not take that seriously that you 
should not do your job? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I... Yes, I did my job as best as I can. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Because PRASA is the one that pays my 
salary Chairperson and part of that job is to protect the 
interest of PRASA. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in regard to... assuming you had 
scrutinised 
contracts 
carefully, 
whether 
involving 
Mr 
Mabunda’s firms or Mr Moodley’s firms here.  How did Mr 
10 
Montana react to that? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It is was in a very strange way 
Chairperson.  I mean, it happened to me and I happened to 
scrutinise the Prodigy Agreement and indicate that... initially, 
I wrote to Mr Montana, giving him the benefit of the doubt.   
 
Say to him:  “I believe that he may have been misled in 
approving the contract”.  The contract was approved on the 
basis that it is a... so the Prodigy contracts that... 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry, mister. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  I do not want to stop you.  I want to follow 
your affidavit. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  In paragraph 4, you deal generally 
...[intervenes]  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 103 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...with how Mr Montana reacted.  We will 
come to the Prodigy contract in a minute but I do not want to 
lose the thread of what you said in your affidavit. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Sure. 
ADV SONI SC:  So just in general. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Actually, the word I used in the affidavit 
is ruthlessly.  And I believe that correctly characterises the 
response when we do the work to protect the interest of 
PRASA. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  So you say he ruthlessly abused his 
powers? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And you will give us your example of that.  
And you make the point that the public protector has also 
pointed out this in her report called Derailed. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then the third issue you raise is, that 
even when courts made pronouncements about matters, for 
example, where a person has been unfairly dismissed or the 
20 
contract is invalid and so on. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  What was management’s reaction at 
PRASA? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chairman, even for... and so there was 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 104 of 224 
 
always this need to appearing in certain instances where the 
advice that would have come from the legal department, 
would be say, “you do not have good prospects of success 
on appeal”.   
 
Even where we would have said... even from the word go 
that before the decision was made that there is no prospects 
of suspects. 
 
So there will just be that waste of resources and... in 
certain... especially where employees are involved, it was 
almost like an attitude where somebody says, “I have the 
10 
pass of the state and I am going to litigate you until you do 
not have money”. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now the obvious when the contract... a 
cloud is put over a contract and it involved influential people, 
what would their attitude be? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It would be dealt with unprofessionally 
Chair.  I mean, the expectation was that you do not raise the 
issue that has a cloud over this transaction. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no.  I am raising a different point with 
you.  It is the last part of paragraph 4. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  You say that: 
“Even when payment was not justified, payments 
would be made.” 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, that is correct Chair.  That there 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 105 of 224 
 
were instances where there would be very hefty invoices.  I 
mean, I remember one point when I was questioning an 
invoice of a lawyer who had got onto our panel, in my view, 
through the backdoor.   
 
And I was not... I was actually called by Mr Montana.  I 
was busy talking to the service provider as the service 
provider to the legal department, questioning the invoices 
and I was called to his office to say, “why are you 
questioning this and all of this?” 
ADV SONI SC:  And was the invoice paid? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Well, in the end, the lawyer had to 
change the invoice.  I mean, they were glaring things like 
different hourly rates.  Today is two point five.  The next day 
it is four-thousand.   
 
So I mean, those... it was obvious things that were... 
then I pointed them out to Mr Montana to say, “I cannot put 
my signature on an invoice like this.  I mean, if it has to be 
paid in another way, it can be paid in another way, but I am 
not going to put my name on it”. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in paragraph 5 you point out that as 
20 
legal services, you were all often required to take matters to 
different places. 
 
And you say, for example in regard to the contract for 
R 3,5 billion which was conducted... which was concluded 
corruptly.  That is what the court of Appeal said.   Which 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 106 of 224 
 
one... which contract are you talking about there. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair, this the...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder Mr Soni whether you should not 
ask him in a manner that might not appear to be so leading. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes.  I will do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ask him whether they were required... they 
were able to instruct different law firms and what would be 
the position so that the evidence comes from him. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise, it looks like you are giving 
10 
evidence and just getting him to say, yes, yes, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, look at a finding a way of just 
extracting the information, the evidence from him. 
ADV SONI SC:  In regard... well, you are aware of the 
Swifambo contract? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  What... after Mr Montana left, what did 
PRASA do in respect of that contract? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  PRASA launched an application Chair to 
20 
have this contract reviewed and set aside which was 
successful at the high court taken on appeal.   
 
The SCA confirmed the high court decision and there 
was an attempt to take it the constitutional court.  The 
constitutional court said that there were not prospects of 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 107 of 224 
 
success and they did not entertain the matter. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now once the issues that Mr Molefe raised 
is, that in respect of that contract, Mr Mashaba had made... 
had told him certain things about how that contract had 
been... we need not go there.   
 
But as a result of that, what would PRASA in relation to 
taking the matter further, besides going to the high court to 
set aside the contract? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It... there was a gentleman called 
Philemon Mamabolo who was in the security department.  
10 
Just by himself, he took... Chairperson, what... by enlarge 
was the complaint to the public protector that was launched 
in 2012 around... I think he went around 2015.   
 
He deposed to an affidavit and reported those matters, a 
number of those matters to the police.  And in that report, he 
included the Swifambo matter.   
 
So 
when... 
after 
the 
board 
had 
investigated 
the 
transaction and these issues that counsel referred to, came 
up, the investigators assisted Mr Mamabolo to prepare a 
more comprehensive affidavit that is specifically with the 
20 
Swifambo transaction. 
 
And that was then filed under the same case number 
that Mr Mamabolo had initiated.  I think it is Hebrew case 
number.   
 
So that matter was then taken to the police.  At some 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 108 of 224 
 
point, the HAWKS became involved because of the size of 
the transaction and the issues that are involved in it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry.  Were you involved in it as well? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, Chair.  At the beginning it was just 
the board and the investigators who were dealing with the 
matter.  Around, I think 2016, around April, then the board 
started involving the legal department as well in these... in 
the deals between PRASA and the HAWKS.   
 
So that is how we got involved in the dealings between 
PRASA and the HAWKS.  And if I am allowed Chair?  I can 
10 
probably talk about two meetings that stood out for me which 
was one very big meeting which was... were led by Mr Popo 
Molefe from the PRASA side. 
 
The investigators that had been engaged by the board 
were there and the HAWKS were there.  We met with a 
gentleman called General Khana.   
 
When I left that meeting Chair, I was very encouraged.  
It appeared that there was very work that had been done by 
the investigators.   
 
That the HAWKS had appreciated the kind of work that 
20 
had been done and they really believed that this is a very 
important matter that needed to be investigated. 
 
A number of undertakings were made in that meeting by 
the HAWKS to say, “you know, there is a need to take this 
matter to the FAFI”.   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 109 of 224 
 
 
I think it is called... the institution in the police is called 
FAFI.  But it deals with assets forfeiture and meetings were 
subsequently arranged with that institution.   
 
But then the whole thing kind of ground to a halt and 
were inexplicable ground to a halt.  When...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want you to lose your train of 
thought. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just give some timeframe if you can.  
That 
meeting 
from 
which 
you 
came 
out 
very 
10 
encouraged...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...and when was it, more or less, even if it 
is not the actual date? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Year and month.  Or what part of the year?  
And the time when you felt that everything came to a halt 
inexplicable?  I just want those timeframes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair, if I am not mistaken the meeting 
was in April 2016.  And I think there were follow up meetings 
20 
between the investigators.  Sorry.  And the... and FAFI.   
 
I was not part of that meeting because part of the 
discussions are confidential and secret at that stage of the 
investigation but we came into the main introductory meeting 
between... before the nitty-gritty was discussed. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 110 of 224 
 
 
At 
that 
time, 
a... 
one 
of 
the 
sub-contractors 
to 
Werksmans and I think that company is now called Crowe but 
at the time it was called Howarth, had been appointed by the 
HAWKS to do the cash-flow analysis in respect of Swifambo. 
 
The arrangement between the HAWKS and PRASA was 
that PRASA would pay their fees that are incurred by 
Howarth and Howarth would report to the HAWKS. 
 
So those were part of the discussions in the separate 
meeting to deal with issues that related to the Section 205’s 
and the subpoenas and all of those things. 
10 
 
I think it would have been after those initial meetings 
that everything just went dead like... so the timeframe would 
be when this... the following up would have come around 
May and then after May, it seemed everything would just 
ground to a halt.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you said the big meeting which gave 
you encouragement was in... did you say May? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  April. 
CHAIRPERSON:  April? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So just about a month later...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...everything came to a halt? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And in between there would have 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 111 of 224 
 
been about how many meetings if you are able to say that 
because 
you 
said there would have 
been intervening 
meetings? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Well, those would not have been... I 
would not have been present in those meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you know that some meetings 
took place. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Those would have been with the 
investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you know that some meetings did take 
10 
place...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...some people from PRASA and the 
HAWKS 
or... 
and 
the... 
or 
the 
SIU 
or 
whatever 
or...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  It was the HAWKS and I think FAFI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I believe that were engagements as well 
with AFU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I think those were the institutions that 
were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Okay, okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  The AFU being the Asset Forfeiture Unit? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct.  The AFU of the MPA.  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 112 of 224 
 
And I think there was also engagements with... there were 
prosecutors appointed to lead the HAWKS team that was 
investigating.  So there were engagements as well with those 
people., 
ADV SONI SC:  And you have had that one meeting with 
the... you were present at which... you were part of the 
delegation led by Mr Molefe. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Did you have any meetings with the 
prosecutors? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  Yes, we did. 
ADV SONI SC:  And how did you find them? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That came a little bit later Chair.  
Roundabout... probably around 2018.  I initially said there 
are two meetings that stood out.  And I just request counsel 
to just allow me to deal with those. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes.  I was going to ask you about that. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  But ca I also be allowed to just 
insert another... share with you Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  [No audible reply]  
20 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
The... 
so 
the 
second 
meeting 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, now.  I am sorry Mr Dingiswayo. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to make sure that whilst you are 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 113 of 224 
 
going to, as you say insert some meeting...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the first important meeting that you are 
aware of happens in April 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then everything comes to a halt 
inexplicable in May sometime? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And the meeting that you will insert, 
falls in between? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is later? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It is later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Before you go to that meeting.  
What is that you heard or you observed or you saw which 
made you to conclude that there was this inexplicable halt of 
the attempts to... for the HAWKS to investigate and FAFI or 
AFU, all these law enforcement agencies to do something? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chairperson, at that time, the matters... 
most of the matters were handled by the investigators. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So, from time to time, we would have 
meetings with Werksmans and just generally discuss what is 
happening 
to 
the 
investigation 
including 
the 
criminal 
investigation. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 114 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And then the frustrations then were 
coming from that end of Werksmans to say that they are not 
getting the feedback from the HAWKS around further 
engagements with them. 
 
Because, as I understand it Chair, when you are 
investigating transaction like Swifambo and you are trying to 
follow cash, you have to... it is almost like an onion.   
 
So you start on the outer side to say, what... who did 
Swifambo pay?  And try to link those payments to the 
10 
purpose of Swifambo so that you isolate those that seems 
strange in respect of business of Swifambo and then you 
start following the cash from that end. 
 
For an example.  If Swifambo were to pay Vossloh which 
was the OEM, that type of a payment would not raise a flag 
but if Swifambo was to pay Fani Incorporated, then you have 
to ask, who is Fani Incorporated and Fani Incorporated 
belongs Fani Dingiswayo who is an employee of PRASA. 
 
Then you... so they were frustrated by the fact that the 
follow up subpoenas were not coming back.   
20 
 
So the people who were doing the analysis would do the 
first layer of analysis and then say, “we need these other 
subpoenas to be issued and the bank statements to be 
brought”.  And so that was the frustration that they were 
getting. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 115 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now did you say... you were talking about 
the investigators who had been appointed by Werksmans’ 
firm? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The investigators, they were Werksmans’ 
investigators so to speak? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  They were sub-contractors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were sub-contractors. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  But they were reporting to 
10 
Werksmans? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you were having interactions with 
some of them and you... the reports that you were getting 
when interacting with them...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...was that they were feeling frustrated 
because they were not making headway? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And part of the reason why they were not 
20 
making headways because some subpoenas had led... that 
had been issued to try and get to see where the money went 
to and then the subpoenas were not coming back? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, so the way I understood the 
interaction Chair was that the investigator will say, “I need 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 116 of 224 
 
you to issue subpoena for the following entities and banking 
accounts”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
The 
work 
of 
issuing 
the... 
the...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Subpoenas. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  ...subpoenas would be done by the 
police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And then the police would go to the 
10 
banks after issuing... having these subpoenas issued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  They would go to the banks to get the 
statements.  Analysis is done and the investigator says, “I 
need the following”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So at some point that flow through, 
simply came to a halt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now that is very important Mr 
Dingiswayo.  Mr Soni, we need to get to the investigators. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We need them to tell us who was not doing 
his job or her job. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they were require to investigate such an 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 117 of 224 
 
important matter of corruption at PRASA and they needed 
the 
police 
to 
assist 
them 
by 
way 
of 
getting 
certain 
information by subpoenas and the police or the HAWKS or 
whoever it was, were not doing their job or were refusing to 
do their job for whatever reason, maybe because the money 
trail started to lead to certain people.  I need to know. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are those police officers who were not 
doing their jobs? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We need to...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  And to whom did it lead? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We need to get to the bottom of this. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a lot of taxpayers’ money. 
ADV SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who were the police officials who were not 
doing their jobs?  Because if this is correct, they were 
frustrating a very important investigation.  So... thank you Mr 
Dingiswayo.

You... I am sure that you will be able to supply Mr Soni 
and the Commission investigators with names if you are able 
to or those who could assist who were being frustrated when 
they were trying to do their jobs. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Certainly, Chair. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 118 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then let us get to the second meeting that 
you say stood out for you Mr Dingiswayo. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So the second meeting was... I think it 
would have been around November/October 2016.  I think it 
was at a time when Mr Collins Letsoalo was the acting CEO 
of PRASA.   
 
Brigadier Khana requested a meeting and he came to 
PRASA with, I think, Brigadier Makinyane and with them... 
sorry.   
10 
 
Then there... on our side it was Mr Letsoalo and myself.  
I think the company secretary, the then company secretary, 
Mr Lindikaya Zide may have been there and my manager, 
Martha Ngoye was there. 
 
In this meeting, the HAWKS were concerned, they said, 
about the affidavit of Mr Mamabola.  And their concern, they 
indicated, 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
makes 
certain 
legal 
conclusions in the affidavit, for an example, that so and so 
and so and so were acting in common purpose and they 
committed fraud. 
20 
 
So it came as a... so he said, “look, we are feeling stuck 
because we are worried that if you take this matter forward, 
Mr Mamabola is not going to survive cross-examination 
because he is the A1.” 
 
And the A1 is the first person to make the first 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 119 of 224 
 
complaint. So he would be the one who needs to give 
evidence.  And he will not be able to support his legal 
conclusions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think Mr Mamabola does not have 
to... he needed to simply state facts. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he knew.  And if he made the legal 
conclusion that was wrong, that is really neither here nor 
there.  They had to look at whether the facts that he 
speaking to, revealed that there was prima facie a crime, 
10 
whether it was the same crime he was talking about or a 
different crime. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is neither here nor there. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chairperson, that is exactly what we told 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  We also told them that our view is that 
the whole point of investigating... the whole point of 
somebody 
coming 
to 
the 
police 
and 
saying 
please 
20 
investigate this, is so that the police can find evidence. 
 
And we have indicated to them that this is evidence that 
only the police have the legal authority to find.  So when 
Mamabola says, Fani Dingiswayo got gratification from this 
contract, he does not have the legal authority to go into Fani 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 120 of 224 
 
Dingiswayo’s banking account. 
 
He may be making that conclusion on the basis that after 
this award was made the lifestyle of Fani Dingiswayo 
dramatically changed. 
 
So the police then with their legal authority, should be 
the ones that go and find and follow the money.  If the 
money does not lead to that person and does not lead to 
anybody.  It does not... sorry.  It does not lead to anybody 
who it should not lead to, there is no one who should be 
prosecuted. 
10 
 
But if it leads to somebody that should not receive the 
money, then that person must be prosecuted.  And we said, 
you cannot simply say because you think that the legal 
conclusion is incorrect, you do not investigate.   
 
You investigate to check whether the legal conclusion is 
correct.  And when the evidence is gathered, you then 
present the evidence to court”. 
 
And maybe the legal conclusion is like, Chair, you were 
saying, if the legal conclusion is this crime, then that is that 
crime.  Or another crime is another crime but it cannot be. 
20 
 
But the way he was presenting it, it was as if this was 
the end of the road for this entire investigation.  Because we 
were concerned about that stance and, I mean he had, I 
think, a four-page letter that...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Remind me.  Who was speaking here?  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 121 of 224 
 
Was it...? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  General Khana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Khana. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just for the sake of understanding 
properly.  From PRASA’s said, you said it was you, it was Ms 
Ngoye...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  I think the acting company... sorry, 
the then...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Zide. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  ...the acting company secretary... sorry.  
I am putting acting to the wrong designation. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  [laughs]  The acting CEO was Mr 
Letsaolo.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  He was present.  And the Group 
Company Secretary was Mr Zide.  He was also present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And from the police’s side it was 
20 
General Khana...? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I think it was general...  General Khana 
was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I think he was accompanied by Brigadier 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 122 of 224 
 
Makinyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Makinyane 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you know how we spell that 
name? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  M-a-k-i-n-y-a-n-e. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So he was saying he had a letter? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, he had a four page letter with him 
10 
which he presented to the meeting.  So it was a bit strange 
that he has this meeting for - he asked for the meeting and 
he gives us a letter and he wants us to discuss the letter at 
the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So we then said we will respond to the 
letter formally because, I mean, the way that this thing was 
being presented was that – was problematic. 
 
I think he also complained that they did not have 
information because the more comprehensive affidavit of 
20 
Mamabolo had a lot of annexures. 
 
So he said we do not have these annexures.  We 
said but we understand that you were provided with that.  
So he then responded to that letter and indicated these 
concerns from my view to say we believe that the ball is in 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 123 of 224 
 
your court because of the legal mandate and the legal 
authority that you carry which we do not have.   
 
And I think we do, in that letter, make reference to 
the April meeting and the outcomes of that April meeting 
and what happened after the April meeting because we 
thought it is necessary to just go back to say this is where 
we were and when we were here we were very happy and 
then everything comes to a – grinds to a halt.  When it 
grinds to halt, we find that you come now with this letter to 
us and not to the people that you were interfacing with, 
10 
you come directly to PRASA to say this is my concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said this meeting happens 
towards the end of 2015? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was 2016? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes and I think around October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Around October? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So about one and half years after you 
felt things came to a halt? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, Chair.  So it is April 2016 when we 
had that first …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought it was April 2015. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, no, no, it is 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 2016?  Oh, okay.  Okay, so the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 124 of 224 
 
major meeting that gave you encouragement happens in 
the April 2016. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and everything seems to come to a 
half in May 2016. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then this meeting that certainly 
would not have encouraged you at all happens in October 
2016? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So how does that meeting end? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So the culmination of the meeting is 
that we will write a formal response to the letter.  We will 
consider the letter that was just brought to us at the 
meeting and formally respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when General – is it Khana is Khan? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Khana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Khana? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Khana – K-h-a-n-a.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Khana.  When he was speaking at 
this meeting was he basically making the same points that 
he – that he appeared in the letter that he had given you? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   By and large, Chair. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 125 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was the effect of what he was 
saying and the effect of the letter that they were stopping 
the investigation because of what Mr Mamabolo said in his 
affidavit? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, I speak under correction, I 
believe that we have the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And we will make it available. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I believe that was the conclusion that 
this is because of – he was basically saying because of all 
these things we cannot proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But these things were what?  You have 
told me about him saying that Mr Mamabolo makes legal 
conclusion in his affidavit.  What else did he put up as 
causing them to say we do not think we are going to go 
forward or something to that effect? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chairperson, the thing that was in my 
20 
recollection 
intractable 
in 
that 
letter 
was 
the 
legal 
conclusions.  I mean, I think he knows Mr Mamabolo 
personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And like he was expressing sentiments 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 126 of 224 
 
like he knows Mr Mamabolo and he is worried that he will 
be embarrassed in court and if …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because of a legal conclusion? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is very strange. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   There was, as I said, also the issue 
about the fact that they were saying they do not have the 
annexures. 
ADV SONI SC:   The annexures. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   To the …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Affidavit. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   To the affidavits which I later 
established was not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   But, I mean, we re – we gave them the 
documents again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And so you believe the letter 
can be found? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes.  Yes, Chair.  I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we get it?  I wish we had it here. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is your recollection of what the 
letter also says? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 127 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So you then went back and you 
were going to respond.  I think that is where we were. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chair, I just want to for the record, in 
whose name was that letter, the letter that was given to 
PRASA? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   The letter that was given to PRASA 
was addressed to Ms Ngoye. 
ADV SONI SC:   No, no, no, who signed or who wrote the 
letter? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Oh.  General Khana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was his position within the Hawks?  
Was he the second-in-command? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   He was the head of a unit called The 
Serious Economic Offenses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Serious Economic Offenses? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, then this meeting that I just told 
you about is the one that I inserted because I thought the 
20 
last meeting flows from this …[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:   Before you get to the third meeting, sorry, 
Mr Dingiswayo, when you wrote back to General Khana 
what was your – did you agree with him, did you dispute 
what the correctness of what he was saying? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 128 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the thrust of your response? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   The thrust of the response, Chair, is 
what I have said, that the position that we held even at the 
meeting that the whole point of Mr Mamabolo not going to 
arrest those people that he named there himself is because 
it is the police that must be reported to and it is the police 
that must conduct an investigation and the police that have 
the authority to arrest but the main thrust was that these 
are economic crimes and the only way you deal with an 
10 
economic crime is to follow the money.  Which is, I think, a 
discussion that I think we have had with the Hawks ad 
nauseam even on the Siyangena investigation, that you 
just have got to follow the money. 
 
So that was the thrust of the response.  It was fairly 
a lengthy response, Chair, because we felt that we have to 
be as detailed as that and at least that one I can make 
available almost immediately but I think the one from 
Brigadier Khana, it might take some time.  But I will 
request assistance from our investigators as well as Ms 
20 
Ngoye to see if they can locate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja.  No, thank you.  We should get 
both, ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So on that day that I delivered the 
response, because I had all these lever arch files as well 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 129 of 224 
 
as our response, I went to the Hawks offices in Pretoria 
and gave them the documents.  We had some bit of a chit 
chat with me giving them the essence of what our response 
is.   
 
Then one of the officers accompanied me, because 
their offices, at those premises, you need a remote and 
there is no security guard.  In fact, it is a nondescript 
building, you would not know that there is police there, 
there is nothing that says police.  So one of the members, 
of the officials, accompanied me so that he can open the 
10 
entrance for me. 
 
So I thought let me just ask this gentleman because 
this seems so easy for me, maybe there is something that I 
am missing.  I said to him if you look at the application that 
was launched by PRASA …[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:   This is the Swifambo application? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That Swifambo application.  I think 
there is a very interesting thing that happened which is in 
the affidavits and that is the meeting between Mr Molefe 
and Mr Mashaba at the Maslow Hotel and the outcomes of 
20 
that 
meeting. 
Have 
you 
not 
considered 
having 
a 
conversation with Mr Mashaba? 
 
My 
understanding 
of 
what 
Mr 
Mashaba 
had 
presented to Mr Molefe is that it looks like I got myself 
entangled in something I should not have gotten myself 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 130 of 224 
 
entangled in.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Might have to lose my assets. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct.  And he appeared to, 
from my reading, he appeared to have received the shock 
of his life when he received instructions to make payments 
to people that are not associated with Swifambo, with the 
business of Swifambo.  He was a sole director and he knew 
who were Swifambo’s counterparties in transactions and 
these people are people he did not know.  So I said to him 
maybe somebody like that can assist if this thing is 
10 
correct. 
 
Chair, there was an awkward silence for a few 
seconds and this gentleman said to me I feel bad that you 
have to ask me this question because I have been an 
investigator 
for 
a 
number 
of 
years, 
I 
have 
done 
investigations in the North West and blah, blah, blah.  So 
he went on and told me his life story in the police and he 
says what you are telling me is something that we have 
asked from our superiors and I was just instructed not to 
touch Mr Mashaba. 
20 
 
So I said to him look, I do not want to put you in a 
difficult position, let me go, what you have told me is 
enough.  But the essence of it was that he had been 
instructed not to take that route.  Between me and him in 
our discussion seemed to be a very easy route and 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 131 of 224 
 
something to explore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he seemed to have been instructed 
not to do what he believed was the right thing to do in 
order to do his job? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you – is that somebody that you 
know, is that somebody that you met once on that 
occasion, is that somebody that …[intervenes] 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I only met once, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And I never met him again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I think I may have enquired about him 
at some point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And I was told he had left the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I was told something like that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh. 
 
But 
is 
that 
because 
you 
remembered his name? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I – you know, as I am talking about 
this, I am thinking – I think you are going to get there and I 
am trying to remember his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   But I think I may have it somewhere, 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 132 of 224 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well, you see, maybe if he has left 
the police he might well be very – might be quite prepared 
to assist the country and tell us what he knows about why 
this investigation – why the Hawks do not seem to have 
done what they were expected to do or what he would have 
done but was prevented from doing and who prevented 
him.  So one knows that an investigation such as the 
investigation that this Commission has conducted depends 
to a very large extent on men and women in the country 
10 
who will put the country first and who will have the courage 
to stand up and to speak the truth, sometimes under 
difficult circumstances and we have seen some of –some of 
the people who have taken that stand, who have come 
before this Commission and the country should be very 
grateful to them.   
But there are many who are staying away from the 
Commission when they have knowledge of very bad things 
which should be told to this Commission that have been 
done by certain people who are staying away from the 
20 
Commission, who are not putting their country first but 
there may still be many who have not come forward who, if 
contacted, might just say okay, I will come. 
 
So maybe even the one that you are speaking 
about, wherever he is, even if we do not contact him, if he 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 133 of 224 
 
hears maybe he may just decide to make himself available 
to the Commission.   
If there are not enough people in this country who 
are prepared to come forward and make sacrifices and take 
a stand, all that we are doing will be in vain.  We will not 
make this country a better country.   
If we are all too scared, if we are all putting our 
own self interest first, if we all putting our organisations’ 
interest first, if we are all putting certain wrong institutions 
first and not putting the country then all of these efforts 
10 
and all of the money that this Commission is using to try 
get to the truth will all be in vain and I continue to be 
grateful to each and every one of those people who have 
come here and who  - and told the nation some of the 
things that we heard and those who have stood by the truth 
even in difficult times over the years as I have been told by 
numerous witnesses.  
So we need his name and we need others who know 
exactly why certain institutions were not doing their job to 
come forward and tell us.  When they tell us, they are 
20 
telling the nation, the nation gets to know what was going 
on, we will get to be able to make recommendations that 
hopefully can contribute, if implemented, to make this 
country a better country.  Yes, thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Dingiswayo, 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 134 of 224 
 
you will look at your documents and so and try and identify 
the person but as the Chairperson has said, if that person 
hears your evidence hopefully, he will come even on his 
own whether you not find his name. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, sorry, can I just one thing?  My 
observation of how the PRASA criminal investigations were 
conducted is a case study of how to look like they are 
investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you are actually not investigating? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, I was very happy with the 
10 
evidence that was led yesterday and this morning around 
the property transactions because it is evidence that we 
have been looking for, for a long time, it is evidence that is 
sitting in the hands of bankers.   It is not evidence that is 
sitting with the people who are implicated in the criminal 
offences and the police have simply not gone to the bank 
to ask for the bank statements so that we can be able to do 
the very sterling work that was done by Mr Oellerman this 
morning to take you through the property transactions. 
 I do not believe that it takes long, I think the 
20 
concern as well is the fact that the money is disappearing, 
the properties are lying unattended to and, I mean, it is 
just construction sites, the value of that property is 
dissipating.  The biggest loser in the process, it comes the 
country. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 135 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Before I leave this theme, general 
investigations.  You dealt with the Swifambo investigation.  
During the course of that you mentioned a little earlier the 
– you said the same thing happened in the Siyangena 
investigation. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now you do not have to go into details 
unless you want to but what happened there?  If you could 
tell the Chairperson. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chairperson, the lesson learnt from 
the Swifambo investigation is that do not do the cash flow 
analysis, that is why it ground to a half at some point 
because now you are starting to see names of people, you 
are starting to see organisations that should not be seen 
associated with those transactions.  
 
So at the April meeting - because by the time we 
had the April meeting, the police had already appointed 
Howarth to do the cash flow analysis, so that work had 
started on the Swifambo investigation.  
20 
 
Now on the April meeting one of the things that 
General Khana said he is going to do is to do the same 
appointment that had been done on – because the 
appointment – that appointment necessitated that PRASA 
should issue a letter to Howarth to say we will cover your 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 136 of 224 
 
fees, you report to the police. 
 
So after that meeting that letter was not issued to 
Howarth in accordance with what was discussed at the 
meeting that Howarth was going to be appointed to do the 
cash flow analysis in respect of the Siyangena matter.  
That appointment never happened so that is why I am 
saying that whoever was controlling this investigation 
realised that if you make this appointment you are going to 
have problems and I am saying I am happy with the 
evidence that was lead yesterday and today in the morning 
10 
because now the things that were just in newspapers and 
such places are now clear that those reports, those news 
reports were accurate that those journalists did do the 
work that – in a proper way.   
So  they probably feel vindicated but, I mean, it is a 
bitter sweet experience that all these things came out in 
2016 and it is only now in 2020 that they have been 
ventilated in public in a forum which is credible and the 
people are coming out to say yes, there was a TLM 
inscription on this bank and there is clearly monies 
20 
demanded this side and Mr Montana is asked for money 
and then he says I will pay tomorrow and then money is 
deposited there and then the payment is made.   
So to draw that – now I do not think that it would 
have taken the police and investigators a long time from 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 137 of 224 
 
2016 to get to that point where you can clearly see what 
has happened.  I mean, PRASA has had to spend millions 
litigating against people who have done it wrong and those 
people who were using the money coming from PRASA to 
defend themselves in the litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, to make it worse – and  think as Mr 
Molefe was saying, on the one side PRASA has had to 
litigate against people that allegedly were engaged in 
corruption and that money corrupt the fraud in PRASA and 
those people use that money to fight PRASA but PRASA 
10 
has had to also litigate against the Hawks.  PRASA goes to 
the Hawks and the SAPS and say go and catch them.  
There they are, here is the evidence, here is a complete – 
catch them, there is crime here.  The Hawks do not seem 
to do much until PRASA says let us go to court to force the 
Hawks to do their job and what do the Hawks do?  They 
oppose that, they fight with PRASA.  What kind of thing is 
that? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Mr Dingiswayo, just so that I understand, 
20 
at the April meeting with the Hawks with General Khana 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, when we finish here, I will 
want to see you Mr Soni and Ms Langata(?) and the 
investigators that are attached to the PRASA work stream 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 138 of 224 
 
so Mr Oellerman must not go away.  If he is around.  Or if 
he 
is 
not 
around 
maybe 
somebody 
can 
send 
him 
information to say he should be here when we finish. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, we will do that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now I just want to understand, one of the 
matters – in fact the main matter that was discussed was 
the Swifambo criminal case.  But was Siyangena discussed 
at that meeting as well, at the April meeting? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   In my recollection it was. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   But the difference is in regard to 
Swifambo they appointed the assistance that Werksmans 
was providing but they refused to do that in regard to the 
Siyangena matter. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chairperson.  Well, 
sorry, Chair, sorry.  It is slightly different.  At that meeting 
General Khana undertook that the appointment that was 
made to Howarth on the Swifambo case will be made to 
them to deal with the Siyangena case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was saying he will use the same 
20 
people for the Siyangena investigation as well? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that PRASA must pay for it. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 139 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   And that will in the sense fund 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The same arrange would apply. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   The same arrange and after that 
meeting, we – PRASA issued a letter to – I think it is the 
acting CEO was Mr Nathi Khena.  He issued a letter to say 
to Howarth that PRASA will cover their fees, they must 
assist the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   But that appointment was never made by 
10 
the Hawks. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, it was never made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you get to know why it was not 
made? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It did never – this is one of the things, 
Chair, that we were complaining about after the meeting of 
April and I think in the response that we sent to the Hawks 
later that year to their letter, we also included that to say 
this is what – this is the impression we got from this 
meeting and it just never happened. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now we are talking about the letter 
which you told us about which was responding to General 
Khana’s letter. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These are the things you dealt with in 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 140 of 224 
 
the letter. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now did General Khana ever respond to 
your letter? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He never responded? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But from what you said earlier it seems 
to me that the content of your letter was such that it called 
for a response if he did not agree with the points you were 
10 
making there because there, as I understand it, part of 
what you were saying is, you people cannot stop the 
investigation just because of what Mr Mamabolo says in 
terms of legal conclusions. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair, and that was 
the expected – we were expecting one of two outcomes, 
either a response or some …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Action., 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Action in terms of furthering the 
investigation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if they did not respond but they 
continued with the investigation then you could see that 
they were continuing. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not mind then not responding.  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 141 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Then that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be a response in action and 
not in – by way of a letter. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
if 
they 
were 
not 
going 
to 
…[intervenes] 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
 
Do 
anything 
then 
they 
should 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they are going to maintain their stance 
despite what you said in your letter then you expected 
10 
them to respond to your arguments. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which they did not do. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Which they did not do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  To this day. 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
 
Yes, 
yes, 
Chair, 
I 
think 
that 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you know. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   To this day, Chair, because that is part 
of the reason why the board decided to launch a mandamus 
20 
to compel them to do their work, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now Mr Dingiswayo in your affidavit you 
refer to the affidavit made by Ms Ngoye in October last 
year. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 142 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   If you look at paragraph ...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:   Six. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  Now can I just ask you this, you’ve 
read her affidavit? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.    
ADV SONI SC:   And you agree with what she says insofar 
as she talks about you? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   Just now you then say, but there are two 
10 
matters you want to discuss and it’s not surprising, given 
your evidence that one of them concerns a company 
involving Mr Roy Moodley, that’s Prodigy and the other 
concern, 
Siyaya, 
the 
company 
involved 
involving 
Mr 
Mabunda? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Let’s deal with the Prodigy matter, you’ve 
dealt with it quite extensively in your affidavit but if you 
could – we can go through what you say was wrong with 
this matter and how it ended for you, but I’ll lead – I’m 
20 
just, sort of presenting the panel. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair around March/February – March 
2015, I received a request, so what happens is that if 
anyone in the business requires legal services they come 
to me as the General Manager of legal services and then I 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 143 of 224 
 
decide what I’m going to do, whether I’m going to do the 
instruction or maybe ask one of my colleagues to assist 
with it.  So I received this request from a Mr Sydney 
Khuzwayo who is in the Supply Chain Management Division 
of PRASA.  The instruction …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is about when, just to get the time 
frames? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  February/March 2015.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh February/March 2015, ja okay.   
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, so I receive this instruction, the 
10 
instruction is, we have this contract between PRASA and 
Prodigy, this contract contemplates the training of 3000 
PRASA employees on customer services.  We have – the 
contract, I think it was for three years, this contract has 
now lapsed but we have not trained 3000 we have trained 
just over 2000 so can you assist us to finalise that scope 
of work so that we can – because I think at that time, 
payment could not be made without a contract.  So when 
you enter the details of the contract on the SAP system or 
on the finance system you had to enter that length of the 
20 
contract, so once it lapses then requisitions for payment 
will not happen and what was explained to me was that 
there has – the parties have been continuing with the work, 
notwithstanding that the contract has lapsed but now they 
are having problems with payment.  So, I said, okay, as is 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 144 of 224 
 
normal give me the SCM file so that I have a better 
understanding of what is going on here.  So I look at the 
SCM file…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What does SCM file contain, the 
contract? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, so the SCM file will contain all 
the information that has led to the on boarding of the 
service provider for that contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So, whatever – however they were 
10 
procured and all of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so it will give you information 
that will tell you whether the contract is justified, whether 
there was a need for this contract. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how the contract – what processes 
were followed to conclude the contract. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you asked for that file? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Before you go on just so that we orientate 
ourselves, this is the matter you deal with from paragraph 
14 of your affidavit, would that be correct? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   So, there are other matters that are dealt 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 145 of 224 
 
with but they’re in a sense, peripheral to the main issue 
and I thought I would just indicate to you, where precisely 
Mr Dingiswayo is leading evidence from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that’s fine. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So Chair – so in terms of just 
orientating myself I look at this file to see what happened, 
I come across a letter that is dated 10 June 2010 which 
seems to be the genesis of this relationship.  That letter, 
Chair, is marked as MMD3 and is on page 138. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The page number? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   138. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson – before you go on, just 
again orientation so you will recall, you might recall when 
Mr Holele gave evidence this letter came up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay well I can see that it has 
attracted my attention every time I see it. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair it’s a bit of a confusing letter but 
20 
how – it seems that what it sought to do was to say, as 
Prodigy we have a grant from the Services SETA of I think 
– well the numbers are a bit also confusing but at the  end 
it seems as if the number that was agreed to was 
R10.8million so we have a grant of R10.8million for training 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 146 of 224 
 
purposes now you have people that need training.  So, 
what we can do is, we can use this grant for training your 
people you claim the grant, so it’s a – for PRASA it 
becomes a zero sum, you pay Prodigy for training and then 
you claim from that grant that they have and the other 
thing is that there’s a – I think there was something around 
the fact that Prodigy was accredited to do something called 
recognition of prior learning…[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry Mr Dingiswayo, may I just place on 
record, you are reading from a document now, am I right? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   That’s MMD3 starting at page 138 and 
finishing at page 139. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now what is that, could you describe it for 
the record so that when the Chairperson is looking at this 
later, he knows what he is looking at. Now this is a 
letter…[intervenes]. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, it’s a letter from Prodigy, it is 
addressed to Mr Montana at PRASA, it’s signed by the 
20 
Director at Prodigy, a certain Nerishni Shunmugam.  
ADV SONI SC:   And the date? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   The date of the letter is 10 June 2010. 
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry you were explaining what this letter 
is about. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 147 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, now Chair on page 139, the third 
line, the sentence there says, 
“These interventions will also include recognition of 
prior learning and we’ll align to test critical skills 
required by PRASA”. 
 
So, it appeared that – and if I recall I may have 
seen, also, in this SCM file a submission to Mr Montana to 
say that PRASA would like to engage Prodigy by way of a 
confinement because they are the only people who are 
accredited to do recognition of prior learning.  So that was 
10 
the reason for the confinement, that you won’t be able to 
get another person to do this for you.  So, you will see that 
the – Mr Montana has made a note on that letter, there on 
page 138 and he seems quite excited about the proposal 
and gives an instruction that the necessary documents 
should be prepared so that the relationship can be 
established. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I see that he seems to have – the 
letter was written on the 10 t h of June 2010. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he signed that hand-written note on 
the 10 t h of June, the year doesn’t appear on my copy but it 
has to be 2010. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t think that he could have waited 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 148 of 224 
 
until it was 10 June of another year, so it has to be 2010. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it means it was written on the 10 t h of 
June 2010, probably delivered by hand or so, delivered to 
him say day and same day he made that note there and 
signed to accept it, to say it should be accepted, actually 
not to say it should be accepted, he says, it is accepted. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So, then there’s a – then there’s the 
10 
following document which is MMD4…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I know that we have dealt with this 
document – this letter before but basically Prodigy says, 
from what you say, says we have got money that we – that 
can be used for training, is that right, is that what you’re 
saying? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have people that need to be 
trained, we can provide the training but then it says, it 
says, you will pay us and claim back from that source that 
20 
we’re talking about but that will be a different source, not 
them, is that so? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It will be the SETA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be the SETA? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 149 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so they make it look like you won’t 
pay? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, it’s a zero sum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja you won’t pay, ja, so why not give it 
to us. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And we’ll also do recognition of prior 
learning for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And like I say, I think there’s a 
submission that I came across at the time that actually 
10 
said – stated that, that is the reason why – the reason for 
the confinement, is the accreditation for – so, and then 
there’s a contact that is concluded, Chair, which is a 
partnership agreement which starts on page 141 and runs 
to 152. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that’s MMD4. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is MMD4, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   What’s the essence of the agreement, in 
other words, what obligations were there on Prodigy and 
what obligations were there on PRASA? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   PRASA was supposed to provide 300 
of its employees for training by Prodigy at a cost of 
R10.8million.  You will see, Chair, on page 141 there’s – at 
the bottom there are two bullet points and the one talks 
about the provision of grant funding valued at that for 300 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 150 of 224 
 
learnership which Prodigy has secured from the Services 
SETA and the PRASA appoints – I’m not sure what actually 
happened at this point, I’m just looking at the documents 
as they come to me but the impression that I form is that 
this was the intention, this is what had been done.  So, 
Prodigy – how Prodigy puts the foot in the door is by 
saying, I have this grant and I am accredited, therefore 
let’s do a contract.  A contract is then prepared and signed 
and I take it their service is delivered but that’s for 300 
learners. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   And at a cost of? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Of R10.8million, but this is not the 
contract that was the subject of my instructions, let me 
see, I think the contract that was the subject of my 
instructions 
is 
the 
next 
contract 
which 
is 
MMD5…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So just for the sake of completeness that 
contract – partnership agreement that you were – we were 
looking at just now, namely MMD4 at page 141 was signed 
by, it would appear, Mr Montana as CEO on behalf of 
20 
PRASA.  
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there is a witness there and 
the designation for the witness appears to be GE – office 
of GCEO. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 151 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know that signature, whose 
signature is that? 
MR DINGISWAYO: It looks like Mr Holele’s signature.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay 
and 
you 
would 
– 
at 
that 
time…[intervenes].  
MR DINGISWAYO:   He was the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Occupied that position? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, yes you say then the contract 
10 
that you were dealing with is not this one? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because what was sought was – this one 
had lapsed? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   This one had run its course and it 
seems it was executed and discharged and the parties’ 
obligations were discharged. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but was it not the one that was 
sought to be extended or something? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not, oh this was the initial one? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So, this is what is giving me the 
background. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 152 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So, I – I’m sorry Chair, I think I’m – I 
was not correct, it’s not MMD5 that was the subject of my 
instructions it is MMD6. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Oh, 
okay 
and 
MMD6 
appears 
at 
…[intervenes] 
MR DINGISWAYO:   At page 170. 
CHAIRPERSON:   170 yes h’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And runs to 177. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if we are going to talk about MMD6, 
10 
it – would it not be more logical to talk first about MMD5 
unless there’s nothing to talk about on MMD5? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   We can – well it’s just for background 
purposes Chair because…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That too, had run its course? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   MMD5…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   It’s at page 154. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, I’m just trying to... 
ADV SONI SC:   Isn’t this the addendum to the original 
contract? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, now MMD5 is – I think, an 
interesting document, if you’re on page 156 there is – at 
the bottom there are paragraphs that are numbered 1 to 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
 
Now 
you’ll 
see 
number 
1 
is 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 153 of 224 
 
implementation of PRASA Customer Service – PRASA My 
station, frontline worker, programme, 3000 employees, 5 
days of training and 5 days of workplace mentorship and 
coaching.  Now the way this looks, MMD5 departs from 
MMD4 and introduces a new service, the training on 
Customer Services and then the second one is another 
training on all Customer Services of 6000 employees and 
then continual professional development of training for 
station and corridor management.  So those are the things 
that PRASA and Prodigy are going to have a relationship 
10 
on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  
MR DINGISWAYO:   So, the one that is against the 
paragraph marked number 1 at the bottom becomes MMD6, 
the training of the 3000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And you will see that it’s on page 170. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   You will see that it calls this the first 
phase under paragraph 2, the second numbered paragraph 
20 
it says, 
“The first phase of the three phase partnership 
agreement 
is 
for 
a 
minimum 
of 
3000 
PRASA 
employees commencing 1 s t September 2011 and to 
be completed by 31 s t March 2014”. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 154 of 224 
 
And if you go further and you will come to page 175 and 
there’s a table that’s there on page 175 under the heading, 
“invoicing schedule, phase one of three, PRASA my station 
programme” and the next page which is 176 you’ll see the 
total cost and under the heading, “number of learners” is 
3000 and the total cost including VAT is R82 080 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now for which year or what was the 
duration for this one? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   The duration, Chair, is where we 
started it is…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   2013…[intervenes]. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  On page 171 the second un-numbered 
paragraph under heading, “number 2”, the second line of 
that is 1 September 2011 to 31 March 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So, is that four years or three years? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It’s just over three years, I think it’s 
about three and a half years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now is this…[intervenes]. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No two and a half. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two and a half? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Apologies Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is this still provision of training to 
make PRASA employees to enable them to provide good 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 155 of 224 
 
service? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So Chair, we’ve moved now from what 
seems to have been recognition of prior learning, which is 
the 3000 the zero sum game of the – I’ve got a grant, give 
me people to train and you claim back from that grant and 
– which is the reason why we have the relationship with 
Prodigy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s what I want to understand, I 
want to see where we start to have something different, 
remember you started with the original. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you came with the original 
agreement, the partnership agreement.   
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was talking about the SETA 
money. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, which was based on the SETA 
20 
money. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Then there was another agreement 
which, I think, we didn’t talk much about then there was 
another one.  So I want to find out whether we are still – 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 156 of 224 
 
the basis for all this is still the SETA money or if it is no 
longer the SETA money this is the first time we are no 
longer dealing with the SETA money or whether any of the 
previous agreements were already no longer based on the 
SETA money, that’s what I want to establish. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So, the previous one – it seems to me, 
Chair, the previous one is sort of an umbrella and it – well 
it serves two purposes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The partnership one. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It departs from SETA and starts a new 
10 
relationship, altogether…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is MMD4 – MMD5…[intervenes]. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   MMD4 – 5 sorry, the one that is called 
addendum to partnership agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So that one…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s where the departure from the 
SETA starts?  
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That one starts now introducing 
customer services training for – first phase is 3000 
employees; second phase is 6000 employees and the – 
then continual professional development.  There’s no – it 
doesn’t talk about money or anything and programmes and 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 157 of 224 
 
things like this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
 
Where 
we 
start 
talking 
about…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry before you go there, I’m just trying 
to see if there is a relationship between – we have the 
partnership agreement as MMD4. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Then we have MMD5 and if you look at 
page 154, what is this document called? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It’s called an addendum to partnership 
agreement Chair. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But that is a misnomer it has – in my 
view it has absolutely nothing to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the content. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  In terms of the content with what was 
envisaged in the partnership agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You think the – the heading or title is 
there to mislead or maybe not intentionally? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No Chair I think it is intentional.  I think 
20 
– earlier I said the first one was – was the foot in the door. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Now when now the door is open. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can get you to do other things. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Seems – anything is possible. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 158 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but on the face of it might be – it must 
look like we are still continuing. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Like it is a continuation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Partnership. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  So if this was a new agreement the first 
agreement was a confine – was based on confinement. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  If this was a new agreement you would 
10 
have to follow Section 217. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  But this is now as the Chairperson has 
pointed out simply titled Addendum but in effect has nothing 
to do with the previous agreement. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chair it has nothing to 
do with the previous agreement.  It has nothing to do with 
the rationale for the previous agreement and it does not – it 
has nothing to do with the services contemplated in the 
previous agreement.  But I am saying – I am calling it sort 
20 
of an umbrella because it now starts a new thing of 
customer services. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.   
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I then ask you if you look at MMD6. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 159 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 170.  What is that document called? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It is called an Annexure.  It is – no it is 
called Annexure A2 of Addendum to Partnership Agreement. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And when is that agreement entered 
into? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  If you look at page 177 you will see it. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  It is dated 21 October 2012 it is 
signed by Mr Montana on that date. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  So the annexure to the agreement – n sorry 
and if I can ask you could look at page 168 that is the date 
on which the previous agreement, the addendum was 
entered into. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  What is that date? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It is 30 August 2011. 
ADV SONI SC:  So the annexure is entered into more than a 
year later? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  So that just puts those agreements in 
context 
or 
a 
purported 
relationship 
between 
those 
agreements in context? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  Chair the – this – one of the 
things that is striking about MMD6 is on page 175 under the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 160 of 224 
 
heading No 4 Learner Cost of PRASA My Station Program.  
The first unnumbered per learner cost of the program is 
R24 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you say page 175? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  175. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is – oh the Learner Cost of the 
PRASA My Station Program? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The My Station Program was that 
something that was started by PRASA or did they come up 
10 
with it as part of what – of giving a name to what they 
wanted to do? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes Chair they just gave a name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They came up with it. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Who? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prodigy? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Prodigy – I do not know who came up 
with the name Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay, okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But it was just called My Station. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  You say the per learner cost was R24 000. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  That means for each learner.  What did the 
– in terms of days and so on what did the – the program 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 161 of 224 
 
entail? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I am not sure if it is here on MMD6 but 
you will recall that it is a five-day course.  I think we saw it 
on MMD5.  It is a five-day course and – and five days of 
workplace mentorship and coaching.  Now in response to 
Counsel’s question Chair may I ask you to go to page 172 
and there is a table there and you will see on the – I think it 
is the – what is it?  Is it the fourth column which says: 
Develop Customised PRASA My Station Skills.  And it will 
speak – it talks about transport NQF1 and professional 
10 
driver NQF3 and transport passenger services NQF3.  Now 
this is an according to your qualifications standards that are 
issued by the qualification’s authority.  And I am drawing 
your attention to this because as far as I know NQF4 is 
matric.  The reason I am – I was drawing your attention to 
that price is that you are here with a course on customer 
services which is pitched at a level that is less than a 
matric for five days and it is R24 000.00 per learner.  I think 
it is the most expensive customer services training in the 
world.  But Chair so what then causes concern for me as I 
20 
look at this transaction is that which the Chair has noted 
simply starting the relationship on one basis and coming up 
with a confinement because that is a deviation from the 
normal process and then simply introducing another process 
mid-stream – sorry another service mid-stream which is not 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 162 of 224 
 
related to why you confined in the first place.  So I then 
raised this as a concern to the colleague to say, this is 
irregular because I think there is so many people who can 
do customer services training.  There is nothing unique 
about customer services training and I think it is too 
expensive.  I mean I think the prices are much, much less 
than – especially for just five days.  But I did not – I did not 
want to get into that. I said to the colleagues I think this is 
irregular and I would prefer not to be involved in it.  I wrote 
there an email to Mr Montana to say I think that he may 
10 
have been misled to enter into – for this agreement to be 
concluded.  Sorry I wrote that letter – that email to the then 
Chief Procurement Officer a Mr Joseph Phangula to say I 
think 
that 
the 
Group 
CEO 
was 
misled 
because 
the 
relationship starts as one thing and then it just out of 
nowhere morphs into another.  I was not supposed to do 
that.  An – Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get a response in writing? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  From the – so the – if I remember well 
the Group Chief Procurement Officer said he will bring this 
20 
to the attention of Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That – so she sent me a short response 
that just says something along those lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 163 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So after some time and I think at some 
point I think I did not put my foot down at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But after some time, I said guys this is – 
I am not going to be involved in this because it is irregular 
so please do not bring this thing here.  I have told you it is 
irregular and you insist that I should do this.  I am not – I 
am not going to do something of this nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And then there was an email that was 
10 
then coming from Mr Montana – apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I thought you wanted to say something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So an email came from Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I do not know if it is here. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes it is at page 187. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  1? 
ADV SONI SC:  187. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  187. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is in MD – MMD8. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Okay.  Yes so that is – that is the email 
that was…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not have the one that you sent to 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 164 of 224 
 
the Group Chief Procurement Officer because if we do – oh 
no it is not we do not have it here. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  You know – no Chair I do not have it 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it can be found? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It can be found Chair.  I had requested 
the investigators to request that I be given access. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the premises. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  To my laptop and my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And I do not think anything came out of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think it should be – attempts 
should be made to find it and – and I think nobody is going 
to resist if we ask that he be allowed to have his laptop in 
order to assist the commission. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes so – so but you are referring us 
20 
now to the one at page 187? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It is an email that is from Mr Montana.  
It is addressed to Ms Nonhlanhla Kondowe, Fani Dingiswayo 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 165 of 224 
 
and Sidney Khuzwayo and then it is other people are copied 
there including my manager Mathongene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was or is Nonhlanhla Kondowe?  
What position was she holding? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Nonhlanhla Kondowe is in the HR 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  She – she was the person who was 
really running with this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 And 
I 
remember 
in 
one 
of 
my 
discussions with her I said but the end user is supposed to 
be rail – the rail division no HR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Why am I talking to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Because I said to her I think one of the 
problems 
that 
cost 
the 
situation 
where 
you 
finding 
yourselves in is that the end user is not the one needing the 
discussions and telling you I can make so many frontline 
20 
stuff available at such a time so that you have a proper 
schedule of the train.  But she was what I would consider 
the champion of this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  In essence what does that email say Mr 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 166 of 224 
 
Dingiswayo? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  The essence of the email Chair is the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think I know it has been read into 
the record but I think we may as well have it read again 
because it is quite important.  Just read that email from Mr 
Lucky Montana to Ms Nonhlanhla Kondowe and others. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It reads Chair. 
“Dear 
Nonhlanhla 
there 
is 
nothing 
wrong 
with 
the 
10 
appointment of Prodigy nor with the extension of their 
contracts.  I am not surprised I think that is what it is 
supposed to say I am not surprised because this is part of a 
much bigger agenda which has targeted certain contracts.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just hang on before you proceed.  When 
he says this – I am not surprised because this is part of a 
much bigger agenda.  What do you understand this to refer 
to? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I – Chair I have – I do not know.  I think 
after in November – in December and January – in 
20 
December 2014 and January 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Mr Montana was on leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  When he came back from leave. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 167 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  He had a lot of what I think was some 
paranoia and some – he was unsettled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  He felt – he felt extremely unsettled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Because before this there was a 
meeting of what is called the extended exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And I mean I do not – because of my – 
10 
because I am a junior employee I do not go to those 
meetings.  But an extended exco I was invited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  In that meeting there was this long 
about two-hour complaint by Mr Montana complaining about 
people who have got agendas and that he is going to 
expose them and whatever.  So I was really shocked 
because I have – I have never been in a meeting where like 
you have – you discuss the business of the meeting and at 
some point the person chairing the meeting has just a very 
20 
long speech that he is – he is talking and everyone is quiet 
and he is really saying – talking about this agenda that is – 
that has been launched.  He is talking about people that are 
trying to get the favour of the board at his expense because 
they are probably after his job or something like that. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 168 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It was a very – it was a very strange 
thing to me I mean I – like I am saying I have never been in 
that kind of a situation where – I thought maybe somebody 
will say can you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will stop him. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Can you tell us what you are talking 
about because everything was couched in very general 
terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Because I certainly felt I would want 
him to stop or I – or be specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Now if there is somebody in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That he is addressing then they must 
have a separate meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But it – we cannot all be detained here 
you know and be listening to this that – at the time I thought 
20 
had absolutely nothing to do with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But I realised like from that time on up 
until he left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 169 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That was going to be repeated over and 
over again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Against employees of PRASA and 
against the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay continue. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So – so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  …[intervenes] 
MR DINGISWAYO:  …[intervenes] was a big agenda which 
has targeted certain contracts and appointments and to 
10 
project – and to project these as being irregular.  Some of 
the contracts had already been leaked to external auditors 
and the media as part of a strategy to discredit the Group 
CEO and create a cloud before he steps down at the end of 
the year.  And then the next paragraph says: 
“This 
is 
a 
well-co-ordinated 
strategy 
that 
started 
in 
November 2014 when I went on leave. I was at the most 
appropriate time – I will at the most appropriate time act 
against all those who are involved in this dirty campaign.  
The investigation they are starting is unlawful and part of a 
20 
plot I am well aware of.  The extent of opportunism by some 
of our managers really amazes me.  A manager like Sidney 
Khuzwayo should start first by cleaning the many irregular 
appointments he has party to within SCM which I have been 
trying to address and even explaining some of these to the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 170 of 224 
 
office of the Public Protector.  Some of the managers are 
excited by the new board and are feeding all sorts of wrong 
information so that they could carry: 
I think he wanted to say: 
“Carry favour with the board.  They will be the biggest 
losers at the end of this process.  A decision to partner with 
Prodigy on the training of customer services remains sound 
and the extension of the contract is still in order.  Please 
allow them to continue with their strategy which is bound to 
fail.” 
10 
Then he says: 
“Kind Regards.  Lucky Montana.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of what 
made Mr Montana write this letter?  Having read it in the 
context 
of 
what 
was 
happening 
what 
was 
your 
understanding of why he wrote this letter? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair I – I thought that the colleagues 
that I was dealing with who in the Prodigy matter it – I 
thought they were reporting back to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  To say this is the – these are the views 
that are held by this man and now I think that at this time 
they had told him that now he has said please leave me out 
of this matter.  And I think at the time I also said it should 
not come to the legal department.  If – because I mean Mr 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 171 of 224 
 
Montana has his own lawyer in his office who can – who can 
do this work.  But I am very uncomfortable with – with 
having my name associated with this irregularity.  So I think 
that he – there had been – there had been reports that had 
been sent to him. I think that – I think the reference to Mr 
Sidney Khuzwayo was a deflection.  I think that the entire 
thing was addressed to me that is how I understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said earlier on that this was a 
meeting of the extended executives, is that right? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And which you would normally – well you 
would normally not attend meetings of the executive 
committee. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had been invited to this one. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Because it was an extended exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it – ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was an extended exco.  Were there 
others who were invited to – or in other words were you the 
20 
only one who made it to be an extended exco or were there 
others who – who were there who also contributed to 
making it an external exco? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja.  No I wish I was the only one who 
made that cut Chair but no I was not. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 172 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. The people at my level 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Of General Manager are invited for 
extended exco’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For external exco’s. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  For extended exco’s yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Okay.   
MR DINGISWAYO:  But I am saying that this whole thing 
about Sidney is just a deflection. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a deflection ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Because I said earlier that I am a junior 
employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Sidney’s position is junior to mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And he would not be dealing with – only 
– he would not be involved in irregular appointments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  As someone else was – who is higher 
20 
than Sidney would have to sign off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  On any appointments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So I – I just thought this – this is just 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 173 of 224 
 
something that has been put there to – to hide the fact that 
this entire thing is a response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But quite clearly – quite clearly this was a 
– Mr Montana’s response to the stance taken by some which 
included you that the Prodigy contract was irregular. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that reading of this correct? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But at that stage apart from you who 
else had made it known that they also thought that this 
Prodigy contract was irregular? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Well in writing I was the only one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were the only one? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  I had – I had discussed it with – 
with Ms Martha Ngoye. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Especially even at the time when I 
thought I am not engaging in this anymore. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I am getting out of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  To say to him – to say to her this is the 
stance that I have taken. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 174 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And I am not going to do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  She agreed with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  She agreed with you. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  With me and I think I even – because 
we have – we have monthly – at the time we had monthly 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  As a department. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I think I may have tabled the issue at 
the departmental meeting.  Because I had – I had given – I 
had made a number of enquiries to try and see if there is 
nothing wrong with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So this – I thought no, no this – that is 
fine no further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Now how – how long before the 18 
May 2015 which is a date of this letter had you written to 
20 
say you – this contract was irregular and I think you had 
written the Group Chief Procurement Officer? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long before that – that date more or 
less? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 175 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  At most a week Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so it was close? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It was a very time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja a very short time. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Very short time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And he of course had told you that he 
would convey to Mr Montana your stance. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now did you get to know whether Ms 
Kondowe and Nonhlanhla was the letter the salutation is 
10 
Dear Nonhlanhla? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You know it is not Dear Mr Dingiswayo. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is Dear Nonhlanhla did you get to know 
whether Ms Kondowe had written anything to Mr Montana 
about the Prodigy contract to which maybe which had 
prompted Mr Montana to write to her?  Or is that something 
you never got to know? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No I never got to know Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you know whether Ms Kondowe 
was agreeing with your position on this contract or not at 
that time? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No she – she never agreed with my 
position. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 176 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She did not agree with your position? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She – but she – did she – was she against 
it?  Did she articulate a different position or she never said 
anything? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No Chair I mean she – she never 
engaged with me about my position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But I mean having checked also her 
conduct after all these things when she was working very 
10 
hard to – to try and make sure that Prodigy is paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I do not think that she – she agreed with 
my – she never expressed her disagreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She never articulated. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any position. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
She 
might 
just 
have 
carried 
out 
instructions. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I think – I think that if I am not mistaken 
at best Chair what she may have said is that look I mean 
Prodigy would not know our processes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 177 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Sort of it is a – is an innocent party to 
this thing and now they are in this situation we have put 
them in that situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now this letter from... I mean, this email 
from Mr Montana is dated the 18t h of May. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  May. 
ADV SONI SC:  May. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  What was the next major incident that 
happened after this letter was sent? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  On the 19t h ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Of the following day? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  On the 19t h of May...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe actually before we do that.  I see 
we are at one minute past four.  I am quite happy that we 
continue ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...up to five to try and finish.  If we... if 
that suits everybody. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if we are going onto to five, maybe we 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 178 of 224 
 
should take a short break.  Mr Dingiswayo, you are happy 
with continuing. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I am okay Chair.  I am on suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Soni, [laughs] oh you are on 
suspension?  You have got all the time. [laughs] 
ADV SONI SC:  We enjoy the interaction. [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laugh] Okay.  Alright.  Let us take a short 
break and we will come back at ten past. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS: 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to go back to the letter MMDH at page 
92.  So Mr Dingiswayo, as... would it be correct to say, as far 
as you know, at the time of this meeting of the extended 
executive... No, no.  I am sorry.   
 
At the time of this letter, you were the only one among 
the employees of PRASA who had taken the position that 
this contract was irregular and that would have been 
conveyed to Mr Montana.   
20 
 
As far as Mr Ngoye is concerned, she was agreeing with 
you but that was a discussion between ...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the two of you at that stage. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chair. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 179 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the probabilities are, you would say, 
are that Mr Montana knew only you as the person who was 
saying this was irregular. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If there other people, we could hear 
from him. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not know of anyone else who 
10 
had taken that style... that stand and said it should be 
conveyed... it can... it could be conveyed to him. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, Chair.  I can confirm that... I mean, 
I think someone like Sydney was trying to see if we can find 
a solution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had taken a clear position? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Your mic.  Your mic. 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
Chair, 
the 
following 
day, 
after 
I 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 180 of 224 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you deal with that.  How did this 
letter make you feel? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I wanted to respond to the... to this email 
Chair.  But I realised that I will be now on the... a real war 
path with the Group CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So I had a discussion about it with my 
10 
boss because I mean, the... all these things what he is 
saying about these general statements are incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And I do not... Maybe there was an 
agenda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I was not part of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But it was clear.  As... Chair, you have 
noted that according to my knowledge at the time, I had been 
20 
the only person who had expressed this view.   
 
And this view is now emerged into what is call a bigger 
agenda about people who are investigating Mr Montana 
unlawfully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 181 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And Chair, you... I think at this time, it 
was before even the Werksmans’ investigation started.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So I... so there is a lot of strange things 
that are said in this email which are associated with this 
view which I felt I probably just need to set the record 
straight and say, this is my view.   
 
It has nothing to do with all these things that are being 
mentioned here.  It is something that I believe is legally 
sound and it is an independent view, a professional view. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But Chair, in some of these institutions 
you cannot tell a professional view which is sound, if it 
interferes with other people’s personal interest, then you get 
dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And the normal thing is that they confuse 
their own personal interests with PRASA’s interest because 
they will always use that cloak of saying, you are acting 
against PRASA when, in fact, you maybe be dealing with his 
20 
own personal interests. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m.  And when he says in the end of 
the third paragraph:  “They would be the biggest losers at 
the end of this process”. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 182 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did you think he was talking about? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I thought he was talking about me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And that is why I thought I needed to 
isolate the professional view from all this.  All this paranoia 
and say, I have nothing to do with... I do not have... I do not 
have 
the 
time 
or 
the 
inclination 
for 
agendas 
and 
opportunism.   
 
I am just working here.  And this is just a view that I am 
expressing.  So I believed that he intended to do something 
10 
drastic.  And that is why I thought it would be necessary to 
respond to the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  But in my discussion with Ms Ngoye, we 
agreed that we do not escalate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
Let 
us 
de-escalate 
the 
situation.  
Maybe... and hope for the best. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.    
ADV SONI SC:  What though happened on the following day? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I was on my way home in the evening 
from work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now on the ...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  On the 19t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...on 19t h of ...[intervenes]  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 183 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of May 2015. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015, ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  I am on my way home and when I 
am about five minutes away from home, I received a call 
from PRASA.  I pick it up and it is Mr Montana’s personal 
assistant.  I think it was De Beer.  I mentioned her yesterday, 
Dumi. 
 
She calls and says, “Mr Montana would like to see you”.  
10 
I say, when?  She says, “Now”.   
 
So I am like: “I am close to home.  Does he need to see 
me today?  Please let him know I am close to home but if he 
needs to see me today, I will come back to the office”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  At what time was this, Mr Dingiswayo? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Maybe around seven. 
ADV SONI SC:  In the evening? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, seven in the evening.  So I get 
home and as I am driving into my driveway, I get another call 
20 
from the same number.  I pick it up and she tells me, “No, 
no, no.  He wants to see you now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was still his PA? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 184 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So I then say, okay.  Now the people 
inside the house have seen I am driving.  So I have to go 
and say, “I have been called back to work”.  And like... and 
everyone is like:  “Are you serious?”   
 
So then I called... I am on my way back to work and I 
call Ms Ngoye and I say to her, “I think I am going to be 
fired”.   
 
So she says, “Why?”  I said I received this call and this 
is what happened.  She says, “Okay, just go and let me know 
what happens”.   
10 
 
I get to the office.  He was finishing a meeting and 
walking the people that he was meeting with out.  And he 
then says... he comes back, he says... he greets and he 
says, “Come in”. 
 
I go into his office.  And then he says that he has heard 
that I am working against the interest of PRASA.  So I am 
taken aback, okay. 
 
He starts talking about some tender that he said I was... 
he said I wanted to cancel a tender.  So I say, “Okay, but 
wait.  I do not have the power to cancel a tender.  Which 
20 
tender are you talking about?” 
 
Then he explains what he is talking about.  I say, “No, 
no, no.  We are approached because the BEC is having 
some problems with this tender and we were asked to give 
advice.  We gave the advice.   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 185 of 224 
 
 
And the advice was nothing mere to cancellation of the 
tender.  There was just a bottle neck.  We gave advice to 
ease that bottle neck, so that the work of the BEC can 
continue”. 
 
He says, “No, I do not want to hear anything from you.  I 
have been told what I have been told”.  And then he goes all 
over... he talks about a number of things that I am acting 
against him.  I am leaking documents to the board.   
 
Now I am really stunt that... how does... how does one 
leak documents to the board?  I mean, the documents of the 
10 
company are documents of the company.  The board is the 
accounting authority. 
 
And I am thinking, I am so far from the board.  I do not 
even know who is in the board.  I have never interacted with 
these people.  My normal work does not bring me anywhere 
close to these people. 
 
But I cannot say these things because I have been told 
that:  “No, I do not want to hear anything from you”.  And 
then he says, “All I brought you here to tell you is that you 
no longer work here”.   
20 
 
So I am like okay.  And he says, “We can talk about how 
much I pay you for you to leave your employment”.  I said, 
“No, I am not interested in that discussion.” 
 
He says, “Okay.  Then you do not... you are fired”.  I say 
okay.  And... so I realise that he is done and I gesture to 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 186 of 224 
 
stand from my seat.   
 
Then 
he 
says, 
“You 
can 
wait 
for 
your 
letter 
of 
termination or you can get it tomorrow or you can tell us 
where to deliver it”. 
 
It was not a long meeting Chair.  And I think he said I 
could wait because his legal advisor was there present, Ms 
Naidoo.  I think she was the one who going to draft the 
termination letter. 
 
So I say, “No, no.  I will come back tomorrow and get it.  
I will come and also get my personal belongings from the 
10 
office”.  And so I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not even you are suspended? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are fired? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  No, I was fired on the spot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he says he does not want to hear 
anything from you? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.  The only thing he can engage on is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  How much you want to be paid? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are fired? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  In his words, he says, “You no longer 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 187 of 224 
 
work here”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how he put it. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you come in working here? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. [laugh] 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you go out not working here? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. [laugh] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now the tender that he was 
10 
referring to, are you able to remember what it was connected 
with? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair, I do not remember but what I 
remember is that, they... you know in a situation of a tender, 
there is a part where you do the technical evaluation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Where you need to meet a certain 
threshold before other aspects of the tender can be 
considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Now the specification was drafted in 
such a way that you needed to... that type of collaboration I 
think was divided into four or five aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And they said you need to meet a 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 188 of 224 
 
minimum, I think of like 80% on each of those aspects for 
you to get the typical... the threshold of the typical criteria 
to...   
 
So they said to us, there is none of the tenderers who 
gets all of those five aspects at that level and... according to 
the scoring.   
 
And... but the technical advisors... because there was 
technical advisors there.  Siyaya was with the technical 
advisors of that tender.  They say that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that tender committed with Siyaya?   
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Siyaya was one of the ...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  The professionals that are assisting 
PRASA to do their evaluation of the tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  So they said... the typical advisors are 
saying they are satisfied that some of the people can 
actually do that job because the whole point of a technical 
evaluation is to assess whether the tenderer can actually do 
the work. 
20 
 
We said to them, “Look, you seem to be having a 
problem with you technical evaluation criteria because if you 
are satisfied that they can do the work but your evaluation 
criteria says they cannot, that is what you need to deal with 
because it is not achieving what it is supposed to achieve”. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 189 of 224 
 
 
And the guys that we consulted with were happy and 
they left.  And then later on, I was accused of wanting to 
cancel that tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you also say, he accused you at 
that 
short 
meeting 
of 
leaking 
some... 
leaking 
some 
documents to the media or...? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  To the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the board? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was it to the board only or also to 
10 
somebody else? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  To the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the board? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now in the letter of 18 May, you did 
also speak again about people who are leaking...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...documents but he said to the media. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The external auditors ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, the external auditors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  Okay.  Alright.  So you left.  You 
said you will come back the following day to take your letter. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, to take the letter and take my 
personal belongings. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 190 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  Now, after you left Mr Montana’s office, what 
was the next thing you did? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Well, as soon as I left the building Chair, 
I reported back to my boss as I indicated that I would call 
her after the meeting and I told her that... I told her that I am 
going to be fired and I am fired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am sure she could not... she thought 
you... she could not believe that you ...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  No, she thought I am joking. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And I said, “No, I am not joking.  I am 
fired”.  But I mean, I have seen it coming from this letter 
because that “biggest losers”, I thought it is a threat.   
 
It is a threat although, the threat was a raid by the name 
of Sivele Khuzo(?) but I did not see it.  But I could see it.   
 
So she said... she did not believe me.  She said, “Let us 
meet”.  And we arranged to meet and I told her this is what 
happened.  And she realised that I am not joking.   
 
And she made a call to Mr Montana and asked him, “This 
20 
guy...”.  I mean, she was shocked.  She was shocked.  And 
she made the call whilst shocked that how did this happen?   
“This person reports to me.  You do not tell me what you 
are doing and you just fired him.  I mean, how does that 
work?”   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 191 of 224 
 
And then I did not hear everything that was discussed.  I 
only heard what Ms Ngoye was saying.  And from what she 
was saying and once she has told me, they had agreed to 
meet the next day for him to take her through the reasons 
why he had made this very drastic decision.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when Mr Montana asked you about 
that tender which I think you said he said he understood you 
wanted to cancel. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he make you... did he represent that 
10 
your dismissal was because you wanted to cancel that 
tender?  Was... did you understand that he wanted you to 
believe that that is what the dismissal was about? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, Chair.  So he... that is one of the 
things that he mentioned.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  He mentioned the cancellation of the 
tender, he mentioned working against PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  He mentioned leaking information to the 
20 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it... you are... he may have 
wanted 
you 
to 
believe 
that 
it 
was 
all 
of 
those 
things...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 192 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he mentioned. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  And he did not mention 
anything that was connected with the letter or that was in the 
letter? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  With the email? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The email, ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair, I really do not recall him saying 
anything about Prodigy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Except that, I guess, that... in 
10 
that email, the one addressed to, Dear Matlantle. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that email, he is speaking strongly 
against those whom he was accusing of working against him. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So it may not be that if you are leaking 
documents to the board you may have been working against 
him if he ...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  If indeed you can leak documents to a 
board.  Yes, then that we are. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laugh]  Well, certainly from his point of 
view. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can, you are good.  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Ja. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 193 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Alright.  Ms Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  As it please you.  Now, Ms Ngoye is giving 
evidence that after that meeting which was about as short as 
your meeting was with Mr Montana... oh, sorry.  At the end of 
that meeting, Mr Montana told her that you were fired or you 
no longer... 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes.   
ADV SONI SC:  Now...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, Mr Soni.  Please do not forget 
10 
your next question. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You said that you... I asked you earlier 
on about what... I think I believe I did you ask you.  [laugh]  I 
hope I did.  About what you believed was the reason why Mr 
Montana dismissed you that evening.  What, on your 
analysis, is the reason why you were dismissed? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  According to me Chair, I gave a view that 
is legally sound and that was against his personal interest.  
He appeared overly invested in this relationship.   
20 
 
I mean, it is a... in the greater scheme of PRASA, this is 
a very small contract, especially taking into account that two 
thirds of that contract had been implemented already.  It is a 
miniscule contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 194 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  PRASA burns... well, it is supposed to 
burn more than R 20 billion a year.  Now when we are talking 
about a contract of R 82 million, which is two thirds... has 
not discharged two thirds of the way and you have this very 
bizarre response to a legally sound view, then it shows that 
extend of your investment, your personal investment in the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  H’m.  So you believe that he 
dismissed you because of the position you had taken with 
regard to the Prodigy contract? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Well, Chair.  Let me put it this way.  
This... it is some... this one is the crescendo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  There are things that happen.  I mean, 
for an example, there is a very... there is a story that is not 
told about the fact that at some point there is an intention to 
increase 
the 
value 
of 
the 
Swifambo 
contract 
from 
R 3,5 billion to R 5 billion. 
20 
 
And we were asked to do that addendum.  And we said, 
“Well, no.  You guys are too far off with this thing.  It is an 
addendum”.   
 
I... because we queried a couple of things and it did not 
make sense but... because the rational that was stated for 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 195 of 224 
 
the increase in the contract price was that the Euro had 
moved against the Rand and because of that the contract 
value must increase so that we still get they still get this 
thing of committees. 
 
Now, I mean even to me who is a lawyer who does not 
know numbers, an increase from R 3,5 billion to R 5 billion, 
it is almost 33%.  I do not think the Euro could have increase 
so much. 
 
So that is one of the things that... you could see the 
level of irritation growing as you are saying, “Please, do not 
10 
include me in this.  If you want to go ahead with it, you go 
ahead with it but...” 
 
And we said, “We were approached by Ms Malongete.  
He said, “You know this thing better than all of us.   We have 
fundamental problems with this contract but... so you draft 
and then we do not want to go back to those problems.  So 
just finish the addendum.   
 
She had... she actually had a draft of that addendum but 
she wanted us to be... to have an input to it. And he said, 
“Please, do not get us involved in this”.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say, you were fired, as far as you 
are concerned, for this position you took with regard to the 
Prodigy contract? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say that happened as culmination 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 196 of 224 
 
of a number of things that had happened before what you 
have just said. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of which was the...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Attempts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Attempts.  You stand.  Not to want to be 
involved in interest in the Swifambo contract. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, I perhaps should have asked earlier.  
10 
Very early in your evidence, you talked about a parallel 
process and you were saying it in reference to the work you 
and Ms Ngoye did.   
 
Is that the process that you are now describing that Ms 
Malongete and the lady in Mr Montana’s office you were 
engaged with, is that the parallel process you are talking 
about? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  So in other words... oh, if I can just ask you 
and tell me if I am wrong.  There was the official process 
20 
that you... your office and Ms Ngoye’s office was involved 
with. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And there was this process of his own 
personal advisors and an outsider...[intervenes]  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 197 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  ...that... who was advising him, Mr Montana. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And who had drawn up the Swifambo 
contract?  Was it your office... oh, sorry.  Your office.  Or 
was it these other processes? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  It was DM5.  As I understood it, it was 
Ms Brenda Malongete who drew up the contract.  
ADV SONI SC:   So your office was not involved in the 
drafting of Swifambo. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No.  No, it was not. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now Ms Ngoye has described the manner 
in which Mr Montana dismissed her and of course she 
would have told you about it but in relation to your 
dismissal – your and her dismissal, what happened next? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   So I did not go to the office on the 20 t h 
as I indicated I would because now there is this meeting 
and I felt - I do not know, maybe let me not be 
presumptuous, let me just park my going back to the office 
and then she was fired and she relayed the message to 
20 
me.  So we then went to the CCMA.   
We did two things basically, we wrote to the board, 
we said this is what has happened to us and we believe 
these are the reasons that this has happened to us. 
 
We are taking the matter to the CCMA but we 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 198 of 224 
 
wanted you as the board to know that this is what 
happened under your watch and so we did not receive any 
response from the board but what happened after that is 
we were called back to the office and the letters of 
dismissal - I think about a week later the letters of 
dismissal were withdrawn by Mr Montana and then he then 
asked us to show cause why he should not suspend us. 
 
We wrote representations, he rejected them and 
suspended us and we were on suspension until he left. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now in paragraph 14.15 at page 105 you 
10 
give your assessment of Mr Montana’s state of mind in 
regard to the two dismissals.  Will you indicate to the 
Chairperson what you thought his state of mind was?  This 
is paragraph 14.15. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes.  Chair, I state here that: 
“I submit that the reaction of Mr Montana was of 
one 
who 
had 
suffered 
a 
bout 
of 
temporary 
irrationality or someone who was overly invested in 
showing that his word was final or someone who 
was overly invested in this transaction and was 
20 
intolerant 
of 
anyone 
who 
saw 
the 
screaming 
irregularities in the transaction.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, what paragraph, what page was 
that? 
ADV SONI SC:   It is page 105, paragraph 14.15, 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 199 of 224 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. Paragraph 105? 
ADV SONI SC:   No, page 105. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 105. 
ADV SONI SC:    Paragraph 14.15, just at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I think I – it has been a long day, 
I am looking at the wrong – I am looking at Mr Achmat’s 
affidavit.  Okay.  Okay, let me get the page number again 
now.  I am on the right document now.  Paragraph 14? 
ADV SONI SC:   14.15 which is right at the bottom of that 
10 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have got it, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   I thought …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why I did hear 25 or something?  Okay, I 
have got it. 
ADV SONI SC:   I thought just Mr Dingiswayo’s description 
of what he understood or what he thought Mr Montana’s 
state of mind is, is a matter that you are looking at as a 
whole, Chairperson.  I thought we needed to put that on 
record. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright, then you have said in paragraph 
14.16 that you went to the board.  What we have not done, 
I am looking at the parallel process, in paragraph 14.17 at 
page 106.   
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 200 of 224 
 
Now you go back to the SLA and what happened to 
that?  This is the agreement you said you would not 
support, is that correct? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, the SLA was intended to be an 
annexure to the agreement because, I mean, I said I think 
as I am preparing myself to assist you, I need to – a 
programme of the rest of these trainings as well as – 
before looking at the issues of whether it is irregular or 
not, the programme of the training, I also need some – 
there must be some service level agreement that you 
10 
conclude with the service provider. 
 
So the document I was going to prepare would just 
contain the general terms but the specifics in terms of what 
is going to be the – the training is going to be and all of 
those things should be in this document called an SLA and 
then Ms Kondoa(?) told me that no, no, no, we have been 
talking about that, in fact I can send you a draft and then 
she sent me a document which is very similar to what is 
the SLA. 
ADV SONI SC:   MMD7? 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   MMD7. 
ADV SONI SC:   Page 179.   
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, I do not think so, I think it – no, 
sorry, I have joined the Chair, I am at the wrong place. 
ADV SONI SC:   Page 179. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 201 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   That is the SLA. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, yes, that is the document that 
was given to me but you will see when you read this 
document it does not have any of the essential terms of the 
contract, it does not tell you how many people are going to 
be trained, how much is this training going to cost and all 
of those things because it was not intended to be a self-
standing document. 
ADV SONI SC:   And you articulate that at paragraph 14.17 
10 
your reasons, is that correct, why you thought that the SLA 
was inadequate? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, yes, that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   And why PRASA should not enter into 
such a contract. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Because the obligations of the parties 
were not properly set out and, in any case,, it now had 
become a self-standing agreement. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Now you were now dismissed on the 19 
May. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   But do you say that that agreement, the 
SLA, was concluded by PRASA or signed by PRASA on the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 202 of 224 
 
29 May?  This is a week and a half after your dismissal, is 
that correct?  Look at the last page of the SLA, you will 
see that. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes.  Yes, so it is signed on behalf of 
PRASA on the 29 t h. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  And you say a Ms Koko signed the 
agreement? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   No, I am just going back – was she in your 
department?  In other words, in the legal department? 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, she was in the HR department.  
ADV SONI SC:    You say she was not in the HR 
department but …[intervenes] 
MR DINGISWAYO:   She was in the HR department. 
ADV SONI SC:   She was in the HR department? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   But this, given the fact that it is R82 
million contract ought to be signed by -  I mean, it ought to 
pass through legal, would that be correct? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, Chair, that would be – well, all 
20 
contracts should be regardless of the size. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now do you know if this passed through 
Group Legal? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I do not think so, Chair, because I had 
– as stated, I had not reported about this at the monthly 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 203 of 224 
 
meeting of the legal department where all the legal 
advisers come and they – partly, I mean, it was to alert 
them to the fact that, you know, we do not do the – we do 
not get involved in these kind of things so I do not think it 
went past – I mean, even the quality of the document, as a 
self-standing document, I do not think that any of my 
colleagues in the legal department would have agreed to 
this being the document. 
ADV SONI SC:   You are not in a position to say whether it 
had passed through the eyes of lawyer, if I could use such 
10 
an expression? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, no, not [indistinct – dropping 
voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may have dealt with this already and 
maybe I missed it.  Do you know who had drafted it? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   According to Ms Kondoa it is a 
document they were developing with Ms Shunmugan of 
Prodigy.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. .Ja, okay.  And contracts 
would ordinarily be prepared by the legal department, is it 
20 
not? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, we either draft a …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if somebody else drafts them they 
would have to be approved by the legal department. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair.  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 204 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was Ms Kondoa legally qualified? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was Ms Koko legally qualified? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   As far as I know, no, Chair, she was in 
the HR department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright, then you describe or you point out 
that there were other people who had suffered adverse 
consequences at the hands of Mr Montana and you say that 
at 14.18. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair, Mr Khuzwayo 
was suspended and there was just a dramatic thing that 
was done around his suspension.   
 
I am told that these reflector things were – where, 
you know, that are used for where there is an investigation 
by police to warn people not to go in were put around his 
office door just to add drama to his suspension. 
 
Mr Gangia was not suspended with such much 
fanfare but he was one of the people who are saying on the 
payments that – the payments that PRASA was claiming 
20 
were not valid or were not warranted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you refer to Mr Khuzwayo and Mr 
Gangia in that sentence, a letter you say who refused to 
requisition.  Is it Mr Gangia who refused to requisition 
payment or is it both Mr Khuzwayo and Mr Gangia? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 205 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It is Mr Gangia, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright.  And did you get to 
know why Mr Khuzwayo was suspended or not really? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, I think he said to me he was 
accused of losing documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   But after Mr Montana left what happened 
to Mr Khuzwayo and Mr Gangia?  
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   They came back, I mean, no charges 
were proffered against them and they came back to work. 
ADV SONI SC:   And at whose intervention did that 
happen? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I think what happened is that the first 
peoples whose suspensions were lifted was myself and Ms 
Ngoye. 
ADV SONI SC:   Ngoye, yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   And then the then Group CEO engaged 
a firm to look at the other suspensions and engaged Milton 
20 
Rose too look at the other suspensions and a report was 
produced which – there were a number of people that were 
just suspended for no reason and all of them came back.   
 
You know, there were some people in the HR 
department, I do not know what they were suspended for 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 206 of 224 
 
an no one seems to be known what happened there and so 
they all came back. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now in the next three subparagraphs, that 
is 14.19, 14.20, and 14.21 you deal with payments.  Can I 
just ask you, you have mentioned those in 14.20 and 14.21 
the meetings that Mr Moodley had with Mr Holele and Mr 
Makoto. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   That is at 14.21 and 14.20 earlier you 
mentioned the approach to Ms Page in December 2017. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Can I ask you to say to the Chairperson 
why what you say at 14.19 is important?  
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, I think in an organisation like 
PRASA you find that because in order to institutionalise an 
irregular contract there are number of players that you 
need for that to succeed.   
 
So you need to kind of create that chain of people 
that will assist you from the on boarding to the payment.   
 
So it is normal where you find that although 
20 
something is so irregular, it still has champions, it still has 
those people who are saying he is paying you this thing, 
please feel sorry for this is innocent service provider and 
so forth.  
 
So there is always that and that is why even the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 207 of 224 
 
people from Prodigy gained entrance and went to Ms 
Page’s office.   
 
I mean, one Prodigy official came to my office, he 
was just there in the corridor and he said he is looking for 
me, he did not know –so I said who are you?  And he told 
me why.   
 
He says I am from Prodigy and he was trying to 
say let us have a meeting and discuss blah, blah, blah, so 
I said to him no, no, no, come, sit, it is just going to take 
five minutes, let me explain to you, I am not going to set 
10 
up another, you know, we can kill it now and he left.   
 
So the –and you ask yourself, how did that person 
gain entrance?  How did that person know where to look for 
me and all those kind of things.   
 
So there is always people who are working for 
PRASA but who are working for service providers. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now in December 2017 in paragraph 
14.22, you point out that there was a news report in 
relation to this Prodigy contract and you annex that report 
as NMD9 which appears at page 189. 
20 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now you do not have to read the whole 
report in but would you confirm whether that is correct, 
that the report dealt with the Prodigy contract and, of 
course, Mr Roy Moodley’s association with Prodigy? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 208 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, I am trying – okay there it is. 
ADV SONI SC:   Page 189. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, it is – the reference to the link 
between Mr Moodley and Prodigy is on page 190 at the top. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It says: 
“We 
can 
today 
reveal 
that 
Prodigy 
Business 
Services, a provider of training and skills services 
made at least…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, have you identified what 
10 
report that is? 
MR DINGISWAYO:    Oh, sorry, yes.  Apologies, Chair, it is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just identify it, ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It is a report by News 24. 
ADV SONI SC:   And who is the author of that report? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Is it Mr Pieter Louis Myburgh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Give the date as well if you have the 
date as well. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   The date is 15 December 2017. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   And what is the essence of that, the 
article? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I interrupted him while he 
was reading the first sentence, if I am not mistaken, or had 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 209 of 224 
 
you finished? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   No, no, no, I had not finished, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It is at the top of page 190. 
 “We 
can 
today 
reveal 
that 
Prodigy 
Business 
Services, a provider of training and skills services 
made at least one payment of more than 4 million to 
one of Moodley’s companies in 2015.  The payment 
was made after Prodigy had earlier secured a 
contract from PRASA that would ultimately earn the 
10 
company 82 million.” 
ADV SONI SC:   And if you look at the first page of that 
article, which is at page 189, you will see a picture there.  
Whose picture is depicted there? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, it is the picture of Mr Moodley 
and Ms Jessie Duarte, I think the Deputy Secretary 
General of the ANC. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now this article quotes Ms Nerishni 
Shunmugan as saying they did not want to go into details 
of the contract, is that right?  If you look at – it is just 
20 
before that picture on page 190. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes.  Yes, it just says that it is 
inaccurate and false. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   But she did not answer detailed 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 210 of 224 
 
queries about Prodigy’s payments to Moodley’s companies. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes and in just under that picture she also 
demands something from News24.  What is it that she 
demands according to the article? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Sources for the story. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now just in regard to the Prodigy contract 
– we can finish this quite quickly.  Let me ask you, the 
newspaper article refers to Mr Moodley’s connection by 
virtue of a R4 million payment made to one of his 
companies, My Prodigy. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Is there any more direct link between 
Prodigy and Mr Moodley or was there a more direct link? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair, the …[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:   I can just ask you to look at NMD1. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   1, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Page 123. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes, I mean, this came from the 
payment application, NMD1 is a printout of company 
information from – I think it is WinDeed.   
20 
 
It sets out the company information of Prodigy 
Business Services and this came – this document came 
with a payment application that was launched by Prodigy 
and it shows that at some point Mr Moodley was a director 
of Prodigy. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 211 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni, the article at page 
190 at the bottom refers to Mr Moodley having paid Mr 
Zuma a salary of R1 million a month. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I seem to remember that at some stage I 
had in mind that that is what I had read but when you led 
evidence with regard to what Roy Moodley’s company paid 
the former President I seem to think that what you – the 
evidence you led seemed to reflect a much lower amount 
than that per months, about 65 000 or something. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   About R65 000 a month and a total of 
about R1,5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Altogether? 
ADV SONI SC:   Altogether. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So do we know whether this was 
just a mistake on the part of the author or could that be 
other payments that have not – were not been – the 
Commission has not been told about? 
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson, may I put this as elegantly 
or as neutrally as possible. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   The figures we have given are perhaps 
more accurate from the information that has been given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay, thank you.  And they 
were from the bank. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 212 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   That is right, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now just coming back to the contract, the 
Prodigy contract.  There are two things I want to raise with 
you.  One is, there was a report on the contract, is that 
correct?  That report was done by Mr Majola.  You referred 
to it at different parts of your affidavit. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   But in paragraph 15 of your affidavit you 
say the report is annexed as NMD2. 
10 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   And you give details about what is 
contained in the report.  Chairperson, with respect, it may 
not be necessary to do that for two reasons.   
 
I could just alert Mr Dingiswayo to particular 
paragraphs of the report and then what the status of the 
Prodigy dispute is at the moment, we circumvent having to 
deal with those matters.  
 
So would it be correct, Mr Dingiswayo, that the 
document at NMD2 at page 128 is the report you are 
20 
talking about, the Majola report? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:   If you look at the conclusion at page 135, 
I just want to start off with – we do not have to go through 
all of them, at 5.1 what does he say? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 213 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It reads, Chair: 
“There is a number of witnesses who are yet to be 
interviewed and submit statements to this matter.  
On statements obtained it is clear that former 
PRASA technical CEO Mr Saki Zamxaka’s statement 
will be critical to this matter.” 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes and then 5.2? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It says: 
“There is host of documents and records still to be 
retrieved from different offices or employees in 
10 
order to complete this investigation as per the 
scope.” 
ADV SONI SC:   And 5.4? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   It says there’s a general feeling from 
some managers that Prodigy training of PRASA employees 
was not worth the money which they have been paid to 
them as it did not benefit the business in any way. 
ADV SONI SC:   And 5.5? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Although the investigation process has 
not been completed it is confirmed through the statements 
20 
obtained that there was no SCM or tender process followed 
to employ the services of Prodigy for this training program. 
ADV SONI SC:   I just want you to stop there for a moment.  
What is contained in 5.5, how does that compare with your 
view about the SCM process? 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 214 of 224 
 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair it agrees with my view that there 
was no SCM process. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then 5.6? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   5.6 says Ms Nerishni Shunmugam has 
been contacted on a number of occasions for a meeting so 
that she could present her side of the matter, and submit a 
presentation to clarify the issues in dispute and she wrote 
in a letter via BVM Attorneys dated 13 September 2017 
stating that she is not willing to give an interview. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then if you could read the first 
10 
sentence of paragraph 5.7. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Ms Shunmugam’s reluctance to be 
interviewed for the purpose of this investigation appears to 
be in contravention of the partnership agreement which she 
signed 
together 
with 
Mr 
Lucky 
Montana 
and 
other 
witnesses dated 11.10.2010 and quotes 6.1 which says: 
“The 
provider 
will provide internal auditors 
of 
PRASA with all necessary support, facilities and 
access to information pertaining to PRASA and 
these 
services 
in 
accordance 
with 
legislative 
20 
requirements, 
appropriate 
assurances 
will 
on 
request be provided to PRASA’s internal auditors 
regarding the controls instituted in respect of the 
provider systems which provides services to or 
interface with PRASA.” 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 215 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, now do you know whether the further 
interviews were conducted and the further documents were 
retrieved as is suggested in 5.1 and 5.2? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   I don’t know Chair, I don’t think they 
were. 
ADV SONI SC:   But can I just ask you finally in respect of 
that, what is the position with regard to the dispute 
between Prodigy and PRASA? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Chair the – they made application, we 
submitted 
an 
answering 
affidavit, 
just 
before 
I 
was 
10 
suspended I was finalising an affidavit for the – an affidavit 
to review the – for the Court to review and set aside the 
contract, based on legality, so I think that there is a lot of 
work in the organisation at the moment and I do not think 
anyone has really gotten to that, but that was the next 
stage, and I think the other thing is that at some point 
Prodigy’s lawyers had withdrawn, so it looked like the 
matter had died and Prodigy was trying other avenues.  I 
think Chair we learnt from the dispute between the COO in 
the Office of the Public Protector and the Public Protector, 
20 
the COO that was dismissed that the Public Protector was 
trying to fast-track the investigation of Prodigy.   
 
They went to National Treasury to say they have not 
been paid and we wrote back to National Treasury and said 
we are disputing the payment and they went also to the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 216 of 224 
 
Department of Transport to try and get paid. 
 
So after the lawyers withdrew it looked like they 
were looking at other avenues to try and get payment. 
ADV SONI SC:   And you say that Prodigy went to the 
Public Protector, you recall you said earlier that the former 
Public Protector, Ms Thuli Madonsela, had filed her report 
“Derailed” which was in 2015, 2014 sorry. 
MR DINGISWAYO:   Yes that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now when Prodigy went to the Office of 
the Public Protector who was the Public Protector? 
10 
MR 
DINGISWAYO: 
 
 
It 
was 
Advocate 
Busisiwe 
Makhwebane. 
ADV SONI SC:   That is the person who succeeded Ms 
Madonsela? 
MR DINGISWAYO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at quarter past five.   
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How much time do we still need? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, Chairperson can I place this on 
record that the other matter that Mr Dingiswayo is to deal 
20 
with is the Siyaya matter concerning Judge Makhubela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now he to a large extent confirms what Ms 
Ngoye said in her evidence and the first two documents 
she dealt with. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 217 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then there is PRASA’s then attorney, 
Mr Makashwa who has filed an affidavit which largely is in 
line with what Mr Dingiswayo has said.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   May I make the suggestion, and I could do 
a small synopsis of what is there and ask at some stage 
that that part of Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit be dealt with 
purely by way of affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Because there is nothing controversial, 
even in terms of what Judge Makhubela says in her 
response to the various affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja I think insofar if Mr Dingiswayo is 
not going to be adding anything in regard to the Siyaya 
matter but will just be largely corroborating what Ms Ngoye 
has said then until what we can do is wait and see whether 
Judge Makhubela disputes any of that, and if therefore 
there is a need for corroboration then he can be called.  So 
you could put in an affidavit that confirms that part. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then if at a later stage the version 
that he was going to corroborate is disputed then if need 
be he can be called back but having I wonder how much 
dispute there will be, but we will see, we do not know. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 218 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, but Chairperson may I make this 
point, we will know next week because we are consulting 
with Judge Makhubela next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   So we will put Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit to 
her so we will know if there is a dispute and that will just 
narrow things down.   In fact, it will save the Commission 
valuable time in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   And we just concentrate on anything that 
10 
is serious merit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so on Siyaya we do not need to 
bother to cover that part insofar as he is concerned? 
ADV SONI SC:   That is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what else would still be outstanding 
that needs to be covered? 
ADV SONI SC:   That is all, that is the rest of his affidavit, 
but before we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I don’t want to – I do not want 
us to do injustice to anything important that might still 
20 
have to be covered, but if we have covered the important 
things then it would be fine.  But you have something to 
raise? 
ADV SONI SC:    I just wanted to say Chairperson when I 
asked Mr Dingiswayo about the status of the Prodigy 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 219 of 224 
 
dispute I wanted to place on record that in PRASA Bundle 
B Exhibit SS3 from page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the same file we have been 
looking at? 
ADV SONI SC:   No, no, no it is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   A different bundle? 
ADV SONI SC:   It is the Bundle B – you need not go there 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I don’t need to go look at it, okay, 
alright. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:    No, it is just to say that this matter is 
before the High Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   And the papers in the High Court are 
before the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  We have included it, just like we did with 
the Siyangena matter. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
no, 
no, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
completeness ja. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, no that is fine.  So the Prodigy 
matter is before the Court, the Siyangena matters are 
before the Court. 
ADV SONI SC:   Siyaya is before ...[intervenes]  
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 220 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Siyaya matters, I do not know if they are 
before the Court because hasn’t Siyaya been liquidated? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, but the liquidators ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The liquidators are still pursuing that? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is before the Court, Swifambo 
there was a High Court judgment and an SCA judgment 
saying that the contract was invalid but the money hasn’t 
been recovered and very little, if anything has happened to 
get the money back. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   That was the issue you raised yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  When you combine all of 
these amounts, the Swifambo amount is what, four comma 
something? 
ADV SONI SC:   The Swifambo is R3,5billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   R3.5billion and ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:   Siyangena is in the region of about five – 
perhaps with – but if I could just put the contracts it is 
R4billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is about R4billion? 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is about seven and a half or 
something billion and the Siyaya? 
ADV SONI SC:   Siyaya is that R50million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About R50million. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 221 of 224 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry R60million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   R60million? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there one that we are leaving out, is it 
all of them there? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes and then of course the Prodigy one 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh the Prodigy how much is that? 
ADV SONI SC:   It is about what PRASA is doing is it 
wants to review and set aside the whole contract with the 
10 
intention 
of 
claiming 
back 
all 
the 
money 
and 
the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and how much was involved in 
Prodigy? 
ADV SONI SC:   Hundred and – sorry R82million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   R82million, so all of these entities the 
amounts involved must be somewhere just above R7billion? 
ADV SONI SC:   It is about – it is closer to R8billion than 
R7billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is close to R8billion, ja.  Yes okay, no 
20 
that is alright, so would that be the end of what we need to 
cover with him? 
ADV SONI SC:   With Mr Dingiswayo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there something that we might be 
missing Mr Dingiswayo that you feel is important that 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 222 of 224 
 
should be covered, that you – in terms of your own 
evidence apart from ...[intervenes]  
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you might have wished to say on 
Siyaya? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Chair on – it is on Siyaya. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is on Siyaya? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Yesterday, I think it was yesterday 
when we were told that there was an inquiry, a liquidation 
inquiry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  And where there was a number of 
concessions that were made by PRASA employees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By employees, ja. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  What you are not told is that the star 
witnesses who made those concessions where Lucky 
Montana, 
Daniel 
Mthimkhulu 
and 
a 
gentleman 
called 
Mayishepo Papi so what to make of those concessions is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   If I could and I know it is comment 
Chairperson, it is like Mr Montana coming and saying these 
Prodigy contracts are good because I signed them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] 
ADV SONI SC:   That is exactly what happened in the 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 223 of 224 
 
inquiry and at the right time Chairperson you will be given, 
when Ms Makhubela comes, you will be given a copy of the 
Commission’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, that is fine, because we have got 
the transcript of the proceedings, we have got the interim 
report as well. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we have got a lot that.  Okay, 
otherwise you are covered? 
MR DINGISWAYO:  I am okay Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No thank you very much Mr 
Dingiswayo 
for 
coming 
through 
to 
give 
evidence, 
if 
necessary you will be called back but I think there probably 
is still a lot that you need to – that the Commission would 
need to – would need you for in terms of other issues that 
have been raised by you and Ms Ngoye and maybe other 
people, but thank you very much for coming to give 
evidence. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess that at some stage, ja if you are 
20 
needed certainly you will be asked to come back.  Okay. 
MR DINGISWAYO:  Thank you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  So tomorrow we 
do not have a sitting. 
ADV SONI SC:   No. 
02 JULY 2020 – DAY 229 
 
Page 224 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We do not? 
ADV SONI SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then I need to just announce for 
purposes of the media, so tomorrow we won’t have a sitting 
but next week we will continue, on Monday we will hear 
evidence from – I will hear evidence from Mr Frolick, a 
member of Parliament, we will deal for most of the week I 
think we will deal, or maybe half of the week we will deal 
with some Bosasa related persons or implicated persons.  
There will be I think other Bosasa related witnesses during 
10 
the week and implicated persons will give evidence for 
most part, for most of next week. 
 
Okay, we adjourn. 
ADV SONI SC:   As it pleases Chairperson. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 6 JULY 2020
