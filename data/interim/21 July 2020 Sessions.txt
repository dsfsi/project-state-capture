PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 21 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good morning Chair. 
UNKNOWN PERSON:   Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the – todays hearings are in 
respect of the evidence of Mr Desmond Nair and Mr Linda 
Mti.  Chair there are – we are having discussions with 
representatives of both witnesses.  Can we ask for time just 
10 
to discuss with them and then approach you in chambers and 
then we can then if we reach an agreement and then perhaps 
put the agreements on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let – let us have Counsel for Mr Nair as 
well as for Mr Mti place themselves on record.  You can just 
do it from where you are you switch on the microphone yes. 
ADV DORFLING SC:  Good morning Chair Danie Dorfling is 
the name.  I represent Mr Nair on instruction of Sias Ulrich 
Roux and Associates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV VAN DER MERWE:   Chair my name is [indistinct] Van 
der Merwe from [not speaking into the microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Okay I will grant 
you an opportunity to have discussions with the – with the 
legal representatives of both Mr Nair and Mr Mti and then I 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 4 of 15 
 
can be approached in chambers as to the way forward.  So 
maybe – we may be looking at about 30 minutes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  30 Minutes I think would be sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 30 minutes.  Okay we will adjourn 
then and then you will let me know once you are ready. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Notshe have you had a chance to 
discuss with your colleagues? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Representing Mr Mti and Mr Nair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair we have discussed and we 
have reached agreements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Insofar as Mr Mti’s matter is concerned 
the – we will provide Mr Mti with all the evidence – all the 
evidence that implicates him and it will be in the form of the 
link to the website of the commission where the evidence is 
housed and also although the notices in terms Regulation 
20 
3.3 have been sent we will again give them the statements 
that we attach to those notices.  This will be done before 
the end of business on Friday the 24 t h.  And then two weeks 
thereafter Mr Mti will then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think you starting the matter – 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 5 of 15 
 
you are not starting where it should start.  As I understand 
Mr Mti is not here today. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Mti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the reason for that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Mr Mti is not here today and Mr 
Van der Merwe is here representing Mr Mti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe – maybe then we should start 
with Mr Van der Merwe just saying something about that and 
then he can also talk about what has been agreed and you 
can confirm.  Mr Van der Merwe you can speak from where 
10 
you are if you just switch it on – the microphone on.  Yes. 
ADV VAN DER MERWE:  Thank you Mr Chair.  I confirm my 
appearance on behalf of Mr Mti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If you are comfortable to move – 
remove your mask just for purposes of speaking feel free to 
do so. 
ADV VAN DER MERWE:  Indebted thank you Mr Chair.  I 
confirm that my office has received a Notice of Set down six 
working days prior to today’s date.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VAN DER MERWE:  I have informed Mr Mti but 
unfortunately the notice was short.  Being an officer of the 
court, I thought it prudent to be present and not simply 
ignore the notice and we have reached certain agreements 
relating to the Provision of Evidential Material and the 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 6 of 15 
 
response thereto in as far as it may be necessary for Mr 
Mti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  So it looks like Mr Mti 
his lawyers received the notice late. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know why – what brought that 
about do you? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No Chair I do not know but Chair what is 
also is important to note is that up to now we had not 
received the – a response to the 10.6 Notice that Mr Mti had 
10 
been given.  That is – he has not provided an affidavit yet.  
But despite that a notice had been – a Notice of Set down 
had been served on him I think it is on the 10 July.  And I do 
not know why it was served late. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well as I understand from the discussion 
in chambers the position is that the notice notifying Mr Mti 
that today he is supposed to appear before the commission 
was received recently and Mr Van der Merwe says about 
10.6 or six working days. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ago that is probably about ten normal 
days.  It should have been sent off much earlier. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is 1. 
2. So Mr Mti is not here so we cannot proceed with regard 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 7 of 15 
 
to his evidence because he is not here.  But as I understand 
the position the legal representatives both the side of the 
commission and Mr Mti have reached an agreement in terms 
of which even if Mr Mti may have received previous 
statements a full set of the statements of witnesses who 
implicate him and the evidence will be identified to his 
lawyers and they can then reach that access that on the 
website of the commission.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they will be notified of the all the 
10 
names of the witnesses who implicate him within a few 
days. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes we have given an undertaking that 
that will happen before Friday the 24 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Mti has through his lawyers 
undertaken to furnish an affidavit in regard to the evidence 
that has been led against him. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even though he may reserve his rights in 
regard to disclosing his defence, in regard to the criminal 
20 
matter.  Is that so? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is so Chair that will happen within 
fourteen days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  After receipt of our notice. 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 8 of 15 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your notification. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Of our notification yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Van der Merwe you confirm that 
that is the arrangement? 
ADV 
VAN 
DER 
MERWE: 
 
Mr 
Chair 
I 
confirm 
the 
arrangement.  I specifically confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DER MERWE:  That Mr Mti’s right to not to 
disclose his defence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VAN DER MERWE:  Will be protected in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VAN DER MERWE:  And in fact, may not deal with the 
facts specifically save to make statement that it may lead to 
unfair criminal trial which is currently being run in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Thank you.  So that will 
be the arrangement in regard to Mr Mti. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then and once he has filed his affidavit 
then a decision will be taken whether it is necessary to fix 
20 
another date for him to appear. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  In regard to Mr Nair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  In regard to Mr Nair Chair the  
1. There is an application by Mr Nair to cross-examine Mr 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 9 of 15 
 
Richard Le Roux and then 
2. There are two outstanding affidavits.  They are 
statements for now they have to be affidavits that have 
to be commissioned and made available to Mr Nair. 
We have a problem with one deponent.  He – apparently, he 
– he has a virus – he has tested positive for the virus but 
we hoping that we think seven days from now he should be 
available to have the statement commissioned.  The 
arrangement we have reached is that we get a – we are 
unable to proceed today because in fairness Mr Nair would 
10 
– should see those statements so that when he testifies, he 
testifies after he has seen the statements.  So the 
arrangement is that by next week the 31 July he – the 
statements will be served on them and then – and then 
decide what – whether they want to respond to those 
statements and if they do, they will do so within fourteen 
days of the statements.  And then they will then consider 
their position and then depending on a ruling regarding the 
issue of cross-examination of Le Roux and they may also 
after they have seen the statements apply to cross-examine 
20 
the other – the other two witnesses – potential witnesses as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Counsel for Mr Nair are you able to 
confirm the arrangement? 
ADV DORFLING:  Thank you Mr Chair yes.  Perhaps I could 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 10 of 15 
 
just at the outset just place certain facts on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. I am sorry.  If you do not mind 
if you move the mask a bit, I think I will hear better but if 
there is a problem you can just raise your voice. 
ADV DORFLING:  I will try and just raise my voice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DORFLING:  Is that suitable?  Could you hear me Mr 
Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV DORFLING:  Thank you.  Chair could I just raise one 
10 
or two matters that concerns us and that we had some 
discomfort on the side of Mr Nair.  We did receive the notice 
for today’s hearing on the 10 July in the same way as Mr 
Mti.  Mr Nair is here, we are ready, we prepared.  Mr Nair is 
happy – was happy to give his evidence.  We were this 
morning informed that two further statements might be 
forthcoming that of Mr Bejoo and that of Mr Van der Merwe.  
We were also subsequently informed that there is a 
potential further and third statement from Mr Le Roux that 
might be forthcoming.  Mr Le Roux deposed to a first 
20 
statement on the 28 January 2019.  He gave evidence on 
the 31 January 2019.  We did not receive a Rule 3.3 Notice 
forewarning Mr Nair of that and alerting him to the rights 
that he have in terms of Rule 3 of the Commission which 
caused some prejudice.  It is water under the bridge.  We 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 11 of 15 
 
need to deal with what we have and we are more than 
willing to cooperate with the commission.  The discomfort 
we have Chair is the fact that we are being confronted as 
we go along with new and further facts that needs to be 
dealt with.  It is not a fair process for an implicated person 
to be confronted with evidence preparing himself to respond 
and then be confronted with further evidence.  We want to 
do and we propose that it be done in one go.  That 
everything gets presented to Mr Nair.  That he deals with it 
sensibly, consider it all and make his election on the way 
10 
forward.  So I would urge Mr Chair to appeal to my learned 
friend Mr Notshe leading the evidence to ensure that we 
have the body of evidence that they want to present as 
agreed by next week Friday that would be Mr Bejoo, Mr Van 
der Merwe and if potentially the evidence of Mr Le Roux a 
further affidavit of him.  We are happy to commit to then 
making our election and responding to that within fourteen 
days.  Next week Friday would be the 31 July we would then 
make our election and respond appropriately by the 14 
August.  There may be an application or further applications 
20 
to cross-examine the further witnesses.  There is pending 
before you Mr Chair an application to cross-examine Mr Le 
Roux which will be entertained after Mr Le Roux’s input has 
been obtained and secured and been placed in your 
possession.  The same would then apply to the other further 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 12 of 15 
 
witnesses if there were such applications to cross-examine 
them.  In the circumstances we are therefore happy to 
agree to the terms and those conditions of moving forward 
and we believe that once all that is done the commission 
would be ready to then look at allocating a specific date to 
deal with all of these issues and ideally we want to appeal 
to the leader of evidence and to the commission for us to 
try and resolve this on a singular day when we can come 
and deal with it and bring the matter to finality.  As it 
pleases. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair can I just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can I just deal with just one issue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is not in response it is – just on 
record.  The – Mr Bejoo has not tested positive for Covid 
but he has self-quarantined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And he has given – I am just – I have 
just been shown a note from him saying that he expects to 
20 
be out of it by end of this week.  So I just – I gave incorrect 
information to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He has tested positive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 13 of 15 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He is self-quarantined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So the – we are not going 
to proceed with the evidence of Mr Nair then today on the 
basis that another date will be arranged once all the 
affidavits that are still to be exchanged between the 
commission’s legal team and Mr Nair’s legal team have 
been exchanged.  And obviously I will get to know once that 
point has been reached and then I will also at that point 
deal with the application for Leave to Cross-examine or 
applications for Leave to Cross-examine if another one will 
10 
be forthcoming.  And then after that a date will then be 
arranged and it – the aim will be to have all of these 
matters – all of the issues dealt with on the same day and 
finalised.  So no thank you very much I think I would just 
say I appreciate that there has been a lot of cooperation 
between the commission’s legal team and both teams one 
representing Mr Mti and one representing Mr Nair this 
morning for the agreement to be reached.  So we will 
adjourn then on that basis. 
 
As for tomorrow Mr Notshe what is the position with 
20 
regard to Mr Gillingham have they indicated what their 
position is? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Still the – the position is that the Notice 
of Set down was sent to Mr Gillingham.  He has no legal 
representative at this stage.  It was sent to him to an email 
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 14 of 15 
 
that had been used to communicate with him.  There is no 
response from the 
email.  He was – they tried to 
communicate with him by cell phone.  There is no response.  
An SMS was sent to the cell phone but both the cell phone 
and the emails are the emails he had been using and the 
cell phone he has been using but there is no response so 
far.  So we are not certain what the position is.  But the 
matter is set down for tomorrow 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  For him and we are not certain whether 
10 
he – what the position is.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But the – his bundles are ready and we 
will also indicate electronically to the email where he can 
access the bundles so that if he comes, he has got the 
bundles available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But we are not certain whether – what 
the position is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But as we stand the date of the hearing 
has no changes for tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  The hearing of the 
evidence of Mr Nair and the evidence of Mr Mti is adjourned 
sine die and another date – other dates will be arranged.  
21 JULY 2020 – DAY 236 
 
Page 15 of 15 
 
We adjourn. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
