PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 30 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning 
everybody.  Are you ready? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Good morning Chair.  Yes I am ready Chair.  
Chair the first issue to address this morning is an application 
for a postponement that has been brought by Colonel 
Mhlongo.  He was asked to testify today.  He is being 
implicated by General Booysen and he was asked to testify 
in respect of those aspects raised by General Booysen.  
Perhaps it is appropriate that my learned colleagues address 
10 
you on the postponement and after that with your leave I will 
make certain submissions to you with regard to that 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But with what we are supposed to do 
today? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Today we have three witnesses who are set 
down.  The first is Colonel Mhlongo.  The second is Terence 
Joubert and the third is Edward Zuma.  If – I can – if you 
would like me to deal with all three at this stage I will or 
would you like to deal with the first deal with this application. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so tell me what is – what is the position 
with them? 
ADV WENTZEL:  With the other witnesses? 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the ones you have mentioned. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes.  With regard to Colonel Mhlongo he 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 4 of 36 
 
has brought an application which we will deal with.  I can 
address you on the background to his evidence just for the 
purposes of public and understanding what his evidence is 
about.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I understand the context. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to – you to address me on what 
is going to happen – what is the plan about those three 
witnesses? 
ADV WENTZEL:  So the plan about the application for a 
10 
postponement is the attitude of the evidence leaders.  It is 
that that application should be granted.  Although I would 
like to address you on the issues that have been raised in 
the affidavit.  Just to place on record what has transpired 
between the commission and Mr Mhlongo’s attorneys.  But 
after discussion with them it is felt that there are aspects 
that merit a postponement and the reasons for that are that 
affidavits have come in late.  The second is that one of the 
main aspects that in respect of which Mr Mhlongo was 
implicated was that a person called Terence Joubert had 
20 
deposed to an affidavit annexed to General Booysens’ 
affidavit in which he had stated that he had been approached 
by Colonel Mhlongo in order to dig up dirt on Advocate 
Nxanana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you - you are now going into the – 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 5 of 36 
 
into aspects of the postponement application. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you wanted to do that later? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes I am just indicating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted you to tell me. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is – what are your plans about the 
three witnesses that is all I wanted to hear. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes.  In respect of the second witness who 
is Mr Joubert what has transpired Chair is that he deposed 
10 
to – which is also related to Colonel Mhlongo’s affidavit.  He 
deposed to an affidavit in support of an affidavit deposed to 
by General Booysen.  In that affidavit he indicated that he 
had been approached by Mr – Colonel Mhlongo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No you are going into the merits.  I 
wanted you to say so and so will testify, so and so will 
testify, so and so will not testify. 
ADV WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can deal with the reasons later. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they have – if anybody is not going to 
testify. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes thank you Chair.  The long and short is 
that Mr Joubert will not testify today but Edward Zuma will 
testify.  
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 6 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Let 
me 
hear 
the 
– 
Mr 
Mhlongo’s 
application.  Yes.  Just place yourself on record again. 
ADV MONALA:  Thank you.  Chairperson I am Monala ME.  I 
am instructed by Maringa Attorneys and we both appear for 
Colonel Mhlongo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  Who is then scheduled to give testimony 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  And we have since then prepared an 
10 
application for the postponement of his testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  And if you permit me then Chair, I will take 
you through the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  Chairperson the starting point is that 
Colonel Mhlongo has given a notice in terms of Rule 3 
informing him that he was implicated by General – yes Major 
General Booysen. 
 
Now 
he 
was 
referred 
specifically 
I 
believe 
to 
20 
paragraph 42 up until paragraph 46 of Booysens’ affidavit 
and there there arose two issues. 
 
The first was that there is a recording which 
evidences wrongdoing on the part of Mhlongo and the other 
part was that there is also an affidavit that evidences his 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 7 of 36 
 
wrongdoing on his part.  So there were two complaints that 
he had then to address. 
 
In dealing with the complaints he asked then to 
receive a copy of this recording which is mentioned as the 
first complaint.  And we have since then been told that even 
if that recording is to be given, we would require specific 
equipment in order for us to be able to listen to that.  But we 
have now been told that arrangements are being put in place 
to enable us to listen to that recording.  So that would then 
address the first complaint that we have in relation to the 
10 
audio that is the audio equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When was the first request made for that 
recording? 
ADV MONALA:  So Chairperson what you would have noted 
is that when the affidavit was presented that is the first 
affidavit an answering affidavit was put up and after the 
answering affidavit was put up a replying affidavit followed. 
 
Now when we received the replying affidavit we then 
responded with a supplementary affidavit and it is in that 
supplementary affidavit that we then mentioned that we 
20 
require to be placed in possession of those recordings.  I am 
trying Chairperson to get 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  The date of the supplementary affidavit but I 
can assure you Chairperson it is sometime in September. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 8 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Last year? 
ADV MONALA:  September last year yes 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  So that was then put in and there was 
correspondence all along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After that? 
ADV MONALA:  After that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  The latest part of that correspondence 
concluded on the 23rd Thursday last week – 23 July 2020. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  And it was then that we were told that even 
if we were to be given that you will not be able to listen to it 
because it requires specific equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is now recently? 
ADV MONALA:  Yes.  We were told then recently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MONALA:  So that is insofar as that complaint is 
concerned.  But related to that complaint Chairperson there 
would have been two other affidavits that then followed.  
20 
That is the affidavits of Padayachi I believe it is – ja it is 
General Padayachi.  Yes so those two affidavits the one 
gives somewhat of an account of what is being said in those 
recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 9 of 36 
 
ADV MONALA:  However, we are of the view that what is 
stated there it is not necessarily a verbatim account of what 
transpired there.  And we want to ascertain ourselves as to 
whether that which is being said is exactly as it appears from 
the recording.  And that affidavit Chair was then availed I 
believe on the 10t h or the 9t h July 2020.  That is the first leg 
of the complaint.  That is the basis for our postponement. 
The second leg pertains to an affidavit of Terence 
Joubert.  What has happened here Chairperson in the first 
affidavit which was given there was an affidavit attached I 
10 
believe it is the affidavit dating 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MONALA:  We responded to that allegation and put up 
an affidavit of 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was last year? 
ADV MONALA:  Yes that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you responded and put up a 2016 
affidavit. 
ADV MONALA:  Yes indeed it was last year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MONALA:  So when we put up that 2016 affidavit we 
then said as far as we are aware there is an affidavit that 
says that first affidavit is wrong and that is a forgery and all 
of those things.   
 
So we then proceeded with the matter on the basis 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 10 of 36 
 
that there is no first affidavit.  In fact, the correct position is 
as set out in the second affidavit.  Now recently Chairperson 
Terence Joubert has changed to – he has deposed to a third 
affidavit and that affidavit we received on Sunday this is the 
26 July.  We received that affidavit on Sunday. 
 
In this third affidavit he now resuscitates the first 
affidavit and he says the second affidavit was wrong and that 
is the affidavit on which we then relied all along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MONALA:  So the sum total Chairperson of all of this is 
10 
that we need to reconsider our position in relation to those 
options that are available in terms of Rule 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MONALA:  And decide whether or not this would be the 
best way or that would be the best way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MONALA:  And for that purpose, Chair we require a 
postponement in order to deal with those aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV MONALA:  Thank you Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes why – why was – why did the 
commission not give the recording much earlier to Mr 
Mhlongo?  Switch on the microphone. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair with respect as was indicated by my 
learned colleague there was a lot of correspondence that 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 11 of 36 
 
followed that first request.  What the commission first 
thought was requested was the recording that was played 
during the evidence of Colonel Booysen.  And there was 
correspondence stating that.   
 
Then the issue of the recording of the transcript – I 
mean the recordings – the 70 recordings those recordings 
were never in the possession of the commission.  The 
commission has never had them.  Summons was issued and 
Colonel 
Padayachi 
provided 
those 
recordings 
to 
the 
commission yesterday. 
10 
 
For 
the 
first 
time 
the 
commission 
saw 
certain 
transcripts relating to Colonel Mhlongo relating to those 
recordings.  It is our understanding that there are very strict 
requirements with regard to the evidence chain of those 
recordings.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That recording that you talking about is the 
one that General Booysen testified about, is it not? 
ADV WENTZEL:  That is the recording that the commission 
initially thought was being requested.  When it then became 
apparent that the recording that was requested is the actual 
20 
Act 70 recordings done by Colonel Padayachi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
ADV WENTZEL:  The commission has never been in 
possession of those recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no let us get clarification. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 12 of 36 
 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
During 
his 
evidence 
Major 
General 
Booysen if I recall correctly testified about a certain 
recording. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am asking whether the recording that Mr 
Mhlongo asked for is the recording that Major General 
Booysen testified about. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair if you are talking about the recording 
on the telephone done by Terence Joubert that recording was 
10 
provided.  It was provided pursuant to a Rule 3.3 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. no. 
ADV WENTZEL:  And it was subsequently provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I am not talking about that one.  
Maybe – it may be that Major General Booysen talked – 
testified about two recordings. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think both are important.   
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is the recording he testified the one 
20 
that I remember well he testified about is the one relating to 
or connected with the – the investigation of Mr Panday. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that was done in terms of some 
statutory provisions. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 13 of 36 
 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Is that the one that Mr Mhlongo asked 
for? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Well it appears that that was requested at 
a later stage and it arose in these circumstances Chair.  
What occurred is that in fact the affidavit of Colonel 
Padayachi annexed to Booysens’ affidavit did not deal at all 
with Colonel Mhlongo’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV WENTZEL:  What occurred is that… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay which recording does Mr – did Mr 
Mhlongo asked for?  That is what I am trying to – I want to 
identify it first. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we know what we talking about. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes it was that recording but Chair you will 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was which recording? 
ADV WENTZEL:  It was the Act 70 recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes now we know what you talk 
20 
about.  That is… 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That one Major General Booysen did 
testify about that I recall. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 14 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Now what then occurred is General 
Booysen testified this is what was told to me by Colonel 
Padayachi who was the person in charge of the Act 70 
interceptions.  He was the person who actually listened to 
the recordings.  So you will remember Chair that the 
response that then came was I do not need to deal with this 
because it is hearsay. do not need to deal with this because 
it is hearsay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What response are you talking about?  
10 
Why would I know that response? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Oh Chair in the application to adduce 
evidence it – and in fact there was not an application 
brought by Colonel Mhlongo to adduce evidence.  It was an 
application in terms of which he deposed to an affidavit in 
which he said, I would like to just place this affidavit before 
the commission and he did not ask that he actually testify 
before the commission.  That was an issue that then arose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WENTZEL:  When this matter was set down. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel.  Ms Wentzel you are all over 
the place. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to make sure we are on the 
same page. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 15 of 36 
 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought we have identified what recording 
you are talking about. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Mr Mhlongo’s application for a 
postponement seems to be based on two things.   
1. That he asked for a recording for the recording quite 
some time back and was only told recently that it is 
available but the certain equipment would be needed 
for him to be able to listen to it. 
10 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am trying to establish which recording 
are we talking about? 
ADV WENTZEL:  We are now talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from what you have said it is the 
recording that Major General Booysens spoke about relating 
to the interception of telephones. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV WENTZEL:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now why – why was it not supplied to 
Mr Mhlongo all along? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair because those recordings have never 
been in the possession of the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes why did the commission not ask for 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 16 of 36 
 
them? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair as I understand it those recordings 
cannot be given to the commission.  They cannot be handed 
over to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But have they not been given now? 
ADV WENTZEL:  No Chair they are given to us in a reserved 
manner and the manner in which they are provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The thing is they could have been given in 
a reserved manner a long time ago. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair that might be.  But it was not 
10 
anticipated what – what had occurred and that is why I just 
would like to give you some background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not want a long background. 
ADV WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are two issues.  Mr Mhlongo seeks a 
postponement 
because 
despite 
having 
asked 
for 
the 
recording many months ago that was not given to him.  So 
that is why I want to know why was that not done?  Because 
we are now faced with a situation where there must be a 
postponement and yet already last year, he had indicated 
20 
from what I understand that he – he needed this.  And now 
his application if this was indicated in September last year 
that means it has been about nine months or ten, I am not 
sure.  It has been about nine months.  So my question is, 
why did the commission not make sure that he got this on 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 17 of 36 
 
time? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair the answer to this is in fact simple 
because even if the commission had summons Colonel 
Padayachi to bring his recording he cannot give that 
recording to the commission.  The commission cannot play 
that recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – what – what did the commission do 
to try and get the recording? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Well to be honest Chair what occurred was 
in preparing for the evidence of Colonel Mhlongo at that 
10 
stage the – the issue that he had raised was, you do not 
need to listen to what Colonel Booysen says Colonel 
Padayachi told him.  Why?  Because it is hearsay.  As a 
result of that steps were then taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if Major General – Major General 
Booysens says I am aware of a certain recording. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that recording contains a conversation 
that is relevant to the work of the commission.  Why should 
the commission not – should the commission not say, let us 
20 
take steps to get that recording. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  I appreciate that point.  What I 
have – can only say to you Chair is I did not lead the 
evidence of Colonel Booysen.  I was not involved in it and it 
was only in the course of preparation of Colonel Mhlongo’s 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 18 of 36 
 
evidence that this issue arose and steps were then taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you have been involved in Law 
Enforcement for quite some time is it not? 
ADV WENTZEL:  I was but Colonel Booysens’ was led before 
I joined the commission.  And to be honest Chair it – I n 
preparing for this the first thing that occurred to me is we 
need to get that recording and steps were then immediately 
taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but… 
ADV WENTZEL:  To get that recording. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it happens late it should have 
happened a long time ago and in which case we would not 
be having to postpone and lose a day.  We do not have much 
time as a commission. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes Chair I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the first people who must make sure 
we use all the time we have are ourselves as the 
commission.  The legal team has got to make sure that these 
things are looked at long in advance before – before the date 
of hearing.  As soon as some affidavit comes in, I mean 
20 
there are work streams in the commission.  There is the Law 
Enforcement Agency.  There are people who are dedicated to 
that including members of the legal team.  And I have always 
said the investigations must be guided and directed by the 
legal team. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 19 of 36 
 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which means I am not going to blame the 
investigators.  The legal team are supposed to look at 
affidavits and say, this is what we need.  This is what we 
need. This witness must be interviewed and so on.  We are 
going to need that.  We are going to need that recording and 
drive the process.  And they are the ones who know what will 
be acceptable legally at the hearing in terms of evidence. 
And then the – the affidavit that – of Mr Joubert because 
they rely on two things.  It is the fact that they were not 
10 
given the recording. 
2. That they only were given the affidavit – the latest 
affidavit of Mr Joubert on Sunday. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why was that affidavit only obtained so 
recently or given to them so recently? 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair at all times Mr Joubert was 
represented by an attorney. There was communication – 
constant communication between the commission and that 
attorney.  It was only as I understand it on Friday or 
20 
Saturday morning that the affidavit was provided to the 
commission.  Once it was provided steps were immediately 
taken to write a letter to Colonel – to Mr Mhlongo’s attorneys 
and enclosed that affidavit.  So with respect Chair that was 
not an issue that was within the realm of the commission.  
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 20 of 36 
 
What then transpired is that having had that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess – I guess that with regard to 
Mr Joubert the commission may have been content that there 
are two affidavits deposed to by him.  One relied upon by Mr 
Nxanana in his evidence another one relied upon by Mr 
Mhlongo in his affidavit. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
the 
commission 
had 
made 
arrangements to – for the person who administered the oath 
to Mr Joubert in regard to the first affidavit to come and give 
10 
evidence to say he knows Mr Joubert and he took his oath 
freely and voluntarily in regard to the first affidavit.  And 
then Mr Joubert was going to have to explain on the witness 
stand why there was a second affidavit. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So from the commission’s side you – there 
might not have been an arrangement for an affidavit.  Mr 
Joubert would have to explain in the witness stand about 
how the second affidavit came about. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes but the fact of the matter is that 
20 
through his attorney the commission did receive the third 
affidavit and in that affidavit, he says, my second affidavit is 
not correct and my first affidavit is correct.  He then after 
that Chair has had communication with the commission 
saying this third affidavit he has now deposed to is an 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 21 of 36 
 
affidavit that was not in accordance with his attorney’s 
instructions.  As I understand it he still says that the first 
affidavit is correct but there are certain aspects in it that he 
does not like.  His attorney has now withdrawn and we are 
now faced with him now having to explain this issue before 
the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well he will have to explain.  I think 
what will be necessary is that a date will have to be 
determined when Mr Joubert must take the witness stand.  
He can explain whatever he wants to explain on the witness 
10 
stand.  Mr Mhlongo’s lawyers will advise Mr Mhlongo about 
whether it is necessary to file any response to that affidavit 
but I think what will be important to fix a date let Mr Joubert 
take the witness stand and – and explain himself. 
ADV WENTZEL:  And explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright that is fine.  I am going to postpone 
the hearing of Mr Mhlongo’s evidence to a date to be 
determined.  And if they – if Mr Mhlongo elects to respond to 
20 
that affidavit we will see when that happens but otherwise 
the 
date 
for 
Mr 
Mhlongo’s 
next 
appearance 
will 
be 
determined.  The application brought by Mr or Colonel 
Mhlongo for the postponement of the hearing of his evidence 
is granted and a date will be determined for him to appear 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 22 of 36 
 
before the commission in due course. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay alright. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair if – the matter by – if the 
proceedings might stand down just for ten minutes so I can 
take some instructions from William Nicholson about the 
witness who is due to appear Mr Edward Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not want to adjourn.  I want you 
to take one minute to talk to him and then let us continue. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Sure.  Perhaps the… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Hulley wants to talk to you as 
well. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Chair perhaps if Mr Nicholson can address 
you because he has been dealing with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well maybe let us talk about I think Mr 
Hulley you want to I think – allow Mr Hulley to address me. 
ADV WENTZEL:  Sure.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  They must just sanitise. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Good morning, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair, as the Leader of the Law 
Enforcement Team, we tender through yourself through the 
team for Mr Mhlongo, and of course, through the South 
African public.  My sincere apologies in relation to some of 
the mix-ups that have occurred. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 23 of 36 
 
 
I 
was 
in 
specifically 
dealing 
with 
that 
particular 
application but I accept full responsibility and I tender my 
sincere apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We will certainly investigate the matter 
further and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think, bring the mic a little bit closer to 
you ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...as your voice is not as audible as it 
10 
should be. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  As I have said, I 
sincerely apologise.  That I will investigate the matter and I 
will place a full report before Mr Chair.  Just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I must say that of course, you joined the 
Commission later.  As some of the things happened you were 
not here but ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I accept the responsibility for that Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair, just one matter that has... and I 
fear that Ms Wentzel may have said something which might 
have given the incorrect impression and I just wanted her, 
perhaps through herself, to have corrected it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 24 of 36 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It must be emphasised that we do not 
have... the Commission does not have the recording in 
respect of that and date of discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We still do not have the recording.  We 
have listened to the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We cannot obtain the recording.  What 
we have managed to get hold of most recently is simply the 
transcript. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And that is what will be made available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What we can make available to the other 
side, is the opportunity to listen to that recording but the 
recording itself, even if we had it and even if we made it 
available to the other side, which as I understand it, we can 
obtain but even if we did that, they would not be able to 
listen to it because it is an encrypted... one requires specific 
machinery ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  ...to be able to listen to the recording.  
So in the first instance, we do not have it.  We still do not 
have it but we have listened to it.  And I think this 
...[intervenes]  
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 25 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you listen to it without having it?  
[laughs]   
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, no.  Because we have got the 
machinery.  We have got the person who has the machinery 
and who has the recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]   
ADV HULLEY SC:  So we have at least managed to do that.  
But without the machinery... I suppose we can dispose of the 
person who has the machinery but we cannot dispose of the 
machinery. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We require the machinery in order to 
listen to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I take it...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is as far as we... that is the only 
point that I wanted to correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  I take it, if somebody within the 
Commission... if you are able to listen to it, arrangements 
could be made for them to listen to it, to whatever you 
listened to it. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is what we have conveyed to our 
learned friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And we will do that way.  But we will also 
do is ...[intervenes]  
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 26 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you will not be able to give them 
anything other than the transcript. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We will not be able to give them anything 
other than the transcript.  In fact, we cannot even allow them 
to make a recording of the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, ja.  Okay as long as they can hear 
what you have heard.  Ja, I am sure that should not be a 
problem. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, that is fine.  Thank you.  And 
10 
then somebody was must talk to me about the witness.   
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Good morning, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning, Mr Nicholson. 
ADV NICHOLSON:  Mr Chair, the... a witness who would 
have also appeared today is Captain Edward Zuma.  Captain 
Edward Zuma is a retired member of the HAWKS.   
 
When we managed to get hold of him about three weeks 
ago, I personally spoke to him and he conveyed to me that 
his wife has contracted COVID or somebody in his household 
contracted COVID.  He is displaying all the symptoms he 
20 
went for all the tests.   
 
Last week when I got hold of him, he still not had his 
tests results and I have been trying to get hold of him this 
entire week and I cannot get hold of him. 
 
The issue is, he is now retired so we can only call him 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 27 of 36 
 
on his cell phone.  He does not even have an email.  With 
regard to... I did convey to him because with the discussion 
we had with the DCJ, we did convey to him that he may be 
able to testify remotely. 
 
He said he was willing to do that but since then when I 
have been trying to phone him to makes those arrangements, 
I just could not get hold of him and I have been phoning him 
every single day from last week. 
 
With regard to the issue what he will testify about.  Mr 
Terence Joubert is present and I confirm with him again this 
10 
morning that he does not de-check from the affidavit that 
was commissioned by Captain Edward Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Well, the thing about Mr Joubert is, 
he seems to have deposed to an affidavit in 2016 which... in 
which he denied the affidavit of 2013.   
 
And from what Ms Wentzel was saying, we have an 
affidavit, the recent affidavit and it appears that he is 
querying some aspects of that affidavit as well. 
 
So it does make it difficult to know what else he will 
deny before the next date he takes the witness stand. 
20 
ADV NICHOLSON:  Indeed, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, as I 
understand, Mr Joubert does not deny the first affidavit and 
he still maintains that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  As of what day? 
ADV NICHOLSON:  I beg your pardon? 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 28 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As of today? 
ADV NICHOLSON:  Not as of today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He does not deny? 
ADV NICHOLSON:  No, not as of today.  Okay if I can just 
give a brief background.  The affidavit was sent to me late 
on Friday.  That is when I distributed it to the secretariat and 
I made it available for it to be also distributed to Mr 
Mhlongo. 
 
Later on Saturday evening, I have received a call from 
Mr Joubert where he explained to me that his explanation for 
10 
why he made a second affidavit was not part of his 
instructions but he stands with the first affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, is Mr Joubert in this room? 
ADV NICHOLSON:  He is present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that, for what it is worth, even if 
for whatever reason he might not be able to give evidence 
that covers everything, it may well be that at least he should 
take the stand and confirm in front of me whether he still 
stands by that affidavit of 2013 because if that is... if he 
does that, we may not need to call Mr Zuma for another date. 
20 
ADV NICHOLSON:  Indeed Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may well be that we might need to do 
that.  But I think counsel for Mr Mhlongo are excused but you 
might wish to reflect that and maybe discuss with Mr Hulley, 
Mr Nicholson as to what may need to be done about Mr 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 29 of 36 
 
Zuma.  But I think I will adjourn to enable all of you to talk 
about what should happen.  We will adjourn for ten minutes.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   What have you decided? 
MR MANALA:   Mr Chair, Mr Joubert is here and he is 
willing to confirm that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us do that.  Administer the oath 
or affirmation.   
10 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR JOUBERT:   Terence John Joubert. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR JOUBERT:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the 
20 
truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say so help 
me God. 
MR JOUBERT:   So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Joubert, for coming to 
give evidence.  As I understand the position, you were 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 30 of 36 
 
going to be able to give full evidence but it appears that 
there are some procedural issues that have not been 
sorted out that the legal team needs to attend to and you 
will be asked to come back on another date but it seems 
important that you give evidence with regard to at least the 
aspect of whether or not you acknowledge the affidavit of 
2013 as being the – an affidavit that you took and that 
there are no issues about it because if that is so it would 
not be necessary for Mr Zuma to be called, who was the 
Commissioner of Oaths.  So I thought let me explain that to 
10 
you.  Mr Nicholson, continue then? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Mr Joubert? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, sir. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   You have a bundle in front of you.  If 
you turn to Y11, you will see the bundle – Mr Chair, it is 
LEA10.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   It is LEA10, I think the bundle is being 
handed to you.  I apologise, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is bundle LEA10. 
20 
ADV NICHOLSON:   That is correct, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not speak too far away from the mic. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   LEA10 has three exhibits in it.  The 
exhibit we are going to look at, as EXHIBIT Y11.  So there 
is EXHIBIT Y10 and there is EXHIBIT Y11. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 31 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at what page is it? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Mr Chair, it is in folder, in a blue 
folder. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but what is the page number? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   It starts afresh from 1 again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   It starts afresh from page 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 1. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   So if you go to the pack you will see 
the file, there is three blue folders.  The first one is Y10, 
10 
the second one is Y11. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you tell me the page number that 
should enable me to go there.  At page 31 appears to be 
the index.  Page 1, page 2 is the filing notice. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   If the Chair would go to 210, page 
210. 
CHAIRPERSON:   210? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   210.  After 210 the Chair would see 
that there is a folder Y11 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why does it look like the pagination is 
20 
not in order here? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Chair, what I think this is, I think that 
is – possibly it would be preferable if each exhibit goes 
into a separate file because then it will run from 1 to the 
end of the file but in this case, we have got three different 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 32 of 36 
 
exhibits.  So it runs to 1 to the end of the exhibit.  In the 
next exhibit it starts at 1 again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I have spoken about that quite a 
few times, that is not the way the pagination should be 
done. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Indeed, Chair, what I will endeavour to 
do, since we are only going to deal with one exhibit here, 
is perhaps to remove the other exhibits out of the file and 
put them into separate files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, I had a conversation with 
10 
members of – I think – I do not know if you were there 
yourself but Mr Hulley and Ms Wentzel were there, we had 
a discussion, was it early in the week, was it on Monday or 
was it last week when I clarified this issue of pagination. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Indeed I was present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so why is this bundle that was 
meant to be used today not paginated in the way that I said 
they should be paginated? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Mr Chair, as I understand, the file is 
not paginated in the way that the Chair requires from what 
20 
I understand from the Chair now but each individual bundle 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am asking why is it not paginated 
the way in which I said bundles should be paginated? 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Chair, this is the way I understood the 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 33 of 36 
 
file ought to be paginated and the paginating team, the 
bundle team, also understood it to be this way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the pagination is not in order. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   Will it help, Chair, if we simply 
removed the bundles.  So in other words, we will take out 
Y10, we will put it in a separate file, we will take out Y11 
and we will put it into a separate file and we do the same 
with Y12. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The pagination that I have explained is 
simple.  You have page 1 at the beginning and it is 
10 
sequential up to the end.  It makes it easy, you do not 
need to tell me many things, you just say – or the next 
document that I am referring you to, you go to page so and 
so, there is one page 20 in the bundle, there is only page 
40, there is only one page 5.  There are not many pages 
filed, you see?  If you arrange it to have different 
pagination for different sections in the file you end up with 
different page numbers appearing in different sections, 
that does not make things easy.  The best way to do this is 
– you see, I have to struggle now to find – so there is an 
20 
affidavit of Mr Joubert that I am coming across somewhere. 
ADV NICHOLSON:   That is the affidavit we are going to 
deal with today, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is three pages that the one that I am 
at... 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 34 of 36 
 
ADV NICHOLSON:   20, 21 and 22.  It is Y11, TJJ020, 21 
and 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Joubert? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know about the three affidavits that 
we are talking about that you have signed, is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the one was signed in 2013, 
another one was signed in 2016 and I understand another 
one was signed recently, is that correct? 
10 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know also that the one that is 
signed was deposed to in 2016 effectively disowns the 
affidavit of 2013, is that correct?  It denies what is in that 
affidavit or denies that you know about that affidavit, is 
that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And in the third affidavit that you 
signed recently you explained how the affidavit of 2016 
came about, is that correct? 
20 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now in the affidavit of 2013 you 
testified about certain matters that you heard about from 
Colonel Mhlongo, is that correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, ja. 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 35 of 36 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you had recorded him, is that 
correct? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is also correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who did you depose to – before whom 
did you depose to, that affidavit? 
MR JOUBERT:   It was commissioned by Captain Zuma at 
the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that affidavit, did you depose to it 
10 
voluntarily and freely? 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct, Your Honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and the signature that appears in 
that affidavit is your signature? 
MR JOUBERT:   Is mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you have no queries about the 
fact that you made that affidavit? 
MR JOUBERT:   None whatsoever, sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you stand by it. 
MR JOUBERT:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  I think for present 
purposes that is what we needed to be dealt with.  And 
then another arrangement will be made for you to come 
30 JULY 2020 – DAY 241 
 
Page 36 of 36 
 
back and then you can give evidence about the content and 
you will also explain how the second affidavit came about 
and if in the third affidavit - there is the recent one, there 
is something that is not true, you will explain that as well. 
MR JOUBERT:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or if you want to put in a supplementary 
affidavit where you explain some things in the recent 
affidavit that you feel are not accurate, that is fine as well. 
MR JOUBERT:   Okay, thank you, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  We – I am going to 
10 
release you and arrangements will be made for you to 
come back. 
MR JOUBERT:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are excused.  But we are going 
to adjourn just now.  On Monday I will be hearing the 
evidence of Judge Makhubele and for the rest of next week 
I will hear evidence relating to certain allegations of 
corruption in the Free State, so that is what will happen 
next week.  For tomorrow I will hear the evidence of Mr 
Sandile July in relation to the rendition matter and his 
20 
investigation.  That is just for the benefit of the media and 
the public.  We are going to adjourn now for the day.  We 
adjourn.
