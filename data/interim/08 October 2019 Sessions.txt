PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 8 OCTOBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning, good morning everybody.  Before we 
start I just want to deal with something else and then we will continue.   
ADV PIET LOUW:  Pleases You. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be seated.  Thank you.  In the business day 
of Friday the 4 t h October 2009 an article appeared on the front page 
which was titled and I quote “Zuma to get preview of nuke-deal 
questions”  In that article the Business Day said that the commission 
had sent former President Mr Jacob Zuma questions that he would be 
asked when he next appears in the commission.   
10 
 
It referred to the fact that prior to his appearance before the 
commission last time former President – the former President had 
asked that he be furnished with the questions that he would be asked 
once he was in the witness desk – on the witness stand and that I as 
Chairperson had made a decision to refuse that he be furnished with 
questions in advance. 
 
The article goes on to say that the commission had sent Mr 
Zuma’s lawyers eleven pages with 80 questions.  When you read the 
whole article it certainly gives the impression that the commission has 
changed its decision on the question of whether Mr Zuma should be 
20 
furnished questions before he – before he appears before the 
commission.   
 
Since then I think another newspaper has published the same 
article.  The fact of the matter is the commission has not sent Mr 
Zuma’s lawyers any questions.  The – there is a document which has 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 3 of 163 
 
eleven pages and I saw that in the article there is a reference to eleven 
pages.  There is a document with eleven pages that was sent by Mr 
Paul Pretorius to counsel for Mr Zuma.  That document contains areas 
of interest in the various affidavits that had previously been given to Mr 
Zuma as the affidavits from which questions would arise.   
 
That document was in accordance with the agreement that was 
reached on the 19 t h July 2019 which was the last day of Mr Zuma’s 
appearance before the commission that week.   
 
The terms of that agreement were announced publicly by 
myself.  Counsel for Mr Zuma and the head of the commission’s legal 
10 
team Mr Pretorius were asked after I had announced the terms to 
confirm whether those were the terms of the agreement. 
 
They stood up here in public and confirmed that those were 
the terms of the agreement.  Anyone who listened to the terms of the 
agreement as I announced them or anyone who wishes to listen to the 
recording of that day will know that there is nothing – there was nothing 
to say Mr Zuma would be sent questions.   
 
That same day after the proceedings had been adjourned some 
of the TV stations began to say in their reporting that the commission 
was now going to send Mr Zuma questions and some of them were 
20 
raising questions as to why he had not been given questions when he 
had asked for them before the hearing. 
 
Either the same day or the following day but I believe the 
same day the commission issued a media statement clarifying this that 
the terms of the agreement did not include that Mr Zuma would be 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 4 of 163 
 
given questions in advance that he would be asked when he takes the 
witness stand. 
 
I am aware that some – one or more of the TV stations did 
correct and said no we got it wrong.  The arrangement is not that he is 
going to be given questions.   
 
One would have thought that with that background it would 
have been clear that the commission still stood on the position that the 
former President would not be given questions in advance that he 
would be asked once he takes the witness stand. 
 
I subsequent to me being aware of this article in the Business 
10 
Day I asked Mr Paul Pretorius to please give me the document once 
again that he had sent to counsel for Mr Zuma.  And before that he told 
me that there were no questions that he had sent.  
 
He gave me the document again and I could not see any 
questions.  All I could see was an indication of areas in various 
affidavits or incidents or events in which the legal team was saying 
they were interested so that he could deal with those issues in the 
affidavits contemplated in the agreement that I announced. 
 
I thought it is important that I set the record straight because I 
do not know why on the basis of the document that we know it is said 
20 
that we have sent questions to Mr Zuma when a mere reading of the 
document will show that really there are no questions. 
 
I will cause that document to be released to the public either 
today or at the latest tomorrow so that the public can see for itself that 
there were no questions that were sent.  That is the eleven page 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 5 of 163 
 
document that I am talking about.   
 
I do not know whether there might be an eleven page 
document elsewhere that has been manufactured by somebody else and 
has presented it to the media as coming from us, the commission but 
the eleven page document that we have does not have – does not give 
Mr Zuma questions.  It indicates the areas on which questions will arise 
but not the actual questions. 
 
We – we appeal to the media to please just check the affects 
and to be fair to everybody including the commission.  I spoke some 
time earlier this year about an article that had been published by the 
10 
Sunday Independent in regard to Mr Nombembe who is Head of the 
Commission’s investigation team where in the article it was alleged that 
– or somebody had alleged that he had done certain things because he 
wanted to be appointed as NDPP and I said then I cannot understand 
how any newspaper would publish that story when the editor must know 
and I would have expected the journalist concerned to have known that 
to be NDPP you need to have at least a legal degree and Mr Nombembe 
does not have a legal degree.  He is an auditor.  But that was 
published. 
 
I think that the media must realise that when they do not check 
20 
their facts properly or when they do some things that are difficult to 
understand to the ordinary reader that might give rise to all kinds of 
suspicions and we do not need any unnecessary suspicions to be 
associated with the media.  The media plays a very important role and 
they need to be respected, their rights need to be respected. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 6 of 163 
 
 
Journalists do generally speaking a very good job.  Society 
relies on them.  We would like to be able to know that they do their job 
with the necessary professionalism.   
 
So we just ask that we be treated fairly as the commission just 
like we say everybody should be treated fairly.  But in order to make 
sure that the side of the story of the commission is known 
arrangements will be made for us – we will make arrangements to 
release the document that was sent to the lawyers for the former 
President the only eleven page document that I know about that will be 
released. 
10 
 
Thank you very much.  We can now proceed. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Thank you Justice.  Mr Zuma may I just remind you; 
you are still under oath? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you are still under oath Mr Zuma.  Good morning. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Zuma perhaps to commence the issues I wish to 
deal with – with exactly what the Deputy Chief Justice has been dealing 
with now namely the press and things have been reported up to now 
20 
concerning you as well.  In the first place – the first point I wish to 
make is this.  You were asked questions yesterday out of any 
discernible sequence not that there is anything wrong with it but you 
did not have the opportunity to actually explain your whole involvement 
in the meeting how it came about and what happened afterwards and 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 7 of 163 
 
what happened during the course of the meeting in one narrative.  You 
were asked questions perhaps important questions but in silos and you 
did not have the opportunity to explain what had actually happened as 
one narrative.  Now those who are privy to the commission documents 
would have read your affidavit, the affidavit that you prepared when you 
applied to cross-examine Mr Jonas.  And there the – the story is told in 
its – in its extremity.  But just perhaps also because this commission is 
conducted in – in public scrutiny it is perhaps important for you I would 
think just at the beginning to give a very quick overview of how it came 
about that this meeting was organised, what the purpose of the meeting 
10 
was, what your role and function was and what happened afterwards? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay thank you.  I will try and be quick Chair.  
As I had said… 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Sorry can I just say. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Your affidavit of course is at page 37 – sorry 735 
which is in Volume LL1. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  B. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes B.  LL1B.  Perhaps you can just keep that open 
next to you as you give a very, very quick overview high level overview 
20 
and I will ask you questions about that – about the – about the 
meetings, how it came about? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes what page is that again Sir? 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I – my note says 735 let me just double check.  I 
think – that is indeed correct.  At page – the second bundle of LL1.   
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 8 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think there may be confusion with the changes that 
were made in the numbering and the labelling.  Maybe Mr Mokoena 
should just check that you have your files are labelled the same way as 
his in terms of the latest labelling. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It is LLB 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  The requirement for the National Director of Public 
Prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  LL1B. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  This is LL1B. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja there is a 1. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I said 1 – 1 [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what page did you say? 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Page 735. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  735 okay.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the red numbers – page numbers. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  At the left of.  Mr Zuma do you have it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have got it Sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Right keep that next to you I do not want you to 
read it out.but if you can just for purposes of commencing your re-
20 
examination this morning give a quick overview in a chronological 
fashion of what happened please. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay.  So I had said there were rumours 
making the rounds on a certain issue which has been termed as 
blackmailing between Uncle Fana and Mr Jonas.  These were rumours 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 9 of 163 
 
that were persisting for a few months and by the time I had spoken to 
Uncle Fana this was at a point where I was like okay we need to – we 
need to – to see what is going on here because on the one hand when I 
had spoken to Uncle Fana he was not too sure about the rumours and 
he just said, look let us leave it.  I popped it up again he said the same 
thing and at the third I have asked him he said okay if you are very 
sure about this and serious about this you resolve it.  So he gave me… 
ADV PIET LOUW:  You resolve it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  Resolving meaning set up a meeting, get 
the three of us to sit down and we will discuss this matter.  
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And can – just for the record Mr Mokoena just 
reminded me.  If you say Uncle Fana you mean Hlongwane? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It is Mr Hlongwane yes sorry about that.  Cool.  
Ja can I just –  
ADV PIET LOUW:  Go ahead. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you.  So if I am not mistaken that would 
have been the period leading up to October 23 r d meeting.  I was given 
the number obviously by Uncle Fana because I did not have Mr Jonas’ 
number.  As I had said I never met him before.  I did not see anything 
untoward.  It is normal course.  If there is any issue, if there is any 
20 
discussion to be had you speak to people.  I did not see – they agreed 
to meet or not.  So I got his number and contact was initiated.  Initially 
it was via sms and then one or two phone calls but there was a busy 
period in between and I think it took quite a few weeks for us to sit 
around the table.  So by the time we decided to meet up it was on the 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 10 of 163 
 
23 r d Mr Jonas was at Nedlac which is in Rosebank. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  23 r d October? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So this is the day in question.  So the Nedlac 
offices are in Rosebank.  I am not too far from Rosebank.  I live in 
Saxonwold as is known and… 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Saxonold is the suburb that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As – yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  That is next to Rosebank. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Next to Rosebank.  It is adjacent to Rosebank.  
So I had received a message from Mr Jonas saying look I will be 
leaving out of town later this afternoon/evening.  There is an 
opportunity to meet because Nedlac seemed like it is finishing off early 
today.  And that is when he had sent the times and if I am not mistaken 
he moved it again a bit earlier.  I actually arrived to the meeting slightly 
late because the time was moved a bit.  As I got to the venue which 
was the Hyatt Regency in Rosebank. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So – just to stop there for a moment.  Whose idea 
was it to go to the Hyatt? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It was Mr Jonas’ idea. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright and then? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  When I got to the Hyatt he was – he was there 
already sitting in the reception – reception area.  The lobby should I 
say.  And greeted him.  Exchanged very short pleasantries and 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 11 of 163 
 
obviously we were waiting for Uncle Fana to arrive.  And in that inter-
leading period that is when the phone call came in and said… 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Which phone call. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The phone call that was a venue change phone 
call. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Just explain that in a bit more detail please? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay.  So the phone call came in on my mobile 
device from Uncle Fana to say look I am not comfortable meeting in a 
public area.  Mr Jonas also looked uncomfortable as was I because it is 
a hotel lobby and people are sitting around there.  Everyone has got 
10 
their own profile or whatever it is.  So the phone call came in.  They 
had the discussion between the two of them and I said look whatever 
you guys decide we will go.  So the venue – the decision for the venue 
was a very difficult one because we could not go to Uncle Fana’s house 
because he stays in another suburb in that area. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  In Hyde Park? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  He was on his way to the meeting.  He 
wanted the meeting changed to somewhere more private and that is 
when I had suggested down the road there is a place that I do work 
from which happens to be the household.  And the reason why I do work 
20 
from there is because there are also some office facilities so I had 
been conducting my meetings outside of the office for a very long time.  
From the Gupta residence as it is called.  
ADV PIET LOUW:  Could I perhaps just interrupt you here.  Why not 
your own home we heard it was about 600 meters away from the Gupta 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 12 of 163 
 
residence? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I do not conduct meetings from my personal 
home. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Do you have facilities at home or did you have at 
that time? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I have got an office but that is purely for own 
private matters. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And if you could just expand a bit on the facilities at 
the Gupta residence.  What – what were they like?  Were there 
facilities and why would that be a good place to go? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja so when I say facilities it is just obviously 
printing capacity staff in between I mean there is – what is it – catering 
sort of. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Catering? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Catering yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Food, water, coffee whatever it is – snacks and 
it just makes it easier as opposed to sitting in a coffee shop.  It is a 
private area so that is what I mean by office facilities. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And could I just ask you this.  Do you any of the – 
20 
did any of the – if I say do I I mean back in October 2015. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sure. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did any of the Gupta brothers work from home?  Did 
they conduct any business from home – from that – that specific part of 
what I think has generally been called the compound? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 13 of 163 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  As I said the person that I worked very 
closely with was a Mr Tony Gupta that is the person that I was in 
business with and we conducted… 
ADV PIET LOUW:  He is now – he is… 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Rajesh. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Say that again please? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Mr Rajesh – Rajesh Gupta. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Rajesh Gupta also knows as Tony. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Also known as Tony. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  As I had said we – we spend a lot of time 
together.  We conducted business on a daily basis wherever it was.  
Whether it was – we went – we would go to the office at times and as I 
said yesterday I limited my movements to the office and we conducted 
a lot of our business from the household.  As for the other two brothers 
they spent a lot of time at the offices and obviously there is varying 
officers in Midrand and in Sandton. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright.  So it was a convenient venue to move the 
discussion to as – and if you can go one then. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  What happened? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So after the phone call after there was mutual 
agreement between the three parties – I am obviously the one that 
came up with the venue that is when we decided to make a move. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did Mr Jonas know where you were going? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 14 of 163 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes that is correct Sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did you mention the name of the owner of the 
property, the family? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I did. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And was he happy with that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  He was – like I said the whole time from when 
I had met him, during the meeting, post the meeting there was no 
apprehension from his side.  There was no hostility.  So the way I took 
it is he was fine to do so.  And if he was not he would have said so I 
am sure. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And then what happened? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  From that point logistically he decided to come 
with me because he said you have your own vehicle.  I said yes, jump 
in with you. I said no. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did he ask you about your vehicle? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did he ask you to – in fact go with you or did you 
offer him to come with you? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I had said I have got my vehicle and if we can 
go it just made logistics easier you do not have to follow.  We do not 
20 
have to follow each other and he said if you do have a vehicle I will 
jump in the car with you. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright and then? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So he had his security/entourage which he had 
to leave behind obviously.  
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 15 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did he give them any instructions? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am not sure what their discussion was but 
they did not come along no. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And then what happened? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And well obviously well the reason he done 
that obviously was because we were going somewhere private 
otherwise he would have followed us with his – with his team.  And I 
appreciated that.  So we jumped into my vehicle and we made our way 
to the residence. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did you stop anywhere? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  We stopped at - there is an Engen Garage 
which is just around the corner from the Hyatt because I was low on - 
on petrol.  So that took a bit of time and from there we continued to - to 
the residence and that is when we had arrived almost simultaneously 
with Uncle Fana.  Walked into the residence, went to the lounge.  We 
sat in the lounge and that is when we started the discussions. 
Obviously pleasantries were exchanged.  These are two 
gentlemen that have known each other for a very long time as they 
have both confirmed.  They shared a few war stories from their MK 
days and that is when I introduced the meeting and the reason we there 
20 
for the meeting. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So your role has been described differently.  
Sometimes as that of a mediator.  Sometimes as that of a spectator.  
Sometimes as that … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Of a policeman. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 16 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  As merely as somebody who got people together … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  True. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And the question was asked and I think legitimately 
so.  Why need you?  Why were you there at all? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Why …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before he answers.  I must just say that he described 
his role in that meeting as almost a spectator or - or mediator. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Mediator. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes.  No, no certainly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Chair I have no quarrel with that but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  The question - the qualitative question that followed 
on that was well why were you needed at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Why not leave just to the two of them to sort it out 
over the phone or by some other meeting? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And - and it is - it is (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  I do not have a problem with that.  It is just that 
it - I gained the impression that - that it was as if it is other people who 
described his role as (intervenes). 
ADV PIET LOUW:  No, no.  I - I thought I made the statement wide 
enough. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 17 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  In fact if one reads his own statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  He uses the term mediator there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So I am asking now the - the witness really just too 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  To clarify your function in that meeting please. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  So my - my function in the meeting was 
10 
besides pulling the two parties together because that is - that is what 
resolving issues is about.  Get the people around the table.  That was 
my one function and the second one as per agreement that meeting 
could never have happened between the two of them without the person 
that is - had introduced this issue of the background rumours and that 
sort of thing. 
So if you are raising that you need to be part of that meeting.  
You need to own that - that rumourmongering idea and you need to 
present it yourself because when I am asked and I am alone in that 
meeting it is - it is a very difficult thing to do because he is - 
20 
Uncle Fana would be asked but who is saying this.  He might mention 
my name.   
He might not mention my name.  So the idea was that I be in 
the meeting.  I own the issue of the meeting and I - I present it and that 
is exactly what happened. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 18 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So you had an active role in so far as that is 
concerned.  If I correctly understand Mr Zuma tell me if I miscategorise 
what your function was.  You were actually there to explain the fact of 
the rumour.  Not the - not the truth of it of course …. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  But the fact of the rumours of blackmail.  You were 
there to present evidence so to speak. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Of the fact that there are rumours like that.  
Otherwise there would simply be a denial? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Correct.  I was - if I may say I was - I was 
acting as a witness as well in that meeting because you know I was 
going to be tested which I was to say okay you are raising this.  Where 
did you hear it?  Why did you hear it?  Who was saying it?  Whatever, 
whatever that the questions would have been at that time and - and why 
are you pulling us together? 
Why did you not just raise it with Uncle Fana?  You raise it 
with me.  All those - all those questions would have obviously been 
canvassed in - in that meeting … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Ja. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And they were and I said look I am over here.  
I cannot just say something.  I have had the discussion with 
Uncle Fana.  I cannot not own this issue and that is exactly why I was 
there to say I am presenting it to you and I - I was at the risk of a 
denial and that is exactly what happened. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 19 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So you denied … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja of course. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Jonas denied? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes he did. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  He denied - he - he denied the fact of blackmail but 
not the fact of the rumour.  Is that correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  He denied the fact of blackmail, yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  But not the fact that there was a rumour? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  No, no.  I am not sure if he was aware of 
it or not.  I do not know but this is what I heard. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright and then what happened? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So the meeting continued.  It took the shape it 
did. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  How long was the meeting? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Say approximately 40/45 minutes.  I mean I 
will need - I will need to - to check the time. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Ja.  Well it is an approximate. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Well let us - let us call it … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Please give us an idea.  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Let us call it, ja.  45 minutes. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And - and then how did it end? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  It ended in a stalemate obviously.  There was 
this allegation that was put to him that he denied.  There was a back 
and forth between the two of them that ended up the way it did but by 
the time the meeting was done.  It was agreed that look this matter will 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 20 of 163 
 
- will pick up on - on another occasion because there was obviously 
time constraints from - from Mr Jonas who was travelling to wherever 
he was travelling. 
Then at that point I had walked Mr Jonas out to - to the 
arrival area - the parking lot and I had asked him where he was going 
to and he said look he is not sure.  He is either going to go to the 
Gautrain in Rosebank or to - to the airport - to the airport and I said 
look here is a driver.  He will take you wherever you need to go and 
that was - that was the end of that of - of that eventful day. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright.  So he then left.  Now during the course of 
10 
the meeting your statement stays - affidavit says that Mr Rajesh Gupta 
made an appearance and there was an interaction with him.  What 
happened? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So it was an interaction to the meeting which 
was purely to get my attention for confirmation for a meeting which was 
going to be over the next day or a few days.  So he peered into the 
room, got my attention and I had walked out of the room whilst the 
conversation continued and then I popped back in and that was for a 
short period.  It was not a long period. 
DV PIET LOUW:  You explained your relationship with the - the - Tony - 
20 
Mr Tony Gupta - Rajesh - yesterday.  Could I ask you at this point to 
give a quick overview of the three brothers whose names have been 
mentioned?  Ajay, Atul and Rajesh.  Just age wise and where were the 
other two brothers that day.  Were they at home or were they 
elsewhere?  What - what is your recollection? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 21 of 163 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay.  Mr Ajay obviously will be the eldest 
brother.  Mr Atul is the middle brother.  Age wise I am not too sure.  Let 
me approximate it as well.  Let us put Mr Ajay at late 50s and Mr Atul in 
his mid-50s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please raise your voice Mr Zuma. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Mr Ajay in his late 50s.  Mr Atul in his mid-50s 
and Mr Tony in his late 40s. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Is it possible to say who the - who the - not - I do 
10 
not think one should call it a patriarch but who is main outside face of 
the family at that time? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  By outside face you … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes.  The - the person who makes representations 
… 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Representations. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And decisions and so forth. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No that is - that is - in my view it would Mr Atul 
which is the middle brother because he was the Chairman of the group. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And … 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  And sorry - and then on - on that day if I - 
because when we have meetings at the house there is generally nobody 
else.  Nobody else meaning the brothers would also go - the other 
brothers - two brothers would be either travelling or at the office 
because they were quite strictly office bound.  So for them not to be 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 22 of 163 
 
there is not an anomaly here. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Now Mr Ajay Gupta do you - do you have any idea 
where he was that day?  Was he around or not? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am not sure where he would have been that 
day.  I read his testimony but from my recollection at that time I did not 
see him in the household at any point. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  He states under oath that he was at the office. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Then it is probably where he was sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And Mr Atul Gupta? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Once again he was not at the house at that 
10 
particular point in time and I have read the - the documents in front of 
me and as the documents state he was in the country at that time.  So 
he was travelling. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Right.  Now Mr Jonas had now left after the meeting 
with a vehicle that you organised - one of the Gupta vehicles that you 
organised a driver for him to take him either to the airport or the 
Gautrain whatever the case might be.  Did you have anything further to 
do with him?  Did you meet him again - see him again? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So before he left the house after the meeting 
we had agreed that we would have a follow up in the following week - 
20 
the Monday or Tuesday or so and that never happened.  There was one 
or two SMS exchanges and then it just quietened down and that is the 
last bit of communication that we had had post the meeting. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Did you see him again? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I - I did see him again.  Like I said I think 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 23 of 163 
 
twice.  Once was at the same Hyatt Hotel.  He was standing outside 
waiting for whoever or whatever on his phone and I had seen him.  Like 
hey Mr Jonas how are you sir and this was post obviously now the - the 
news stories had broken.  He had put out a statement.  He made these 
allegations and I went to greet him to check how he was doing. 
He looked okay.  Gave him a big handshake and a hug and 
kept moving and then the next time I had seen him after that was I may 
be mistaken.  It was either the State of the Nation Address or opening 
of parliament.  One of the two.  I do not know. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  But you saw him in Cape Town? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  In Cape Town.  It was after the event 
when everyone was walking out of the venue and we actually ended up 
bumping into each other.  We were walking down the stairs together 
and that is when I greeted him and he greeted back and we continued 
on our paths sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright.  Now against that background I am going to 
ask you some pointed questions about issues that came during our 
learned colleague’s examination of you yesterday.  In the first place the 
- there are three points I think that have to do with - with the media … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Sorry.  With the? 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  With the media. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  The first - can I ask you now to go to the first file of 
these two.  I think it is File A.  Just call it File A - LL1 … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  A. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 24 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  LL … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  LL1A. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  LL1A at page 23.  You were asked a number of 
questions about - about this.  We - you will recall that this is a - a 
statement that came out by Oakbay and it is dated 13 March 2016.  It is 
looks a media … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  A media statement. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  This is (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well is that one about which he had - we had 
10 
problems yesterday. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  LL1 - LL1A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not the page that - did not have a statement 
from my side. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is the one Chair. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Oh yes.  Oh yes.  I - I do recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but it is … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I do recall. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine.  You can continue. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Chair have you seen the statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  I have seen it, yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have seen it. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 25 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I think the witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has got it. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  You gave him it yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Excellent.  So now everybody has one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  The - just to get the record straight again on 
13 March 2016 Oakbay - oh it would appear - it is Oakbay Investments 
if you look at the foot of the page.  Statement issued by Oakbay - 
Oakbay Investments on 13 March 2016.  You were asked whether at 
10 
that time you were a director of Oakbay.  Can you recall? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I will have to check.  I cannot recall but … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Were you …? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chances are I was sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Were you asked about this statement? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Asked by who sir? 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Anybody in the Gupta family? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No, no. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  The person who made the statement? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  I was not asked. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Now it would appear that this statement was in 
response to an article on the same day that was published in the 
Sunday Times.  Just too perhaps give you a broad overview and ask 
you whether you have any knowledge of these dates.  These dates 
come from the statement of Mr Jonas and they would seem to be quite 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 26 of 163 
 
correct. 
Namely that there was a Financial Times London report on 
8 March 2016.  Did you see that report?  Do you know anything about 
it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I - I know about it.  I did not - I did not follow 
up on it at that time, no. 
ADV PIET LOUW: 
 And 
then 
there 
was 
a 
News24 report 
on 
10 March 2016.  Did you see that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Can you recall it? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I think I did - I did - I did see that one. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  We are going to go to that in a moment and then 
there as the Sunday Times report of 13 March 2016 and then came the 
Oakbay statement. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I - I did see that one. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Now we have been able to find a - the - the 
statement that was public - the may - not statement.  I apologise.  The 
report that was made in the Sunday Times.  An article that was written 
about this on 13 March 2016.  Mr Chairman I wonder could I perhaps 
ask to hand this to you.  It - it provides a lot of context and … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think that is fine.  Let us - let us probably it 
should not be a problem. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And there is one for the witness as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will have to … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I thought … 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 27 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will have to make it - put in as a … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I put at the right top in pencil LL123A because it sits 
snuggling … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well maybe … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Behind the (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us just make is a separate exhibit on its 
own - as his exhibit. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So this was LL.  Mr Mokoena will be hearing me.  
He might be able to suggest.  It should be LL … 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Exhibit Two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  LL2. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Ja, but … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  LL … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  We have got an LL2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh we have got LL2. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  If I am not mistaken.  We have got LL1 which 
consist of two bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  A and B. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And then LL2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Which is the small bundle the C Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So it should be LL3. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 28 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So this will be LL3. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  LL8. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Eight? 
UNKNOWN PERSON:  We have up to LL7. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Oh.  I see.  So the numbers have gone on.  So it 
must be LL8.  LL8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  LL8.  This is one article? 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It is one article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is one article.  Okay.  The - and it is the article 
from the Sunday Times?  Where is it from? 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  You can see at the foot on the first page Times Live 
Sunday Times.  The date is given 13 March 2016 and the article is 
headed “How Guptas Shopped for New Minister”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So this will be - this article - Sunday Times 
article of 13 March 2016 will be marked EXHIBIT LL8. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Chair with - with your leave not 18 March but 
13 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Is it 13 March? 
ADV PIET LOUW:  1-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  No I thought I said the 13 t h but let me 
20 
(intervenes). 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I thought I heard 18.  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 13 t h ja.  No.  I said - I think I said the 13 t h, ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Oh, good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 29 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Zuma … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Do you see that?  I - I just want to take you to a few 
points in this document.  Now before I do so could I just remind you 
questions that were put to you yesterday about the Oakbay statement 
of 13 March and the - the main issue was in the middle of the page it 
was pointed out to you that there was a statement to the following - in 
the following words: 
“To be clear:  there was no meeting at all.” 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I see. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  You - you recall that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I recall that sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And the question quite fairly was put to you.  Well 
what about your meeting?  There was a meeting.  Was there not? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Now the question of course is one of context.  The 
meeting that was dealt with in - in this statement that was issued by 
Oakbay obviously dealt with the meeting that was reported about in the 
Sunday Times article.  That I am going to take you to now in a moment 
20 
which on your version is a fiction.  It never happened. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  With the inclusion of the brothers? 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja.  That did not happen. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright.  So if I can quickly take you to the report or 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 30 of 163 
 
the article that was published in the Sunday Times.  It starts off with 
the news that: 
“President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane was present 
when members of the Gupta family offered Deputy 
Minister 
Mr Jonas 
then 
Finance 
Minister 
Nhlanhla Nene’s job the Sunday Times can reveal.  
Jonas is said to have been offered the Finance 
Ministry twice.  First by the Guptas at a Sandton 
Hotel on November, the 27 t h last year.” 
Now that would have been 2014.  Is that correct?  Sorry I 
10 
apologise.  The article was written in 2016. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  2015. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So that was 2015. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Of course.  Apologise. 
“The - the London based Financial Times reported 
this week that the Guptas close friends - friends of 
Zuma met Jonas just before Nene was fired to tell 
him they wanted him to be the next political head of 
the National Treasury.  The Guptas said through an 
20 
attorney 
yesterday 
there 
have 
been 
an 
extraordinary number of allegations around the 
Gupta family in recent weeks.  Several of which 
have involved the finance - Finance Ministry.  As we 
have said countless times our primary focus is on 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 31 of 163 
 
business not politics.  To be absolutely clear there 
was no meeting at all.  Let alone any inferences or 
cash offers …” 
You see that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I see that. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It then goes on. 
“…but the Sunday Times has established that the 
meeting took place at about 03:00 pm at a Sandton 
Hotel the last Friday of November.” 
Right and it goes on across the page. 
10 
“Accordingly - sorry.  According to highly placed 
sources at the Treasury the meeting was arranged 
by a fixer described as a controversial business 
person and political figure in Gauteng.  This was 
two weeks before Zuma axed Nene.  Jonas turned 
the Guptas down.” 
Right.  It goes on and it says: 
“Numerous attempts to get comment from Jonas 
were unsuccessful yesterday.” 
Then 
it 
deals 
with 
what 
a 
Presidency 
spokesperson 
20 
Bongani Majola said.  It is reported that he said: 
“Only the President has the authority to appoint 
Ministers and Deputy Ministers.” 
And then there is a quotation. 
“It is therefore totally unacceptable that anyone 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 32 of 163 
 
would seek to abrogate that responsibility to 
themselves.  Such alleged actions have - know that 
the 
knowledge 
sanction 
will 
support 
of 
the 
President.” 
It goes on. 
“Treasury 
spokeswoman, 
Phumza Macanda, 
declined to comment.” 
It goes on then further and this is where it becomes 
important. 
“Severally - several highly placed sources in the 
10 
Treasury and the ANC Alliance confirmed to the 
Sunday Times that Jonas met with Ajay and 
Atul Gupta and the President’s son Duduzane is a 
business …” 
There is a verb missing I think. 
“…is a business partner of the Gupta brothers in a 
number of registered companies.  This - ” 
“He” must be a reference to you. 
“He responded to a written question - sorry.  He 
responded to written questions in an email.  There 
20 
was no such meeting at all.  As such your questions 
are irrelevant.” 
Now assuming for the moment that reference of “he” is to 
you.  Do you have any recollection of having sent an email at that point 
or not? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 33 of 163 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Well most definitely not. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So that “he” cannot be a reference to you.  It must 
be somebody else? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is somebody else, yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And then it goes on. 
“Of course they do this to prove those things - sorry 
- those they call that “whether you like it or not we 
are in charge””. 
And there is a - it seems to me a - something missing in the 
text but it goes on. 
10 
“In the meeting Jonas was told that the job was his 
if he wanted it but could come with conditions - but 
would come with conditions.  He would have to push 
for 
the 
approval 
of 
the nuclear 
procurement 
program and clear certain men from the top 
echelons of the Treasury.” 
And it goes on. 
“He was given a list of people to get rid of including 
Director-Generals, 
General Lungisa, 
Ismail Momoniat, 
Andrew Donaldson 
and 
20 
Kenneth Brown.  The four who have been with the 
Treasury for more than 22 years are among the 
fiercest critics of the nuclear procurement program 
which they believe would bankrupt South Africa.” 
And then it goes on in a similar vein.  Across the page. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 34 of 163 
 
“It cannot be that we have a state that is run by a 
family or a grouping of people apart from its 
selected representatives.” 
I think that is actually a quotation mark that is written out. 
“…and then firing them sources said would have 
allowed the family to capture the Treasury as full 
vacancies would have been filled by bureaucrats 
approved by the Guptas.” 
Then it goes on about the nuclear program Shiva Uranium 
and so forth and at the foot of that: 
10 
“Jonas 
is 
believed 
to 
have 
called 
ANC 
General Gwede Mantashe 
and 
many report 
the 
Gupta meeting.  After the meeting Jonas according 
to the source also called Duduzane to tell him to 
stop what he is doing.” 
Was there ever such a phone call … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No.  There was not. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Or any other communication of any sort? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Nope.  There was not. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It goes across the page. 
20 
“It is quite clear that the Guptas influence cannot 
be understated.  That is what we need to stop.  
Mantashe denied receiving a call from Jonas and 
referred the Sunday Times to the Deputy Minister 
and then in an enigmatic - in an enigmatic way he 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 35 of 163 
 
said phone Mcebisi and ask him because he is 
alive.  He is not an ancestor.  He is capable of 
speaking for himself.” 
And then importantly the next paragraph reads as follows.  
Please listen carefully. 
“Nene told …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - I am - I am sorry.  What would have come 
across as Mcebisi was Msebenzi. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mcebisi.  I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mcebisi is Mr Jonas’ name. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  No, no.  Certainly, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Msebenzi might be somebody else. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I am - I am going to receive lessons afterwards 
about clicks.  Then the next paragraphs is of importance Mr Zuma. 
“Nene told the Sunday Times that he knew nothing 
about 
the 
meeting 
and 
did 
not 
recall 
any 
conversation with Jonas about the meeting with the 
Gupta family.” 
See that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  I see that. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  That of course from other sources appears to be 
contradicted at this point. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It then goes on. 
“After Jonas turned down the offers to replace Nene 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 36 of 163 
 
David Van Rooyen was appointed Finance Minister.  
The markets reacted with shock.” 
And it then goes into the whole Nenegate thing and the 
replacement with Mr Gordhan and it really then goes on about other 
political fallout issues from - from this report.  Now was this - I take it - 
this was the report to which the Oakbay statement responded? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I am not - I am not sure but it - it seems like 
that. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  The times … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  (Intervenes). 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Workout in that sequence. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Alright.  Then importantly still on this topic of - of 
statements and so forth.  If I could ask you just about something that 
you testified about the Public Protector yesterday and you expressed 
some concern with the way that the Public Protector dealt with the 
investigation and your role and function in that whole investigation. 
Perhaps you can just explain to the Chair what had happened 
and what was it that made you concern - raised your concerns 
concerning the - the Public Protector’s investigation. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Okay.  I think the reason we all sitting here 
today at the State Capture Commission is based on the findings of the 
Public Protector Report.  The various role players that have had to 
come and testify.  I mean that is not what I am getting into but some of 
us have been integral to those investigations.  We have sat here 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 37 of 163 
 
alleged of all sorts of wrongdoing, corruption, bribery. 
You know it has been going on almost on a daily basis from 
about three years ago.  So what I would have expected was a - a fair 
opportunity to represent or reflect on my side of the story like I am 
doing here yesterday and today.  I did not get that opportunity.  Was 
communication sent to me?  Yes.  It was. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Sorry.  Can I just ask you?  Perhaps just point at 
questions.  Were you invited to the Public Protector? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  This was towards the tail end.  From a time 
frame perspective towards the tail end.  Time wise I - I - but before the 
10 
tail end meaning before the report was finalised.  I was travelling at the 
time.  I had received a phone call.  I forget the - the lady’s name that 
called and she said she is from the Public Protector’s Office and she 
was checking if I had received communication and I said I will check my 
- my emails and she telephonically said no check it. 
We are inviting you just to come and sit and have a 
discussion and interview and just to get to your side of the story and 
the - and the version of events and I said cool.  I will check that.  
Checked the email and indeed there was an email.  Following up and 
this was a very short period after the phone call and the email.  I 
20 
received a summons or … 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Subpoena. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  A subpoena of some sort to appear urgently 
and the discussion that I had had with the - the representative from the 
Public Protector’s Offices - I am not in the country currently.  I am 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 38 of 163 
 
conducting business.  I am not living in South Africa any longer at that 
time.  So I will need time and when I get back I will look you up and I 
will come and - and present myself. 
So that was the - the version - the sequence of events and 
before I could even make those decisions there was a - a finalised 
report that had come out.  Now the reason I had raised it yesterday is 
obviously I am sitting here today.  I have been mentioned in all sorts of 
lights.  I - I did not have an opportunity to - to give my - my version of 
events and the basis of that report is what this whole State Capture 
Commission is about. 
10 
I am sitting here having to answer all sorts of allegations that 
could have been answered that that point. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Did you – the Public Protector make available, to 
you the versions of other persons such as Mr Jonas perhaps? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No I...[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   For you to respond to it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I did not receive any notices, I didn’t receive 
any transcripts that was – everything I’ve seen has been post the 
finalising of the report. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Good now if I could perhaps then ask you one or two 
20 
rather small questions about questions that were put to you yesterday 
to conclude?  The first one concerns an invitation by the Chair to you to 
speculate about what the reasons would have been why Mr Jonas 
raised the human cry after the meeting with Messrs. Nene and 
Gordhan.  I’m not going to ask you about the contents of those 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 39 of 163 
 
discussions that’s before the Commission and we’ll deal with that in 
due course but I’m going to ask you is this, not to speculate.  What 
actually happened to you as a consequence of Mr Jonas’ statements, 
taking into account the fact that he did not lay a charge against you for 
reasons that he gave to the Commission earlier, what happened to you, 
what were the consequences of his statements? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   There have been quite a few consequences I’ll 
get into them but before I get to that and answer your question, I’d just 
like to make a point if I may? 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Of course. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I mean I’m not sure if I’ll have an opportunity 
to speak ever again so once I leave this chair I just want to satisfy that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you can make your point. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you, I think there are three levels to 
this whole scenario that need to be satisfied, the first one being it’s the 
deal in being political, legal and perception.  Now on the perception 
front that is purely on the Court of public opinion which is driven by a 
narrative that stems from media reports and allegations from wherever 
they come from.  Now I’m look at as a criminal, I’m looked at as this 
face of corruption, this guy that’s plundered trillions out of this country 
20 
which is not the case by the way.  So I would just like to say to the 
public out there, I’m not corrupt, I’m not taking any money from 
anybody, I never have and I never will.  How they take it, that’s for me 
to decide.  So I just want to make that clear so if you see me walking 
around you know, just know that it’s not me.  Secondly there’s the legal 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 40 of 163 
 
perspective which is obviously one of the reasons I’m sitting here 
today.  There have been a lot of legal repercussions stemming out of all 
sorts of investigations or lack of investigations.  I’ve had to walk in and 
out of court rooms, I’ve had to face charges that…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Can I just ask you there, just be a bit more specific, 
you were arrested, is that correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And what were you arrested for? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   This was at the Specialised Commercial 
Crimes Court and that was a charge of corruption. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And what did that stem from, what was the 
complaint? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No the complaint is the specific matter we’re 
dealing with right now. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   The Jonas matter? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   The Jonas matter yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   The Jonas meeting? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And I think, if I may just perhaps assist you, the 
charges would have been framed under the prevention and combating 
20 
of corrupt activities of 2004? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that’s correct. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Also known as PRECA? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that is correct. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   As well as perhaps POCA, the Prevention of 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 41 of 163 
 
Organised Crime Act of 1998.  Now how did the arrest take place, 
where were you arrested and what happened? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Obviously there was a lot of speculation in the 
media and by the time I’d – you know I was labelled the fugitive so I 
was living out of the country I was in self – so-called self exile which I 
was not the reasons why I was not living here which I’ll get into.  When 
I landed at OR Tambo I was escorted to…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   So you were just coming back to South Africa for 
some other purpose? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Ja I was coming for my little brother’s funeral 
10 
last year, that’s the reason I was coming back.  So on my arrival there 
was obviously some sort of notice that I had to face the consequences 
of my actions and that when I asked the gentleman at the immigration 
he told me it was a notice that was originating from the Rosebank 
Police Station.  So that complaint was put forward by the Democratic 
Alliance, that was at the airport, fortunately my legal team managed to 
arrive on time and resolve that issue and we dealt with the matter on 
the Monday because I arrived, I think, on the Thursday evening. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Was there any press present when you were 
arrested? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No not at the airport no. On the Monday, 
that’s when we went through the whole rigmarole of going to the police 
station and then the court room and, you know, that’s public knowledge.  
So that is the way that the arrest happened and at all material times I 
had my legal representative with me and we just wanted to see the 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 42 of 163 
 
documentation which was not forthcoming by the Law Enforcement 
Officers, we wanted to see the charge sheets, we wanted to see the 
warrants, if there were any and we were not furnished with those.  So it 
was a very peculiar situation but you know, it turned out the way it 
turned out. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   But it was based on Mr Jonas’ reports about what 
happened at the meeting? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that’s eventually what that…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Only on that? 
MR 
DUDUZANE 
ZUMA: 
 
 
Eventually 
that’s 
what 
we 
found 
10 
out…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And Mr Jonas refused to make a statement? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that’s also what we found out via his 
testimony here. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And then what happened with these charges? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   They persisted for – so when we appeared in 
the…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Sorry I think you were arrested in July last year?    
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes it was around that time, so after we 
appeared at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court they postponed 
20 
it for, I think it was a period of six months or so for further 
investigations and by the time we’d gone back to appear that’s when 
the charges were provisionally withdrawn and that was on the basis 
that they are waiting for the outcome of the Commission. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Do you feel aggrieved by the arrest? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 43 of 163 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Ja of course I do. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Are you going to take any legal steps about it? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Most definitely, most definitely. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Have you – do you know – I suppose you do know 
that your lawyers have addressed a letter of demand to the police? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes that’s exactly…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   For wrongful arrest. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Correct Sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   If I may make a point the reason for that is as 
10 
you found out on the charge sheet there has not been a complainant so 
you know, my limited knowledge of how things work is, if there is no 
complainant, there’s no charges.  So you know, someone has to explain 
exactly what’s going on…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Look I think there were complainants but they were 
not Mr Jonas? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   No. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And Mr Jonas would not provide a statement? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   That’s the point I’m trying to make. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Alright then…[intervenes]. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Sorry if I may continue, I wasn’t 
done…[intervenes]. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Ja you were still at the third point or second point 
you’re going to the third point. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes the second point was a legal which we’ve 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 44 of 163 
 
covered a bit of and I’ll leave that so I won’t belabour that point and 
then the first is obviously the political and I think we’d all be fooling 
ourselves to think that there hasn’t been a political play in the 
background, you know, speculation is one thing but I think if you look 
back in hindsight the history speaks for itself.  If you look at how a lot 
of issues have come to the fore the people that have brought the issues 
to the fore, what has happened to people on either side of the political 
wranglings, I think that is an obvious case, and I’ve said it before and 
I’m saying it again, I believe I’m unfortunately caught in a political 
storm. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Alright the second last point I wish to deal with is, a 
point that our learned colleague made yesterday, over and over again 
which was that there is a discrepancy between the version that you told 
the Chair about the meeting, namely that Mr Rajesh Gupta came in and 
what Mr Hlongwane said in his interview with the Public Protector 
saying that it was not one of the three Gupta brothers it might have 
been another one, he doesn’t know but it perhaps not Mr Rajesh, do 
you recall that? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes I recall that. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And it was put to you on the basis, I would think 
20 
that this discrepancy is destructive of your version. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And the truth of your version. Now could I ask you 
not to speculate about what Mr Hlongwane might have thought on this 
point but perhaps just to turn to page – in the second bundle of LL1A – 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 45 of 163 
 
sorry this is now at B – LL1B, page 742. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please just repeat the page number? 
ADV PIET LOUW:   742. 
CHAIRPERSON:  742. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That would be Mr Rajesh’s statement?  
ADV PIET LOUW:   Yes you perhaps have seen this before but he 
makes the point that he was there at the property that indeed he did 
peek in to the meeting, take you out and had a quick discussion with 
you about administrative things and then left. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:   And this in on oath, is that correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Yes sir. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Good Mr Zuma I think in conclusion, may I ask you 
whether there’s anything that you would want to add to your evidence, 
you have refreshed your memory about the statement that you made 
that you made to the Chair, you made the point yesterday that your 
statement is perhaps not as comprehensive as otherwise it could have 
been, it didn’t deal with all of the phone calls and SMS’s and 
WhatsApp’s perhaps leading up to the meeting with Mr Jonas and 
perhaps afterwards.  You’ve seen what Mr Jonas said about that, you 
20 
agree that there were communications between you, is there anything 
else perhaps, detail that you would want to focus on in conclusion, you 
will not have the chance again? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I think a lot of the points we’ve covered and 
as Mr Mokoena said and there’s a lot of common cause issues that are 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 46 of 163 
 
[indistinct] because we agree on the versions.  At this point I think I’ve 
said – I’ve said what I can say, my statement obviously is not as 
comprehensive as it should be but I think that’s the points that I wanted 
to cover.  A lot of what has been said I don’t know the detail of I have 
not checked people’s cell phone records, SMS’s, phone calls and 
whatever else may have been left out of my affidavit.  
ADV PIET LOUW:   Mr Zuma if there are any further queries by the 
Commission would you assist? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   I’m here to comply, I’ve complied the whole 
way through, even though it’s been made to look like I’ve been evasive 
10 
and running away I’ve been here three times before, this is my fourth 
time so I have no issues with complying with the Commission. I hope I 
don’t have to see Mr Zondo ever again but if I have to, I’ve complied 
and I will comply. 
ADV PIET LOUW:   Chair those are the questions, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No thank you very much.  I suspect that Mr Mokoena 
wishes to say something but I think we must take the tea adjournment 
now.  I will also have maybe a few questions to put to you Mr Zuma.  I 
can mention that I did share with your counsel, the legal team that 
there are other statements in which you have been mentioned in regard 
20 
to meetings other than the ones that you have been asked about and – 
but the arrangement is that – my impression, or my understanding is 
that those would have been sent to you before but your legal team was 
not sure whether they were sent or whether they received them.  So the 
arrangement is that the Commission’s legal team will look at whether 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 47 of 163 
 
they were sent and be in touch with your legal team and if there is a 
need for you to deal with them in one way or another there will be 
discussions around that, that may or may not entail a request that you 
come back but both legal teams will look at all issues and you will hear 
from your legal team about those.  So I thought I would just mention 
that for now. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but I realise that you don’t want to see me again.  
We are going to take the tea adjournment it’s twenty-six minutes past 
eleven, we’ll resume at twenty to twelve, we adjourn. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair you would recall that yesterday 
I stayed away posing any questions relating to the Public Protector 
because I thought that that proceedings had their own life and sway 
and they were dealt with decisively.  But I see that they also emerged 
in re-examination and I thought that maybe there must be two or three 
clarity questions from our side to Mr Zuma simply you know to place the 
matter in its proper context.  And if I am permitted I will limit myself to 
20 
only those three or four questions of the PP because I think it is quite 
important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright.  And I think you must maybe 
use this opportunity to tell me what happened to the discussions that 
you were supposed to have with Mr Zuma’s legal team about the issue 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 48 of 163 
 
that he raised yesterday.  I think he was saying there was some 
omission. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I said the legal teams will talk and then I would 
be updated – I would be – I would get a report back this morning about 
whether it is something that I need to know or what the position is. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It would appear that it was never 
persisted with because Mr Louw did not persist with it today Chair and I 
take it that it was since resolved either between Mr Zuma and his legal 
team because no one have raised it for today.  So it might be that it is 
10 
no – it is no longer an issue. 
REGISTRAR:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But ought you know to receive your 
attention 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if there is no – no issue and whatever he might 
have been – had in mind is sorted then that would be fine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think Mr Louw will or wishes to say something.  
20 
Maybe let us clear that and that before you continue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Thank you Mr Chair the – there are two points that 
our learned colleague made.  He wants to ask a few questions about 
the Public Protector we have no quarrel with that of course.  The 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 49 of 163 
 
reason why we dealt with the Public Protector is because of reports 
that have apparently been published overnight in some of the press 
about what Mr Zuma said yesterday in these – in these proceedings.  
So it was really to give him an opportunity to deal with that and just to 
perhaps clarify issues from his perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It was not – it was not to deal with a new front and 
opening a new front. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  The second point is the issue of it was dealt – it was 
10 
termed I think yesterday an omission or an oversight or a gap or 
something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Chair with – with respect after some reflection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  We decided not to ask questions about it.  It really 
concerns Ms Mentoor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And what she testified about… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And what had happened but we can deal with all of 
those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 50 of 163 
 
ADV PIET LOUW:  At the end of the day should you invite us to present 
argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Which we take – take it that you will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Taking into account Mr Chair that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Insofar as this part of item 1.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Of the schedule to the proclamation is concerned. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  You have to make a factual finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And we would like of course in due course to 
present an argument to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  On that factual finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Submissions yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So – so we have no quarrel with questions about the 
Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I told you why we went there this morning and then 
insofar as the other aspect is concerned once again. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 51 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It is not really a matter for Mr Zuma to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It is more a matter of argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. Thank you. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Zuma I am sure that the Public 
Protector’s you know reports which are not here well speak for 
10 
themselves.  We did not bring them along and I am simply asking these 
questions in order to clarify certain aspects you know arising from your 
re-examination.  Do I understand you correctly that you did as a matter 
of fact receive an invitation from the Public Protector? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  At some… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To participate in the proceedings. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  At some point yes I did. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And you then went overseas, am I 
correct? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes I was out of the country. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You received then a subpoena? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  After… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Which  - yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  After a phone call yes I received the subpoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And you were not able to honour 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 52 of 163 
 
the subpoena because you were overseas? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes and I communicated it quite clearly that I 
am travelling when I get back I will come and present myself. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  So you were not ignored.  At least 
there was the invitation and there was subpoena? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.   Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you.  Mr Zuma I have just a few 
questions to clarify certain things. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  Before you ask Chair can I just clarify 
10 
one thing? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Just from the line of questioning about 
[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I just want to make it clear the procedural part 
of how the Public Protector dealt with it it is – it is up for debate.  All I 
am saying is my version is not on the final report and I take your point, 
look for another avenue.  You said that I should have maybe taken an 
approach like Mr Ajay Gupta did to force himself to go and present 
20 
himself.  Once again I humbly disagree with that because if people are 
looking for aversions and aversions of events you know that is 
something that we need to present.  They need to give us that 
opportunity.  We cannot be fighting for that opportunity especially when 
it is something that affects us via allegations.  So I am just merely 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 53 of 163 
 
putting across that I am sitting here today and that is what I said 
yesterday why is my version not on – of events not on the Public 
Protector’s Report?  That is all I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also I must just say when I refer to what Mr Ajay 
Gupta did I was not necessarily saying that is what you were obliged to 
do or necessarily should have done.  I was simply saying here is 
another way in which somebody else who wanted to put his side of the 
story that he did maybe and I think I put that maybe that is what you 
10 
should have considered as well.  So I put it no higher than that. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  You referred to drinks or drinking 
facilities when your counsel asked you I think about your – about the 
choice to go to the Gupta residence for this meeting among the three of 
you that is yourself, Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas.  But I did not hear 
the exact full story of what you say about drinks.  Were you saying that  
ADV PIET LOUW:  Not speaking into microphone. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  In facilities.  It was not a shebeen.  It was catering 
facilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh catering facilities.  Well I did say I did not hear 
the whole story and maybe that is why it is important to clarify.  Just 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 54 of 163 
 
repeat exactly what you were saying about whether it is catering or 
drinks or whatever. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you.  What I was referring to was 
immediate facilities for any catering requirements for guests or people 
that we meeting with.  That would be tea, coffee, snacks, biscuits, nuts, 
whatever – whatever people have so that is what I was referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Hot drinks as in… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Temperature not – not alcohol. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Now my difficulty with that is that I would think 
that in your own house at Saxonwold you would receive friends and if 
you would receive friends you would offer them drinks so why would – 
why would the fact that there are catering – there are certain catering 
facilities at the Gupta residence really be an important factor in the 
choice of the venue when you were talking about – one of the – the fact 
that one of these people is your friend, Mr Hlongwane was your friend 
and the other person was your friend’s friend.  So one would think that 
20 
it is normal to have friends.  It is not a large group it is just two people 
then yourself then it is three people and I would have thought that if 
you have two or three friends in your own home you can make sure you 
can afford them drinks like that.  So – or is the position that you did not 
– you did not entertain friends in your home?  Make me understand. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 55 of 163 
 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes, Yes I will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chair when I said the catering parts and the 
drinks and sort of thing I think I did not say it in isolation I mentioned 
office facilities as well and staff.  So it is whole… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know at the Gupta residence? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Which is – yes – which is something that I may 
or may not have at my place which might inform my decisions not to 
10 
have meetings there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes./ 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I was asked if I have an office there, yes I 
have my own personal office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  But do I have facilities that would be office 
type, printers, staff, runners, whatever it is, no I do not.  So to answer 
your question of course I have entertained very few friends not many.  I 
do not have a huge staff compliment.  I do not have typical office type 
equipment in my home and that is what would have made me not have 
20 
any meetings of that sort.  Now to answer your question.  On Uncle 
Fana being a friend Mr Jonas being the friend’s friend I think I have 
stated quite clearly that I do not conduct business meetings from or 
meetings of that nature from my residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this was not as I understand it and you must tell 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 56 of 163 
 
me if my understanding of your evidence is not correct.  My 
understanding of your evidence suggest that this was not a business 
meeting.  This was an – a meeting where you sought to afford two 
friends – friends to themselves not both to you – two friends who had 
an issue to discuss, a private issue. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Private issue to discuss an opportunity to discuss and 
it just seems to me that the – there should be no reason why you 
cannot have two friends in your home who want to discuss a private 
matter. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes.  The two friends.  They were friendly to 
each other.  I only had one friend so the other technically is not – and 
was not my friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but… 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So he remains – he remains a let us call it a 
stranger well especially at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  So from – from a welcoming perspective from 
having someone in my home that I do not know is something that I do 
not generally do and I did not do on that day. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja well I would have thought that at least for 
purposes of that kind of meeting your friend’s friend would be welcome 
to your home for purposes of this discussion which you had taken 
trouble to say I want to help them resolve this. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 57 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand where I am coming from. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I understand that.  I understand where you 
coming from Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And my – and you must tell me was there 
a need for any office facilities for this meeting? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No though I mentioned the offices… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just because you were asked. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  No, no because that is what my daily business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  My daily movements were like so 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The point I was trying to make with the office 
facilities because I was asked.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  A direct question, why did I not go to my office 
to have the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. Oh okay. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  What put me – what put me at a residence at 
that point and I had mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Those facilities so to highlight why I could 
have meetings of that nature work related. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  In that space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  I wanted to also mention 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 58 of 163 
 
because you asked yesterday about the commission whether it was 
investigating or had investigated certain allegations against you.   
1. The commission investigates allegations that fall within the terms 
of reference of the commission but you know there will be all 
kinds of allegations even in a statement of one witness.  And 
some will be important for purposes of the commission some 
might not really be so important for purposes of the commission 
but might be important to the persons affected.  So the 
commission might not investigate everything that it is in 
somebody’s statement but seek to really investigate those that 
10 
appear to be material for its own purposes.  So it does that. 
But I want to take this opportunity to mention to you for what it is worth 
that Mr Ajay Gupta and Mr Atul Gupta as you know are not participating 
in any way in these proceedings.  But in regard to Mr Jonas’ evidence 
Mr Ajay Gupta and Mr Rajesh Gupta I cannot remember about Mr Atul 
Gupta they filed affidavits in their application for Leave to Cross-
examine Mr Jonas and in those affidavits they said what they said and 
in regard to Mr Ajay Gupta he said on that day he was in his Sandton 
offices.  He was not at the Gupta residence.  Months back – oh and she 
– and he said in his affidavit he mentioned the name of a certain lady 
20 
and he said that lady who works for his company would corroborate his 
alibi and he said and other employees but he gave the name of a 
particular lady.  Many months back I said the investigators must 
approach that lady and try and get her statement from her.  And – so 
that if necessary she could come and give evidence to say what she 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 59 of 163 
 
may know about where Mr Ajay Gupta was on the day.  Recently I was 
told that there were difficulties in – in getting hold of that lady.  So the 
commission is interested even if the Gupta’s may not be participating if 
they have placed information before the commission that maybe helpful 
for the commission to get to the bottom of what happened the 
commission will investigate that.  I can say that in due course 
irrespective of whether that lady is found or not in due course probably 
there will be one or two witnesses who will come to the commission and 
– and talk about Mr Ajay’s alibi as well as Mr Atul – Mr Ajay Gupta’s 
alibi, Mr Atul Gupta’s position as well because my understanding is that 
10 
it was said that he was out of the country at the time. That is Mr Atul 
Gupta.  I have given instructions that the investigators must check that.  
And if the information that comes out shows that he was out of the 
country that will be put out here in the public.  If Mr Ajay Gupta the 
investigations shows that Mr Ajay Gupta was not at the residence at the 
relevant time that also will be put up here publicly.  So I just want you 
to – to know that we – we – even with them not participating if they 
have put information before the commission that might be important for 
us to establish who was where when what was happening we will look 
into that. And – and the public will know.  So – but as I say there may 
20 
be some allegations that a particular person who is affected might think 
is important to follow up but the commission might think for its 
purposes it should not spend more resources on that.  But any affected 
person should feel free to approach the commission and say there is 
this allegation that was made about me I would like it to be looked into.  
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 60 of 163 
 
Then the commission might be able to say look we do not think we want 
to spend more resources on this but if you have anything that you want 
= that you are able to find bring it.  You know.  So – so – so I mention 
that just so that  
1. You know.  But also I just want the public to know that we are 
looking at everything. We are looking at everything.  We do not 
have a version that we want to be proved.  We just want the truth 
and wherever we might get the evidence. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Okay the last question that I wanted to 
10 
ask relates to the rumour that gave rise to the meeting.  Is the position 
that you also did not know any facts in relation to this rumour – all you 
knew is there was a rumour? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is the position Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the position.  And once – so in other words 
there was not much information that you were going to be able to give 
to the two men at the meeting other than this is what is being said in 
terms of the rumour but I have no further information. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And once – once Mr Jonas denied having blackmailed 
Mr Hlongwane was that basically the end of that discussion because 
nobody had further information? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  There was no further information but it was 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 61 of 163 
 
still interrogated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. And on your understanding did Mr 
Hlongwane believe that Mr Jonas was responsible for – for this rumour 
or had done what the rumours suggested he had done or was his 
position that he did not know but want to find out? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  At that point from what I had known he did not 
know and wanted to find out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay. 
10 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And did he accept Mr Jonas’ denial as you 
understood the position at the meeting?  Or did he not accept it. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Like I said the meeting ended off after the 
denial it took its turn and by the time the meeting was done there was a 
conversation to reconvene earlier in the week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  To pick up discussions that was the end of it.  
So whether it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  I cannot comment on that Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Now your arrest that you talked about 
when your counsel was leading you – was re-examining you.  Was it 
solely related to the meeting that took place at the Gupta residence 
attended by Mr Jonas and yourself and Mr Hlongwane but on his 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 62 of 163 
 
version plus somebody from the Gupta family?  Did it solely relate to 
that or did it relate to other things as well? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Chair no it solely related to that specific 
meeting and as my counsel pointed out that it had to do with the poker 
and the pucker issues.  So around the so called bribe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did the police ever ask you whether you knew 
about – knew in advance about any of that somebody from the Gupta 
family may have made or was the position that they asked you about it 
10 
and you said there was no such of at that meeting and that was the 
end? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  At what point would have that been? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Either at the time of arrest or subsequently before the 
charges were withdrawn.  In other words did they – was the position 
that they – they asked you to confirm that there was an offer made to 
Mr Jonas such as the one that he gave evidence about and you said 
there was no such offer and that was the end of their enquiry to you.  
Or was there more discussion to try and see whether you knew anything 
in advance about any offer that was made? 
20 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Like I had said the whole period leading up to 
– to today there had not been much communication that has been 
passed [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  We made numerous requests and still continue 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 63 of 163 
 
to make numerous requests to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  The law enforcement agencies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  To the NPA guys.  What is the story?  What is 
the situation?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  If there is anything please let us know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  We will comply.  We will give you whatever 
10 
information you need.  If there is anything you investigating because 
there is a lot of stuff being thrown around and in the public domain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  We are here.  We understand that is what is 
being said is there anything you need from us.  So even up until that 
point there was no questioning there was no interaction of any sort.  As 
a matter of fact we were asking them prior to the arrest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  What is the issue can we assist?  During the 
arrest what is the charge?  We were not given that information. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Only after the arrest we managed to get sight 
of – because obviously they needed to present charge sheets and 
warrants and that sort of thing and that is why now I have decided to 
take the steps that I have decided to take because I really want to 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 64 of 163 
 
understand what the issues are.  Because I have not had that 
opportunity to have that conversation.  I did not have the opportunity to 
be questioned.  It was just an event that just took me in the direction 
they wanted to take me and it ended up the way it did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I am asking this question because in his 
statement and in his evidence if I recall correctly Mr Jonas was very 
clear that at the meeting you and Mr Hlongwane you might not agree 
but he was clear that you and Mr Hlongwane were very quiet.  He said 
the – you know you really did not take any active role in this discussion 
that he was having with the member of the Gupta family that he talked 
10 
about.  So – so I thought that maybe there may be something that in 
terms of questioning that may have come up.  But it is fine.  Before the 
commission we have heard persons who have been arrested and 
charged in circumstances where they have complained that they were 
being charged in circumstances where there was really no case against 
them and charges were later withdrawn.  And I have said that I want to 
see what information the police had and what information the 
prosecutors had on the basis for which they charged those people.  
Because it does not matter who you are.  If the police have got proper 
evidence and proper grounds to arrest you and the prosecutors have 
20 
got proper grounds and proper evidence to charge you they should 
charge you.  But equally It does not matter who you are if they do not 
have evidence and proper grounds to arrest or to charge they should 
not charge.  So it is important that the police use their powers properly.  
Now I do not know whether in your case or in the case of the others 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 65 of 163 
 
that I have talked about who have come before the commission whether 
it was abuse or not abuse. But it is important to simply say I want to 
see all of that.  So in what I want to see it will include yours in the light 
of Mr Jonas’ evidence that you were very quiet at that meeting.  You 
and Mr Hlongwane.  It may well be that there were proper grounds and 
it may well be that even if there were no proper grounds it was just 
honest you know exercise of power I do not know.  But I just want to 
mention that I will want to see everything.  I think that is the end of my 
clarificatory questions that I had.  I see your counsel wants to say 
something. 
10 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  I just something from our side not from the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Joubert who sits next to me – apologise – was 
the counsel who represented Mr Zuma at the time of his arrest and 
merely to – from the bar just to inform you that Mr Zuma was never 
asked for a statement, he did not ever make a warning statement.  
There was no attempt to illicit further information or evidence from Mr 
Zuma.  He was merely arrested under the Act that I read out earlier The 
20 
Prevention on – And Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act of 2004 and 
the Prevention Of Organisation Crime Act of 1998.  They go by the 
acronyms of PRECA and POCA.  The charge insofar – no charge was 
ever put but the reason for the arrest is that Mr Zuma was apparently 
present when a bribe was offered to Mr Jonas and he did not make a 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 66 of 163 
 
report about that.  It is a report [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  So that is – it is 
CHAIRPERSON:  The basis. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  It is this inaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  That I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Was what the police were after.  The supreme irony 
of course being that Mr Jonas himself did not make such a report and 
10 
until today has refused to cooperate with the police on that point.  That 
merely insofar as that issue is concerned.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  With your leave may I ask the witness one final 
question?  It is – it is something that concerns you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And it would have concerned me as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  And perhaps I can just ask the witness a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just one. 
20 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Just one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Mr Zuma the Gupta residence. Can I ask you this?  
Is it the same as any other ordinary residence?  Would you be able to 
go five houses down the line in the same street in Saxonwold and walk 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 67 of 163 
 
in and have a meeting?  Or is there anything special?  Is the house, the 
residence, the area where you – where you met with Mr Hlongwane and 
Mr Jonas different from ordinary houses or is it just another sitting 
room, lounge area that of which there are probably millions in 
Johannesburg? 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  If there are probably millions in Johannesburg 
that should make it the million and first one so it is just like any other 
residence. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Were there any … 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Normal lounge – 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a second question now.  I granted you 
permission for one.   
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Just to clarify Chair.  It is like any other – any 
other residence there is no … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes nothing special. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Nothing special because this – just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Ja there is a lounge a normal lounge. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I am hoping you 
20 
are not asking for one more. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No questions.  No questions at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Zuma for coming to 
give evidence and share with the commission what you know.  As I said 
earlier and there may – there will be further discussion between the 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 68 of 163 
 
commission’s legal team and your legal team and in terms of that there 
may be a need for you to come back.  It just depends on the outcome of 
the discussions that will take place.  But thank you very much for 
coming to give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chair thank you very much for having me. It is an 
honour, a privilege and a pleasure to be here.  I appreciate your 
fairness and thank you for giving me an opportunity to put my side of 
the story across. Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much and you are now excused.  
Thank you. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  My colleagues are here ready and eager 
to proceed with the next business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the other witness the next witness. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But we – if we may afford them maybe 
ten or fifteen minutes adjournment for them to be able to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Properly you know place themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are at thirteen minutes past twelve.  If we 
20 
start at twenty five past twelve will that do?  They say it should be fine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is fine.  Should be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn then and resume at twenty five past 
twelve.  We adjourn.

left a number of files and documents and the - the little one on your 
table which is marked EXHIBIT HH14 are relevant for today’s 
proceedings. 
In fact if I can qualify that statement.  So HH14 which has 
20 
your statement is relevant for today’s proceedings and I believe we will 
only need Reference Bundles B - small b and F.  They may already 
have put them on your table for you ma’am.  Have a look at the two 
files that are on your table.  We need Reference Bundle b and F for 
today’s purposes with - if all goes well we should not have to refer to 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 74 of 163 
 
any of the others.  Thank you very much. 
If you then go to your affidavit which are contained in 
EXHIBIT HH14 and turn to page 1 thereof.  I know we have discussed 
the small amendment you would like to make to what is written in the 
tramlines at the top.  Could you please do that? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes Chair.  I would like to remove the sworn on 
the affidavit and it remains just affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just raise your voice again.  I did not hear. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  I am saying the - it is written sworn affidavit.  I 
would like to remove the sworn. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine, but let me see.  Oh.  Ja that is - 
that is - ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that - is that all? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That was it Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Certainly.  It was because we know 
the position you always take on this and it is slipped through … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This time but we thought if we correct it at 
the outset … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You would be a satisfied customer … 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 75 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And know that we do pay attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that - I guess that it can only mean it is 
double sworn. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This is what you have said to us Chairman 
and really apologies.  It slipped through this time again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ms Mtshiza if you then look at paginated 
page 1 and confirm whose name is on - reflected just below the “I, the 
undersigned”? 
10 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  It is Elder Mtshiza.  That is my name Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you and then if you go to - turn to 
page 2.  Could you confirm the signature - whose signature that is 
above the word “deponent”? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  That is my signature. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And can you confirm to the Chairman 
where and when you deposed to this affidavit? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  It was in Pretoria on 1 October 2019. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You confirm this is your affidavit? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes ma’am. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you very briefly - I know you have set 
this out in paragraphs 3 and four - tell the Chairman what this 
particular - the content of this affidavit represents? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that Ms Gcabashe.  I - I just want to 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 76 of 163 
 
say I did read the affidavit.  I think that most of the things that she 
deals with are unlikely to be controversial in terms of framework and 
policies.  There may be somewhere in terms of what actually happened 
that maybe - maybe - might be disputed. 
I am not sure but you - you are much closer to the affidavit 
but I just mention this to say I - I do not mind if you move fast in regard 
to those areas which are unlikely to be disputed by anybody.  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As you please Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will do that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman, we - there are two affidavits.  
So we will just complete what is in the first affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I think your comments really … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are most appropriate with the slightly 
longer one … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But we will indeed try and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Expedite that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 77 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ma’am if you could just very tell the - very 
briefly tell the Chairman what the first 2019 affidavit - what the purpose 
of this is. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes Chair.  The purpose of this affidavit is that I 
had previously provided a -a sworn affidavit to the South African Police 
Service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the sworn affidavit comes back. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Provided an affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  To the South African Police Service and this was 
10 
in 2017 and this is really to state that I still stand by the contents of 
the 2017 affidavit which was issued.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you ma’am.  So if we then go to 
page 3 will you confirm again that this affidavit is your affidavit?  So on 
page 3 there is your name. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes.  It is my affidavit. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then … 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Elder Mtshiza. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If we then go across to page 8 - paginated 
page 8 you confirm that you are the deponent? 
20 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And can you then confirm the place and 
date of this particular affidavit? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  It was signed in Pretoria on 3 November 2017. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Excellent.  Thank you very much.  We will 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 78 of 163 
 
go straight into the 2017 affidavit because that is where the heart of - 
of the matter lies.  Please just explain to the Chairman where you are 
currently employed? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  I am currently employed in the now Department 
of Agriculture Land Reform and Rural Development.  At the time it was 
the Department of Agriculture Forest and Fisheries. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And what position do you occupy in the 
National Department? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  In the National Department I am the Program 
Management Co-Ordinator at the level of a Chief Director responsible 
10 
for the conditional grants - CASP - which is the Comprehensive 
Agricultural Support Program and Ilima/Letsema Conditional Grants. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How long have you been employed at the 
department at which you work? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  I have been with the department since 2010 and 
since then until today I have been responsible for this portfolio. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Could you very briefly just explain to the 
Chairman what those - I will use the acronym - CASP Conditional 
Grants are?  What is the essence of that? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes.  The CASP Conditional Grant is a grant 
20 
which is governed by the Division of Revenue Act.  At the time of the 
funding to the Vrede Dairy it was a Schedule 4 Conditional Grant which 
meant it was meant to supplement equitable share in supporting 
farmers both smallholder and subsistence in particular and it is mainly 
for support to Black producers. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 79 of 163 
 
Just to enable them to increase their production to allow them 
with acquisition of infrastructure.  To support them with training, 
capacity building, support them with market access as well as business 
development.  The Ilima/Letsema Conditional Grant is a Schedule 5 
which was a special purpose conditional grant aimed at increasing food 
production. 
Mainly for your household food security.  So we would 
support your household food gardens.  We would do food massification 
in communal areas but also provide inputs to smallholder farmers who 
have received infrastructures like your poultry houses or piggery 
10 
structures from CASP.  Then you give them the first inputs as start-up 
inputs for enabling or starting up production on their farms. 
Also with Ilima/Letsema you could also invest in unlocking 
infrastructure like your irrigation schemes.  So those are mainly grants 
that are aimed at giving your Black producers some support that will 
enable them opportunity to be able to access your loans because at 
this point in time they do not necessarily have adequate resources or 
enough capital to actually access loans directly. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I see you have mentioned Black producers 
a number of times.  Is that one of the - the essential criteria … 
20 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  The … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For the … 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  The programs … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Grant? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Are mainly meant for Black producers Chair. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 80 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes and you have also mentioned that 
these grants are from DORA, but can you explain the relationship 
between your administration of the grant and National Treasury? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes.  National Treasury Chair is the - the body 
that governs the Division of Revenue Act and that has also 
appropriated funds which we then distribute to provinces that has been 
appropriated for Division of Revenue Act.  So as a - as is given within 
the Division of Revenue Act both National Treasury have powers to 
release as well as to withhold where there are concerns. 
The same way as the transferring of (indistinct) which in this 
10 
case was a delegated function or is a delegated function to myself has 
the powers to release or to withhold the - the funds that has been 
disbursed if there is any non-compliance or any violation to legislation 
or non-compliance to the framework that has been issued. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now the grant is - is applied for and given 
to the provincial departments.  Am I correct? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You do not give the grant to implementing 
agents? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  No.  The allocations are made directly to the 
20 
Provincial Departments of Agriculture and the process for which the 
farmers are able to access these grants is through the application to 
the provinces.  So the application would also start at local level.  There 
are committees that would receive those applications for farmers that 
need support and if they are in line with what has been prioritised 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 81 of 163 
 
commodities of that - at that time and they are ready for 
implementation. 
You would then - the local would present their cases to 
district and sometimes it is really on the basis of limited resources.  So 
the district will then select the ones that they will want to present to the 
provincial committee and at the provincial committee they would have 
to be signed off by the accounting authority and consolidated into one 
application of the province against the budget that has been allocated 
to that province but it is not just a given. 
So the province must then come and according to the Division 
10 
of Revenue Act that application needs to be received by the National 
Department on 30 September.  So the National Department will receive 
all applications from provinces and we will schedule a meeting of the 
National Assessment Panel.  After the penal because a panel comprises 
of a number of expertise within the department who need to look into 
the plans of the - of the provinces within each project. 
So we will schedule that panel meeting with is the NAP 
meeting and the provinces will then be invited to come and present 
each one’s case in that.  So when we receive we receive a plan of a 
province with all the projects that they want to achieve and what impact 
20 
those would - would achieve and the panel will deliberate after the 
province has presented and a decision will be made to say we can 
recommend to the Director-General that a business plan for this 
province should be approved or not. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Tell - tell … 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 82 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please tell the Chairman what exactly a 
conditional grant is.  I am - I am looking at the oversight role you have.  
Why conditional and as you explained that please explain the oversight 
role that you play because it is a conditional grant? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes.  The conditional grant Chair is that you 
cannot use this money for anything else but for what it was approved 
for.  So in this instance with CASP we would approve it for 
establishment of an infrastructure on the farmer’s farm.  We would 
approve it for providing that farmer with training capacity in terms of 
10 
coaching/mentorship. 
We would approve that grant to that farmer if you are going to 
assist that farmer with market infrastructure or also post-harvest infra - 
services.  So the - you cannot use it for any other purpose that it was 
not intended for. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Could you just clarify one point?  Do you 
simply throw money at the province and wash your hands of it and just 
check on how they are using it or in - in what - in the services you 
provide do you actually physically also assist with let us say 
infrastructure or with marketing some of the other matters that you 
20 
have raised? 
I - I just want to understand whether it is just the matter of 
giving money or do you also do other things with the provinces - 
provinces? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  We - as I had indicated the responsibility to 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 83 of 163 
 
implement is that of the province.  So we would confirm first that a 
province has the capacity that they need and if they do not then you 
will avail the resources or expertise that they may need for such a 
project to be executed. 
We will also do oversight visits ourselves just to monitor 
whether the plan has - is being implemented as was approved by - by 
national. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  I am really just going through 
these essential features fairly briefly.  You also have standard 
operating procedures.  You set that out in your affidavit. 
10 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That applies across the board.  We will 
deal with those in a little more detail slightly further on. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think what is important is to - to assist 
the Chairman understand whether the Department of Agriculture and 
Rural Development Free State made a presentation to the National 
Assessment Panel and what then happen - happened in relation to that.  
This would have been in 2012. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes Chair.  We received the business plan of 
20 
the province as is expected and one of the projects which were 
presented to the NAP included the Vrede Dairy. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact can I make a correction?  It would 
have been in - in 2013. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 84 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am at your paragraph 8. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  This was during the 30 t h to 31 January - NAP 
Meeting of the 30 t h to 31 January where the first date means that 
representation of their plan and the Vrede Dairy Project in particular to 
the National Assessment Panel. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who is the Chairman of that particular 
panel? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  I am the Chairman of the panel. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And can you give Chairman a - a sense of 
the expertise that resides in that panel? 
10 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes Chair.  In the panel we have water use and 
irrigation experts.  We have the agricultural economist.  We have 
animal specialists, crop production specialists.  We do fund extension 
support.  So we have colleagues from extension services just to make 
sure that the plans are in line with the extension plan framework. 
We have training experts from the department to look at the - 
whether the skills audits were done for the farmers that needs to be 
trained as has been requested and look deeper into the training plans 
of those provinces.  We also have market colleagues who are 
specialists in market assess and agro processing who are sitting in the 
20 
panel. 
So each member of the panel within each province will go 
into their critical niche and evaluate of the nine provinces and make 
comments in terms of the - their inputs that the province needs to look 
at or satisfy themselves that the province had met the technical 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 85 of 163 
 
standards that is required for that project to be executed.  Such that 
when we make the recommendation that the plan should be approved. 
Minor issues which we can still follow through and do.  We 
have a holistic agreement in terms of their focus.  It is in line with the 
policy imperatives and the - already progress in terms of the technical 
standards that are met.  We would approve with certain conditions that 
will need to be met to enable the province to start with the execution of 
- of those plans. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Excellent.  Can we then assume that 
because the Provincial Department Free State was given a CASP 
10 
allocation that they met your standards on application for that grant? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes.  The - in particular on the Vrede Dairy 
Chair it was one of the big projects of the Free State and the 
conceptualisation which was captured in their business plan was quite 
exciting and we were quite happy with what was contained in their 
presentation that was made to - to the NAP. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And as you say in your paragraph they 
also indicated that they already had an invested part of their equitable 
share … 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In the project? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  The standard operating procedure encourages 
provinces to look for private investment.  To that effect is that we are 
quite aware that our resources are limited and to extend our rent it is 
better to bring in private partners to co invest with Government but 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 86 of 163 
 
mainly for the funding and secondly for the skill which should also then 
be distributed to our beneficiaries but also some of our beneficiaries 
are not necessarily at that point ready to participate along the value 
chain in the secondary value chain. 
So that on it is - on it is own allows them to participate along 
the value chain.  So it was quite exciting that there is already a partner 
and also there was a - a high level executive approval from the 
province which meant there would definitely be some guarantee in 
terms of equitable share together with our conditional grants enabling 
the development of that project. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chair I notice that it is - it is 1 o’ clock.  
Maybe we could take the lunch break now.  If you prefer us to push for 
another 10 minutes we can do that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you left with 10 minutes to finish her … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really?  Just to finish the statement and then 
the annexures? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The next section goes into the actual - the 
issues that arose (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is the next portion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then maybe we should take the adjournment now and 
then resume at two.  We will try as far as we can to finish both today? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Definitely Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 87 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are halfway through this statement 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No.  That is fine.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment and we will resume at 2 o’ clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s us continue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you DCJ.   Ma’am Mshiza are you 
ready? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes I am. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   We are now dealing with paragraph 9 to 
paragraph 15 of your 2017 affidavit and this is the area that really 
deals with what went wrong.   Now you have told us at paragraph 9 that 
certain concerns were raised by your panel, by the NAP, please take 
the Chairman through those concerns. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please articulate your response if you’re not – that’s 
not capture in the record okay.  I think she asked you a question and 
you nodded, you need to say what your response is. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 88 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can I repeat the question Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Repeat the question ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Ma’am in paragraph 9 you explained that 
certain concerns were raised by the panel that you Chair, is that 
correct? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Could you please take the Chairman 
through those concerns? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Chair as I explained when the plan is presented 
by the Province and project of this magnitude is presented, and as I 
10 
indicated the panel was quite excited about it.  We had already 
received a presentation that said the work has already started in terms 
of construction so the panel just wanted to check all the technical 
issues to see, was the disability concluded, was it positive, is water 
rights in place and is there enough water, has the quality been 
confirmed and these responses were responded to positively. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That is when you asked them during the 
process? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   During the map process. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   We were also quite excited that the project is 
going to benefit a hundred beneficiaries and – because the Province 
had already indicated that some will be milking.  We also wanted to 
understand the content around the logistical arrangement of collecting 
the milk and bringing it to the facility.  So we understood that there will 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 89 of 163 
 
be production that happens off site in those farmer’s lands as well as 
what is happening within the facility because all that documentation 
was not with us, we then concluded by saying that we need to be 
provided with a list of beneficiaries and we must also be – the Province 
must keep records, like your feasibility study, your business plan ready 
for as and when it’s needed…[intervenes]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can I just probe that one aspect, so when 
they came to see you and make application for the CASP Grant they did 
not have the list of beneficiaries. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    They did not have a feasibility study that 
they shared with you, they did not have a business plan that they 
shared with you.    
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And they did not have – they couldn’t 
give you any indication that the EIA’s had been concluded – those 
applications had been concluded. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Chair the documentation was not part of the 
presentation but all these questions which were asked by the panel, 
were responded to positively.  I remember with the water, they had said 
20 
their application was already done with the Department of Water 
Affairs.  So we were comfortable to let it go because in terms of the 
technical steps that needed to be done, the Province had actually 
indicated that they had already started or concluded some of these 
processes which included completion of the feasibility study which is 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 90 of 163 
 
positive, the application of water rights which has already been lodged, 
the EIA which was concluded and so on. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes, thank you.  On the strength of what 
they said to you, you were then prepared to give them a grant of 
R53million? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes, we then – the Province came requesting for 
R53million from CASP and R22million from [indistinct] and we felt if you 
approve R75millionn all at once it’s actually too heavy of the intention 
of the grant so we only approved the R53million that we said we will be 
able to recommend for approval to the Director General…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   R53Million? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   R53million and we then declined the R22million 
because it was actually going to affect negatively the drive of Feza 
Gala programme because that money was earmark for [indistinct] which 
is Food Massification as I had indicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This presentation that the Province came to make to 
this panel, as I understand your affidavit that’s a presentation aimed at 
complying with the requirements…[intervenes]. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Of the Division of Revenue Act yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and your panel would be the one that would 
20 
approve or would give comment…[intervenes]. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   That would satisfy itself that we can recommend 
for approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and the actual decision to approve would be 
made by whom? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 91 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   The actual decision for approval would be made 
by the Director General.  So when the panel concludes I will then 
develop a submission and pull all the documentation with the final 
national business plan which I would have compiled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   And present to the Director General for approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but now you say that, as I understand the 
position, the team from the Province that made this presentation did not 
bring along certain documentation? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that normal? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it normal that people can come for that 
presentation and leave out what may be important documents because I 
would imagine that the business plan would be an important document 
and water rights documents would be important documents? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair like I said CASP was a schedule 4 
conditional grant at the time which means it was meant to supplement 
equitable share so the Province’s plan which is a plan to develop 
farmers would then be the one that is presented to the panel for 
20 
approval which would then signal key projects which then would be 
driven and for what purpose would your money now be used for and in 
this instance because this was a mega request on one project, although 
it benefited a hundred beneficiaries at the time their technical experts 
which are the members of the panel would then want to delve deeper 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 92 of 163 
 
into understanding how far has the province gone in developing the 
plan towards it’s implementation.  Hence we requested that all that 
documentation be kept safe for as and when it is required.  What would 
then follow Chair would be a monitoring visit by the different expertise 
who would then engage with the documentation with the Province and 
where there’s a need for strengthening or picking up issues we will then 
do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well my expectation, and I thought that’s what 
emerges from your affidavit but you must tell my if my expectation 
doesn’t accord with the procedures and practices of the – or the 
10 
prescripts of the Department.  My expectation would be that your 
committee would not be prepared to approve the grant of so much 
money without having those important documents being shown to them 
looking at them and taking a view about them, am I mistaken? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Chair one would have expected that we probably 
go deeper into requesting the actual documentation but if you go into 
what the standard operating procedure at that time was saying, it – as I 
indicated the implementation was with the Province so ours was to 
make sure and satisfy ourselves that they had gone through proper and 
I think it was more initial trust that you know that the accounting officer 
20 
which is the head of the department is also obliged to abide  by the 
prescripts of the regulations that governed that and at a point where 
their response to the questions of they’re not favourable responded to 
or you feel that there are gaps then your hold their approval process 
and then go and make a follow through because the same technical 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 93 of 163 
 
within the National Department are expected to be present at a 
Provincial Department but some of the improvements that we have 
made to the programme in particular, just to try and close these gaps 
because we realised that – just to give you an indication Chair, in one 
sitting the panel would be receiving presentations from all nine 
provinces with about 1 500 projects that would be executed for the next 
financial year.   
 
So you then check with each and every province, bringing in, 
in terms of the work that they have done and on that basis a project 
gets approved and then there’s follow through, oversight to confirm that 
10 
what has been said is actually what has happened and is the project 
executed as is.  So it was more really an issue of capacity but also to 
understand that we are concurrent implementers here.  So you do your 
job, I do my job and I come and say, have you done all that you need to 
have done and you will say, yes I’ve done all what I’ve need to have 
done.  So as colleagues we will then agree that you have done what 
you need to do and I have checked and confirmed with you that you 
have done what you need to do and I would record it as such and on 
the basis of what the record then we take it further to say, we can 
recommend that this is approved because it is stated that – so you 
20 
would always say it is stated that this and this and this and then you 
will schedule visits and then go and verify all that information.   
 
So there will be different teams now that goes to all nine 
provinces and make sure that the projects are visited and confirm that 
they meet the standards as has been – unless there’s a problem with 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 94 of 163 
 
one particular province or they extend the quality of the presentation, 
it’s such that the province – because they will bring in a strong 
delegation of their expertise to engage with the technical expertise at 
[indistinct].  So to an extent that the province had failed to convince 
the panel that they are ready, then we would not recommend for 
approval and we would schedule a follow up meeting within that 
province and before that meeting we would send teams because we’ll 
now be sitting with a list of projects that were earmarked for support 
and our technical teams will just go about, so that by the time that we 
sit with the province we now have detail, having been on site to 
10 
understand what the issues are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but the long and short of what you are telling 
me in regard to my question seems to be that it was in order and there 
was 
nothing 
un-procedural 
or 
irregular 
if 
the 
– 
your 
panel...[intervenes]. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Had approved that without documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Approved the kind of request that it approved in this 
case without seeing the business plan, without seeing water licenses 
and without seeing, maybe other documents, is that what you are 
saying? 
20 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   That’s what I’m saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and was there a document, whether it’s 
regulations, policy or whatever that set out what this panel must satisfy 
itself about and what it should have before it before approving at that 
time? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 95 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   At that time we had only the terms of reference 
for the panel and the guiding documents would then be the grant 
frameworks as well the Division of Revenue Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   In fact Chair, just to assist on this 
particular point a couple of issues maybe that need clarification.  One, 
you’re saying there would always be follow up engagement or visit after 
that approval/recommendation phase? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s the first thing you’re saying.  The 
10 
second thing I understand you to be saying is that you have improved 
on the systems that were in place in 2013? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair, similarly as I had indicated the CASP 
was a schedule 4 conditional grant and with a schedule 4 if you go to 
the Division of Revenue Act, a province need not really submit a 
business plan, that’s now if you go into what a schedule 4 is all about.  
You can come and say we have agricultural projects to support and you 
need not submit a business plan.  Whereas a schedule 5 conditional 
grant requires that you must submit a business plan.  We then moved- 
because some of the learnings of the past enables you to improve, we 
20 
approached National Treasury and we have since changed their 
schedule for conditional grant CASP.  So CASP is now a schedule 5 
conditional grant so it is now mandatory for such documentation to be 
presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 96 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   To the National Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that’s fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you Chair, can I also just point you 
to the CASP funding agreement of 2013/2014 and this you will find in 
reference bundle F for Freddie, if you go to page 2066 towards the 
back, there are stickers at the top so there is one that is written 125 
it’s right towards the end and that’s where you’ll find page 2066, so it’s 
reference bundle F for Freddie page 2066, have you found it ma’am? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   I have reference bundle F. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   On the top right-hand corner you have 
10 
the page numbers, I can see you are very far from where I want you to 
be, go right to the back, keep going, you should find 2066 closer to 
where you are now. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes I have found it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And that is the CASP funding agreement. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   If you look over the page to page 2067 
you have the signatures of three officials from the Free State 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   The first one is that of Dr Masiteng. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   The second one is that of Ms Dlamini the 
CFO. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 97 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And the third one is that of the HOD Mr 
Thabethe. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And this document was signed on the 12 t h 
of June 2013. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can you briefly take the Chairman 
through what it is that they were agreeing it to and whom they were 
agreeing these particular terms with? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Chair after the business plan has been 
10 
recommended for approval and the Director General has approved their 
business plan, we then get into another agreement with the province.  
So these are now the conditions that the province will commit to abide 
to in executing the project in that financial year.  So it would state the 
total grant funding to the province and the province will then say we 
agree to all these 11 conditions which are set now in the agreement as 
the rule or the non-negotiable and the head of the department, the 
Chief Financial Officer as well as the CASP coordinator in the province, 
in that instance it was Dr Masiteng would then have to sign the 
agreement and then submit back to us.  Upon receipt of these 
20 
agreements we will take all the agreements to National Treasury and 
only after the agreement is signed can we release the funds. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So at the time that this agreement was 
signed National Treasury had not communicated its reservations around 
the Vrede Dairy Project? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 98 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   When did you get the first inclination or 
indication that all was not well with the Vrede Dairy Farm Project? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Chair it was in July when we received a letter 
from National Treasury, their concern was that they had picked up that 
the Vrede Dairy is a public/private partnership and that the province did 
not follow due process for a public/private partnership and as such they 
are in violation of Regulation 13.61 and any continued expenditure on 
this project will equal to unlawful expenditure.  As a result they are 
requesting that we should withhold their conditional grant.  The Division 
10 
of Revenue does allow in terms of withholding of conditional grants 
that, that process can be initiated by National Treasury or by the 
transferring officer and there are conditions through which you can do 
that and one of them is if there is any violation to any Treasury 
Regulations or – yes thank you Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can I point you to the same reference 
bundle but this time to page 2063, exactly where you were but this time 
it’s a couple of pages before the last one you looked at, 2063. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Is this the letter you refer to dated – it’s 
20 
not very clear but it’s June 2013, certainly. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes it was, it’s the same letter Chair which was 
received by our department and it was dated 26 June but the office of 
the Director General received it on the 3 r d of July 2013. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   As evidence by the stamp on the top 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 99 of 163 
 
right-hand corner? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   The stamp on the top yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can you just give the Chairman the gist 
of what National Treasury’s reservations were as communicated to your 
department? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   In the letter Chair, it’s actually paragraph two, 
the nature of the arrangement was that a PPP as I had explained has 
been entered into by the department but the department had failed to 
follow due process which means that it should have registered the PPP 
with Treasury and also informed relevant Treasury that the expertise 
10 
exists within their private partner which they are entering into. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You then decided to go on a site visit? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Please tell the Chairman about that? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   When we received the instruction from National 
Treasury the first thing you do really is to abide by their requests.  So 
according to the Division of Revenue Act we then issue an intention to 
withhold the funds but because, as I had indicated we were sold onto 
the project and we really wanted to see this anchor within the Free 
State particularly in the identified sites we then sent the letter of 
20 
intention to withhold the province to say they should state this is what 
the National Treasury’s concerns are and they should tell us why we 
shouldn’t withhold the funds.  We then received the response from the 
province which then outlined all the approval by the Executive 
Authorities and all that but it was not addressing the fact that there was 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 100 of 163 
 
a dispute whether this is a PPP from the Provincial letter that we 
received.  So we initiated a letter back to the province requesting that, 
to resolve this dispute – because technically we are all in agreement 
that this plan should be executed.  We now need to meet as four 
parties to resolve these – and see how best do we correct that wrong 
but before that meeting we then decided, actually we approved on the 
basis of the information that was presented to us so let’s then go on 
site visit and go and confirm our technical facts, so that by the time we 
meet we know we are together with the province in enforcing that the 
project is continuing. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Did you go to Bloemfontein or did you go 
to Vrede? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   We went to Vrede and we met with the HOD, Dr 
Masiteng and their CFO and the District Manager at Vrede. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   They were there to receive you, you say 
in your paragraph 11? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:  Yes, they were there to receive us and they took 
us through the site inspections and their technical team was now 
engaging and it could only engage with them because the implementing 
part now was not there. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can I ask this question, because you had 
such a high powered delegation from your office and from the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, was the engagement 
with the HOD and the coordinator, and the CFO or was it with the 
people who worked on the farm? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 101 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   It was with the HOD, the coordinator and the 
CFO plus their Project Manager who was on site at that time and the 
District Manager also, I think, she was also part of the meeting.  So it 
was not with the people on the farm because the ones who were on the 
farm were really the ones who were working, busy with construction. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   At paragraph 12 you then deal with what 
you established when you got…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Ms Gcabashe I think you – I missed your 
announcement to go back to the statement, to the affidavit? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes I beg your pardon, in the rush 
10 
Chairman to keep to the time I promised you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   I’m being a little untidy, my apologies 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   We are going back to the statement to 
page six of the statement and its paragraph 12 of HH14 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And can you just give the Chairman a 
sense of how you felt when you – as you were leaving this project, as 
20 
you were leaving Vrede, you set that out in paragraph 12. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Chair we found that there was work going on and 
a lot of work was already done as stipulated here, we were also taken 
to the site where there were cattle kept…[intervenes]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can you explain that so the 351 Friesland 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 102 of 163 
 
cows were held or kept at a different site is this what you’re saying? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes, they were in Vrede but they were not at the 
construction site because there was construction.  So they were kept in 
the veld where they were grazing and there was a vet looking after 
them and some headmen when we got there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Did you speak to this vet, do you know 
where – was he from the department? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   We spoke to the vet he was not from the 
department Chair he was also coming from India yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   A vet from India? 
10 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry did you speak through an interpreter or was 
he quite conversant in English? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   He could speak English Chair but it was not very 
perfect English but we could…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You could understand? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   We could understand each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Did they give an indication on how long 
20 
they had kept those particular cattle there and when those cattle would 
be moved back to the farm proper? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   I don’t remember that part of the discussion 
Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Did they give any indication as to why 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 103 of 163 
 
they had purchased these cattle before the farm itself was ready 
because you call it a construction site? 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes, there were timelines with regard to when 
they anticipated the construction of the building to happen and they felt 
to have a parallel process through which you are now getting the vet 
familiar with the livestock and showing that they are properly nourished 
as they had indicated they were anticipating certain level of 
productivity from these cattle and I think it was merely – because I  
don’t think there was any key reason Chair, 2013, I might not remember 
all the facts but we were not necessarily finding it odd but yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Continue because you then go on to speak 
about water rights not being in place etcetera.  Just take the Chairman 
through that? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Yes.  Chair remember when we approved there 
were a number of questions which the panel had asked in terms of 
readiness to implement and one of them was a feasibility study.  On 
site we were hoping – our letter said we will get there and you will 
present and provide documentation that was requested by the National 
Assessment Panel.  So the feasibility report was also not issued on site 
to us.  The business plan presentation was also not made but the 
20 
project manager without a business plan he knew what needed to 
happen.  And that was also a concern by the Agricultural – the Chief 
Agricultural Economist that we were with.  We also were concerned that 
during the presentation the province had indicated that an application 
for water rights was done.  But on site they could not also provide us 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 104 of 163 
 
with evidence of their application for water rights but they had… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I just – Can I just interrupt you there 
to tidy up one piece? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that again takes us to page 2069 of 
Exhibit HH Reference bundle F.  2069 Reference bundle F and am I 
correct in saying that this is the letter that indicates that even as at the 
24 t h February 2014 the application for water rights had not been 
concluded? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   According to this letter yes Chair. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is just the material fact that we have 
been debating during the hearings. Thank you continue you were then 
going to just complete your summary of the items that were red flags. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For you. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   And there was also an indication Chair about 
the beneficiaries.  So when we were on site one of the things we 
mentioned was that we would have liked to interface with them so that 
we also get from them what they understand about what the project is 
all about. But in the absence of them being part of the meeting can we 
20 
be availed that list of beneficiaries and it was also not made available 
to us on site.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I again just ask you to – to go to the 
same Reference bundle F page 2041.  This is a letter written to the 
then Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Me Tina Joemat-
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 105 of 163 
 
pettersson and it is written by the MEC in the Free State for Agriculture 
Me Thabethe.  And where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you say 2041? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  2041 Chairman.  I have just – this is the 
particular paragraph I will be referring to Chairman but if you want the 
beginning of the letter I can give you that page number? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I think… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what might be confusing me because on the 
page it does not look like it is a letter. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  The letter starts on 2036 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay now I see. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes and it is dated the 26 t h August 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But the salient portion I want to refer the 
witness to is at page 2041. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that paragraph 2 the very last 
sentence of the paragraph that is titled Phases for Project Deployment 
reads as follows: 
20 
“It is pertinent to note that the department has 
already identified and signed contracts with 80 
beneficiaries for this project and any delay in 
releasing funds will have a direct impact on the 
beneficiaries.” 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 106 of 163 
 
Now when you went on this site visit and in the negotiations around 
what you required from the department in the Free State were you ever 
shown these signed contracts with 80 beneficiaries. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   No Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact to our knowledge on the evidence 
that has been led to date 80 beneficiaries certainly – there are no such 
contracts that have been brought here or that we have been able to find 
and I thought you might have better information than the commission. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   No Chair we – as I indicated we did not get the 
beneficiaries nor were we presented with a list which we requested at 
10 
the meeting.  When we left the meeting we had agreed with the HOD 
that he – because he indicated that there is a l list of beneficiaries but 
he did not talk to contracts.  So maybe they did enter into them later I 
am not sure.  So there were – to conclude our visit we made a list of 
the things that needed to come to us because we could not make any 
engagement technically and that was supposed to be a technical visit 
on site.  We then requested that the feasibility report be submitted to 
us, the list of beneficiaries be sent to us, the business plan also be 
sent to us, the EIA be sent to us.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Then at your paragraph 13 you – you 
20 
speak to the back to office report that you have annexed to this 
affidavit.  That report Chairman is on paginated page 26 of HH14.  
HH14 which is the affidavit of the witness.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I am sorry about that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of course Chairman not a problem. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 107 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So we are at page paginated 7 one hand 
is 0 a couple of fingers are holding page 7 which is where paragraph 13 
appears Chairman and then the other part – other hand has gone to 
page 26 which speaks to the issues raised in paragraph 13.  So we 
looking at paragraph 13 on paginated page 7.  We are also looking at 
the specific report that is referred to in paragraph 13 which is found on 
paginated page 26.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ma’am can you just take the Chairman 
10 
through without reading the full back to office report.  I think if you take 
the Chairman through those essential recommendations that you made 
which you have enumerated at paragraph 13? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Chair when we came back we were then – the 
province met their deadlines of submitting to the [indistinct] that we 
had requested but we only received the feasibility report and agreement 
between the province and Estina.  We did not receive the business 
plan.  The Agricultural Economists and our dairy expert then engaged 
on that documentation because we really had to make decisions and 
make decisions very quickly.  And their concerns where that – that was 
20 
really not a feasibility – a proper feasibility study for the Vrede Dairy 
because it did not give them much content around Vrede which they 
wanted and they had highlighted a number of concerns with the 
assumptions which were made.  The profitability of the entity as had 
been projected in the feasibility report.   And just to go through to our 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 108 of 163 
 
recommendations.  They then recommended that the basis through 
which the approval was made was false because of the documentation 
that came through even the application form for water rights did not 
accompany so he made an assumption being site when the HOD told us 
that he is meeting with the Department of Water the next day from our 
meeting that that would only be the time that they are going to be 
making the application.  So we recommended that the – because the 
basis through which we made the approval was false the province must 
now conduct a proper feasibility study for the project and also that 
feasibility study will then inform a proper business plan that they must 
10 
conclude on the applications for water rights and because there was 
some indication of livestock that might and we would not know whether 
in the business execution there would be some change in breed given 
that you have an international entity that which is Paras at the time that 
is going to bring some of its intellect into how milk should be produced 
because as was indicated by these experts the quantities which were 
projected in that plan were too ambitious and not even achieved by the 
high performing dairy producers in the country.  That the province must 
conduct also biological impact study and also for these reasons 
therefore we cannot confidently continue with funding the project 
20 
because we believe technically all technical processes were not 
properly followed and the funds must therefore be withheld.  So to that 
end we completed this report to inform the Director General and we 
issued the last final letter that the funds should be withheld and the 
balance of the funding can be released back to the National Revenue 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 109 of 163 
 
Fund or support projects within the province which we knew existed and 
still needed funding and some of which were owing the Agriculture 
Credit Board.  But for us to conclude whether the funds must then be 
redirected we needed now detail of the projects that we identified 
against the balance of the fund and we sent teams out to confirm that 
the work that is proposed by the province for the other projects is what 
should happen and upon approval by the panel we then rediverted the 
funds from Vrede Dairy to these other projects.  So… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I just – can I just clarify one point.  I 
know you have gone past this point. 
10 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But if you look at paginated page 30 in 
HH14 Chairman you will find there a list of eight factors arising from 
the flaws in the feasibility study.  Is that correct Ma’am? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And it is on the basis of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say – did you say paragraph [indistinct]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Paginated page 30, 30 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 30. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman.  I think these are important 
20 
just for purposes of giving perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of the flaws that were in that feasibility 
study, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 110 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Okay.  One what was reached Chair is that 
large parts of the feasibility study covers standard theoretical 
information with no details. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Your microphone. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Sorry.  With no details on the project itself.  
For an example the document covers alternative approaches of doing 
things, what to look for, when planning without a final statement on how 
things will be done in this project and in particular and where will they 
source what and at what cost?  For an example you would have 
expected them to have factored in the costs for feeds.  The costs for 
10 
water and at what cost will – and will where will that be sourced so that 
it informs your business plan and your business plan’ projected profit 
can then be confirmed to be true.  The study does not make any 
comments on the total water needed and ability to provide it.  This is an 
aspect that needs to be verified by specialists such as engineers 
specialising in this field for both the fresh water and surface water.  No 
documentation of the water rights has been provided.  The document 
does not make any comment on the involvement of small holder 
farmers.  Their location, who they are, their current productivity and 
infrastructural requirements.  Nothing is mentioned on how their 
20 
production will be managed to meet specific requirements pricing, 
collecting etcetera.  And this was because we understood that there 
would also be the recipients of cattle from and produce it on their farms 
as well the milk.  The conception rate at 60% is low and it is not in line 
with the high mild production assumption in the business plan.  The 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 111 of 163 
 
number of cows needed for mating at a 60% concentration rate will be 
in the order of 830.  This will result in a very high percentage of dry 
cows.  The normal acceptable rate for dry cows in the herd is in the 
order of about 20%.  The general economic assumption which was on 
page 56 of the 63 document that was submitted needed further clarity.  
The amounts for some cases could well be challenged while others 
could be part of a double counting in the broader perspective.  The 
assumption of 45 litres milk per cow per day is too good to be true. 
Some of the leading milk producers in the country will a long build-up 
of quality dairy herds recorded in the order of 30 litres milk per cow per 
10 
day.  The implication could well be that the estimated profits for the 
business be reduced to 60% of what is recorded currently in the plan.  
There is no mention of the biological impact of the project and no 
documentation to this effect has been provided. The market approach is 
not clarified.  Probably this would have been covered in full in the 
business plan but the business plan is not available.  So this was the 
documentations Chair which I received from the Agricultural Economists 
and the dairy specialists in the department.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You have then told the Chairman that you 
– the department decided to – having engaged with the provincial 
20 
Department of Agricultural and Rural Development your department 
decided to withhold the R53 million that you had allocated.  Can I ask 
you to go to Exhibit HH Reference bundle B for Barry.  And if you go to 
page 610 there you will find a letter that confirms what you are saying 
about the withdrawal of those funds and I would like you to turn to page 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 112 of 163 
 
611 which is the second page of that letter.  So it starts on 610. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   This is Reference bundle B? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  B yes Ma’am.   
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Apologies I took F 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the letter starts on page 610. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   This is page 600 and? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  10. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   10. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I really want to refer you to the 
second page which is 611. 
10 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The last two paragraphs of this letter.  
Could you just read that into the record briefly because it confirms what 
you are saying? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:    
“The Province has failed to meet the 1 s t November 
deadline.  Also National Treasury has commissioned 
a forensic audit” 
Is that the one Chair? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes please continue. 
20 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Okay. 
“Also National Treasury has commissioned a forensic 
audit of the project which was expected to end on 
31 s t October 2013.  However the results of the 
forensic audit have not been communicated to us.” 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 113 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Continue into the… 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:    
“In 
these 
circumstances 
no 
funds 
will 
be 
communicated to …” 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Will be committed. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:    
“Will be committed to the project at this stage from 
the CUSP and [indistinct] conditional grants.  The 
NAP meeting that was planned to recommend 
projects for ministerial support for the 2014/15 has 
10 
been rescheduled from December 2013 to February 
2014 to allow a turn by turn meeting between the 
Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, 
National 
Treasury, 
Provincial 
Department 
of 
Agriculture and Provincial Treasuries which I hope 
you will prioritise.” 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now this is a letter that came from the DG 
in your department and it was directed to the CEO of the Provincial 
Treasury in the Free State Province Provincial Treasury. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the date of this letter is the 3 r d 
December 2013. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the apron strings were cut on this 
date?  The money was withdrawn? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 114 of 163 
 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   The money was withdrawn but it was withdrawn 
already in August Chair after the visit.  Here the Director General was 
responding to the requests or the question that was asked by the 
Provincial Treasury whether – to confirm whether we are still in support 
of the project or not.  So the Director General was now just putting the 
record straight to say not – we are not. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the clear message to them was you did 
not comply with the conditions that were set, is that correct?  We asked 
you to correct certain matters you did not do so by the deadline that we 
had given you and for this reason we are now going to confirm that we 
10 
are not giving this money for this financial year. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Were there any other engagements after 
this letter was written and after the money was withdrawn? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Yes Chair.  When we wrote the back to office 
report we made the report also available to the province and requested 
a meeting to try and find ways of supporting the province in meeting the 
expectation as stated in the letter.  So the offer to provide additional 
technical support by the province was also not accepted or responded 
to. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are there any other matters you would like 
to explain to the Chairman as you conclude your evidence?  I say this 
possibly because the Chairman might be interested in – in the kinds of 
partnerships that you would sometimes fund but which partnerships 
were not PPP’s.  The example you gave us during our consultation 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 115 of 163 
 
might give him a sense of where to place this particular “partnership” 
that Estina entered into with the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development please. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Yes Chair.  We have had communities with 
arable land which is big enough to be commercialised but they will not 
necessarily have the skill nor the capital to put or to tap into that 
opportunity. So they will identify a private partner and get into an 
agreement with a private partner to develop their land as a commercial 
entity.  And what they – because they do not necessarily have the skill, 
you do not have the capital but they have land the technical partner will 
10 
then develop a full comprehensive business plan and together with the 
community approach the department.  In this instance it would be the 
Provincial Department and the Provincial Department would love the 
proposed project and it is in line with our objectives and imperatives 
and that support will then happen on that.  But we will agree to support 
that type of a project by putting up their required infrastructure.  One of 
such projects which was a partnership between the community and the 
private entity which was not necessarily a PPP was the support to 
[indistinct] macadamia in the Eastern Cape.  So the evidence leader 
was asking if we have had other partnerships that we have supported 
20 
beyond this and we gave that type of an example.  In this instance the 
partnership was not initiate by the department.  The partners came to 
the department to say we have this opportunity could you help and the 
assets that you establish and the land is part of the contribution of the 
community.  And then… 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 116 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you are saying the farmers themselves 
along with their investor partners would approach the department? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And say we have got [indistinct], 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have got equity here.  We have 
brought the land or whatever it might be. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Here are people we are working with but 
we need your support. 
10 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To scale this operation of ours. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct.  And in this instance you will 
see what is the rand value that the partner is bringing on the table plus 
their skill and they would also do a lot of lobbying for additional funding 
from other sources just including the banks just to support and we 
would join in too – ensure that we turn that land into a commercial 
asset of that community. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But that of course was a very different 
model to what happened with the Estina model where an implementing 
20 
agent was appointed by the Department and the rest followed. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is correct Chair.  And probably as we 
would be guided by National Treasury that is why they then informed us 
that that is a model that is fully in line with what they have prescribed 
as a PPP. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 117 of 163 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Excellent.  Anything else you would like to 
share with the Chairman? 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:   That is it Chair.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I have no further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much for coming to share what 
you know with the commission.  We appreciate it.  Should there – 
should a need arise we will ask you to come back but thank you very 
much and for now you are excused.

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman we now have Ms – Advocate 
Molefe presenting the evidence of Mr Theron.  We have an interpreter 
to assist Mr Theron.  If we may have a five minute adjournment 
Chairman so that the interpreter could be sworn in and so the witness 
can take his seat in the witness stand.  It is a short witness Chairman 
we will not be very long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will – it is about three minutes to three.  We will 
take – we will resume at ten past.  I will add another seven minutes.  
20 
We will resume at ten past so we will – I will swear in the wit – the 
interpreter and then at ten past we rusume. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As the court – as the Chairman pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.

me. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the contents contained in this affidavit as 
we have understood you gave evidence in Afrikaans? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  The statement is in English. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja.

Please take out the U. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  So would …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Would the correct spelling be C-O-R-N-E-L-I-
S? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  Are there any other further 
corrections you wish to make?

Page 122 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes Chair.  I refer 
to paragraphs 4, six, eight, nine, 17 and 18.  My employer’s name was 
spelt incorrectly.  It is Neuman but the correct spelling is N-E-U-M-A-N.  
Please correct it like that. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Mr Theron.  Do you now …? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is all - that is

statement? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Pardon. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Do you confirm the correctness of your

MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject to those corrections? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you.  Mr Theron please tell the Chair 
what you currently do for a living? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Chair I am - I am a 
retired dairy farmer and for the last four years I am an estate agent in 
the town of Memel. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And where do you stay? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  I stay in Memel. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 123 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Do you have any experience relative to the 
dairy farming industry? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Chair I was a dairy 
farmer myself for 34 years and for six years I was a dairy manager for 
the Neuman Farming Enterprising. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who is Mr Neuman? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  It was my employer. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And where was Mr Neuman’s farm located? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Halfway between 
Memel and Vrede. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did Mr Neuman won this farm or was he 
leasing it? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well he - he owns 
about 30 000 hectares in that area.  So that is - that was his own farm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And how large was this farm 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  30 000 hectares. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What expertise if any Mr Theron would be 
required in managing a dairy farm? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON: 
 
Well 
good 
discipline, good knowledge for feeding the cows, seeing to their health 
20 
and very important is to manage the labour. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you repeat that again please?  To 
manage … 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON: 
 
(Intervenes) 
to 
manage the labour. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 124 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what factors would you consider to be 
key in a dairy farm? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well I think the 
biggest factor is the bottom line is whether you are making as profit or 
not. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And would things such as water, irrigation be 
quite key in a dairy farm? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes.  Water is life.  
Water means production of feed which is a key element in producing 
milk.  Yes.  You cannot go without water. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay.  Can we then turn to page 2 of your 
statement starting at paragraph 6 thereof?  You narrate events that 
took place in or around the middle of the year 2012.  Is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please tell the Chair what happened 
during this time? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON: 
 
Chair 
I 
was 
approached by my employer that we will have a visit from a delegation 
from the new project Vrede Dairy Project and they wanted to see how 
we are doing things because we were a - a model dairy farm in the 
20 
Vrede area and they wanted to see how we are doing things … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  And that day there 
arrived about 20 people on the farm.  Four of which was from the 
municipality and plus/minus 16 was from an Estina dairy company from 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 125 of 163 
 
India. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I just go back to what you said?  You 
said that you were informed by your employer? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Is this Mr Neuman? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did he tell you who contacted him? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  He did not tell you? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay.  Then you have just told the Chair that 
on that day there was a delegation of people who went to the farm.  
Which farm would this be? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  It was the farm of 
my - my employer Mr Neuman and he ordered me to show the people 
around of how we are - were doing things. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And why were you requested to show people 
how you were doing things? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Because I was 
acknowledged as a great expert - expert on dairy farming due to my 
20 
long … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Experience. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Long time doing 
dairy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 126 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  And he - they - they 
expect me to know everything and to show - show the people how we 
are doing things? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Mr Theron can I ask you to just move your 
mic a bit forward.  Apparently there is technical issues because you are 
too close.  That is better.  Thank you very much.  So these people who 
came to the farm who were you told these people were? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well I was told that 
it was a delegation from the Estina Dairy Company from India and also 
from the Vrede Municipality. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what did you do in relation to this 
request of showing them how things are done?  As you have put it at 
Mr Neuman’s dairy farm. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja.  Well they 
arrived in their cars.  Mostly Mercedes Benz’s and I showed them 
around on the farm.  From rearing the calves, the milking process itself 
and where the cows were in the camps.  Feeding - where they were fed. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You earlier mentioned that there were four 
persons from the municipality.  Did I get that correctly? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct your 
20 
honour. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who were these persons? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  The one was the 
Mayor Mr John Motaung and the other three I cannot remember but they 
were related to the Municipality. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 127 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I confirm the spelling of Motaung as you 
have it at paragraph 7 of your statement?  Is that M-O-T-A-U-N-G? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what role did Mr Motaung play in this 
meeting? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well he did not 
show much interest but just strolling around with us.  I was a bit 
disappointing about his understanding of the dairy business. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who was leading this delegation that 
visited the farm? 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well as I - it is a 
long time ago but I - as I remember it was the vet and I have forgotten 
his name.  The vet from India as well as Mr Prasad. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  When you say the vet from India is the Chair 
to understand that the vet was of Indian decent? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct 
Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  From India? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you say as far as you recall Mr Prasad 
20 
was also present? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And the other people in the delegation you 
have told the Chair about 20 people having visited the farm.  Is that 
correct? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 128 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Of the 20 you say about four were officials 
including Mr John Motaung.  Is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  That leaves on my count about 16 people 
being present.  Is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And from that 16 you say that someone who 
was the vet was present? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you do not recall his or her name? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Was the person male or female? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Pardon. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Was the vet male or female? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Male? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in addition to the vet you say possibly 
Mr Prasad? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who were the remaining people of the 
20 
delegation? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well it was Indians 
and I - I cannot remember their names.  It is impossible to just - 16 
people and remember their names.  I - I am not that good. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  If we turn to paragraph 7 of your statement 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 129 of 163 
 
which is on page 2 of that bundle you make a comment about your 
observations relative to the Indian delegation.  Is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you please tell your - the Chair about 
your observations in this respect? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Can you repeat 
your question Chair? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  I will do so.  At - are you at paragraph 7 … 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Of your statement?  You are - you make a 
10 
comment about your observation relative to the Indian delegation.  Is 
that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And can you please tell the Chair what you 
observed in respect of the Indian delegation? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well during our visit 
to the farm you could - I mentioned that some of these people stick 
together and the other going on their own way.  That is why I 
understand it that they were - some were from India and the other not. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  So when you say some were from India and 
20 
the others were not how were you able to draw this distinction that you 
have just made between those you say were from India and those you 
say were not from India? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well I - I have 
judged them on the questions - the type of questions they asked me.  I 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 130 of 163 
 
have seen that the - the people from India was well experienced in 
dairy farming and the other not. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What in your opinion was the vet’s 
experience relative to dairy farming? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well I could he 
knows something about the dairy but he was not an expert and that he 
was not used to the situation in South Africa and especially in the Free 
State.  Everything was new for him.  The diseases etcetera and the 
feeding circumstances. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  I am sorry.  Can you please repeat that 
10 
again? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well it was clear to 
me that the vet was not used to the circumstances in the Free State 
comparing to that in India because in India you have a tropical climate 
which is much different from the dry nearly arid climate in the Free 
State.  So should different - be - be different. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay.  So when you were showing this 
delegation how you were operating at Mr Neuman’s farm the Chair is to 
understand that you were doing a walkabout.  Is this correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And how long did this last? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  It lasted for about 
two hours. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now if a person does not have experience in 
managing a dairy farm would the walkabout be sufficient in equipping 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 131 of 163 
 
them to manage a dairy farm? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No Chair.  That is 
totally impossible.  Just to mention one example.  To AI - to - to do an 
AI Course on - on an animal will take you about a week and to … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And what is … 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  And to … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And can I just interrupt what is an AI Course? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON: 
 
Artificial 
insemination. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Please continue. 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  And to learn about 
feeding the right stuff to cows is about a three year university degree.  
So in two hours you cannot become a professional and just walking 
through a farm but it will give you an idea. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  What then happened after you gave them the 
walk - after the walkabout at Mr Neuman’s dairy far? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well the - the 
delegation left but about a month later I was contacted by 
Mr Ashok Narayan … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  And he asked me to 
come to Johannesburg.  They want to speak further to him - to give him 
further advice and consulting them in erecting dairy project at Vrede. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can I refer you to paragraph 10 of your 
statement and that appears from page 3 of that bundle?  You have just 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 132 of 163 
 
told the Chair that it was about a month later.  Is this a month later 
from the visit at the farm? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And you say you were contacted by Mr Ashok 
and is the spelling there N-A-R-A-Y-A-N at chapter - pardon me.  At 
paragraph 10 of your statement the spelling of Mr Ashok’s surname? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You said he contacted you.  How did he 
contact you? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  By phone. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what did he say? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  He told me that 
they want to continue with the project but they need some expert advice 
in planning the whole project. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  When he said they do you recall who he was 
referring to? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well I was under 
the impression that he spoke for the Estina Group. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and did he tell you where this meeting 
would take place? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes.  He gave me 
an address in Saxonwold where I should meet him at 9 o’ clock that 
morning. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did he tell you who would be attending 
the meeting? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 133 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes.  He told me 
that my employer Mr Neuman would also be attending. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Now if you turn again to paragraph 10 
of your statement.  You speak about urgency.  Is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja.  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Can you explain to the Chair what this 
urgency you speak of was about? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Chair as I - I 
understood it - understood it, it was about the largeness of the project.  
I mean R1 billion to be spent on a dairy project is enormous and I think 
10 
they themselves become afraid of the enormity of the project and they - 
they - that is why it was so urgent. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Is that what was said to you? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No that was my - 
what I … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assessment? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Afleiding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your assessment? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja.  That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  So Mr Narayan calls you and he asks 
you to meet him in Johannesburg and he says that this meeting will 
take place - place in Saxonwold.  Is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 134 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did he say where in Saxonwold? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes.  They gave me 
a street address.  I cannot remember the address anymore. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  So after this conversation over the 
phone with Mr Narayan what then happened? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well me - I - I 
reported it to my employer that they invited me to go there and he said 
to me that he wanted to go with me … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and … 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  And we discussed 
10 
the project between us and we thought ah.  Here as a - as the boere 
says.  When it rains pap you must skep.  That is the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that.  Please just repeat that. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  As the boere said - 
it is a saying.  When it rains pap you must skep. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  We realised the 
enormity of this project and thought ah now we can sell our cows at a - 
at a huge price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was an opportunity? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  So you have this discussion with 
Mr Neuman.  You are in agreement that there is an opportunity for you 
to sell your cattle? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 135 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did you accept Mr Narayan’s meeting 
invite? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And did you go to Saxonwold at the address 
provided to you by Mr Narayan? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And how soon after the telephone call with 
Mr Narayan did you go to Saxonwold? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well that was about 
10 
a week. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Can you recall whether the property at 
which this meeting was to take place was an office or a residential 
property? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No.  I was not 
aware whether it was either of them but when I arrived there I saw that 
it was the residential property. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and what happened when you arrived at 
the property? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well I never in my 
20 
life have seen such security - security at the gate as well in the parking 
area.  When I stopped, there was three guards escorting me to the 
house. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes and were they expecting you? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes.  They took me 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 136 of 163 
 
straight to Mr Ashok Narayan. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Is - so you drive to the property.  You are met 
by about three security personnel at the gate and they take you to 
Mr Narayan inside the premises? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you …? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did you see …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you drive together with your employer 
or separately? 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No.  We - we went 
separately Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So you arrived on your own? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair and you were then taken to 
Mr Narayan? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did you meet anyone else other than 
Mr Narayan? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Did you know whose property the meeting at 
which you had gone belonged? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well we were not 
informed but I - at that stage I thought it would a property of Estina … 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 137 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Because that is the 
only name whichever was mentioned to me. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  So you then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say you were not informed? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja.  Of which 
property it was.  No, I was not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose property it was? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not informed? 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but you thought it must be … 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Estina’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Estina’s? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  So you are then met by 
Mr Narayan.  Has Mr Neuman arrived at this point? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well he arrived 
about an hour later. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Okay.  So what then happens after you are 
met by Mr Narayan? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well we tried to 
identify the - the purpose of the meeting and/or the agenda and we - 
because we cannot give advice if we do not how - know how the things 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 138 of 163 
 
sticking into each other and then Mr Ashok Narayan told us that he was 
sort of mediator between Estina, the Vrede Municipality and the 
Department of Agriculture of the Free State and that he pertinently told 
us that Mr Ace Magashule was involved and that was a key project for 
him to be pushed through … 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now you … 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON: 
 
And 
it 
should 
succeed. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes.  Is that what he said? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Now just at the outset of this meeting what 
was your understanding of Mr Narayan’s role in respect of Estina? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well he was very 
serious about the whole project and I - I could see that he was nervous 
Chair.  That he should succeed. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the question is whether you were able to tell 
what his role was in Estina.  Whether he was a manager of Estina, a 
director or what it was. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No.  He was just a - 
20 
just a representative your honour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just a representative? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  But a mediator 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 139 of 163 
 
between the three major role players in this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So you - you did not understand him to 
be part of Estina but you understood him to be from outside Estina but 
appointed as a representative of Estina? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  You also made mention of your understanding 
of Mr Narayan’s role and I use the word “mediator” in quoting you.  Now 
in relation to Mr Ace Magashule what was your understanding of 
10 
Mr Narayan’s relationship with Mr Magashule? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Well Chair I came 
under the impression that Mr Narayan was very nervous every time we 
talk about Mr Ace Magashule and he was not able to put all the cards 
on the table.  He kept them close to his breast.  So - and that - that 
makes us a bit suspicious about the whole project. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  So what was the purpose of this meeting? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  The purpose was 
from me and my employer’s side to advice and consult - be consultants 
for the project.  To get off the ground and to be implemented 
20 
successfully. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And in advising and consulting were you told 
who you would be engaging with in your role as advisors and 
consultants - to use your words? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Yes.  He - Mr Ashok 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 140 of 163 
 
referred me at the end of this meeting to the vet.  That vet from India 
which name I cannot recall now and a student - a young student which 
came with him. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  And who were these people introduced as? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  Pardon. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Who – you speak of the vet, correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   You also speak of a young student. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   The vet that you refer to is it the same vet 
10 
you met in Free State during the walkabout? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct 
Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And you also speak of a young student, is 
that correct. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Who was this young student introduced as? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   As I understood it 
at the time they wanted to appoint him as manager of the whole project. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And did they tell you what his experience is 
20 
in farming? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes, they didn’t tell 
me but I could see at that stage he had no experience of dairy of that – 
so big a dairy, he wasn’t experienced, he did not have enough 
experience to manage such a big project. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 141 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And was there any discussion around what 
the nature of his experience is? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Not specifically but 
in our discussions it came out that he knows nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you say you could tell that he did not have 
experience that is based on the discussion you had with him? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   And the vet yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the vet, ja, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   So you meet at the property you have 
10 
described as being located in Saxonwold, you meet with Mr Narayan 
and you say that Mr Newman joins an hour later, is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct yes. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And how long was your meeting with Mr 
Narayan before you started speaking to the vet and the young 
gentleman you speak of? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well our 
conversation with Mr Ashok Narayan was about three hours, from nine 
to twelve. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, and did you and Mr Narayan come to 
20 
any agreement? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes, as I told you 
before we tried to sell our, we saw the opportunity to sell our cattle at a 
good price, and he told us no they are not interested. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And you earlier said that he had sought 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 142 of 163 
 
advice and consulting assistance from you relative to dairy farming, 
was that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   So after meeting with Mr Narayan was it Mr 
Narayan who then introduced you to the vet and the young man at the 
same meeting? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No that was a 
different meeting. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   But was it at the same property? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   At the same 
10 
property. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   On the same day? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   On the same day, 
the meeting with Mr Narayan was in the dining room, the meeting with 
the vet was on the stoep. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, and what did you discuss between 
yourself and the vet as well as the young gentleman who you say you 
were told would be managing the dairy farm. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, they told us 
they want to milk a thousand cows, so they asked me what 
20 
infrastructure they should need to milk a thousand cows, what the feed, 
how much feed they need, how the follow-flow should look and how – 
what diseases are in the area, which they should be aware of. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   When you say that they said they wanted to 
milk a thousand cows what was the frequency, would this be a thousand 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 143 of 163 
 
cows daily or how frequent did they intend to milk these cows? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well twice a day a 
thousand. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   So that would be ...[intervenes]  
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   A thousand cows 
milked twice a day. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Milked twice a day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is that normal – is that frequency in milking cows 
quite – every month? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, sometimes you 
10 
can go to three times milking but then it’s – that is very hard work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   It is very hard work, so but it depends as long 
as the cows have got the milk then you can milk them two or three 
times a day. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, Chair a cow is 
producing milk continuously, every minute she is producing milk, but if 
you add another milking there is more space in the udder and then she 
can produce more milk, there’s space to produce more milk, but when 
the udder is full she produces less. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you.   So they told you about their 
intentions and what do you and Mr Newman say? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well we realised 
that is quite a big operation because a normal dairy in the Vrede area 
is about 80 cows big.  So that – this was an enormous dairy to be 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 144 of 163 
 
erected. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And was there any advice that you shared 
with them at this meeting? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, I told them the 
biggest problem was to produce enough feed for the cows and to buy in 
as little as possible because a dairy cow needs very refined food, 
either pastures or lucern or alfalfa which should be bought in, and the 
Vrede area the only thing growing there is mealies and grass, so I 
questioned their decision to establish the dairy in the Vrede area, 
because most of the Free State farmers or a lot of them have already 
10 
moved down to the Coast, the Southern Cape or Natal where to produce 
milk is much cheaper, so there was a question raised by my why in 
Vrede.  That was according to me I think it was a stupid decision to 
produce milk in the most difficult area in the country, for such a big 
project. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, so after having this conversation with 
them what was your impression about the vet and the young 
gentleman’s understanding of the importance of climates in dairy 
farming? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well they were 
20 
quite surprised when I told them about the climate, they didn’t expect 
it, because they were used to India’s plenty of rain there, and not the 
harsh winters we have here in the Free State, so I thought there 
awaited a surprise for them, and I think they realised that. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And did they share with you how they 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 145 of 163 
 
became involved in the project? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Sorry I don’t 
understand your question? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Did they tell you how they became involved 
in the dairy project? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well as I 
understood it they were involved in Estina’s projects in India. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Okay, and how did the meeting conclude how 
did it end? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well after I told 
10 
them about the diseases in the area we covered about everything in the 
management of the dairy and they were satisfied and we concluded it. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Now having spoken to them over a couple of 
hours as you have said what was your impression on their capabilities 
or expertise in running and managing a dairy farm in the Vrede area? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well I realised they 
were in for a big surprise. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Okay. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   And I was proved 
right because a lot of their animals died after they bought in, about six 
20 
months after they bought in quite expensive animals and good animals 
they start dying due to diseases they did not understand. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, so still at this meeting in Saxonwold 
you’ve had a discussion with Narayan, you have also had a discussion 
with the vet as well as a young Indian man.  Did you meet anyone else 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 146 of 163 
 
at the property? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No that was the 
only people. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Did you then leave after your meeting? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes but as agreed 
with Mr Ashok he paid me for consulting fees as well as for my 
travelling fees. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And when did you agree with Mr Narayan on 
these fees? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   When he first 
10 
phoned me to tell me that they need me for consulting I told him, then 
we agreed around the amount. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when he invited you to come to this meeting Mr 
Narayan told you that the purpose was for him to consult you on 
matters relating to this project, he told you? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes that is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and what – why did he say, did he say why he 
needed your employer to be there as well? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No he didn’t tell 
me that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He didn’t say but he said your employer would come 
along as well? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, that’s correct. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 147 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the discussion that you had with your employer 
after this the two of you realised that there could be an opportunity to 
sell your cattle to them? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now the discussions that happened between you 
and Mr Narayan at this residence did it involve your employer 
throughout after he had arrived or was there some discussion before he 
arrived and he just joined in on the way? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No he joined in 
from the beginning of the meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not start the meeting, that is you and Mr 
Narayan immediately after you had arrived, because you said your 
employer came about an hour later? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not start discussing you waited for him? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not wait? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not start? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well we started 
20 
having tea ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You talked but the real stuff, not the real business? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s right, the 
serious meeting starts when my employer arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   Okay but basically the meeting was used for Mr 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 148 of 163 
 
Narayan to get advice on various aspects of the project and running a 
dairy in Vrede? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair.   Mr Theron you earlier 
made mention to an amount of one billion rand is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Where do you get this amount from? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   At that meeting 
where me and my employer was, attended, Mr Ashok Narayan told us 
10 
because we asked him where will the money come from for this project, 
but what was the sense in discussing it if there is no money available 
and he confirmed to us that Estina will put down 300million and 
700million will come from the Government for the project. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, and at paragraph 14 of your statement 
on page 3 you give your opinion on or share your views on this amount 
of R1billion, can you please tell the Chair about your views in respect? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja Chair one 
billion rand is a lot of money and at that time around 2012 a lot of dairy 
farmers went out of production because it was no more profitable and 
20 
to put down a dairy and starting off a dairy was to an amount of 
R30million about more or less, so we could not understand why, what 
the motive of Estina was and the whole Group, was it to produce milk, 
to get milk, or was it to put emerging farmers on the ground. 
 
If it was to produce milk this was the wrong option, and too 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 149 of 163 
 
expensive, they rather could fund existing dairy farmers, commercial 
farmers to get the milk if that was their motive.  So I don’t think they 
were quite sure of their own motives. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Then paragraph 17 and 18 of your statement 
as it appears at page 4 of the bundle you set out what appears to be 
you and Mr Newman’s interest in the project.  You have earlier – is that 
correct – you have earlier told the Chair that you saw an opportunity to 
sell cattle to Estina, is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And at what cost were you anticipating to 
10 
sell cattle to Estina? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well at that time 
the going price of dairy cattle was about R8 000 depending on the 
quality but we thought we could go up – maybe we could get R12 000 a 
cow. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   That you would sell it for R12 000 a cow? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, because at that 
stage we thought that was a good price. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   I understood you to say that the cows that 
you intended to sell were selling at approximately R8 000 at that time, 
20 
is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct but 
we aimed for a bit more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was raining? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Oh I see. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 150 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was raining. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair.   And paragraph 18 of your 
statement still on the same page you then speak to the supplier of plant 
and – dairy plant, pardon me, and equipment, is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can you please tell the Chair what it is you 
set out in that respect? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Chair we see 
another possibility of making a few rands, and knowing what expensive 
10 
machinery they needed at the project we told the ...[indistinct] or the 
agents of the people who is putting in the machines, the suppliers of 
the machines and the storage tanks that there is an opportunity they 
can get business and they were so thankful they told us they will give 
us one percent of the pressure cost for putting in the machinery, and 
that was about R6million and me and Mr Newman received each R30 
000, that was R60 000. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
when 
you 
couldn’t 
use 
the 
opportunity 
successfully with the cows you used it with the equipment? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s correct 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing) okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And can you recall what type of equipment or 
machine you had recommended to be sold by Alfa Laval to Estina? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well Chair our 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 151 of 163 
 
recommendation was to put in a 30  point rotary milking machine to milk 
that amount of cows and the storage a thousand cows should give you 
about 30 000 litres of milk per day so you need storage capacity of 
about 60 000 litres and that was what we recommended. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And how much did this machine cost? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   The machine cost 
about – well all the equipment cost about R6million. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And would that be the fair market value? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes, that would be 
the fair market value. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   You also told the Chair that yourself and Mr 
Newman each received R30 000? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And you received this R30 000 from who? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   From the supplier 
of the equipment. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And is one to understand this to be in 
relation to recommending them to Estina? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, that’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   As a spotter’s fee? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, that’s correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Right, then at paragraph 19 of your 
statement, still on page 4 of your bundle you set out what happened 
some few months later, is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja that is correct. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 152 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Please tell the Chair what happened. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Can you repeat 
your question please? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Please tell the Chair what happened as you 
have set it out at paragraph 19 of your statement. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Oh, paragraph 19.  
Chair again I see an opportunity in my career to be part of this big 
project and maybe become manager, I have identified an opportunity, 
so I went to Mr Prassad, he was the office manager in Vrede and told 
him that I was willing to help them in managing the project.  At that 
10 
stage it was the stage when the cattle started dying on the farm and I 
felt that my services would be appreciated there, and that they did not 
manage.  So I was honest in offering my services to them, but they 
were very sensitive at that stage of the cattle dying, so they chased me 
away. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Did – before speaking to Mr Prassad, and 
after your meeting at Saxonwold did you speak to anyone in respect of 
the dairy project?   Did you – let me rephrase my question, pardon me 
Mr Theron, after your meeting at Saxonwold did you hear form Mr 
Narayan again? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No, from Mr 
Narayan? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well I phoned him 
about managing, helping them managing the project and he was very 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 153 of 163 
 
sensitive and he referred me to Mr Prassad.   
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   When you say he was very sensitive what do 
you mean? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well I get the 
impression that he was not in control and he referred it to Mr Prassad. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And is that the reason you went to see Mr 
Prassad? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And you say Mr Prassad – you again used 
the word sensitive? 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   What did Mr Prassad say to you? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No he just closed 
the door in my face.  He was very harsh to me. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes and you have just told the Chair that 
that this was during the time when the cattle started dying? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Then at paragraph 20 of your statement, in 
fact before moving onto paragraph 20 did you do anything else in 
relation to the Vrede Dairy Project? 
20 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No, I did not do 
anything else? 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Then if we move to paragraph 20 of your 
statement, that is on page 5, you speak about Mr John Motaung is that 
correct? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 154 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   What is it that you are telling the Chair 
about Mr John Motaung? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Chair in Vrede it 
was general knowledge, or as they say down the grapevine you get the 
information, down the grapevine that Mr Motaung received a brand new 
black 450 Mercedes ML for his part, his role-playing to arrange the 
Krynaauwslust Farm on a 99 year lease for Estina but I have never 
seen the car, and nobody told me it firsthand, that was common 
knowledge in the discussions there in town. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   So you do not have personal knowledge of 
that? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No, no. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Then the last ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, it was a rumour? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it a rumour? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Chair.  Then the last issue that 
20 
you have dealt with in your statement relates to the termination of the 
lease of Mr Newman’s farm and that you deal with at paragraph 8 of 
your statement, so you might just have to turn a few pages back, that is 
page 2.   Is that correct? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 155 of 163 
 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   What knowledge do you have about the 
termination of the lease? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well my knowledge 
is that the project people become desperate to get the land the farm 
Krynaauwslust to initiate the dairy project. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Which people? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well it was Estina, 
all the role-players, and they put a lot of pressure on Mr Motaung as 
Mayor of Vrede to get rid of the Newmans from the – to get them out of 
the contract, the lease contract. 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something you have personal knowledge of or 
is that ...[intervenes]  
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes, yes, I 
personally attended the meetings between Mr Newman and Mr Motaung. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   In Mr Newman’s 
house, in his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   I attended it 
20 
personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it Mr Motaung who was telling Mr Newman 
about the pressure.  
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well actually he 
begged him to be kind and for the sake of the project to get rid of the 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 156 of 163 
 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Can you recall whether there was just one 
meeting or more than one meeting? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   There was about 
three meetings. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   And what was discussed at the three 
meetings. 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   At the three 
meetings it was all basically the same, to get rid of the lease contract. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes, and what knowledge do you have about 
the subsequent termination of the lease? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well actually I do 
not understand your question. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   After those meetings do you know what then 
eventually happened? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well my employer 
was sympathetic against the project and he said well he will let go his 
20 
contract and cancelled the contract. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say anything about how he would be 
compensated by the municipality or anybody for losing out on the 
balance of the period of the lease? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 157 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No he did not 
insist on any compensation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not insist on any? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That was just a 
gesture of goodwill. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Mr Theron, is there anything else 
you wish to bring to the Chair’s attention about this project? 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No I think this was 
like tapping  blood out of a stone, there is nothing else I can mention. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   Thank you Mr Theron.   Chair we have no 
further questions for Mr Theron. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   You said you took – you said this was a 
stupid project to be done in Vrede, just elaborate on that, tell me why 
you say that? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well Chair lots of 
farmers stopped their dairy operations in the Free State, from Heilbron 
right through Vrede, Harrismith, Bethlehem, Ficksburg because it was 
20 
not paying anymore.  It was too expensive to produce food for the 
cattle here, and the milk price as too low.  The ratio from milk price and 
food price was not right, so they are moving down to the coastal areas, 
Natal and Southern Cape, Tsitsikamma and there they survive and 
making huge successes, so that was making me raising my eyebrows.   
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 158 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is the reason why you say it was not wise to have 
this project in Vrede simply that the – it was difficult to produce milk 
profitably because the price was not ...[intervenes]  
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   The price ratio. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The price ratio was not ...[intervenes]  
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   In balance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, there was no balance.   Mr Thabethe who was the 
Head of Department of the Department of Agriculture in the Free State 
Government at the time, I don’t  know if you ever met him, you know of 
him? 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, he says he testified here and said the only reason 
why other farmers had moved out of Vrede or had stopped producing 
milk in that place, in that area, was that there was a problem with the 
transport, transporting milk, the costs, and he mentioned the price as 
well, maybe that’s the balance you are talking about that there was no 
balance between the cost and what you get. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but he said they thought they thought they would 
address that problem by the intervention of government because you 
20 
see he was saying in effect if you are a farmer you are producing milk 
and there is this challenge of the transport cost and the price and you 
are on your own that might be difficult, but if you are going to – if 
Government is going to come in and assist in one way or another you 
might be able to continue, what do you say to that? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 159 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No Chair, the idea 
of processing your own product to add value to your own product that is 
a very good idea.  If that succeed then the project could be successful.  
The cost of transportation, the argument of transportation is not for me 
a good argument, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   The argument from 
Mr Thabethe that the transportation cost is the main problem is not 
correct because these days people transport milk from Cape Town up to 
Johannesburg, from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg, that is not really a 
10 
problem, but where Government could have played a role was in 
creating a market for that value added products, that would solve the 
problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How would they create the market as far as you 
understand ...[intervenes]  
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Well as I see it 
with Government contracts ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would hospitals buy this milk or something like that? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct, 
Government institutions could buy the milk. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would have solved the problem. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Schools, School 
Feeding Schemes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Could be a 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 160 of 163 
 
solution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that could have dealt with the problem of the 
imbalance. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja, because our 
people needs protein, especially our children and Government could 
take initiative there and produce people with good food. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, now you say in your statement you have been 
involved in dairy farming for at least 40 years, is that right? 
10 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, these 40 years all within the Free State or in 
different parts of the country? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   No half of it were 
in Natal, Northern Natal, and the other half was in the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Free State. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are quite knowledgeable. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I see also that you do have a BCom degree, 
is that right? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you got from the University of the Free State in 
1976? 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 161 of 163 
 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   That is correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it involved, did it have anything to do with 
farming? 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Yes.  I have done 
agricultural economics as one of my subjects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  No thank you very much.  Ms Molefe is 
there anything? 
10 
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:   No Chair, there is nothing, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing.  Thank you very much Mr Theron for coming 
forward to give evidence. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We appreciate it very much, you are excused. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you Chairman.   Chairman this is 
just a request that you confirm the dates on which Ms Rockman will be 
appearing before the Commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and we said 16 and 17? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I previously said that Ms Rockman would give 
evidence on the 14 t h and 15 t h of October and I said that was 
provisional.  The final dates are now 16 and 17 October.  Closer to the 
08 OCTOBER 2019 – DAY 179 
 
Page 162 of 163 
 
date I will indicate whether we will start at normal time or at another 
time and Ms Rockman and her lawyers can be informed at that time, 
next week. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then Mr Thabethe? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   All indications Chairman are that the 28 t h 
of October is the preferred date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Ms Buthelezi has been trying to sort that 
out for us while we have been here and that is what she has texted 
10 
back to us.
