PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 11 MAY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Soni, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Montana.   
MR MONTANA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the oath you took yesterday will 
continue today Mr Montana – will continue to apply.  Okay.  
Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  Chairperson 
10 
you will recall we adjourned yesterday after Mr Montana had 
made parts or had made the affidavit in the Siyangena 
matter available to us.   
We just wanted to check if there is anything there 
that would affect the line of questioning for now obviously 
we will admit that document at the correct stage but for now 
may I proceed with where we left off on the questioning 
yesterday Chairperson? 
MR MONTANA:  Ja that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  And we will admit the relevant documents at 
20 
the right time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  Mr Montana I am 
going to try and keep an eye maybe more than I have done 
before today to making sure that you – you are able to 
answer the question first even if you have some elaboration 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 4 of 343 
 
but if the question is wide the answer starts with the reason 
is and then you can explain or if it is what or where then the 
place is this or the time was what.  Okay let us start. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  Mr Montana 
can I please again refer you to Bundle G and this is page 
198.  This you will recall is where the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is PRASA Bundle G? 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
PRASA 
Bundle 
G 
as 
you 
please 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  This is an annexure to Mr Loubser’s 
affidavit it is SS16 and it is page 198 where Mr Van Der 
Walt was itemising the payments he made in respect of the 
Parkwood property.  Page 198 Mr Montana.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The handwritten 198.   
MR MONTANA:  I got it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright so yesterday you will recall we were 
dealing with different sub-paragraphs of – paragraph 2.2 
and we had gone up to 2.2.4 that is the amount of 
R400 000.00 that was paid on the 24 t h of July 2014.  You 
20 
confirm that? 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair I note – I note there the – I know 
the statement. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 5 of 343 
 
ADV SONI SC:  I am just a bit concerned when you say you 
note the statement.  You see what I am putting to you is we 
have a letter from Mr Van Der Walt in which he says in 
respect of Parkwood property he made these various 
payments to you.  Now are you simply saying you note it of 
do you say you received those payments either in your own 
bank account or he paid somebody whom you asked him to 
pay? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I can only note I said yesterday it is 
like Chair somebody giving me your statement and say 
10 
answer the question.  I do not know the details of the 
statement because it has got nothing to do with me.   
So I can only note and I think let – I think that let us 
be fair I am – how am I expected to answer about the 
statement of somebody else?  What we know here Chair is 
that I sold a property for R6.8 to Mr Van Der Walt and he – 
and I have confirmed that he paid me R6.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now that R6.8 did not even come into my 
account. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But it was paid in different ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  With my own instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 6 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:  Now what we have before us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Not asking me about that.  You know Chair 
I mean let us be fair I came here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  When I came here I was told that I stole 
R36 million and brought properties.  I am here.  This story 
about R36 million has now gone away.  Now I can only note 
I do not even know his – Mr Van Der Walt is responding to 
his partners. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think we can make progress what you 
have made what you have just said now is Mr Van Der Walt 
paid you R6.8 million – number 1. 
2. If I understand you correctly none of – no part of that – 
no portion of that amount came directly into your bank 
account.  Is that right? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I think the large – the large bulk of 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And that is why I say I do not have access 
to my own accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  But the large bulk – so I remember two – 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 7 of 343 
 
three specific payments that were made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  The first was to the bank for R2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  So it is not reflected here I so not see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  We do not even know from what account it 
was paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:  We know that I have asked him to pay R2 
10 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  For deposit to Hurlingham. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  We do not see that in the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Then there is a third payment of R2.2 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  And then – there are other payments that 
he said to me in an email that it is money that I owed to 
20 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Which I think is in that annexure there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Now I think Chair the – so that I confirm. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 8 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now I look at the statement – this 
statement yesterday.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR MONTANA:  I did a quick calculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  The statement that I think it was 198 and 
earlier one – the longer one version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Now it has got transactions deposits of 
10 
over R30 almost between 30 and 40 million they have got 
nothing to do with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  They have got to do with even other 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Are they here before the commission to 
explain?  Now Chair I think it is really to ask me to ask me 
to answer questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. I… 
20 
MR MONTANA:  About somebody else statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think. 
MR MONTANA:  I can only note I do not know what you are 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I do not know what Mr Soni says – 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 9 of 343 
 
I think that what you are saying is some of that amount of – 
part of that amount of R6.8 may have gone into your 
account. 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the bulk of it on your instructions was 
paid in different amounts to different people or entities. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes for example Chair the first R2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  It goes without saying actually that was not 
even an instruction from me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
It 
is 
the 
property 
that 
had 
to 
be 
transferred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  The bond had to be cancelled in the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MONTANA:  He has to pay that amount first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  And so I – I agree with that Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Now I am saying if – if you say 110 came 
into your account sitting here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Not having my statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 10 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:  Because my account was closed.  That is 
why I requested the commission to – can we ask the bank to 
provide us that so that I can then compare and say that may 
have come into my account I confirm.  So – so when I say I 
note because I cannot confirm or reject Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot admit or dispute. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Well on that basis Mr Montana can I then – 
we will accept what you say – you are saying that you note 
10 
the various payments that Mr Van Der Walt reflects as 
having been paid in respect of the Parkwood property from 
2.2.1 to 2.2.9. 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct Chair ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay so we do not need to go into each 
statement. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I do not think we should but part of 
the issue let me explain.  When Mr Van Der Walt you will 
recall that when Mr Van Der Walt bought the property one of 
the issues that we agreed on there were certain things that 
20 
needed to be done at the house and we agreed that I even 
said to him those are not for my account.   
If you want to restore new things you can do that.  I 
can install them but they are for your account.  Now as I am 
sitting here I am not able to even reconcile any of those 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 11 of 343 
 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So – so I think the only thing that will help 
us is only if we get my statements to do that.  And nothing 
is being put to me Chair about the flow of the R36 million.  
You know Chair I keep on repeating this point.  The whole 
country knows that Montana stole R36 million and bought 
houses.  I am here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I am being asked about somebody else 
10 
account not about what I stole. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I want to answer this commission on those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
MR MONTANA:  So I keep on making that point Chair 
because it is very important to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine Mr Montana.  I think 
the only other issue that should be raised in regard to these 
amounts that are stated here at page 198 to 199 is that you 
are able to remember I one, two or three – it is in respect of 
20 
two or three or so payments that you have recollection of 
your instructions to Mr Van Der Walt as to what he should 
do.  Like the Hurlingham property that some money should 
go there but you cannot remember all of them. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I am – I am saying – actually I do not 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 12 of 343 
 
want to come and say to the commission I do not remember.  
That is not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  That is not the kind of answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  I am simply saying that for now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR MONTANA:  We are dealing with two statements that do 
not belong to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
10 
MR MONTANA:  Now Mr Van Der Walt and I Chair beyond – 
beyond this statement – beyond what has been put before 
me had a relationship on developments.  There is monies 
that have exchanged.  Now I do not even know what these 
relates to.  Now in principle I would say to Mr Soni I am not 
denying that there could have – these payments would have 
been done or even paid to other people on my behalf 
because that is what I said to you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So Chair I am not – Mr Van Der Walt 
20 
bought the property – I think earlier on you said R68 million 
not R6.8 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh R6.8 Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  I think Chair I do not want that amount … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might – you must have been thinking 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 13 of 343 
 
from R36 million to R68 million. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes we – but I would have asked for more 
that you come back Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No if I said R68 million sorry it is R6.8. 
MR MONTANA:  So plain as what I am saying to Mr Soni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I am saying that I am noting this.  It is true 
he may be saying that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But I also realise that Mr Van Der Walt may 
10 
also have made mistakes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  When I look at these in my understanding 
of the thing and I think that he could – he may be including 
all of these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  In relation to what he then told me as a – 
as an amount owing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he said you owed him. 
MR MONTANA:  That I owed to him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  That is what he is saying.  So I am not able 
to say that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think let us put it to bed if we 
can. As I understand it Mr Soni – Mr Montana says he notes 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 14 of 343 
 
these amounts and what Mr Van Der Walt says about them.  
He is not in a position – he is not saying he is disputing 
them. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He – all he is saying is he and Mr Van Der 
Walt 
had 
a 
relationship 
in 
terms 
of 
which 
various 
transactions happened and not just the ones we are talking 
about.  And in respect of this particular property he 
instructed Mr Van Der Walt to make payments out of his 
R6.8 million not R68 million – out of the R6.8 million he 
10 
gave him instructions as to where to pay what amount. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I think … 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  We cannot take it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we can – ja we can take it from 
there. 
ADV SONI SC:  There is one – there are two issues that I 
want to raise with you in regard to the payments.  If you 
look at page 199 you will see at paragraph 2.2.8 he says 
that a payment was made of R2 million on the 20 t h of 
20 
February 2015.  Do you see that Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:  I see that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay now I want you to look at please page 
191 of that bundle.  Keep your hand on this page though 
look at page 199 of that bundle and you will see the fourth 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 15 of 343 
 
last entry on that page.  This is the Precise Trade bank 
account that he has given his partners. 
MR MONTANA:  What page – what page are you on?  191? 
ADV SONI SC:  191.   
MR MONTANA:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  You will see there that on the 20 t h of 
February 2015 in regard to that account there is a 
withdrawal of R2 million.  That is the same day that he says 
he made payment in respect of the Parkwood property. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes and I think that he provides that the 
10 
ERF number which is the property you are talking about. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay I just wanted to make that point. 
MR MONTANA:  So Chair I think that – that may suggest to 
me that that R2 million I mentioned earlier on which is the 
R2 million for the settlement of the – the cancellation of the 
bond. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ja.  Of the Parkwood property? 
MR MONTANA:  Yes remember it was bonded for … 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no I will just – just listen to the 
question please Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Because I understood you to say – please 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 16 of 343 
 
turn to page 190. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now it is the previous page of that bank 
account. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  You look at the first debit on that account 
on the 18 t h of June 2014. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is the R2.25 million you said was in 
respect of the deposit or the bond on that account. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He said may have been I think. 
MR MONTANA:  No, no but also Chair let me clarify.  There 
are three main big item payments that were – that were 
made from the R6.8.   
The first is the R2million because the – I am not 
talking about the dates.  The R2 million is for the 
cancellation on the bond.  Okay.   
The second one is the – is the payment for the – 
sorry there is a R2 million for the payment of the bond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  There is a R2 million deposit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the cancellation. 
MR MONTANA:  To Hurlingham and there is a R2.2 million 
rent to Waterkloof property.  So those are the three 
payments that I spoke about. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 17 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us talk about this I just want to 
make sure that I – you are right.  I think when you answered 
the question in relation to the R2.2 – R2.250 million which 
appears as a second or is it a third transaction on page 190 
yesterday you may have answered in a more definitive way 
that it was for the bond.  But I think later on you 
emphasised that you thought so but you were not definite. 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair let me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or are you definite? 
MR MONTANA:  No let me be definitive Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I am saying the three main items. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  That I can remember vividly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  When the R6.8 – remember Chair when you 
look at my accounts at that time you will not even find the 
R6.8.  That is because they went not in my account.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Usually you will see that this side and that 
20 
side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  The reason why you do not see it is 
precisely it is for one thing because I then asked him so you 
settled the bond – the bond cancellation comes from that 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 18 of 343 
 
amount.  Because I am paying – I am settling the bond.  
The second issue relates – was a R2 million that was paid 
as deposit and I think Chair that the R2 million that is 
mentioned once not twice we do not know where the other 
R2 million is coming from.  So there is a R2 million for the 
bond cancellation, there is a R2 million for the deposit to 
Hurlingham.  So those are the two.  And then there is a 
third payment which is basically pay for the ERF 161 
Waterkloof which I mentioned in the – in my statements.  So 
those three Chair are definite – I am saying definitely 
10 
because that is what has been paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are definite about those ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Exactly Chair so I can confirm that.  Now 
that is why when I am asked about  
CHAIRPERSON:  The R2 250 million. 
MR MONTANA:  The payments – the other payments here 
that he – that Mr Van Der Walt shares with his – with – I 
think they may relate – may reflect payments that he could 
have made to me or other people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your instruction. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Which he then regard – which he then 
regard as a loan which he mentions R1.3 million.  Okay or 
other things that we may have done together.  But from the 
R6.8 the three large ticket items are those Chair bond 
cancellation which was R2 million.  The deposit for 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 19 of 343 
 
Hurlingham and as well as the payment for ERF 161 
Waterkloof. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
And 
those 
three 
payments 
almost 
exhausted R2.8 million, is that right? 
ADV SONI SC:  R6.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they each is about R2 million. 
MR MONTANA:  No they come to about – they come about 
R6.2. 
ADV SONI SC:  R6.8 Chairperson. 
MR MONTANA:  So there is about 5 / 600 000 left Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is about 5? 
MR MONTANA:  No they come to about R6.25 so there is 
about 600 – 600 left in the 00:20:03 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. No that is fine.  Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Montana I am just trying to understand 
and I know you are not answerable for what Mr Van Der 
Walt says.  So to the extent that Mr Van Der Walt says to 
his partners as he does in 2.2 of his letter of the 28 t h of 
January that these various payments were made in respect 
of the Parkwood property save for the one marked at 2.2.1 
20 
and the one marked at 2.2.8 you are saying that the rest are 
not in respect of the Parkwood property. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair – Chair I would – I would say that 
and I think that the probably what Mr Van Der Walt has done 
may have been to confuse – to conflate issues that are 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 20 of 343 
 
there because I think they will have to align with annexure 
162 or rather 160. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  We then have to then check the statement 
as to where the R1.3 he is talking about comes from and 
when I look at the statements not knowing them – they are 
not my statements I would assume that those amounts 
would reflect that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  So I am not saying that they were not made 
10 
but I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  So for me Chair the – that is why when 
people talk about my properties I say no, no, but I put my 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And that is a breakdown of that.  That is 
why I keep on coming back where is the R36 million that 
Montana spent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  On properties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh.  Now I just want to go back and I know 
you are not answerable for this but this is information 
before the commission and we must in some way try and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 21 of 343 
 
reconcile all the facts that are before us.   
 
If you look at after the R2 million he then says he – 
at 2.2.9 on the 23 r d of March 2015 he paid R439 200 … 
MR MONTANA:  Sorry Mr Soni.  Are you on 190 or 198? 
ADV SONI SC:  199. 
MR MONTANA:  199 Okay sorry, sorry about that.  I just 
wanted to make sure.  199 okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  He says he paid on the 23td of March 
an amount of R439 200.00.  Now he is saying he paid that 
in respect of the Parkwood property.  Now when one looks 
10 
at the Precise Trade  
MR MONTANA:  Accounts. 
ADV SONI SC:  The transactional account. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  One does not find that figure there.  I am 
just saying that so even on Mr Van Der Walt’s version 
unless he paid you from some other account in respect of 
the Parkwood property he paid you R439 200.00 less. 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair if he is owing – if there is money 
owing to me then (speaking in vernacular) Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will be quite happy to receive it. 
MR MONTANA:  I am in desperate need of money.  So I 
think – no but that is the point I am making.  So I do not 
even know Chair how Mr Van Der Walt was financing his 
activities or what I can see here is that he has got a lot of 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 22 of 343 
 
activities and monies going in and out of different people. 
Okay.  For me I am interested firstly on the R6.8 because it 
tells me how I financed my participation in the other 
projects.  So it is possible that he may have had another 
account.  It is possible that he may have paid the other 
people that needed to be paid from the completely different 
account.  And I think for me that is why I have a problem 
that I am dealing with statements that are not mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But from what Mr Soni is doing to say we 
10 
see what he is saying there but we see on the other side I 
do not have a problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  The commission should do that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.   
ADV SONI SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course when you talk about giving 
instructions for Mr Van Der Walt to pay as I see it here you 
– you accept that he was using Precise Trade to make 
payments. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Chair Precise Trade was his company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it was his company.  Ja.  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   He had now – now remember I am not part 
of Precise Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 23 of 343 
 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
The 
issue 
was 
that 
where 
we 
do 
developments together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR MONTANA:  We then create joint ventures for that 
purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So that was the – that was the principle 
around that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR MONTANA:  And – and I wish Chair the only thing that 
10 
will help us Chair to understand and to confirm or to reject 
that it is only my statements are put here on the table 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  And Chair I think it is not too late.  I think 
the commission should try and get my statements so that we 
can – we can confirm so that I can say he did not come here 
or I had to then get my notes where I say page so and so, 
page so and so now I do not have those before me Chair to 
be able to confirm that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well Mr Soni maybe I should say 
this.  I do not know to – I do not know what difference it 
would make to see what is in Mr Montana’s bank statements 
in this connection in the circumstances where his position is 
clear that that I sold the property to Mr Van Der Walt for 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 24 of 343 
 
R6.8 million.  Mr Van Der Walt paid that R6.8 million and 
part of it may have come into my account; part of it – 
different parts of it were paid by him on my instructions to 
different entities so – so it is not a situation where he 
denies that… 
ADV SONI SC:  No absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those payments were on his instructions.  
So I do not know that it would make a difference. 
ADV SONI SC:  It will not.  It will not Chair.   
MR MONTANA:  In fact Chair if you look at the letters 
10 
where to – for the Hurlingham property and for the 
Waterkloof property he says but there he does it from not 
Precise. He was using a conveyance house which – which is 
the firm that he says we are holding this amount of money 
on behalf of Mr Montana.  So he makes a commitment to 
pay a deposit for that – for that property. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now – Now Chair that is why it was very 
important and you can see people who went to this firm of 
attorneys and collected information they – they jumped that 
20 
point.  They jumped the fact that he had written a letter but 
as a not as Precise this time but as a law firm that we have 
got R2 million for Mr Montana that will pay.  So he is 
dealing – he is providing a guarantee.  When he does the 
same in Waterkloof Chair and I think that one of the letters I 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 25 of 343 
 
may even have – I may not have included – because I did 
not know that we are going to go this route you see it was – 
but now I see these letters confirm what he holds on my 
behalf from the sale of that – of that particular property. 
 
Now – and that is why Oellerman is saying Mr 
Oellerman was saying Montana paid for this property but he 
did not have money.  Because he will say that if he jumps 
an important letter Chair and that is why the importance of 
proper investigations.  He jumped that letter that says – you 
will not know everybody moves from the premise that in 
10 
Hurlingham I did not pay.  I paid R2 million Chair from the 
proceeds of the sale.  When my bank went to Pretoria for 
the second property and I see it has been tweeting about it 
yesterday he does not know that the proceeds of that 
payment comes from the sale of my – of my house.  Why 
are they doing that Chair?  Because they are not interested 
in that they are interested in another narrative that no, no 
Montana got money – got a kickback and paid for his 
property Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let – at least I think we are clear 
20 
that… 
ADV SONI SC:  About the payment yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It  might – ja – it is not necessary to go 
into Mr Montana’s statement because of the position he has 
taken. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 26 of 343 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But Chair I am making a commitment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  That if my statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Statements. 
MR MONTANA:  Statements become available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  The commission wants to probe me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  I will… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are happy to do that. 
MR MONTANA:  I will come back Chair even if I come in my 
pajamas I will come and answer questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright now Mr Montana we must get on I 
am afraid please.  Can I ask you to turn now to Bundle H 
page 57. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the same bundle we are using or 
is it a different bundle? 
ADV SONI SC:  It is – sorry it is – so we were working in G 
20 
with the bank accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the same that we have – oh we were 
using G. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes now we looking at H. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 27 of 343 
 
ADV SONI SC:  This is Mr Oellermann’s – the annexures to 
Mr Oellermann’s report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   What page, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page 57.  Now you remember in 
respect of the offer to purchase which is PP-2 which 
appears at page 46.  On the 5 t h of May you sold this 
property.  We were at that yesterday.  Now I just want to 
refer you to the addendum to the sale and it starts at 
paragraph – page 57 of SA-16.  It is a called an Addendum 
10 
to Offer to Purchase and you agreed that this is the 
addendum to the sale of the property by yourself to Precise 
Trade, the property at Parkwood. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, can I – I do not remember that I 
see it is signed by me, Chair.  Let me just quickly remind 
myself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MR MONTANA:   I see that, Chair.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  I just want to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I just raise this for the sake of 
20 
clarity?  Mr Montana, I know you have been saying you had 
a relationship with Mr Van der Walt.  Just noting that, for 
example, this addendum and the purchase, is between 
yourself and Precise Trade as an entity. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 28 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be more accurate to say your 
relationship was with Precise Trade as a legal entity?  But 
of course, Mr Van der Walt was the sole director or 
shareholder and – because you were not selling the 
property to him in his personal capacity, you were selling 
to his company. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no I sold it to him in his personal 
capacity, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   But he decided to use that as a vehicle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
Now 
we 
do 
not 
know 
in 
other 
developments ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...what other vehicles would use if we had 
proceed with our relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So Chair I think that the relationship was 
with him ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   With him. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   ...personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   The fact that he decided to use Precise 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Use a certain vehicle. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 29 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   ...for that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   ...it is his own decision ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, that is fine, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, you would have no objection 
10 
if he used a certain vehicle as long as he was behind that 
vehicle and you continued with – you achieved the 
objectives of the relationship. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think that if you look – let us use 
the example of Hurlingham to answer ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I put to media(?) and I said to him:  
Would you partner with me?  He said no.  I will not have 
the money to come into that relationship.  And he 
introduced me to some other people. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I entered into an agreement with 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So it is the nature of the business, Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 30 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  
MR MONTANA:   It is the nature, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would just depend on the business. 
MR MONTANA:   On the business and where money is, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Because – want to use.  I mean, in my 
case, I have had a situation where the banks says:  We 
cannot expand your facility.  So that created a bit of a 
problem for me.  So that is what it is, Chair., 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Ja.  Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson.  Now, 
Mr Montana, can I just ask you to look at page 58, 
paragraph 2.1 of the addendum? 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that reflects – if I could just go 
through it very quickly.  That says it would be your 
obligation as the seller to complete and install on the 
property the swimming pool, to be properly fitted, the 
kitchen to be replaced, the construction on top of the 
20 
garage to be completed, the tiling inside the house to be 
completed, renovations to bathrooms must be completed, 
and finalisation of security system.  That is an obligation 
that – those are the obligations that were placed on your 
by virtue of this. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 31 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   It is true except, Chair, that subsequent 
to our conversation, we have agreed because in some 
instances, when we wanted – I remember, for example the 
kitchen, he wanted me to install a different kind of – what 
do you call it – the ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Appliances? 
MR MONTANA:   ...the appliances.  So I think I wanted to 
put different ones.  If I remember very well he wanted 
different ones.  He said:  Look, if you do not want that one 
then we are going to put it on your account.  So that is the 
10 
kind of thing but largely these...  For example, the pool, I 
remember I did the pool, Chair.  So we did some of that 
work and I think that most of those were for my account, 
Chair.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, at 2.3 it says: 
“The parties specifically agreed that all the 
above costs will be for the account of the 
seller...” 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  And then, of course, the one 
20 
you referred to and I have already referred you to at 
paragraph 
3.1 
that 
Mr Zamchlaka(?) 
[00:06:27] 
was 
residing on the premises and you have explained to the 
Chairperson already the circumstances that you thought he 
would be in danger if he lived in town or ...[intervenes]  
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 32 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   That is ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Indistinct]  
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then there was to be payment of 
at least R 20 000,00 per month by Mr Zamchlaka for 
occupying the premises.  Just – I just want – and please a 
yes or no – do you know where Mr Zamchlaka paid the 
rental as per this agreement? 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I think that – my understand 
that he stayed there for long and he was paying for rental, 
10 
ja.  But whether he paid every month, I do not know Chair.  
I would not know. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Van der Walt never 
complained to you? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no.  Not as far as I can recall. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  I say that because of this.  
When one looks at the bank account, the transaction 
account, one does not see deposits of R 20 000,00.  I am 
just pointing that out ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Sure. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...in case you want to comment. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay but it is not a matter that concerns 
you.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, Chair but you will recall, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 33 of 343 
 
Mr Soni, when he(?) is talking about the four-hundred-and-
thirty-nine, it is reflected in his explanation but it is not 
showing in the statements which is possible that we do not 
– unless we have that contract between the two of them 
and to see which account was used.  So it may suggest 
that he was not having one account, as it were, Chair.  But 
again, it is not my story.  I would not get involved in that.  
MR MONTANA:   Okay.  Do not and please.  Can I then ask 
you to – in regard to now what happened in regard to the 
improvements?  There are certain emails that start at page 
10 
60.  And can I ask you to, please, first look at page 61 and 
that is an email from yourself.  You will see right on the top 
dated the 10 t h of June sent about noon to Mr Van der Walt 
and you say: 
“Dear Riaan.   
Can I request that we pay from the proceeds of 
the 
sale 
of 
my 
house 
an 
amount 
of 
R 79 576,92 for interior work done for me.  
The payment should be made to the following, 
Team Austin(?)...” 
20 
 
You recall that? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I see that.  I think it is my email.  I 
think I can confirm that. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay.  And then if you look at page 60, 
there is a response to you on the following – oh, sorry, at 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 34 of 343 
 
three or four days later, is from Mr Riaan van der Walt.  He 
says: 
“Hi, Lucky. 
Hope you are well. 
Take note that I could not do the payment 
due to the bank account being invalid...” 
 
I am just pointing out to you that this is among 
the documents that relate to the Parkwood property. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Thank you. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, alright? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR MONTANA:   Then can I ask you to please look at page 
63 where, on the 30 t h of June 2014, you say to him: 
“Dear Riaan...” 
 
And in the second paragraph: 
“I am under pressure to start paying the 
contractor for additional work and his own 
suppliers from the proceeds of the sale as well 
as start to realise the savings of my monthly 
instalments of the bond...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni.  Are you at 63? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   At page 63, yes.  I am not reading 
the whole email ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...as there is no ...[intervenes]  
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 35 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at least tell us where you are 
starting from. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry, sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am getting lost where you are reading 
from. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry.  It is the last sentence of 
the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of the – paragraph.  Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Sorry, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now I see, ja.  Okay. 
10 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear.] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But you then ask him to make those 
payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just – so there – that sentence 
says:   
“I am under pressure to start paying the 
contractor for additional work and his own 
suppliers from the proceeds of the sale as well 
as start to realise the savings of my monthly 
instalments of the bond...” 
20 
 
Ja, okay alright.  Continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then you say: 
“In the meantime, I request...” 
 
This is the next paragraph. 
“...I request you to make the following urgent 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 36 of 343 
 
payments from the proceeds of the sale and 
we 
can 
reconcile 
the 
numbers 
when 
the 
property is finally registered...” 
 
You did send that email ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair, I confirm that, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay and I just want to – we do not 
need to go into details.  The amounts are in respect of the 
City of Johannesburg, R 150 000,00 and in respect of 
Simcindi ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Simcindi Projects, ja. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...Projects, R 350 000,00 and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Simcindi will be s-i-m-c-i-n-d-i.  Simcindi 
Projects Company.  That is for the transcribers.  Yes? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   R 350 000,00.  And then in respect of 
a credit card from ABSA, which seems to be in your name, 
an 
amount 
of R 250 000,00 
and 
then 
an 
invoice 
of 
R 110 000,00 with the reference TL Montana.  You confirm 
you sent that email with that request ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   I confirm that, Chair. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Then can I ask you to turn to 
page 65, please? 
MR MONTANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that is an email from a Jasper 
Nukwa, I think it is, where they say: 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 37 of 343 
 
“Good morning, DCEO...” 
 
It is addressed to you and it says: 
“Attached are proposed designs for number 
10...” 
 
And that, obviously, is ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   [Indistinct]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...in Newport(?). 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you see the rest of the – the 
following pages until page 71 are copies of the design that 
10 
are being sent to you.  You confirm receiving that? 
MR MONTANA:   I confirm that, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  And then if I can ask you to 
please look at page 72 and that another email from 
Mr Nukwa.  This is on the 19 t h of August 2014 and the 
subject – it is addressed to you.  The subject matter is:  
Newport master bedroom.  And it says: 
“DGCEO, the attached 3D’s are in fact part of 
the set of what I forwarded to you on Friday 
and again, I have contained drawings for 3D 
20 
drawings of the master bedrooms...”   
 
Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 38 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am not being difficult.  It is just 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You need to reflect your answer 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Indistinct]  
MR MONTANA:   I am sorry, sorry. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then can I ask you to look at 
10 
page 77.  Again, this is – oh, sorry – this is now from 
Mr Justin John.  It is addressed to you.  It is dated the 
2 n d of September 2014 and it deals 
with the 
Newport 
master bedroom and the email reads: 
“Good morning, Mr Montana. 
Hope you are well. 
I am still waiting to get approval and a deposit 
to start the master bedroom...” 
 
And then he says in the second paragraph: 
“I 
have 
not 
yet 
received 
the 
balance 
of 
20 
R 165 000,00 for the kitchen. 
It was supposed to be paid by the end of 
July...” 
 
Did you receive that email mister ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I confirm that Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 39 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then can I ask you to please look at 
page 84? 
MR MONTANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page 84.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 84.  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is an email from yourself dated 
the 21 s t of October 2014 to Mr Van der Walt and you say: 
“Dear Riaan. 
10 
This invoice is for the design manufacturing 
installation of the modern kitchen units. 
In addition, I have spent R 40 000,00 for the 
appliances 
as 
purchased 
from 
Miele 
in 
Johannesburg. 
I will forward the invoices from Miele as 
well...” 
 
And then you say: 
“I trust you will find this in order...” 
 
And the invoices you sent to him go up to page 
20 
94.  Is that correct, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   So I see it starts from page 91. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Well, there are various other 
documents.  You will see just interiors ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   But I thought this one was part of – 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 40 of 343 
 
actually was part of the – what is it called?   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of page 84.  These invoices for the 
design manufacture and so on.   
MR MONTANA:   From Just Interiors? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.   
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair I see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Now just at page 94, the 
amount reflected towards the end is R 525 787.50.  You 
see that?  It is the third line from the bottom. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair but the pages – I see the 
10 
numbers.  I do not see the heading here.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   From 91. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   What is it?  Is it an annexure to Just 
Interiors?  Because I see only numbers.  There is no 
heading at all.  I do not know what this is all about. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So, can I just ask you?  You are not 
in any position to tell us what this is about? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he is simply saying, Mr Soni, these 
20 
pages from 91 onwards is just numbers.  There is nothing 
to indicate what the numbers are about, what they relate 
to.  He is asking whether it is an annexure to something or 
it is a standalone document. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, it is the documents we have 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 41 of 343 
 
uplifted from the Siyangena application. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do we know what they represent? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know what they represent? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We only – it would appear that they 
are part of or they were attached to the email at page 84. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  But you are not sure about it, I 
guess? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I cannot take that further than this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I do not know, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I do not know what it means. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   There is actually the – if you look at Just 
Interiors, 
all 
the 
information 
– 
all 
the 
amount 
they 
mentioned in email.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Now this numbers look different.  I think 
they probably relate to something else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MONTANA:   So I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 42 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   I cannot deny or confirm, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Can I then – can I just ask 
you to look at page 95?  And I expect what you are saying 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   95? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...and it does not make sense to me 
as well.  I was hoping you would be able to help. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This then is an email you sent on the 
10 
21 s t of October to Mr Van der Walt in regard to now Miele 
appliances and you say to him.  This is the ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Appliances. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...the Miele appliances. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I paid for.  And it looks like it is about 
R 40 000,00 for that. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.   
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where do you see the 
amount Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you said R 40 000,00. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, I may have had it in my 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 43 of 343 
 
head based on page 84 where Mr Montana says to Mr Van 
der Walt:  I have spent over R 40 000,00 for the appliances 
purchase from Miele. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  But at least the amount 
does not appear on ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   On ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear]  
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, Mr Montana...  Oh, sorry 
Chairperson.  Can I ask you to please look at page 97? 
MR MONTANA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you will see the amount right at 
the bottom.  This is an – it is marked Miele Customer Order 
and the surname of the person who ordered it is said to be 
Mr Montana and you will see the total order value is 
R 40 448,00.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I see that, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Once ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you think that is where you got the 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is where – and I just 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 44 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...was not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But it also ties in with that email 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, that is alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Now, Mr Montana, I know it is 
a difficult exercise because these are emails you sent and 
received a long time ago. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And some of them are not in order 
10 
but leaving that aside.  I just want to ask you a few 
questions about these emails.  You said to Mr Van der 
Walt, and I have read your emails, please pay those 
amounts.  Did he pay them? 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I think some of them.  For 
example, the other one he said there is a bank problem.  
He did not pay.  I see the one of Just Interiors, I think that 
it was not paid.  And then there is the – I see the hundred 
and ten for the catering, Chair.  I think it was paid.  This 
was for, if I remember well, there was a function of – a 
20 
farewell function from one of the ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, no Mr Montana, I am just asking 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Ja, I am confirming some of them Chair, 
yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 45 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But I am not sure, Chair, if all of them 
had been paid but I can confirm some that I see 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...for example that I remember very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But Mr Van der Walt paid them? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, remember that Mr Van der Walt 
paid from the proceeds of the sale, ja. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think that answer is.  Yes, Mr Van 
der Walt but from the proceeds of the sale of the property. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But if you look at that email that was read 
– Mr Soni read.  It says paid from the proceeds.  We will 
then reconcile what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...what the is due but it says paid from 
20 
the proceeds of the sale, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now what issue that intrigues me.  I 
read to you the various mattes that the addendum required 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 46 of 343 
 
you to attend to. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It did not require you to attend to the 
bedroom.  Can I ask you why you fitted – why you installed 
and made all those improvements to the bedroom when 
there was no obligation on you? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, you see, the – it should not 
intrigue anyone.  The relationship between myself and 
Mr Van der Walt was deeper than that and I think that – if 
you look at the items, some of the items are not listed 
10 
there but for example, I think we did not talk about – in the 
addendum we did not talk about materials but we had 
constant meetings before the property was transferred.  
Some of the things where he wanted changes on the 
property to say:  No, no.  Look, I think that we must 
change all of that but... 
 
And I do not know, I need to check the dates 
very well, Chair, because I think some of them are not 
related.  The – Mr Nukwa’s designed thing was not related 
to Mr Van der Walt.  I think that we – if I remember well, 
20 
we built for example a big wall.  We wanted to change that 
and break into half, put wallpaper.  So there was a lot of 
work Chair that was done.  So I think that the – I think that 
those were the details – that was what was happening at 
that point in time, ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 47 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So Mr Montana, I am testing your 
state of mind now. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja.  At the time or now? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, no.  At that time. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We have a situation where you sell a 
house for R 6.8 million.  You agree then after the sale, six 
weeks after the sale to do improvements to the house 
which the original sale agreement did not require you to.  
That is correct, right? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Yes and no, Chair.  The sale agreement 
did not require these thing but I am saying that there was 
constant interaction between myself and Mr Riaan van der 
Walt.  If you look at, for example, the kitchen, like I 
explained earlier.  He wanted, for example, certain things 
to be done there and that those were where I said:  Well, if 
you want that it will be for your account.  And so I think it 
was a more dynamic relationship, Chair, that we had with 
Mr Van der Walt.   
 
Unless if you say that we were not – we did not 
20 
strictly align with the – what is it call – with the offer to 
purchase.  Probably did not, with hindsight, but I do not 
have a problem with that Chair.  The nature of the 
relationship with Mr Van der Walt was such that we were 
working together on many properties and I said earlier on 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 48 of 343 
 
that there were many transactions beyond even what we 
have here, Chair.   
 
We are looking at a specific property and maybe 
– it does not fit in there but I think that what you can 
confirm, I think that was that we had the sale and some of 
this was paid from the proceeds of that sale, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the answer, basically, to that 
question is.  Yes, some of the things you did, you were not 
required by the sale agreement. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are simply relying on the nature 
of your relationship to say, you say – to say:  Well, I did 
some of the things even though, strictly speaking, the sale 
agreement did not require them. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair.  So let us take one 
example.  I said yesterday, when Mr Van der Walt took over 
the property in Waterkloof – I am giving that as an 
example.  You will probably come to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   I said that some of the initial work were 
20 
people that were mobilised by me, that I paid for them, 
okay?  For them to come and do the break and all of those 
– all of – they were organised by me from Mamelodi.  I paid 
these people, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 49 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   So that was the nature of the animal and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...it may intrigue someone but if you talk 
about strictly that really – what is it called?  This is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The sale, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...the sale and close up everything.  Yes, 
I mean, there is a – you will see it as a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   But if you understand the nature of the 
relationship and what we were involved in, Chair, you – I 
do not think it should intrigue anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Can I ask you to please look at page 
49 of that bundle, the original sale agreement.  I am going 
to read paragraph 9.3 to you in light of what you have said.  
Clause 9.3 of the agreement says: 
“The parties hereto being Precise Trade…” 
And yourself. 
20 
“…be agreed that this agreement constitutes the 
entire 
agreement 
between 
them 
and 
that 
no 
warranties or representations 
other than those 
contained herein shall be binding on any of the 
parties 
or 
their 
agents, 
nor 
are 
there 
any 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 50 of 343 
 
suspensive conditions to this agreement which are 
not included herein.  No variation, alternation or 
consensual cancellation of the agreement shall be 
of any force or effect unless reduced to writing and 
signed by both parties.” 
Now I am just saying there is this clause.  You are saying 
effectively 
that 
we 
went 
beyond 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
agreement, the strict terms specifically set out in 9.3.  That 
is your answer to the questions I have asked.  Would that 
be right? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the answer is yes, Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   No but, Chair, I think that the – I think 
you made a – it is yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But I want to explain something and the 
point is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will tell you why I am saying that. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is because I think you have explained 
20 
it before, I think twice actually. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, if the point – I agree with you, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   The point has come back, let me make it 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 51 of 343 
 
quickly, before I forget it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   You see, Chair, if there was a legal 
dispute between Mr Van der Walt and I, that clause was 
going to play an important role.  There was none. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but that is not what he is asking for.  
So that is why I say your answer is yes, we went beyond. 
MR MONTANA:   It is yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But the point I was trying to make, Chair, 
10 
I still need to make this point because I think it is very 
important.  The State Capture Commission will not hold 
Montana and Van der Walt for not sticking strictly to that, 
Chair, unless if there is a dispute between the parties. Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, I do not think that – until Mr 
Soni makes another point. 
MR MONTANA:   Point, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For now your answer is yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Is yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
We 
went 
beyond 
what 
the 
sales 
20 
agreement said. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But let me make that point, Mr 
Montana, and people may say well, here is an agreement 
which says a house is sold for R6,8 million, you will recall 
that the year earlier – Ursula Willis had said that the value 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 52 of 343 
 
of the house was R3,5 million and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second, Mr Soni, the 
air con, if it can be adjusted, it is making it difficult to 
hear.  I think they have had to make a plan. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   One of the questions I must be 
expected to ask in these circumstances is this agreement 
then would protect people, you and Mr van der Walt in the 
event of a dispute, or it could be the cover to say that this 
10 
puts on paper something that is not the reality. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I am glad Mr Soni is actually 
coming back to his real intention.  Okay, let start – we start 
with 36 million and I was asking deliberately, Chair.  Now 
the first thing that we have is that before Mr Soni would 
make that statement, he will ask the first question, was 
there a house, was it sold, was it transferred and who - 
and this property, how was it acquired?  Now I think from 
the factual position, Chair, you can see that the reason 
why we paid and I think Mr Soni in his questions raises a 
20 
number of things.   
So, Chair, I think that even before I even answer Mr 
Soni, the facts of the matter speak for themselves and, you 
see, I say in my statement there has been this desperate 
attempt a whole range of things.  Yesterday I said you are 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 53 of 343 
 
guilty by association. 
Now the house has been sold, Chair.  Now if I sell – 
I may have different houses why I sell the house.  The 
house that I sold was financed by ABSA and I provided – 
all my properties, I provided my bank statements.  And that 
is why, Mr Soni, wanted us to deal with four properties and 
no all my properties precisely because it was aimed at 
denying the fact that there are proceeds from this which 
are mine, I am entitled to them because it is my property.  
Once I pay the bank the rest of the money belongs to me, I 
10 
can invest it as I wish. 
So that is the first thing.  And I think that if there 
was no sale, there was a sale created in the air, there was 
no actual sale.  Now if the sale has happened, anybody 
can attach their own motive one, we cannot sell this 
property.  It has happened, it is there, it is fair, I want 
somebody to say there was no such a property, a 
transaction.  That is one thing. 
The second thing, Chair, we are told about three 
numbers.  You will see that in one of the papers you say 
20 
the valuation was 3.3.  Well, Ursula Willis had said it is 3.5 
in 2012, not when the property was sold, Chair.  You will 
see that the email is very specific, we said that time we 
were discussing and he said if you dispose of that property 
– he mentioned two properties, Chair.  The bank, Ursula 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 54 of 343 
 
Willis from ABSA says if you dispose of that property we 
will want this x amount of money because we value it as 
this amount.  If you dispose of another property, we will 
want this amount of money, here is the value.  Okay? 
Now a year or two later somebody says that 
property is not valued at that amount, they said - in some 
of the affidavits they said the property should have been 
sold for R4.8 million.  Now surely you can see, Chair, all 
the stuff that Mr Soni has been taking through, all these 
improvements that he says they fall outside number 9.3.  If 
10 
that work happened and we paid for those things, it in fact 
tell you that the enormous investment that has taken place 
in that property.  Okay?  Now it does not make sense when 
you say the bank four, five years ago says this property is 
R3.5 million and you list here all the work that has been 
done and the payments.  I have just been asked about the 
payments.  Actually, someone would be intrigued, Chair, in 
this time, it will be most intrigued that when you put money 
into a property you include the value of the property 
tremendously and I think that if you look at the pictures of 
20 
this property that I bought, I said the day before yesterday 
it was a complete wreck.  Chair, it was a complete wreck, 
which we built – we actually had to rebuild.  If this 
Commission had time it will go to the previous owners, I 
think the old man died but the daughters are there, they 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 55 of 343 
 
will say take us there to that property.  They will tell you 
that this is a completely new property that has been built. 
So, Chair, I think, you know, I reject this statement 
with contempt and I know, Chair, let me tell you if I take 
further what Mr Soni is saying.  You see, the surprise of 
yesterday was - yesterday was Monday, Chair, when we 
came here, the story of the R36 million hinge on a number 
of things.  I said three things, Chair, when I was here 
yesterday.   
 
The first one was that all of the properties that we 
10 
are discussing are not my properties, they are Mr van der 
Walt’s properties and seven of the properties are mine and 
I detailed each one of them, how they were paid for, which 
one I sold, how much money I have made out that.  That is 
the first issue, Chair. 
 
Secondly, when the Commission made its assertions 
it did not actually but particularly with two of the properties 
they elevated, Hurlingham, they did not know that I put 
money, I paid the deposit for that amount.  So the noise 
was that Montana did not put any money and I thought that 
20 
if we are assisting the Commission to get to the truth, 
when certain new facts emerged, like they emerged 
yesterday, surely that – I think that we should be able to 
also change our position to say now what happened after 
between myself and Riaan, Riaan van der Walt of Precise 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 56 of 343 
 
Trade in respect of improvements and all of those things?  
There are details, Chair, that are then material to the story 
that I sold the property and the answer is no, they are not 
material to me but the story that this agreement is false, I 
hope 
that 
the 
Commission 
will 
present 
me 
with 
a 
supporting evidence to say – and I know,  Chair, I have 
said the story comes from – yesterday I explained, it is a 
Paul O’Sullivan story, it presents and said it in that way, 
the Commission has now elevated false evidence.   
 
Paul O’Sullivan says in his affidavit Montana is 
10 
engaged in all these properties because …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the short answer to Mr Soni’s 
question, your short answer is you are saying the facts are 
there was a property, that property was sold, that property 
was paid for and you have said that you gave instructions 
as to how certain payments should be made from the 
proceeds. 
MR MONTANA:   And, Chair – I agree, Chair, and also that 
I reject with the contempt the last statement where he says 
other people may say this was a transaction for other 
20 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I have never been presented with 
evidence here that suggests otherwise so let it be put 
before me and then we deal with it in that way.  But I reject 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 57 of 343 
 
it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni?  Oh, I see it is – ja, let us take 
the tea break and let us resume at twenty to twelve.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson.  Mr 
Montana, now I want to deal with the Waterkloof property 
and I want you to please turn to page 105 of bundle H 
10 
EXHIBIT SS18, 105. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Switch on your mic, Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   Sorry, Chair.  I am there, Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please.  Mr Montana, this is 
an agreement that was entered into between Aanmani 
Guesthouse and Johan Smith as a trustee of the Minor 
Property Trust.  Do you see that? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now the Minor Property Trust is a 
trust you formed for the benefit of your children, is that 
20 
correct? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Johan Smith is the trustee of 
the property trust. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 58 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That trust is still in existence, I take 
it? 
MR MONTANA:   Still in existence, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Smith still a trustee? 
MR MONTANA:   I think Mr Smith resigned but there were 
three trustees.  It was him, someone else and my nephew. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And who are the present trustees? 
MR MONTANA:   I said there are two now, I was mean to 
appointed as a – after Mr Smith resigned. If I remember 
well, I think it is Mr Johan Taljaard who works with Mr Smith 
10 
and I think it is my nephew, Edwin Montana. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now this agreement starting at page 
105 is for the sale of the members’ interest in the Aanmani 
Guesthouse CC.  That is correct, is it not? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now this is – we have talked about 
the general properties and you dealt with it yesterday.  This 
is the Waterkloof property. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is at Rose Avenue. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now can I just ask you to please look 
at clause 2 of the agreement which appears at page 106. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And it says: 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 59 of 343 
 
“The purchase price of the property amounts to R11 
million and it will be paid as follows: 
2.1  A deposit in the amount of R3,5 million.” 
Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then that amount was to be 
nonrefundable and then at 2.4 it says: 
“As security for the payment of the balance of the 
purchase price of R7,5 million the purchaser shall 
be obliged to render approved bank guarantees.” 
10 
Is that correct, at 2.4? 
MR MONTANA:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now this agreement was signed on 
the 25 August 2014, is that correct.  If you look at page 
110 you will see that. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, the agreement is – it is valid, so I 
cannot recall the exact date, I do not think it was signed 
by me, it was signed by Mr Smith, so I cannot recall the 
exact date, but yes, it was entered into between the 
parties. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, you do not know who signed 
on behalf of the purchaser, the signature is not familiar to 
you, if you look at page 110. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it does not appear to be Mr 
Montana’s one. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 60 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Certainly not, Chair. 
MR MONTANA:   Because I thought this was signed by Mr 
– it looks like Mr Smith’s signature, I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the last part of the signature does 
look like TH. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does look like TH but did you know 
Mr Smith’s signature?  Did you know how he signs? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, not really.  Not really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but obviously …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MONTANA:   But I think he should be the person who 
signed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  As far as your knowledge goes, he 
is the one who should have signed. 
MR MONTANA:   He should have signed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Would you know the signatures of 
the other two trustees?  Are you able to exclude them and 
say no, this [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, they would not have signed 
because I think for the Minor Property Trust Mr Smith was 
20 
the authorised trustee on this transaction, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, so would you say, as far as 
your are concerned, this should be his signature? 
MR MONTANA:   This should be his signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 61 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, Mr Montana, can I then ask you 
to please look at bundle G page 199? 
MR MONTANA:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you will recall that 2.1 of the 
agreement that was between the guesthouse and the Minor 
Property Trust, said that a deposit of R3,5 million had to be 
paid within 14 days from the signature. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You accept that, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   I accept that, Chair. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, now if you look at page 199 
of bundle G, that again is a document we have been dealing 
with quite often, this is Mr Van der Walt’s explanation to his 
partners about how the various payments were made. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And at paragraph 4 where he deals 
with paragraph 6 of their letter to him and I will just say this 
to you, this relates to the Waterkloof property because that 
is what they had raised with him. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He says in respect of that at page 
4.1: 
“The purchase price was R11 million.” 
That ties in with the purchase price as reflected in the 
agreement, is that correct? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 62 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then he says at paragraph 4.2: 
“The payment of the purchase price…” 
At 4.2.1 he says: 
“…on the 23 September 2014 an amount of R3,5 
million was paid of the deposit.” 
Now can I ask you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In my ears is sounded like you were 
10 
saying 6,5.  It is 3,5. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 3,5. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is 3,5, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you heard also, Mr Montana, 
or you did not hear that part? 
MR MONTANA:   No, I did not hear that part, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is 3,5, Chairperson, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now I would like you now to just on 
20 
that same document, SS16, if you could go to – there is 
190, that is the transactional account. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   If you look at the entry on the 23 r d, 
there are two entries on the 23 September and the first 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 63 of 343 
 
entry on the 23 r d …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   Just hold on, Mr Soni, let me get there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry, sorry. 
MR MONTANA:   You are on page 19..? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   190. 
MR MONTANA:   190, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay, so you will see there are, in 
the middle of the page, two entries on the 23 September.  
The first entry reflects a deposit of R3,5 million. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Van der Walt’s handwriting it 
is said to be a TMM loan.  Do you see that, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   I see that, I see two TMM loans. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   At the top and at the bottom, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Well, the top one we have 
been through already. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Because those deposits preceded 
the R2,25 million guarantee paid in respect of the 
20 
Parkwood Property.  Now this is on the 23 September, a 
deposit of R3,5 million and then the next entry for the 23 r d 
is a withdrawal of that exact amount, R3,5 million.  Do you 
confirm that, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   So it is a withdrawal from this account? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 64 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then you will see that the 
citation is given as Minor Property Trust loan. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So he says at page 199, 4.2.1 that 
Precise Trade paid in respect of the Waterkloof property 
that amount on the 23 r d and you will see it is reflected as 
– that payment is reflected in the transactional bundle. Do 
you accept that, Mr Montana? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You do not? 
MR MONTANA:   No.  Chair, I think yesterday I explained 
Precise – what is it called, Minor Property Trust never paid 
for the property.  When we were looking at buying the 
property and I think that I am glad that it is now called by 
its right name, it is a guesthouse, what do you call it?  
Aanmani Guesthouse.  So when the first offer that went to 
the bank, you will recall, Chair was – I mentioned 
yesterday after the offer of R11 million was made, the 
20 
bank said no, the value of the property was below that.  
So we then agreed with Riaan that look, why then do we 
not then find – pay for the difference, the bank to pay – to 
give us the loan at the amount that they have given and 
there is a difference that has to be paid in that way and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 65 of 343 
 
therefore it was then agreed that no, what Precise would 
do, would then the property be registered in the name of 
Minor Property Trust but that transaction never went 
ahead, Precise Trade paid, Chair, and that is why when 
we could not get the finance from the bank, okay, the 
Precise Trade paid the 3.5 and the development is right 
there, so that is why Mr Riaan van der Walt bought the 
property and registered that in his name, Chair.  So the 
property mentioned does not belong to Minor Property 
Trust or to me, it belonged to Mr Riaan van der Walt, it is 
10 
registered in the name of Precise Trade. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We are going to come to that, I am 
reflecting, Mr Montana, because Mrs de Beer deals with 
that in her statement which I am going to take you to in 
just a moment but I just want to say that – and please, 
you must appreciate that it is the duty of the Commission to 
look at all the evidence.  We have the letter of Mr Van der 
Walt which says that in respect of the Waterkloof property 
he paid from this account R3,5 million, it is reflected in the 
bank account, I am just putting that to you so that the 
20 
Chairperson has the full record in front of him.  Of course, 
with your explanation but let us put all the facts on the table 
first. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, the facts are that Precise Trade 
paid the 3.5, it came from their account.  Those are the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 66 of 343 
 
facts. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Now the next thing that – 
well, 
not 
the 
next 
thing 
but 
the 
more 
important 
development after that, as you have already pointed out, 
is that that agreement - after that, as you have already 
pointed out, is that that agreement came to nothing.  
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And if I can ask you then to look at 
page 111 of bundle H.  This now is an agreement entered 
into between Aanmani Guesthouse and Precise Trade. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is the agreement you were 
talking about, is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay, it starts at page 111 and you 
will see it goes up to page 116. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you will see the signature of 
20 
the purchaser at the bottom.  Would I be correct to say 
that that signature [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MONTANA:   That is Van der Walt, indeed, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Now that agreement is dated 
28 February, is that correct? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 67 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   I see that, Chair, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   Is that February, Chair, the way- I see 
28 t h but that month, I do not know whether it is – does not 
look February to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page are you, Mr Soni. 
MR MONTANA:   Page 116. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   116. 
CHAIRPERSON:   116, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   The signature of Mr Van der Walt is 
10 
there but then, Chair, the month, I am not sure, I do not 
think it is February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, there is no signature for the seller. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, there is not a signature.  
Alright, perhaps Ms de Beer’s affidavit will clear that up, 
we will just keep that in mind.  Can we just move past 
that.  I just want to ask you to look at page 112, reflects 
again the terms of the agreement, certainly in regard to 
price, it says: 
“The purchase price amounts to R11 million.” 
20 
And 2.1 then says: 
“A deposit in the amount of R3,5 million which 
amount has already been paid.” 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is obviously the amount we 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 68 of 343 
 
looked at from Precise Trade’s account. 
MR MONTANA:   I agree, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then it says the balance will be 
paid by way of guarantee.  Now can I then ask you 
because Ms de Beer makes a statement about this, she 
has also given evidence and you have commented on her 
but she gives a commentary on how these various 
developments took place.  I would just like to place that 
on record. 
MR MONTANA:   But where – can we go through to 
10 
affidavit to look specifically on what she is saying, Chair? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes.  I want us to now look – 
the affidavit is page 121.  I am not going to read 
everything, Mr Montana, I will just tell you where I am 
reading from.  It is made by Ms Karen de Beer, her name 
appears in the first line of the affidavit itself and then she 
says in paragraph 2, the first sentence: 
“I used to be the owner of the property situate at 
225 Rose Street, Waterkloof, Pretoria, and I owned 
it through my company Aanmani Guesthouse.” 
20 
Then she says: 
“I decided in or about the end of 2012 to sell the 
property and I subsequently entered into a contract 
with a certain Lucky Montana to sell the property.” 
Then she says: 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 69 of 343 
 
“I attach a copy of the contract.” 
May I ask you to look at page 123?  Does that document 
appear familiar to you, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   123? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   123.  This document is titled Deed 
of 
Sale 
of 
Members’ 
Interest 
and 
then 
it 
says 
Memorandum of an Agreement entered into between 
Karen de Beer and Mr Montana.  Do you accept that? 
MR MONTANA:   I accept that, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That – if I can ask you to go to page 
10 
130.  You will see the signatures of the contracting 
parties.  In the middle of the page is Ms de Beer’s 
signature, that is the 10 February 2013 and then under 
that is the signature of the purchaser also on the 10 
February 2011.  That is your signature, is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay, so that is the agreement she 
refers to and then just because it is just part of the 
historical facts, you can go back to the affidavit, she says 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR MONTANA:   What page again is that? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry, page 121, Mr Montana.  
And then she says: 
“Mr Montana was buying my interest in the property 
for the sum of R10,5 million.” 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 70 of 343 
 
That was the price you and she had agreed upon.  Is that 
correct, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then at paragraph 3 – the 
third line from the bottom, she says: 
“The deal eventually fell through as there was one 
problem after another and Montana claimed the 
bank would not pay the bond which I did not 
believe as there was more than enough value.  I 
decided to withdraw the property from the market.” 
10 
Now getting her adverse comments about you, that deal 
did fall through, is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   No, it did not work, Chair, but I think it 
was not because of problems – and that is why I want to 
see, Chair, the copy of the email from Ursula Willis from 
the bank.  She refers to that: 
“I attach a copy of an email sent out dated 11 
March by Ursula Willis of ABSA Bank who gave the 
address for delivery of the approved building plans 
as…” 
20 
I do not know, is it attached here, Chair? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is not. 
MR MONTANA:   But I think it is very important, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is not, Mr Montana 
MR MONTANA:   But why not? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 71 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Because we are not – we are 
dealing with a deal that did not go through, we are now 
dealing with the payment or the subsequent agreement in 
regard to the Minor Trust. 
MR MONTANA:   No but Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Montana, what document 
are you talking about? 
MR MONTANA:   I am in page 121, Chair, the affidavit of 
Mrs de Beer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   De Beer, ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   She says in paragraph 3, I attach a copy 
of an email sent out dated 11 March by Ursula Willis.  
Remember Ursula Willis was the lady who was dealing 
with my properties from ABSA? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I think, Chair, it is also very important 
because… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who gave the address for delivery. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, I think that email is very important, 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Because you remember the reason why 
that deal did not go through is very important and that is 
why I think it is very vital, it will tell you if I have applied 
to the bank through a facility and the bank says this 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 72 of 343 
 
property is valued at 7.5, whatever the case may be.  So 
there was that gap between the 10.5 and – okay?  And 
that explains, Chair, why we then wanted to create a loan 
between the 7.5 and the what is it called, the 7.5 and the 
10.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Which was what was offered.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So that email is material because if you 
leave it out, Chair, it …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no. 
MR MONTANA:   I think it is very vital. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think you need to persuade me 
that if one leaves it out what the position is.  If the 
affidavit says it attaches an annexure, that annexure 
should be there if it is available.  If it is not available that 
is different because otherwise the affidavit is not complete 
if it refers to an annexure and the annexure is not there.  
Do you know, Mr Soni, whether Ms de Beer has got the 
annexure somewhere, that email?  Because she says in 
20 
the affidavit I attach a copy of the email. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We, as I say, you will see, 
Chairperson, that on Ms de Beer’s statement you will see 
there is a number 2911 right on the top right hand side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 73 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That we uplifted again from the 
documents in the Siyangena file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In the Siyangena court application. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and the email was not there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is what I was given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know there – ja. 
MR MONTANA:   No, but Chair, but Chair, can I object to 
that?  You see, I thought – you will recall yesterday I 
mentioned the fact that various people were forced by Mr 
10 
O’Sullivan to file particular statements, it was written – it 
was even written for them and they told them - it was from 
the Hawks.  Now this affidavit, if Ms de Beer came and 
deposed to an affidavit to the Commission, it must be here 
with all the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Now – and the reason why I am saying 
that, 
Chair, 
if 
you 
look 
at 
the 
entire 
paragraph 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was 2015, it was not deposed to 
20 
the Commission, I think it must have been for other 
purposes. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But you can see that even the sworn 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 74 of 343 
 
statement is a sworn statement rather than a fully-fledged 
affidavit that answers the questions of the Commission.  
You see – and that is what I am have been telling you to 
say the Commission cannot take documents from a 
particular matter if there is no proper context and in this 
particular regard, Chair, the reason why the deal did not 
happen is very important.   
She gives her own view, she says there the deal 
eventually fell through as there was one problem after 
another and Montana claimed the bank would not pay the 
10 
bond, which I did not believe, and there was more than 
enough value, I decided to draw the property from the 
market. 
Now, Chair, that is very important because it would 
then explain the other things that are there and I think, 
Chair, that we need – it is either this statement does not 
stand, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
complete – 
does 
not 
meet 
the 
requirements of the Commission because it is not good 
enough to be told that the statement, we have uplifted it.   
Now Mr Soni yesterday was saying to me we are 
20 
separate from the – we have got our own investigators 
separate from Werksmans’ investigation.   
This is Werksmans at play, Chair.  Now I am 
answering questions on people who never interviewed me, 
who broke into my property, who fought with me and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 75 of 343 
 
[indistinct] must answer the statements that are there.  But 
yesterday, Chair, I’m glad I put it on record, I insist, Chair, 
that this email - probably the Commission is in touch with Mrs 
de Beer so they can see that that – we cannot take only one 
part of what she said because it is material to what happens in 
this transaction after and the reason why we did not proceed 
with the transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say that email will throw light. 
MR MONTANA:   Will throw light, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the reasons why it did not proceed. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Exactly, Chair, because if we do not have it 
we are now going back to the realm of speculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And particularly negative speculation where 
you will [indistinct] information, I think it must be here, Chair, 
so that we can have the proper conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, I think at least attempts 
should be made to obtain it.  Of course, if there are other 
annexures that she refers to, which are not there, those 
should be – attempts should be made to obtain them.  So I 
20 
would imagine that at least if she is approached, that is Ms 
de Beer, she might be able to assist and I do not know 
whether from the court papers where it was uplifted it also 
did not have the annexure or whether what the position is but 
it seems that attempts should be made at least to get it.  Mr 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 76 of 343 
 
Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   May I make this suggestion? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana says it is important, I say 
it is not, but Ms de Beer is not the only one who knows or 
who was told why the deal fell through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana knows that if he can give 
that evidence and we can move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR MONTANA:   Chair you remember why I am here? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR MONTANA:   We are not leading Montana’s evidence, I 
have given this Commission an affidavit with over 170 
annexures and the staff that I am dealing with, with the 
bank, I am not dealing with a property, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   The reason why this document is here 
20 
Chair, you know why, because my deal with Ms de Beer did 
not work, okay.  Then she enters into a transaction with Mr 
– with Precise Trade.  Chair, you can see that when you 
analyse – and the last paragraph say, my disagreement, my 
fight with her, she mentioned different reasons and she 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 77 of 343 
 
said that she believed that there was value in her property, 
okay, that’s what she says.  The bank doesn’t agree what 
is the value there because if she thought the property was 
R7million and she agreed with the bank that the property 
was R7million, I would have probably bought the property, 
Chair, okay.  Now, the bank says it’s not, she rejects that, 
okay and so you can’t withhold that information because 
what is happening if building up- but he’s jumping up 
important facts which will assist the Commission to have 
the total picture of why the property is involved in the 
10 
manner that it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So, if we are playing reliance on this 
statement, 
it 
must 
provide 
a 
full 
information, 
Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let’s pause there, just remind me, Mr 
Soni, why is the reason why – why is the reason as to the 
transaction not being proceeded with so important for 
purposes of the Commission? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It’s not important. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, because if it’s not important then we 
shouldn’t be – we should not delay on it then.   You know, 
I’m just simply – I’m simply raising that question because 
the absence of the Annexure has been raised by Mr 
Montana.  If the reason why the deal was not proceeded 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 78 of 343 
 
with is really not important, we should then be able to just 
proceed. If it is important, it may be that attempts should 
be made to okay it but if it’s not important maybe that we 
should not…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We submitted Chair but Chairperson, 
as I said, we need to work out what the purpose of this 
evidence is.  The purpose of this evidence, Chairperson is, 
to tie in with this deal the payments that Mr van der Walt 
said he made, the source of the funds for that R3.5million 
and that’s TNM, we know and at the end of the day, what 
10 
happens is, the deal falls through, the deal is then entered 
into, which Mr Montana concedes with the minor Trust, that 
comes after this deal falls through and that deal too, is 
replaced, as we’ve already seen by the deal between 
Precise Trade and the Guest House.  So, that’s simply 
what we want to put on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, then, if that is so, it seems to me 
we can move on because the reason does not appear to be 
important for purposes of the Commission but if Mr 
Montana says it is important and then he can indicate to 
20 
me why it is important, then we can take it from there, Mr 
Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, let me take you through a number 
of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 79 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Firstly, let’s deal with the procedure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, it has taken me two years to be 
called before this Commission and I was told he didn’t 
number, he didn’t have this Annexure and everything, that’s 
the first issue, so firstly this Commission must be fair and 
consistent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   So, you admit documents that are being 
used against me, this Commission admits, Chair, and those 
10 
that refute – that challenges this Commission doesn’t want 
to accept, that’s the first issue Chair.  So, I’m asking for 
fairness, that’s number one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I still have two others Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let’s take one at a time. 
MR MONTANA:   At a time… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, now, to the extent that you are 
talking about this Annexure, I agree with you that if there 
is an Annexure to an affidavit, generally one should call for 
20 
that Annexure okay but I go further, I say, there might be 
no need to go and look for the Annexure if it is not 
important for purposes of what we are doing, okay, that’s 
why I asked Mr Soni why is the reason as to why the 
transaction was not proceeded with, important and he said, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 80 of 343 
 
it’s not important and I said well, I will hear whether you 
say it’s important – you already said it was important but I 
will hear why you say it is important but – so if I’m 
persuaded that it’s important, I would attempts to be made 
to obtain the Annexure but if I’m not persuaded that it’s 
important I might not say we should pursue that but I will 
hear what you have to say to that.  So, as far as the 
Annexure is concerned, I agree that if an affidavit refers to 
an Annexure, generally speaking one should look for that 
Annexure otherwise the affidavit is not complete, but one 
10 
might say for what we are doing, this Annexure is 
important, but that Annexure is not important so let’s not 
bother about the one that’s not important but let’s bother 
about the one that is important, so talk to me. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I always take your guidance where 
the Commission is paying reliance on this issue and I’m 
being led on evidence, it can’t be selective because the 
Commission is here to search for the truth, to have the 
total picture we have to look at history in the round to be 
able to form a picture.  So, that is the first issue, Chair, 
20 
and I’m saying that if you look at this affidavit that I’m led 
on now – and Mr Soni says, forget the …[indistinct], if you 
look -  you start with the whole affidavit you’ll see for 
example that, she mentioned my people were contacted 
by…[indistinct -dropped voice].  Things like those don’t – 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 81 of 343 
 
didn’t happen Chair, I don’t want to go into that.  I’m 
saying, the reason why the sale didn’t go through is 
because the bank said certain things which she then said, I 
can’t sell the deal, okay but that is a big issue Chair.  Now, 
I’ll tell you why this also is very important Chair.  Mr Soni, 
for the past two days, he said to me, Mr Montana I need to 
be very fair to us, we are the Commission we are not 
Werksmans Investigation okay.  Chair, we just dealt with 
Parkwood and I let it pass because I didn’t want to be 
petty.  Now, base on what the documents, that were 
10 
selected, elective, they’re presented, and Mr Soni said at 
the end of – when we talk about Parkwood he said, I put it 
to you, not the facts, the facts don’t support that.  That 
some people may say – that is the word before you 
interrupted, Chair, because of the aircon or whatever.  
Some people may say, and he concluded it that the 
agreement for the sale of the Parkwood property and Mr 
Soni then relied on a number of documents.  You asked a 
question and he said, those documents were picked up 
from the Werksmans, what it’s called, the PRASA / 
20 
Siyangena matter okay. Now, those documents, Chair, were 
presented by Werksmans through an illegal process okay, 
that I regard as illegal, and I said, they can’t be 
admissible.  
 
The 
second 
issue 
Chair 
is 
that 
Mr 
Soni 
is 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 82 of 343 
 
articulating, 
he 
did 
that 
at 
Parkwood, 
that’s 
what 
Werksmans is saying in Court.  He’s repeating it, not from 
an independent investigation, Chair, by this Commission.  
He’s taken their views, their positions and their documents 
and transplant it here okay and Chair, I was not even told, 
so that’s  what – it keeps on coming and he says 
something else.  Let me tell me what Werksmans is saying 
and why we are on this path that Mr Soni is on.  He said 
something very – I want to ask for a bit, I won’t take long 
but I want to present it to you so that you can understand.  
10 
Those who have accused me, Chair, have said, Riaan van 
der Walt has got – Riaan van der Walt’s firm, Loubser & 
Van Der Walt, as it was called at that time, I think now it’s 
changed had money from Siyangena or rather from TNM 
which is a holding company of Siyangena.  What did they 
place their reliance on, they placed their reliance, let’s go 
to – I want to show it to you Chair, page – where we deal 
with the financial statements…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But and on Mr Montana, to the extent 
that you’re talking about the big picture of saying this is 
20 
the narrative against you by Werksmans and so on and so 
on, that picture, I think I understand.  At this stage, 
remember 
we 
are 
just 
talking 
about 
whether 
that 
attachment, that Annexure is why – the reason for the 
transaction not going through, why it is important. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 83 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But I’m not dealing with the bigger 
picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I want to deal – he said other things 
Chair, and I want to go to that page…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember, at some stage we can 
deal with other things he has said but this particular 
one…[intervenes]. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, this is actually related to this, I 
want to show you the picture and why, in fact, this 
shouldn’t even be admissible, but I want to go to that page 
again Chair, is it 191 or – where we were dealing with the 
properties, I’ve…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but hang on Mr Montana, I think as 
far as the importance is concerned, you might be able to 
answer without even going to the paper. You say the 
reason why the transaction didn’t go through was what the 
bank said, is that right? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, that’s what the bank said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But Chair, I’m saying three things, Chair 
and I’m using this time to object. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 84 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Okay, I’m saying that the – that affidavit 
or that Annexure of that affidavit from the bank, okay from 
the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   It actually shows how I had intended to 
finance that property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But there was a disagreement in terms of 
the number, that’s the first issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   So, it’s very important and material. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But Chair, I just want to use – because I 
let it slide before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I want to show two things, Chair, so that 
you can understand and there’s an affidavit I want to refer 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   On this specific matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So, if you can be patient with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Because I want to drive it now so that we 
can be…[intervenes]. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 85 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MR MONTANA:   So that we can be – Chair so I’ve said 
that 
affidavit 
is 
very 
important, 
it’s 
material 
to 
what…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Annexure to the affidavit. 
MR MONTANA:   The Annexure, that’s one, secondly, I’m 
saying that, today, unlike what I was told yesterday, I’m 
dealing 
with 
evidence 
that 
doesn’t 
come 
from 
this 
Commission where the people were interviewed, deposed 
to affidavits here.  Now, there’s a confirmation that, no 
10 
these documents – so people that I’m fighting with I’m still 
coming to deal with, who actually have tried – who have 
run a very sophisticated intelligence campaign against me.  
Their 
documents 
are 
now 
the 
documents 
of 
the 
Commission.  I was given assurance yesterday, that, no, 
no, no we are the Commission we are not Paul O’Sullivan, 
we are not Werksmans.  Now, 24 hours later, it’s very 
obvious Chair.  Now, I think it shouldn’t be admissible 
Chair that’s a big issue especially after I’ve explained how 
Mr Louis Green, how Mr – and Mrs De Beer were actually 
20 
pressurising making these sworn statements, it was not 
even drafted by them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   The Commission cannot admit them, it 
must have their own statements, that’s the second issue.  
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 86 of 343 
 
The third issue, Chair, my …[indistinct], you know what 
they’ve done? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Mr Soni knows, not only did this 
Commission – and we’ve dealt with the issue about the De 
Beer Commission or rather the Wagner affidavit Chair.  
There’s another affidavit, this affidavit, it was deposed to 
by Siyangena, the CFO, Mr Soni, it’s interesting that he 
read what the CFO of TNM/Siyangena said in court but he 
didn’t read the affidavit of Siyangena which is submitted 
10 
here okay and Chair, I want to ask you quickly that I get 
that page because I want to demonstrate something very 
important Chair, what page is that Mr Soni of the statement 
is it 191 on the – when we were dealing with the properties 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 191 ja. 
MR MONTANA:   191. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I think – let me show something Chair, 
because …[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It must be the other file. 
MR MONTANA:   It must be the other file? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, okay, let me tell you what TNM and 
Siyangena they didn’t only depose of an affidavit in the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 87 of 343 
 
court matter they deposed to an affidavit and submitted to 
the Commission.  That affidavit the CFO says, you are 
talking 
about 
payments 
that 
we 
have 
made 
as 
TNM/Siyangena and I said, we have never made a single 
payment to Precise, okay.  What did they rely on, Chair – 
and Mr Soni knows that okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it’s page 190 to 191. 
MR MONTANA:   192? 
CHAIRPERSON:   On – oh there is 192 as well on Bundle 
G, PRASA Bundle G, yes? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   You see, Chair, TNM/Siyangena deposed 
to an affidavit and says, we as TNM or Siyangena never 
paid a cent to Precise Trade, they say that there’s an 
affidavit here, it’s not been read, it’s not been presented 
here and you know why, Chair,  it’s being withheld, 
because they have been trying to make the courts – and 
now Mr Soni’s taking this narrative to here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   I asked Mr van der Walt, he says, I asked 
him, 
did 
Precise 
Trade 
receive 
money 
from 
20 
TNM/Siyangena, he said, no and then we find that what 
they rely on are the notes that he has made.  I asked him 
what account is this, he says, no, because I was managing 
many firms not from Precise but from the law firm I had – 
and I think Mr – the partner testified here that each partner 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 88 of 343 
 
was in control of certain things.  He said, these are my 
notes to show, for example, that I’m using that money 
against another money and all of those things, at Precise 
okay. 
 
Now, the reason why Mr Soni withhold this vital 
information Chair, is because, like he did with the first one, 
where 
information 
was 
presented, 
he 
then 
wants 
to 
say…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Didn’t they give you a copy of that 
affidavit, the one you’re saying they withheld?  
10 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
No, 
they 
didn’t 
Chair 
it 
was 
actually…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They didn’t? 
MR MONTANA:   No, they didn’t the Commission didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MONTANA:   The Commission didn’t Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And that is why, based on that statement, 
when I saw the statement, I asked the question and I said, 
but there’s a thing and I think that affidavit must come 
20 
here, like this Annexure must come here and be read 
Chair, and you know what it means? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   It means other than the notes – because 
Riaan says, no, no, no I didn’t receive money in my 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 89 of 343 
 
rotating account I robbed Zondo to pay Montana and 
balance my books at the end and I wrote TNM loans, I 
wrote other things that are other notes okay it’s not a 
deposit from TNM.  He says, he just said, Chair, that the 
payment to Precise Trade, the R3.5million was paid for by 
TNM/Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I want to say that, that is false and 
I think that we must – in addition to that we must perhaps 
at the break, call that affidavit read it to what it is and then 
10 
if there is any other evidence of payment other than the 
notes, let them read the accounts and see which accounts 
paid for this amount and they will prove – so Chair, this 
journey that I’m being taken on, on information taken from 
Werksmans to hang me, is made the position of the 
Commission and we are being led on a journey where vital 
evidence that disproves the narrative that has been 
presented here is being withheld deliberately Chair, and I’ll 
never agree to that Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, no, no, no, Mr Montana, well one, I 
20 
don’t believe that that affidavit would have been – would 
not have featured because we are not done yet, but Mr 
Soni will deal with that I don’t believe that we were going 
to finish without it being dealt with…[intervenes]. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, all the documents on 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 90 of 343 
 
properties are in these two files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it’s not there? 
MR MONTANA:   It’s not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And it was not brought to my attention, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Because I asked, and you know why I 
10 
asked, Chair, is because there was a particular Tweet 
made last night and I then wanted to check, and I then 
discovered there was this particular issue.  Now, I realise, 
so I said the first part, I don’t want to fight it, let me see 
where we are going. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But now Chair, I’m now dealing – I’m not 
at the Commission of Inquiry to State Capture I’m now – 
Werksmans 
didn’t 
interview 
me, 
they 
put 
certain 
statements in courts and the Commission is subjecting me, 
20 
Chair, why must I agree to that, why must I sit here and 
answer the – he’s just confirmed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, I think too, with regard to the 
issue of the Annexure if attempts can be made to find it 
from Ms De Beer or whoever those attempts should be 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 91 of 343 
 
made for purposes of Mr Montana but I note that, based on 
what Mr Soni has said about the reason or the importance 
of the reason for the deal not going through for purposes 
of the legal team, it’s really not important but if you think 
it’s important for your version, I think attempts must be 
made to find it. If it’s found it’s found if it’s not found it’s 
not found but attempts should be made. 
MR MONTANA:   But Chair, I support that first point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But what it tells you about all the 
10 
documents that we have, I’m saying, Chair, I’m making – 
you’ve ruled on the first one, I’m happy with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But let’s find it but we are finding an 
Annexure on documents that are not the Commission’s 
documents, you asked Mr Soni here Chair, you said to him, 
Mr Soni do you know the relevance of this, he says, no we 
have uplifted them.  Chair, I’m making now an application, 
maybe that’s when I need my – now my legal team to be 
here to draft an application that, all these documents that 
20 
were 
uplifted 
from 
Werksmans 
that 
are 
not 
the 
Commission’s documents, are not admissible Chair, to this 
Commission, unless if the people who made them, the 
Commission’s legal team can make sure that they put 
together proper affidavits and they put them – or else, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 92 of 343 
 
Chair, I do not – I’ll fight Werksmans as well but I don’t 
want to fight within the Commission, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no let me explain this part, Mr 
Montana.  It’s critically important that the Commission does 
the best it can in investigating the issues that it is 
investigating that’s point number one.  Point number two, 
obviously it has to operate within such constraints as it 
might have including time and so on.  Point number three, 
it is entitled, if it becomes aware, that somebody is in 
possession of information or documents that may be 
10 
relevant to what it is investigating it’s entitled to or it may 
be obliged to obtain that information and look at it.  So, I 
therefore, don’t think that there would be a source of 
information where the Commission would say, oh if it 
comes from so and so we won’t even look at it.  I think that 
the approach should be, if it’s relevant to what the 
Commission is investigating, let’s have a look and then 
let’s have a look, consider it on its merits.  If we don’t 
think much of it, we don’t think it’s helpful that’s it.  If we 
think it’s helpful let’s have a look at it but of course there 
20 
may be situations where somebody who wrote some 
document might have to be called and so on and so on.  
So, I just mentioned that so that you understand, indeed, 
the Commission has obtained information from various 
sources. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 93 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, thank you for the assurance but I 
don’t want to ask to put plaster over cracks on this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   I respect, Chair, you are trying to move 
us forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I said Chair, when the Commission – I 
said it yesterday, when the Commission went to collect 
documents from court which Mr Oellermann used for his 
report, he left out my version, Chair and this is not 
10 
because the Commission is coming to an end, this was 
done last year, Chair, that’s the first issue.  I’m happy the 
Commission looks at all the documents, including my 
documents Chair, including those, all of those – remember 
I quoted a statement that the Commission can never be the 
voice of the accusers it must balance and look at both the 
accused and the accusers, Chair.  Now, in this particular 
instance, we’ve got very important things, so Chair, I agree 
fully with you, the documents that becomes available, the 
Commission becomes aware that there are documents vital 
20 
for the Commission to fulfil its role, I accept that Chair but 
here’s a Commission Chair, despite your assurance, is 
doing the opposite of what you.[indistinct].  It’s making out, 
it’s 
sneaking 
in 
documents 
okay 
and 
leaving 
other 
documents out okay, for example, I forced that the affidavit 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 94 of 343 
 
of Mr Wagner be read, Mr Soni says it’s not important, I 
said, read it and you know what he tells you Chair, that 
affidavit you know what it tells us, it tells us that Mr 
Wagner who’s got no relationship to PRASA entered into an 
agreement, he deposed to an affidavit, he said it’s a good 
property development that we are looking at, all the 
documents 
were 
submitted 
yesterday 
and 
have 
been 
admitted, Chair, I forced that Chair.  Now, here the 
Commission and the country is made to believe that, in fact 
the R3.5million was paid for by TNM okay.  TNM then put 
10 
the statement to say, no, we didn’t make such a payment 
and our bank never – and they asked this Commission I 
think, for the provision of that and you know it’s kept out 
Chair, precisely because it is kept out.  It then supports a 
narrative 
based, 
not 
on 
bank 
statements, 
based 
on 
handwritten notes of someone who says, I’m – and I think 
that there are many handwritten notes there beyond where 
he says, I’m paying this against that.  Chair, that affidavit 
like 
the 
Annexure 
is 
material 
and 
it 
enables 
the 
Commission to look at things in a round.  Now, we are 
20 
being – Mr Soni says…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me allow Mr Soni to …[intervenes]. 
MR MONTANA:   Let me make my last statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Mr Soni keeps – or the Commission 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 95 of 343 
 
rather, so that I don’t become personal, keeps that affidavit 
that says TNM/Siyangena didn’t pay okay.  Yet comes here 
Chair, 
being 
aware 
of 
that 
affidavit 
and 
makes 
the 
statement Chair and says TNM paid and what is that based 
on, it’s not – we said follow the money but this one notes 
that Werksmans presented to say we believe that this 
money may be coming from TNM.  Chair, today, we are all 
here, this Commission has got capacity let us put it on the 
table.   Yesterday, you knew Chair, I asked you to say let’s 
play the clip, I was not allowed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Let us put – where this R3.5million comes 
from, account wise and let us put the account of TNM and 
see the correlation because this – what is putting through 
to me Chair, is putting us to tell the country that TNM paid 
when it’s actually false and the reason why it’s an 
annexure, it is not put in there Chair it is actually to – it is 
supported by a particular narrative.   I am insisting Chair 
that they put here in total we discuss the matter in full 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no the affidavit – let me allow Mr 
20 
Soni to respond to this. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairman let me first of all say the 
transactional account and the letters written by Mr van der 
Walt were revealed for the first time by the ...[indistinct – 
dropping voice].  Werksmans had nothing to do with it, they 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 96 of 343 
 
conducted their investigations and they are not aware of.  
Mr 
Loubser 
came 
and 
gave 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission indicating where they got this from and how 
the few ledgers from Mr van der Walt were obtained. 
 
Now that was all contained in Mr Oellermann’s 
affidavit.  I just want to – because Mr Montana has kept 
making accusations against the Commission and especially 
the manner in which it has conducted itself, it is important 
Chairperson because at page 32, and I would like Mr 
Montana to look at it so that he follows. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page – sorry, Bundle 8 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 8.  While you are looking let me 
just say something Mr Montana about the statement you 
made that yesterday you asked for a clip to be played and 
you were not allowed, I am not sure that it is correct to say 
you were not allowed, but this is what I think happened 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Chairperson sorry ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I said Mr Soni at that stage his question 
20 
related to what Mr Oellermann said or didn’t say in his 
report and I said he was still going to come to the question 
of what he – what you say in your document he said too at 
the  hearing, and I said if there was – if it is necessary we 
could look at that, so ...[intervenes]

MR MONTANA:   I apologise Chair, I accept your summary 
is correct, that is what happened, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Bundle 8 what page 
Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Page 30 Chairperson.  
MR MONTANA:   Chair is it possible to ask for a quick 
comfort break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, we are three minutes ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   I am dancing here.   Just for three 
minutes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s take five minutes, ja, let’s 
adjourn for five minutes. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Soni.   
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson I am just dealing now with the 
procedure adopted in relation to the allegations.  At page 30 
paragraph – oh sorry let us start at page 29.  We – earlier 
we deal with Mr Montana who was served with a copy of the 
report together with the annexures. 
20 
 
“And at page – paragraph 105 the – 
among the more important role players are 
Mr Van Der Walt who next to Montana or 
perhaps alongside him was the principle 
figure 
in 
the 
four 
transactions. 
 
Bank 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 98 of 343 
 
statements of Precise Trade the vehicle 
through which the deals were facilitated for 
principally 
funded 
confirms 
Mr 
Van 
Der 
Walt’s direct involvement in each transaction. 
 
And 
the 
next 
paragraph 
what 
is 
missing are details of his relationship with Mr 
Montana nor does he provide an explanation 
of how the whole scheme was conceived and 
what the end gain was. 
 
Then at paragraph 108 – oh sorry 107 
10 
we say:  Another significant role player 
certainly in regard to providing finance is 
TMM. In this regard – in this regard the 
commission’s investigators are aware of a 
contract between TMM and Mario Ferreira on 
the one hand and Mr Van Der Walt on the 
other.  It is hoped Mr Loubser deals with this 
in his affidavit. 
 
And then at page 109 we say:  In 
addition Mr Van Der Walt refers to payment 
20 
made towards some of the purchases by 
TMM.  It appeared to be confirmed by entries 
made in Invest Trades Investment Bank 
account.  Given the four properties it is 
submitted that there are serious questions 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 99 of 343 
 
about Mr Ferreira’s relationship with Mr 
Montana and his reasons for providing such 
huge sums to fund property transactions 
involving the CEO for Public Entity. 
 
At page – paragraph 111:  A copy of 
this report and other relevant documents will 
be emailed to Mr Ferreira with an initial 
invitation to deal with the matters concerning 
him, TMM and Siyangena. 
 
And we deal with other role players. 
10 
 
Then at paragraph 115 it is said a 
number of question arise about Mr Montana.  
Monday 00:03:13 the following what was his 
relationship with Mr Van Der Walt?  How was 
the whole scheme to sell his Parkwood 
property 
and 
purchase 
the 
other 
three 
properties conceived?  How did he fund the 
purchases of the properties?  Copy of this 
report and other relevant documents will be 
emailed 
to 
Mr 
Montana 
with 
an 
initial 
20 
invitation to him to deal with those and other 
relevant matters. 
 
Plus the report will be sent to other 
persons mentioned again with an invitation to 
respond 
to 
its 
contents 
insofar 
as 
it 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 100 of 343 
 
implicates them. 
 
And then page – paragraph 117. A 
number of matters are raised in this report 
about the four property transactions.  The 
persons mentioned who are in some way or 
the 
other 
either 
participated 
in 
the 
transactions or facilitated them have been 
invited to set out their versions. 
 
Paragraph 119.  After their responses 
are received a further report will be compiled 
10 
and submitted.” 
 
Now Chairperson Mr Montana seems to refer to an 
affidavit by Siyangena.  I do not have it in here but what I do 
recall and we are checking on that is after this report was 
filed on Siyangena they made an application to cross-
examine Mr Oellerman.  They said they then went to do 
forensic investigations in respect of the different matters. 
 
They want to assist Mr Oellerman.  To the best of my 
knowledge and again I say this has come as a surprise we 
have not received anything from Siyangena beyond that 
20 
application made in terms of 3.3 and 3.4. 
 
The commission responded to that application.  The 
purpose of that application as set out in their application was 
they did not want the hearing of the commission to effect the 
Siyangena hearings in the High Court.  That is what the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 101 of 343 
 
stated purpose was.  And that as I understand it in any case 
did not take place then it took place at a later date. 
 
So I say all of this Chairperson because it is said we 
were selective.  This report was served. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry it is said… 
ADV SONI SC:  We are selective in the documents and what 
we submit.  This report was served on Mr Montana in June 
last year.  We have not received anything in writing from Mr 
Montana.  That is why the 10.6’s needed to be served on him 
in relation in particular to this report. From TMM as I said to 
10 
the best of my knowledge and if something had come up I 
would have been told about it. We have not received the so 
called forensic investigations they did if they did any. 
 
They took a technical point Chairperson that the 
matter had been served on Mr Ferreira but not for – or had 
been served on Siyangena but not on TMM and so on.  We 
responded to that in relation to the 3.4 situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so is the position that you are not 
aware of the affidavit that Mr Montana is talking about? 
ADV SONI SC:    Where there is a denial of this – well 
20 
certainly since the forensic investigations are…here there is 
a 
denial 
of 
this 
– 
well 
certainly 
since 
the 
forensic 
investigations are… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no Mr Montana says he is aware that 
the commission has in its possession an affidavit by 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 102 of 343 
 
somebody from either TMM or Siyangena? 
MR MONTANA:  The CFO Chair.  The CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The CFO. 
MR MONTANA:  The CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is his name? 
MR MONTANA:  Tom – What is Tom’s surname?  I remember 
the surname Chair but he is the CFO of TMM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It was the CFO of TMM. 
MR MONTANA:  Siyangena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And in that affidavit you say he says 
10 
TMM never paid any money. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Precise Trade connected with you. 
MR MONTANA:  And Riaan it confirmed the same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And so – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – let us pause it there.  So you 
are not aware of any such affidavit? 
MR MONTANA:  Chairperson I do not have the affidavit in 
my head at the moment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – the one I am aware of is that 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  There is an affidavit in support of the 3.3 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 103 of 343 
 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do you know whether they dealt with 
that in that affidavit? 
ADV SONI SC:  I – I am just trying to get confirmation of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they – if they were seeking to 
leave to cross-examine anybody they would need to put up 
their version. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that that is the affidavit that – 
10 
that application you said it was for leave to cross-examine. 
ADV SONI SC:  To cross-examine Mr Oellerman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  What happened to it? 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson we submitted – when I say we 
the commission submitted an answering affidavit in that 
regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The legal team. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  But beyond that you… 
ADV SONI SC:  I am not too sure. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mentioned also that the – there was – 
they wanted to say the commission should not hear certain 
evidence prior to the High Court hearing. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is – they did not want Mr Oellermann’s 
report to be presented to the commission. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 104 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja before? 
ADV SONI SC:  That was part of it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well if – if you could refresh your 
memory on that application so that one can see whether it 
was decided on or not decided or whether certain issues 
were raised. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I do seem to recall that there was some 
application but I cannot remember – are there – there have 
been so – there are so many applications that one has dealt 
10 
with I cannot remember each one – I cannot remember what 
the position is but I would like to – to know whether a 
decision was made on it or not – not yet or whatever. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you have a copy of that 
affidavit? 
MR MONTANA:  No not with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have.   
MR MONTANA:  Not with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Soni has it attempts will be 
20 
made to try and establish if there is such an affidavit.  Well 
certainly the application one. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think – I think the Secretariat must be 
asked to check.  It is just that it will be easier if we know the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 105 of 343 
 
surname of the CFO.  When you do remember  
ADV SONI SC:  I think it is Mr Dubeck Chair. 
MR MONTANA:  Dubeck. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MONTANA:  I think it is Dubeck. 
ADV SONI SC:  I think it is Dubeck. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so I think – I think the legal team 
should ask the Secretariat to check if there is such an 
affidavit.  So – so that it can be looked at.  So I think Mr – 
what Mr Soni is saying Mr Montana is he cannot say such an 
10 
affidavit does not exist but he is not aware of it other than 
the 
– 
such 
affidavit 
as 
may 
have 
accompanied 
the 
application for leave to cross-examine.  So bearing in mind 
that in an application for leave to cross-examine that is me 
now talking it is likely that they would have put up their 
version and obviously if they knew that there was an issue 
about whether they made any payments to Precise Trade 
they might – they would have had to deal with that.  But I 
think rather than speculate let us get that affidavit in relation 
to the application and let us get this Secretariat to check is if 
20 
there is any other affidavit from – by the same person and 
then we will take it from there.  And then whatever is 
obtained will be shared with you Mr Montana. 
ADV SONI SC:  It was – may I make one other point? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 106 of 343 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Montana is to say now that he had talked 
to Mr Van Der Walt.  We do not know when he has done that.  
The importance of that Chairperson is that Mr Van Der Walt 
this report was emailed to Mr Van Der Walt wherever he is in 
Texas as we understand it.  Mr Van Der Walt has not taken 
the trouble to present his version.  He knows what we were 
going to present to him and so we have nothing from him.  
His partner came and gave evidence on the basis that they 
accepted in good faith what is contained in his letters 
because those letters were in response to concerns they had 
10 
raised with him.  So this notion that there is – there are 
these loose documents and what is important Chairperson is 
in none of these two letters that Mr Van Der Walt writes does 
he say there look man what is reflected as my notes may not 
be correct.  He in fact says these are the payments with no 
qualification made.  He presents the transactional account to 
them.  So we would like to know to where did the money 
come from? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well let me just say this so you – you 
know Mr Montana.  I do recall that at some stage I think 
20 
there was the question whether since Mr Van Der Walt is – 
cannot be compelled to come here or even to depose to an 
affidavit when he is outside of South Africa whether some 
documents should be given to them and I said even if he 
cannot be compelled if we can if we know where he is he 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 107 of 343 
 
should be given the documents – he should be asked for his 
version. If he does not comply there is nothing we can do but 
he should be.  So I just want to mention that I certainly said 
that should be done and from what Mr Soni says it was done.  
So ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair can I address you?  Thank you Chair.  
You know – you know Chair I listened to Mr Soni and I think 
that he – he made statement.  Now this last statement we do 
not know who paid. 
 
Before I intervened that TMM paid Chair I spoke to 
10 
Riaan when the matter went to court.  It was in the country 
and let us leave Riaan Van Der Walt on the side.   
 
Let us deal we said the method of investigating 
corruption is a flow of money.  All on the track of money.  
Chair. Now here the money does not show notes are now 
being accepted. A note that is written Chair and I ask Riaan 
what did you mean by this?  Okay.   
 
Chair I think that – I think that I want to put it here Mr 
Soni does not know who paid and he says he does not know 
and thirty minutes ago he said these monies are paid for by 
20 
TMM. 
 
Chair I am – I want to say I have said before firstly 
they are false and that is why Chair it is not a mistake that 
they want to deal with four properties that are not my 
properties but that is someone else properties.  And then – 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 108 of 343 
 
and then keep things that are there. 
 
But let me just quickly mention Chair page 32 – 
30 118. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  The persons mentioned who in some way of 
the other – of the other – or the other participated in the 
transactions or facilitated them have been invited to set out 
their versions. 
 
Mr Soni says I have been invited to set out my 
version and that is why Chair I refused in July.  Chair that is 
10 
not true.  In fact on our first day here I said – I indicated to 
the Chair that when I was served the 10.6 I rejected.  I said 
the Chair is unlawful.   
 
Chair my first affidavit was given to this commission 
in – in August 2019 and I addressed the issue of properties 
exactly what I said here you – when you look at my first draft 
this commission tried to curtail my evidence Chair and what 
they were trying to do they were trying to get me to speak to 
certain things and tell me others are outside of the Terms of 
Reference.  Werksmans I was told Chair Werksmans or 
20 
Werksmans whatever it is called I was told it is outside the 
Terms of Reference of this commission – 00:18:47 by this 
commission. 
 
The reason why I did not appear for almost two years 
Chair this commission had tried to terminate and limit my 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 109 of 343 
 
response.  So when they served me with 3 – Rule 3.3 
Notices I said but I prepared an affidavit and I address all 
those issues.  And if indeed the commission is of the view 
that I did not address some of the Rule 3.3 let me know and 
then I will supplement.  But I believe that if you look at my 
comprehensive – at that time I – my first draft to the 
commission Chair was about 245 pages.  So I addressed my 
properties.   
I did not need the commission to serve me with a 
notice when I volunteered to come I knew that one of the 
10 
public issues being raised was the issue about properties 
and I said I am going to assist the commission with 
information. 
 
So Chair I want to say that Mr Soni knows that is not 
true.  There is – in my affidavit I have attached all my 
correspondence and in my first day Chair I spoke openly 
about it how my relationship – I have had a bad relationship 
with this commission because it has tried on numerous 
occasions and I was surprised Chair by the way when you 
asked you say Mr Montana you have written a letter to me – 
20 
you referred to a letter of 26 July 2019.  And I said the Chair 
has not seen the letter.  Yes I wrote the letter and I directed 
it to the Chair. 
 
So Chair the issue about the response about 210.6 I 
even spoke to some of the people in the legal department of 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 110 of 343 
 
the commission I said how do you guys mislead the Chair to 
issue a 10.6 regulation against me.  I will not honour it and if 
the Chair is fair – I used those words in an email to the 
commission – if the Chair is fair he will want to understand 
my side of the story.   And you what I was saying in that 
story Chair in simple terms I said I will address each and 
every allegation made against me okay and those I have 
addressed even in a specific way in my affidavit.   
 
Chair the – by the way this – these allegations 
against me whilst they are old they were made here in the 
10 
commission eight months after I have presented my draft 
statement which addressed the very same issues. 
 
So – so number 1 Chair on 10.6 Chair the – Mr Soni 
knows it is not true.   
Secondly Chair so in 118 I was there – I was the key 
person – I was served with 3.3.  Oellerman spoke to all other 
people he never spoke to me Chair because he never had an 
interest.   
Thirdly 
Chair 
Oellerman 
says 
I 
am 
basing 
my 
documents on court – on court papers.  Court papers on 
20 
these matters of Siyangena Chair at that time when he called 
the information actually records the fact that Siyangena and 
TMM had actually said we never paid a cent to this company. 
Yet it is being – it is being pushed in the way that it 
has.  He says Chair – Mr Soni Mr Loubser’s affidavit will 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 111 of 343 
 
deal with it.  Chair Mr Loubser’s affidavit does not deal with 
it actually it does not – it just referred to – it is actually 
dealing with the process on the law firm and not this – these 
allegations because he said we did not know about them.  
We are learning them about for the first time.   
Now Chair the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
MR MONTANA:  Chair let me – I just noted four points just to 
complete them quickly Chair.  The – the – he caused the 
report where they say the relationship and you can see he is 
10 
speculating there Chair. 
 
But I think Chair when Mr Soni made the statement 
and said TMM paid okay this commission has got a very 
simple task it has got investigators Chair.  Let us go to the 
bank and get the accounts the bank accounts of TMM and 
see the very same process he has been taking me through 
and can you see that I am 00:22:53 to that.  It will show 
Chair – it will show that in fact no such payment and I have 
satisfied myself around that. 
 
What is based on Chair it is based on what Mr Soni 
20 
has been trying to do. To takes notes – now he said in the 
statement there are certain things Mr Van Der Merwe said in 
his statement sorry rather in his letter to his partners but 
those are not reflected in the statements. 
 
Now if that is the case it tells us that there were 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 112 of 343 
 
other activities and probably other accounts at play not only 
one account.   
 
Now they are ignoring bank statements and the facts 
what they are trying to do they are trying and Riaan said it 
very clear they say no I am dealing with a lot of people 
including investors and other things into my company I work 
– I handle the issue of properties for the company there.  So 
when I do I pay Peter and – I rob Peter to pay Paul and visa 
versa depending on the availability of cash in my account. 
 
Now and I – I then suspect that the reason why he 
10 
wrote TMM loan it means he says if I have got this amount of 
money in our account okay I use it, pay back and all of those 
things.  Now Chair the issue is we then need to confirm.  
Follow the money.  The money must say – it says two things.  
It says 3.5 was paid by TMM.  I ask; TMM says no it is not 
us, we have never paid that amount – that money. 
 
It then says TMM paid 7.5 okay.  That again is also 
not true.  Mr Soni as he is building towards this point 
because I know Chair – I know because I know – I have been 
through this before.  I know where he is heading to and I am 
20 
allowing him to continue asking the point because I know 
where the falsehoods lie. 
 
Because for the past six years I have been accused 
of these kind of things.  Now Chair I think the other than all 
these things there are three specific questions.   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 113 of 343 
 
 
Where is that affidavit and I think we need to get to 
today probably lunch time and read it like we did with the 
Wagner one. 
 
Let us get the actual bank accounts so that what Mr 
Soni is saying – what Werksmans is saying – what Mr Pieter 
Louis Myburgh is saying we can show for example that they 
are not true. 
 
And thirdly Chair I think that Mr Soni should either 
change his statement or withdraw because he says he does 
not know – he cannot say to you it was paid by this and he 
10 
says he does not know.  It is not true Chair it is false. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay Mr Montana.  Let – just 
remember that Mr Soni is – has no personal knowledge of 
whatever happened. When he says if he said so this amount 
was paid by TMM my understanding of what he is saying is it 
would appear from these documents that this is what 
happened and giving you an opportunity to say no but that is 
not true and this is why it is not true. 
 
So he does not have personal knowledge of who paid 
what – when he looks at the documents and then says as I 
20 
understand these documents I understand them to reflect 
that so and so paid so much to so and so on such and such 
a date, what do you say?  That is my understanding of what 
he is saying. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I – Chair I am afraid – I am afraid 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 114 of 343 
 
Chair and I want to ask respectfully Chair Mr Soni said after  
he realised that I sold my house – remember that question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MONTANA:  He said I can conclude and put it to you that 
this was not a property transaction it was something else.  
Okay.  He says that based on what he has seen Chair.  Okay. 
And then she comes and make a different – another 
statement.   
 
Now Chair I will tell you that if Mr Soni and the team 
were assisting you and putting all the facts before you and 
10 
not jump and I want to say that he has been selective Chair.  
You can see Chair that this property story and I should not 
have agreed to it Chair with hindsight I should not have 
agreed I accepted your guidance.  I should have insisted that 
my affidavit be dealt with in full.  Because I have said there 
is bias – there is predetermined agenda.  It is playing itself 
out here Chair and I am being asked about documents that 
have been lifted not the investigations of the commission 
and I want to tell – I want to say to this commission I have 
said Chair that when I came here and I want to repeat the 
20 
statement consistently.  When I came here I was told that 
Montana paid for properties R36 million and these were paid 
for by his – by a contracted party to PRASA. 
 
I said that is false.  And I then indicated the details of 
these transactions and how I was able to pay for 1,2,3.  That 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 115 of 343 
 
is one Chair. 
 
We are no longer talking about the R3 million – the 
36 million.  We have moved to something else.  Okay.  Now 
we come to this issue and you can see Chair that what he is 
getting at – what he is getting at in this statement is the – it 
is not the money in the account it is the handwritten notes 
because those are suggest – those are – that is why he says 
these have not been denied by Mr Riaan Van Der Walt but 
those are not transactions – they are notes – handwritten 
notes Chair.  And unless if he know what was in the mind of 
10 
that person he would not be able to say for certainty I take 
that as it is.  And he – he meant it Chair.  As evidence leader 
I said it yesterday Mr Soni you have got a duty to assist the 
Chair towards finding the truth.  Now you are peddling – you 
are peddling you know what are effectively stories that have 
been created by other people outside and that is why Chair I 
actually object Chair to all these documents that have been 
lifted I will never Chair agree to answer questions based on 
documents that have been lifted. I want that affidavit to be 
here to be read so that the commission – the Chair can have 
20 
the total picture of what – of what it is. 
 
So his response I reject Chair I do not accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – for the lunch break. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Soni shall we – will you say whatever 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 116 of 343 
 
you wish to say when we come back or do you want to… 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no I will say it when we come back – just 
let me check what the.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When we come ja.  Yes okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  What the documents say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at nearly twenty five past one let 
us resume at half past two.   
ADV SONI SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue.  You were going, 
Mr Soni, to say something in response to what Mr Montana 
had said before lunch.  You may do so but I want to plant 
this idea that in order to make sure that we make progress, 
it may well be that your team should note the things that 
Mr Montana has said around the criticism that he has 
articulated but maybe not respond now.  We carry on, 
trying to finish what we have to do and then at some stage 
20 
when it is done, you can then deal with all the criticism and 
so on so that we make progress otherwise, we get held up. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  Let us do that.  But 
it is important that your team members, your team note all 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 117 of 343 
 
the criticism, all the concerns that Mr Montana has 
mentioned. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that they can be looked at on their 
merits at some stage later. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   May I, though, raise one point to this 
and we have a resourceful... [Speaker ’s microphone is not 
working properly – speaker unclear] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just pull the mic closer to you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...managed to get the email that 
Mr Montana was concerned about from Ms De Beer.  May I 
just have leave to hand that up?  That will just clear 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...one small part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine, that is fine. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   At least we know that we can 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...we can attend to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 118 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   If I could just read into the record 
what the email says and then perhaps you should give it an 
exhibit number if we want to admit it but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, starting with who it is from and who 
it was addressed to. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, as you please. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what the subject matter is. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the date, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you will see, Chairperson, based 
on what is contained in paragraph 3 of Ms De Beer ’s 
affidavit, the reference is J ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ..BQ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want us to link it with what page and 
what bundle? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page – oh, sorry, Chairperson.  
Bundle – page – Bundle 8, SS-18, page 121. 
CHAIRPERSON:   121.  Oh, that is Ms De Beer ’s affidavit? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Affidavit.  We are just going to finish 
that very quickly but I thought ...[intervenes]  
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 119 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...to clear that up, that will help, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, can I object? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are you objecting to before he 
reads it? 
MR MONTANA:   Because this is – no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MONTANA:   I am glad that this is here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But let us not regularise something that is 
irregular. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I want to hear what he has to 
say about it first.  What are you talking about? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, but I am saying that we are even 
giving it a number and everything when we are supposed to 
deal with it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I have not given it any number. 
MR MONTANA:   He was mentioning the number, Chair. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And I have said once I have read it 
in, we can decide whether we want to admit it as an 
affidavit – as an annexure, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So let him read – let me see what it is.  
He can explain.  And let me hear what he says.  Then, if 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 120 of 343 
 
you have something to say, then you can say it. 
MR MONTANA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I was merely saying, Chairperson, 
that when one looks at the title given to the document, it is 
Annexure KDB-2.  It is the same one referred to in 
paragraph 3.  That is the one Mr Montana was concerned 
about.  And this is an email from Ms Ursula Willis dated the 
11 t h of March 2013 to bookings@armani(?).  That is 
obviously Ms De Beer ’s company and CC’d is Mr Montana 
10 
and the subject is:  Mr TL Montana, address(?) for 
valuation centre.  And it says: 
“Hi, Daniel. 
There is the address for a copy of the 
approved plans. 
However, the valuation you provided us with 
from is from 2009. 
Since then the property prices have changed. 
I spoke to Nolene and the Regional Head, 
William ...[indistinct] and they will not be able 
20 
to 
value 
the 
property 
for 
more 
than 
R 7.5 million based on the current market 
conditions. 
Due to this, I do not want you to waste your 
time dropping off the plans. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 121 of 343 
 
We will not be value for any more than we 
have...” 
 
And it is – signed by – or sent by Ms Willis.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying this is the annexure 
that is referred to in Ms De Beer ’s paragraph...  Is it para 
2? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Paragraph 3, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, paragraph 3. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   On the second line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That Mr Montana was saying it should be 
10 
who is in content? [Speaker not clear] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Before we proceed.  Mr Montana, 
do you want to say something? 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I am glad this thing is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Because again, this email is so material 
in two respects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   The first one is the fact that it shows how 
20 
the first plan around for buying this property was me 
approaching the bank.  That is why – this email from 
Ursula Willis.  Secondly, it confirms the point I was making 
that the reason why did not proceed is not because of any 
shenanigans.  It is precisely because the bank refused to 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 122 of 343 
 
value this property for more than seven point five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Well, I think the bank was wrong but that 
is immaterial.  The factual evidence before us.  It tells us 
the story, Chair.  Now if you take this out of the equation 
okay?  Then you are going to tell us about the fact that we 
were doing in isiZulu [speaking vernacular].  So you are 
keeping this out because you are trying to say:  No, no 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but hang on Mr Montana.  I know 
10 
what you think about its absence earlier.  You have told me 
that but now it is here.  You have no problem that we admit 
it? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  That is the second issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what do you say? 
MR MONTANA:   The second issue Chair is about – I know 
you are giving a directly from how the team should be 
dealing with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, you are sitting with a chap who is 
20 
very unhappy here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   And I am not going to let it go, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I am afraid, Chair, you have to 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 123 of 343 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  You have got to put your 
side, put how your concerns ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, as Mr Soni spoke earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   I said, of course, we have said that the 
statement from Ms De Beer ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, the affidavit. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   The – no, it is not the affidavit, Chair.  It 
is a sworn statement in the matter in court.  It is not a 
state – it is not an affidavit deposed to, to the Commission, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no it is not a – it is a – on the face 
of it, it is an affidavit.  A sworn statement and an affidavit 
is the same thing. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Not ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...probably made it to the Commission. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, it was not for this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, I ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   And therefore ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 124 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   And therefore, the issue that I have 
raised before.  I said the admissibility of all these 
documents that were lifted(?) that they are not the – you 
have made the point and I have accepted it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Look, when we investigate, we look at 
everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Here it is not looking at everything.  It is 
the Commission placing reliance on these documents that I 
10 
even say beyond that are improperly obtained.  So I am 
saying, Chair, that for now we know this document until 
such time, Chair, that overall with all these documents, as 
you have now directed, that you look at this document and 
satisfy yourself.   
 
And I am saying, Chair, that they undermine the 
impact on the very integrity of this Commission.  It is like 
something is being sneaked in for an agenda even if that is 
not so, it says that.  And I think that Chairperson should 
not take this lightly.  So I am saying Chair that is the next 
20 
step for now until you have made the determination we 
noted.   
 
I knew this email, Chair.  That is why I could not 
provide it because I am replying here.  But let me make, 
Chair, the second point that I think it very important.   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 125 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   I am going to continue with evidence, 
Chair, responding to being taken through this document.  
Mr Soni said, did not say Siyangena or TMM only paid.  He 
said we know that.  Now we know that, is he speaking on 
behalf of the Legal Team?  Is he referring to the 
Commission?   
 
Chair, the fact of the matter is that, for us to 
proceed now with this document and this thing that is 
based on lies, I think the Chair should request – I am 
10 
willing – I am not happy but I am willing to come here 
again tomorrow Chair.  We get this affidavit and we get the 
bank statements, Chair, because the crux of why we are 
sitting here centres on what Mr Soni has said – was 
dealing with about who funded these properties.   
 
You remember yesterday, and this will be my last 
point, Chair.  Yesterday I explained.  I said when you look 
at Precise Trade, it is quite clear from the very statement 
that I have been presented that there a lot of people, there 
are a lot of investors in there.  And you can even see on 
20 
some of the notes.  This Commission has jumped all of 
those.   
 
Chair, and I am speaking on the strength of what 
has been asked from me.  That there are other people 
involved.  Now the question arises.  The lie of this is that 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 126 of 343 
 
TMM/Siyangena paid and I am making a submission that 
they did not pay, Chair.  I have checked and I am satisfied 
with the information and we think that if Mr Soni says 
Siyangena or TMM paid to Precise Trade.   
 
Chair, we have to put this thing on the table now 
before I even proceed with all of this because I cannot 
answer on – because this thing – the whole thing is based 
on a lie, Chair.  And I do not see how I am even going to 
participate in it.  I am going to sit, listen Chair.  I want to 
help the Chair.  I think it is either we do what we did 
10 
yesterday.   
 
Chair, get that affidavit, number one.  The Chair 
get the basis of that statement that Mr Soni has said, 
okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   We put them on the table.  And finally, 
Chair.  He says, Mr Soni, that they have replied, they have 
responded to the statement of the application by TMM and 
Siyangena but Chair I have then been furnished – as a 
person – I am probably the, as the word goes, the number 
20 
one accused and... accused has not been.  Even if we were 
in a criminal court, Chair, I just – my legal team will stand 
up and say:  We are not given these documents.  We are 
seeing them for the first time.  And a good judge will say 
the matter is dismissed.  Go home, Mr Montana.   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 127 of 343 
 
 
So Chair, I am saying I do not want us to jump 
and proceed.  I know, Chair, that you are saying study(?) 
but the issue of the payment is so central that it affects 
about how we deal with the remainder of this fact.  So I am 
prepared, Chair, until late tonight if we get.  I know that 
you have got an afternoon session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But my request, Chair, will be that this is 
so fundamental, it has got a bearing on how I am going to 
be asked this question, Chair.  Mr Soni says ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   ...before him there is a corrupt man 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take this step by step, okay.  Now 
with regard to this document. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni can reflect on how it – how he 
wishes it to be dealt with.  One approach is for it to be 
admitted separately.  Another approach is for it to be 
slotted behind Ms De Beer ’s affidavit on the basis that it is 
20 
where it is supposed to have been.  Of course, you might 
have to collect another possible approach on that.  Those 
are the two that come to my mind.  Admitting anything does 
not necessarily mean what is written there is true. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 128 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a separate issue.  So when it 
comes to the other documents we are talking about, I get 
the impression that part of your concern, maybe the main 
concern is that, you are saying, what is contained in those 
documents, or at least some of it, is not true and that is 
part of your concern.  But in addition to that, you still have 
this concern about the affidavit that you were talking about 
before lunch.  Now let me ask.  During the lunch break, 
was the Secretariat asked to look for it?  They might not 
find it so quickly.   
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We have found it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have found it? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Are there enough copies? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Well, why – I think, why do 
you not hand it up?  Give him a copy and then we can take 
it from there.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am stopping, Mr Montana.  I am not 
20 
continuing because I did not know that it has been found.  
So the fact that it has been found might affect what we are 
going to do next.  So I am not continuing with what I 
wanted to say. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 129 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Except, Chair, that – on two things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I agree with you Chair that – you know 
this email supports my version, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I should be jumping and say let it be 
admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So when you say that it can be admitted 
10 
separately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Maybe Chair that there is something that I 
can live with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But Chair, your summary of what my 
problem is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...about these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, is not complete. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   It is not complete, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Let me indicate what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I am saying – and you remember I raised 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 130 of 343 
 
the issue about fairness, that the Commission has to 
evaluate evidence on both sides. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And then come - the Chairperson will 
come to a determination.  That I respect, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   What we are having now, Chair.  Because 
the evidence leader is an extension of the Commission.  He 
is assisting the Commission in completing the job.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   The Commission, therefore, has now 
enter the arena.  It is boxing with me Chair.  That is the 
issue.  The Commission has accepted a particular version 
which is false. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Now I am not saying it must except the 
true version but what the Commission should do is to say 
that all the people are making allegations against Montana, 
let them find – let them put their affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   And that they are led through a process.  
The evidence leader leads them through that process and 
then I am invited to come and reply to them and then I also 
have my rights to either cross – to decide to apply to the 
Commission.  These people, Chair, are not here in the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 131 of 343 
 
arena.  I have Mr Soni standing here and say Siyangena or 
TMM paid for these properties and he says we know that.  
He says it firmly Chair.  That is what he said, okay?  I am 
saying it is false.   
 
And I am saying the reason why it is happening 
is because of how we deal with this evidence.  So the most 
proper and fair way is to say all those people who are 
making – so if Werksmans or Paul O’Sullivan or anyone 
who wants to believe they have got evidence to support 
their things, they must not do it behind Mr Soni, okay?   
10 
 
They must do it themselves and Mr Soni can lead 
them and then I am invited, Chair.  What is happening now. 
I am here at the Commission to assist the Commission and 
I am boxing with the Commission because the Commission 
has admitted evidence that is not its own evidence.  It is 
being what?  Lifted.  Okay?   
 
In the process of investigation – who lift.  But in 
terms of placing reliance on a version that has to be put 
before the Commission.  Chair, it cannot be.  In fact, it 
tells us that this process is so fundamentally flawed.  And 
20 
Chair, that is my – that is the heart of my objection.  That 
the people who are making accusations against me, they 
are not here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But they are speaking through Mr Soni 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 132 of 343 
 
selectively. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  So as I understand your 
position, as it stands now – as we stand now, it is this.  
One.  There are documents here that you are going to be 
questioned on.  You have a problem being questioned on 
those documents before certain people are called to give 
evidence in connection with those documents.  You say 
those people who maybe accusing you, they should depose 
to affidavits first and subject themselves to questioning by 
the Commission and thereafter you get called to respond to 
10 
that. 
MR MONTANA:   And I can also say it is right my cross-
examine ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can then apply for leave to cross-
examine them.  Now, maybe before I say anything.  With 
regard to – I know that I said earlier on, Mr Soni, maybe 
the Legal Team can deal with this later.  Do you want to 
say anything on this limited issue about his position? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairman, I do not want to inflame 
his situation that seems ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...to have heated up.  I do not know 
for what reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So let me not say anything.  I rather 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 133 of 343 
 
hear your ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...your way forward, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now maybe to be on the safe 
side.  Let us just identify the documents that you have a 
concern with before I can go further.  Let us identify which 
ones exactly. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, it is the preliminary report and I 
mentioned it this evening(?) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   ...with all its annexures, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, oaky. 
MR MONTANA:   With all – except, Chair, the – except the 
affidavit of mister – is that a Robert? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the partner for ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   The partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mr Van der Walt’s partner. 
MR MONTANA:   Exactly, Chair.  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have a problem because he 
testified. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   He testified – he presented ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...the others testified, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And now it is clear that they did not even 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 134 of 343 
 
deposed of affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   How are they allowed to come here, 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Let us go to that report Mr Soni.  
Where do I find that report, first?  I just want us to – I want 
to see the actual documents. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The reports itself ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So, basically, the documents are those 
which are annexures to the preliminary report except for 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   His affidavit, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
so 
that 
is 
Bundle 
8 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...SS-18, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  And what page? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The report starts at page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 4.  It starts at page four and goes 
20 
up to page 32 and then the annexures start from page 34.  
Is that right? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, that is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they go up to – up to what page? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, the whole document together 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 135 of 343 
 
with the annexures – to the annexures goes up to page 
240. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two, four, zero? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right at the end? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  No, sorry, 241. 
CHAIRPERSON:   241.  Yes, okay.  And as I understand 
your concern or objection.  It is simply that because 
certain people who are connected with these documents 
have not deposed to affidavits and have not testified?   
10 
MR MONTANA:   Some ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...deposes ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Some testified without evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So without ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Deposing to affidavits. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, to this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Particularly all those lifted documents, 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I am saying let us put them aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MONTANA:   Whoever is behind them, let them come.  
Let us – we can do it this week.  Let them depose of 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 136 of 343 
 
affidavits.  Attached these very documents.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   And Chair my right, I am not trampled 
upon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us clear this.  In respect of 
those people who testified, even if they did not deposed to 
affidavits.  Do you have a problem with that, to their 
documents? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, the document that we have just 
been discussing ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...of Ms De Beer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I am not sure.  Attached this document.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   I am saying that, for example, there is a 
big problem with that.  The report I have a problem with, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, the report I ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   That we have passed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
maybe 
we 
can 
go 
through 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   We ...[intervenes]  
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 137 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, the – there is a Parkwood issue.  
Chair, there is the documents there.  Then there is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.   
MR MONTANA:   ...the document we have dealt with earlier 
on already, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   We cannot withdraw it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   I am saying there is a document on 
Parkwood ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...which – I am happy with Parkwood, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I think that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no problem with Parkwood. 
MR MONTANA:   It supports my story fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Now Chair, we have got Annexure OR-2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell me what page so that we can 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   It is page 98. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Anything before page 98 is fine? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 138 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, no.  There is a report before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, the report I know.  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja.  Then there is Parkwood.  We have 
dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But it is the same principle, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
That 
apply. 
 
We 
have 
already 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But we have dealt with it. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   We have dealt with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So I do not want to go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, then there is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So we start from where there is a 
problem. 
MR MONTANA:   I think we started at page 98, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 98.   
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR MONTANA:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  That particular document is what?  
What is that document, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is a commentary on the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 139 of 343 
 
annexures that flows from page 105. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So what one did there, Chairperson, 
is.  Took the documents and set out from page 98 to 104 
what the relevant document say.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  That - you have problem with 
that? 
MR MONTANA:   I have a big problem, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   If you look at page 27.1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Now that is actually at the heart.  So the 
Commission has summarised this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   271? 
MR MONTANA:   If you look at page 99. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
MR MONTANA:   And that is – what is it called?  Bundle 8, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are referring to page two 
something just now. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
said 
it 
is 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Yes-no, I am saying – well, I was looking 
at the number of the document but I referring to the red 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 140 of 343 
 
number 99, Chair, at the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:   99.  Yes? 
MR MONTANA:   99. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MONTANA:   And if you look at paragraph 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 7, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   7.1, 7.2, 7.8 and all of those things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   This is a summary by the Commission, as 
Mr 
Soni 
said, 
but 
they 
are 
pulling 
this 
information 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...from the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I am saying, it is not only false, 
okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   And if it was false and it is said by a 
witness, it will be fine.  I will be willing to challenge that 
witness. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Now Mr Soni has gone summarise and 
advise the Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...on something that is very false.  Now I 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 141 of 343 
 
must fight.  Basically, I am put in a position Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...where I must actually fight Mr Soni to 
try to prove to him ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...that this is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MONTANA:   And Chair, let me say that I have noted 
and kept quiet because if you look at even the line of 
questioning, it is not one that opens up and say we are 
trying to – and give him these various options.  I am taking 
through this.  At the end, I am told that someone will.  
Okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   That is a let-off(?), Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   All these witnesses who were here, 
20 
especially in respect of PRASA, sitting here, Ms Ngoye, 
they were give the platform to say everything under the 
sun.  For me, I am not even asked on a particular issue, I 
said can you – Mr Soni says, Mr Montana, let us agree on 
the methodology.  I said I agree.  He said the methodology 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 142 of 343 
 
is going to be let us confirm the factual matters and then 
we will then take it from there.  I allowed on Parkwood, 
Chair, knowing that Parkwood is even my strength, I built 
the property and I sold it.  But when he finished that, the 
very same – to facilitate of this Commission, he then 
comes to a conclusion, he does not say having then 
confirmed some of these factual issues, I want to put the 
following propositions.  They were not – it was for me to 
accept or to reject, he moved from those – down those 
propositions and then we concluded on that matter, Chair, 
10 
where he says I am putting to you and says some people 
will say that – now that evidence was not even tested.   
 
Now if you look at 7.1, 7.2 and all of those, which is 
a summary of the Commission, I do not have any problem 
with 
somebody 
being 
wrong, 
it 
should 
not 
be 
the 
Commission, the Commission cannot be factually – cannot 
get its facts incorrect because they have lifted this thing 
from somewhere.  If they come to that determination as a 
result of the investigation it is fine, Chair. 
 
So you can see that document, Chair, 7.1, 7.2 and 
20 
you go on and all of those things.  This Commission moves 
from the premises which belies the statement made by Mr 
Soni before lunch that there is the propaganda machinery 
out there has been telling the country that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, no, no, that is fine, I 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 143 of 343 
 
understand.  So but this is – you have a problem with this 
document.  I just want to identify the documents that you 
have a problem with. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I – yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is one of them? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right, let us continue, let me identify 
properly. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, can I remind you, that when I say I 
have a problem I am saying that if there – there are people 
10 
behind these documents or these allegations, put them 
forward, I am willing to deal with them and challenge them 
but not by the Commission, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Let us identify 
…[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   135, Chair, in page 135, there is again a 
summary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you skip – this document that we 
have just dealt with, that you have a problem with, does it 
refer to a number of documents that come after it?  Mr 
20 
Soni?  Does it refer to…? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It just refers to the agreement 
between Mr Montana and the guesthouse [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  What I am trying to is just 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 144 of 343 
 
identify.  So does the agreement, Mr Soni, go up to page 
116? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, let me – I am sorry, I 
think we are talking... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is that another one? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The documents that I thought you 
were saying that Mr Montana had a problem with seems to 
be in Ms De Beer ’s affidavit, it starts at page 121. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, what we were talking about just a 
few minutes ago with Ms Montana is the documents at page 
10 
98. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I am trying to establish now 
because Mr Montana then moved to a much later page and 
I am trying to see whether he is jumping other documents 
because they are part of this one that he says he has a 
problem with or …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, maybe I can take you to 
that one by one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So after the summary are the 
documents that I relied on and that starts at page 105, that 
was the agreement between the guesthouse and Johan 
Smith.  That was from 105 to 110. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To 110? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 145 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So that would fall – that is the 
agreement. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is the agreement, that is the 
first 
document 
that 
we 
went 
through 
in 
regard 
to 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So perhaps Mr Montana should be 
asked …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and then the next document you have 
10 
a problem with? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, maybe let us do it properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And you started with page 3 with the 
preliminary report.  We have passed that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, the next one is the notes in respect 
of page 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Wait, I am sorry, will your junior just 
make a note of the page numbers of the different 
20 
documents?  Yes, the next one after the preliminary 
report? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, it is page 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is at page 34? 
MR MONTANA:   Page 34, Chair, is what Mr Soni 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 146 of 343 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh what… 
MR MONTANA:   To the notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   For example, let me give you an example, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, I see …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   Do you see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   They fall into the same category as the 
other notes that you dealt with. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   As the others, Chair, yes, that is what I 
am referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Disparity because value and parties’ 
price, not the 
Commission saying that.  It is Paul 
O’Sullivan in his affidavit and now it is a position of the 
Commission.  So Mr O’Sullivan must file an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And then he is questioned and we follow 
the process properly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no, that is fine, so that is the 
next – that goes up to page 39, is that right? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, you would recall that there is that 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 147 of 343 
 
long document.  I think if you look at the emails, some of 
the documents that have been lifted.  The offer to 
purchase, Chair, there is no problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   That we must accept, I think that I have 
signed that, I am happy with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   And then the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the offer to purchase at page 46? 
MR MONTANA:   At page 46, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   And that will include the addendum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The documents that are before page 46 
but after the notes, you have no problem with those. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, no, for this particular one, Chair, I do 
not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So I have a problem with the notes but 
not the documents, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, so from page 40? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Is it page – I thought it is the notes, but it 
will be page… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, would this help because 
I know the documents and I am familiar with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 148 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   If I can just deal with them in – not to 
make any comment but just so that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you know – you can say – ja, you 
can lead us, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So up to page 45 are those email 
exchanges between Mr Montana and Ms Willis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you have any problem with 
those? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, those are fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are fine, okay. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then the next one is the offer to 
purchase by Mr – from Precise Trade made to Mr Montana, 
that is at page 46 to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   51. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   51 or 52. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or 52. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   52, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he said he has not problem with that.  
Is that correct, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair.  And then – ja. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   53 to 56 is the Deed of Transfer, 
Chair. 
MR MONTANA:   No problem with that, is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem with that, is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   No problem, Chair.  Then the addendum 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 149 of 343 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, I must hear Mr 
Montana confirm it. 
MR MONTANA:   I confirm, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no problem, ja.  That is 53 
to..? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, that is 53 to 56, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Yes? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then the addendum is 57 to 59. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you have no problem with that 
10 
either, I imagine, Mr Montana?  The addendum? 
MR MONTANA:   The addendum – no, Chair, I am happy 
with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then 60 to – from 60 onwards 
there are emails between Mr Montana and Mr van der Walt, 
60 to 64, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   60 to 64?  Is it 60 to 64? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Ja, as you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Montana, any problem with 
20 
those? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think – no, no, I am happy with 
those to 64, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then there is 65 to seemingly 76, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 150 of 343 
 
are all the designs and photographs sent to Mr Montana by 
the people who were effecting the building. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  What about those Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, that particular document it 
runs in fact with other emails to page – I think 94. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Or rather – I think page 94, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   You will recall I even objected because it 
is those pages with lots of numbers? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And we could not even explain what these 
numbers were, where they are coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So I think, Chair, that we will need, of 
course, that they are there – the confirmation where these 
numbers are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I understand the part relating to the 
numbers but with regard to – that is not to a single 
document, is it not, it is different documents or is it one 
20 
document? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, it was presented – there are 
three different players there.  I think that one starts in 86, 
Chair.  Ja, I think the design actually ends up in page 81, 
so that is from Mr Nugwa. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 151 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 91 you mean or 81?  Or, no… 
MR MONTANA:   65 to 81. 
CHAIRPERSON:   65 to 81? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have a problem with? 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have a problem, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have a problem with that? 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have a problem, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is 65 to 81, no problem.  
Okay and then 82?  Okay, Mr Soni. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   82 to 83 is a job detail sent to Mr 
Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have a problem, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have a problem. 
MR MONTANA:   Even the one after, I do not have a 
problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, even the one at 84, is that you 
said?  Even the one at page 84? 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, even the one at page 84. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   84 is obviously the… 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   84 and 85 are those emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is that fine?  That is no problem? 
MR MONTANA:   That is fine, Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 152 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   86 onwards is the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The document he was talking about. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The document, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so he has a problem with the 
document starting at page 86 to… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   94. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To 94, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, you will recall that we – 
there is an issue there.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   91, if you go to page 91, that is where we 
have a lot of numbers …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  
 
Yes, 
that we 
do 
not 
know 
what 
…[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   We are not even sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I said if I look at it, we are not even 
sure whether it is part of that document.  So until – that 
document, Chair, is – I think that until page… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your only problem the numbers, these 
figures?  Once – there should be an explanation by way of 
affidavit or something? 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
Yes, 
Chair, 
these 
numbers 
are 
…[intervenes] 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 153 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That states what they mean? 
MR MONTANA:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Other than that you do not have any 
problem? 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, no, these numbers, Chair, I think if 
there is an explanation – we do not even know which 
document that is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   They are standing on their own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   So I think that we need to deal with it 
properly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  But also, I just 
pause here to say it depends whether anybody wants to 
make an issue of them also. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If nobody wants to make an issue of 
them, they just happen to be there and they are not going 
to be put to you, it might not be an issue.  You will go 
along with that? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I am happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   My fundamental issue is that the 
Commission must not enter the arena. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 154 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   That is the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  Okay, that is up to 
94. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue, Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   95 – oh sorry, 95, 96 and 97 relates 
to the email to Mr van der Walt from Mr Montana about the 
appliances. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then 97 is the invoice for the 
10 
order for the appliances. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Any problem with this? 
MR MONTANA:   I am happy with that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are happy with this, okay.  And the 
98, we know you have a problem with the notes and then 
the agreement to page - you have no problem with. 
MR MONTANA:   Until – the notes, they go to 204. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The notes go up to 104. 
MR MONTANA:   104, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and then Mr Soni, continue? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then we have the agreement of 
purchase and sale. 
MR MONTANA:   Sorry, Mr Soni, 98 to 104, Chair, we said 
we are keeping out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have an objection. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 155 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   I have an objection, the notes, I have an 
objection, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you told me, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That is where the false things are carried 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine, you mentioned that.  
Okay, 105? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   105 to 110 is the agreement to 
purchase by Mr Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no problem with that? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I am happy with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then 111 there is 111 to 116 is the 
agreement by Precise Trade to purchase the property, the 
guesthouse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Aanmani Guesthouse. 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have an objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem with that, okay.  Yes, Mr 
Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then the Deed of Transfer, 
20 
Chairperson, is at 117 to 120, that is an official document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no problem with that, Mr…? 
MR MONTANA:   I am happy with that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then of course there is Ms de 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 156 of 343 
 
Beer ’s affidavit which 121 and 122, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem with that? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, I reject this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes?  Just articulate your basis? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, you recall there were three 
things I said about the document.  Firstly, that this 
statement was meant for the Commission, it was lifted from 
somewhere, does not address the issues that we have 
there unless if she does depose of an affidavit. 
 
Secondly, you will recall, Chair, address the issue 
10 
of the annexure which I think that you dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which has been found, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   We just dealt with that.  And also, Chair, I 
raised the issue that this property was – I think if I look at 
– at the second paragraph in – was it the second 
paragraph? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
third 
paragraph 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking simultaneously] 
MR MONTANA:   The second paragraph – no, the third 
paragraph is the annexure. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   The one where she says I called on her 
people to enquire about the property.  This property was on 
the market, it was well-advertised, Chair, and it was a 
show house.  So I think some of this – I think I want her to 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 157 of 343 
 
file an affidavit precisely because she has got a lot of 
hearsay which are not – she only interacted with Ms de 
Beer towards the end and this affidavit does not speak to 
that, it speaks to the Siyangena matter, Chair, in court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, no, let us hang on.  Is your 
objection to this sworn statement by Ms de Beer simply 
that you believe that its contents are not true or some of 
its contents are not true? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think some of the contents are 
not true. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MONTANA:   And the Commission …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say you object because it is not 
an affidavit that was made to the Commission, it is an 
affidavit made for another purpose. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   And now the Commission – because she 
did not file an affidavit here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   The Commission, when I raise my 
objection, it was replacing reliance on a document that is 
not meant for here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   It makes certain statements about me. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 158 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I cannot call Mrs de Beer to come here 
and say – I need to question here, Chair, about these 
things that she says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second.  Did Ms Beer 
not come here? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   She did come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And testified and she confirmed this 
10 
affidavit.  That should cover it, Mr Montana.  Or let me 
explain.  You remember I said earlier on once the 
Commission is aware that somebody is in possession of 
information that may help it in its investigation it can 
obtain that information.  So even if this sworn statement 
was made to whoever, whether the Hawks or Werksmans or 
whoever, if the Commission became aware of it and it 
thought that it might assist in its investigation it could 
obtain it.   
 
Now it may be that in regard to some documents 
20 
you say well, this person was not called here to give 
evidence and maybe we can put that aside for now, a 
situation where somebody could not come and testify but 
where somebody did come and testify, you would have, if 
you were given – and I assume you were given a 3.3 notice 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 159 of 343 
 
in regard to her affidavit, you would have been entitled to 
apply for leave to cross-examine her and she could have 
been called back to face cross-examination. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I accept fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Except one thing, Chair, that one of the 
things I raised was that these statements, the sworn 
statements for that particular case were even obtained 
through illegal means. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   And I am saying, Chair, that there is one 
issue …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the duress or intimation you are 
talking about. 
MR MONTANA:   That duress and that is why the 
Commission, from a quality point of view… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So you place reliance on a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Some of the stories that are being said in 
20 
here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So I think, Chair, that I am saying if she – 
even if it is one page confirmatory affidavit from her to say 
I confirm that my statement and – and that I can have 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 160 of 343 
 
recourse on it, Chair, if I choose. I am not saying I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Depending on how this whole matter 
unfolds.  If I decide to exercise my rights, I should be able 
to, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, okay, I think in regard to that, 
once she came and under oath said she confirms this, 
there is no need for her to do an affidavit because she has 
confirmed it under oath. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but what you are free to do is to 
look at the contents and point out what you believe are 
flaws or what is untrue, that you will be free to do.  But I 
do not think that just because there is no affidavit from her 
saying this is true would be a ground to object but with 
regard to what you say namely that on the information you 
have some of the people were intimidated or pressurised, 
there 
is 
no 
problem 
with 
you, 
if 
you 
got 
personal 
knowledge of that, leading evidence about how those 
affidavits were – or documents were obtained or calling 
20 
somebody to testify to that.  But that is different from 
anything else.  So I think that looking at what you are 
articulating, you should not have a problem with it being 
here but you can say as far as it may have been obtained 
illegally, I maintain that and I will lead evidence if I choose 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 161 of 343 
 
to. 
MR MONTANA:   No, I accept your guidance, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept.  Okay, alright.  Okay, Mr 
Soni? 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
Then 
the 
next 
document, 
Chairperson, is a deed of sale relating to the Waterkloof 
property between …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, Mr Soni, it will help if you start 
with the page. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then you tell us what the document 
is, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is page 128 and it goes until the – 
the agreement itself goes up to page 130. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that is an agreement of sale in 
regard to this problem which did not eventuate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it seems to have annexure B, is that 
right? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is so, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it not have annexure A, does it 
only have B? 
MR MONTANA:   Can I draw your attention to something, 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 162 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   The document 128, I accept it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I accept that, Chair, and I think it goes to 
132. 
CHAIRPERSON:   122? 
MR MONTANA:   If I am right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   I think annexure A …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, when it starts at 128, so it 
cannot go to 122.  132 you mean? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   132, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have a problem with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then there is at page – 131 is 
annexure B to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   133 you mean? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The 131 to 132, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he says he has no problem with that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   I do not have a problem with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so we are at 133 now. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   133, Chairperson, and 134 is an 
email that Ms de Beer sent to neighbours after she handed 
the keys to Mr Montana. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 163 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, even if you do not explain, 
he already knows which ones he has a problem with.  Have 
you got any problem with these two? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, in fact, I will not object, I am happy 
with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are happy with this. 
MR MONTANA:   Let us proceed with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   But let me make one quick point, Chair.  
These documents and the affidavit, you can see that Ms de 
10 
Beer, she believed that she had entered into a property 
transaction with me even though in one of her emails – she 
uses beautiful words, hey?   
“I would like to inform you that I have sold my 
house to Mr Lucky Montana, currently of PRASA.  
He is a very nice gentleman and will take full 
responsibility of the property.” 
And goes on to say that.  Now let us go back to this 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You of course not objecting to being 
20 
referred to as a nice gentleman. 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, but you can see that these 
are two worlds, is it not, the same person says – she says 
I am this wonderful gentleman, tells the neighbours, okay?  
But you can see, Chair, that she also does not have actual 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 164 of 343 
 
understanding of the issues because I am saying her own 
sworn statement or affidavit, you can see because she only 
met me once. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:    It is based on hearsay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But what I am simply saying is that when 
I take this issue on at a later stage, I am going to 
demonstrate that we are dealing with two.  It is either we 
are going to deal with one person with two characters. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not that …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   I am nice guy and I am a criminal on the 
other one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  You have no problem.  Then 
the next one is page 135.  Mr Soni? 
MR MONTANA:   135? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are notes again. 
MR MONTANA:   I object the notes, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are notes, they go up to what? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   They go up to page 143, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   143. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he objects to the notes.  And then 
there is the sworn statement of – oh, continue, Mr Soni? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 165 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, sorry, Chairperson, page 144 
and 145 is the statement of Mr Green. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no problem with that? 
MR MONTANA:   No, I do not have, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  With regard to Mr Green, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He also testified, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I know, I remember he did testify.  
Mr Montana has mentioned him I think yesterday twice, if I 
am not mistaken and I forgot to say this, I am under the 
impression that he is the witness who left on the basis that 
10 
he should still come back to clarify something.  Will you 
team just check? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so that if there was something that 
he was meant to come back and clarify, it is no left 
hanging. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I seem to think that as we were finishing 
I – we talked on the basis that he would still come back at 
some stage. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, maybe – and this is not 
to say we will not do that.  Mr Green when I met him on the 
day he gave evidence, he told me that he had been 
suffering from cancer for some period and could not 
remember things. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 166 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, no, no, that …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But that does not mean we will not, 
but I am just placing it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So that we know that that is a 
possibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
MR MONTANA:   He is the man who told you, Chair, that 
what Mr Montana is doing is not unusual in the property 
market. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  Yes.  No, no, that is fine.  So 
let us check simply because we should not have a situation 
where something was left hanging and we do not follow up.  
Okay, alright.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then page 146, Chairperson, there is 
an email from Mr Green to obviously his firm but in relation 
to the agreement that Mr Montana …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the one at 146 is empty or is it?  
Or what is 146? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is an email from Mr Green. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, does it go to 147? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  From Mr Green to who? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...[Indistinct] Chairperson saying that 
he is attaching the document or the agreement that had 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 167 of 343 
 
been entered into. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Does he attach ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He doesn’t attach the agreement 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so then ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   I think he is referring to the Deeds of 
Sale. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that email you have no problem 
with?  
10 
MR MONTANA:   No Chair I don’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem, Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then page 147 is a second email 
from him which deals with a letter seemingly sent by Mr 
van der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  148? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   148 is a repetition of what was 146 
as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then there’s no objection? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then 149 is crossed out, or 
what is the story? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, 149 is the same thing as 146 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 168 of 343 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   150? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   150 is from Mr van der Walt to Mr 
Green. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem with that Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem, ja? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And 151 is the bank letter confirming 
10 
the payment that is referred to on page 150. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem with that? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no problem with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then 152 Chairperson is the 
agreement between Mr ...[indistinct] and Mr van der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   152 to what page? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   155. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that’s offer to purchase which was 
accepted. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no problem with that Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   No, not a problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem, and 156? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   156 is merely the certificate by the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 169 of 343 
 
CIPC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no problem with that? 
MR MONTANA:   No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then page 157 Chairperson are – 
or from 157 but we just deal with each one, are emails by 
the sellers to Mr Montana, Mr Green and other people 
associated with the property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem? 
MR MONTANA:   No problem Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   158 is a continuation of that email, 
159 is an email relating to a progress report sent to 
various people including Mr Montana Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem with that? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.    
ADV VAS SONI SC:   160 is the red clearance figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem? 
MR MONTANA:   No problem Chair. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   161 is the electrical compliance 
certificate Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem? 
MR MONTANA:   161? 
CHAIRPERSON:   161 ja.  No problem. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 170 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then 162 is the account by the 
attorneys who did the transfer Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No problem? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is an account sent to Precise 
Trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I think Mr Montana is looking at it. 
MR MONTANA:   I am looking Chair sorry at the – this is 
163? 
CHAIRPERSON:   162. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   162. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Oh 162 Chair, yes no I am happy with that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, then 163? 
MR MONTANA:   I am happy with that chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   164 is a further email from Mr Green. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe Mr Soni even if you don’t 
say who it is from he knows them, he will just say no 
objection until we come to where he has an objection.   If 
you will just mention the page, 164 there is no objection Mr 
20 
Montana? 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair, no objection.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   165? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection.  166? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 171 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   167? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   168 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   169? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   I think document goes further Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Up to 179 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Up to 179.  Is that fine Mr Montana, up 
to 179? 
MR MONTANA:   Ja Chair, I think until in fact until, I don’t 
have a problem until 187. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Until 187? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair but I have got one, okay until 
187, but there’s something, I think the pages do not follow 
each other Chair.   I don’t know after 187, until 187 I don’t 
have any objection Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Until? 
MR MONTANA:   187. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no problem. 
MR MONTANA:   I don’t have any objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.    
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 172 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   There’s a page which I don’t believe it 
goes there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The pages then skip from 187 to 193.     
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there something missing? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Things were put in that didn’t belong 
to this Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...[Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I think what should, if that is the 
10 
case a page should be put in here with a note to alert 
whoever is going through this. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You’re quite right Chair, mine has 
that, I don’t know why it is not in yours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mine doesn’t have, yours Mr Montana 
doesn’t have any note saying ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Chair I am shocked with this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MONTANA:   These things here  you know sometimes 
you say God works in mysterious ways. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   This document Chair you see and I think 
it comes from a Werksmans report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which document are you looking at? 
MR MONTANA:  The one Chair after 187, after – you 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 173 of 343 
 
remember I accepted 187. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And then there is this document which I 
don’t think it belongs here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   193? 
MR MONTANA:   Is it 193? 
CHAIRPERSON:   My next document is page 193. 
MR MONTANA:   So you don’t have this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is notes, it is notes I think. 
MR MONTANA:   There is a document Chair talking about 
10 
Dr Daniel Ntimkulu, Joseph Pomola, Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is it marked, what is the page 
number? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair I don’t think it belongs here, it 
doesn’t fall in that number, it is written S4, I think it 
belongs to a different document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR MONTANA: But you know what it is Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   It is a document from Werksmans their 
20 
allegations 
that 
they 
were 
making 
on 
some 
of 
the 
memorandums that we prepared, so these are part of the 
documents that are being ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Has it got a heading? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair it doesn’t even have a heading, it 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 174 of 343 
 
starts with Dr Ntimkulu confirms unreservedly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it, does it look like a continuation 
from another document? 
MR MONTANA:   No it is not a continuation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is it one page? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, so it doesn’t belong here, I don’t 
think it belongs here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I don’t think it belongs here but I am just 
simply saying that we should take it out Chair, but 
10 
...[Indistinct] is suing me, what is said in here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, can I see that page?   She will take 
it.   Oh, it is my registrar.   
MR MONTANA:   And my ...[indistinct] you will find this 
particular document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay it is a document, it is a 
page that is marked 11 at the bottom to indicate that it is 
page 11 of a document, at the top there is paragraph 5.6.3, 
it says Dr Ntimkulu confirmed unreservedly that the amount 
of R17 628 118,59 is due and payable in terms of the 
20 
above two contracts because the company had successfully 
executed the material management programme and the 
data cleansing programme.  It is written by ...[indistinct] 
Commissioner.   I’m sure Mr Soni would like to see it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I would like to see it but I don’t know 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 175 of 343 
 
what it is about, it is certainly not ...[indistinct – dropping 
voice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  It does say PRASA at the top. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.    
MR MONTANA:   So you will see my annexures on the 
various documents that were prepared and I annexed them 
to my affidavit it deals, this page comes from that 
document and I  know all the affidavits on the PRASA 
matter, and the Rule 3.3 Notices given to me, these 
documents were not tabled before this Commission Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   So you will understand why I feel so 
aggrieved and unhappy, because I see these things, 
documents that belong somewhere come into here, but for 
now Chair for us to move on I am just saying that you know 
God is kind Chair, [speaking in vernacular] to see what is 
happening, but I don’t want to do that [speaking in 
vernacular]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chairperson, so I think Chair we can 
20 
proceed to the next one, 193. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine.   Yes, so is it ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am told that it belongs to another 
file Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To another file? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 176 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Another PRASA file? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   SS4 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, okay, but then there 
should be a note here that – a page that ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson may I give you mine, I 
won’t need it.  It says exactly what it is from page 188 to 
192. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that’s fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It just says blank pages ...[indistinct 
10 
dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So it says blank page non-
relevant pages removed 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay it is there, a few pages in that, 
okay, alright, let’s continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The next document Chairperson is 
Annexure OR4 and that is from page 193 to 198, that is 
again a commentary on the index. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those I know. 
20 
ADV VAS SONIC SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Montana has problems with 
notes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   193 Chair I do not accept, I reject Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 177 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine.  Continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then Chairperson 199 to 205 is an 
affidavit from the transferring attorney in the Hurlingham 
property. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, any objection to that? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection, okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then page 206 to 209 is the offer to 
10 
purchase made by Mr Montana to the owner of Montrose 
Avenue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then page 210 is a confirmation from 
Investec Bank that Midtown Brace had paid R11.5million to 
the account of the transferring attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a one page or ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page 210, it is just one page. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no objection. 
MR MONTANA:   I am happy with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Happy with that okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then page 211 Chairperson is 
confirmation that the transfer had been registered in the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 178 of 343 
 
Deeds Office on that date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   I am happy Chair with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page 212 to 215 is an offer to 
purchase from Mr Smith on behalf of the Minor Property 
Trust to the owner of 12 Montrose Avenue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair, no objection at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.    
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    Page 216 is a letter from Mr Smith 
to 
other 
people 
in 
his 
agency 
– 
sorry 
Mr 
Green 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   From Mr Louis Green. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Green confirming that an offer 
had been received from Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   No, not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then page 217 is two emails sent by 
20 
seemingly the secretary of the trustee to Mr Green and 
cc’d to Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 179 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then at page 218 to 223 is an offer 
to purchase made on behalf of the Minor Property Trust. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said up to what page Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry page 222 Chair, sorry page 221 
and then page 222 is the minutes of the trust confirming 
that Mr Smith had been authorised to make the offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and then? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then page 223 to 226 there’s a 
10 
further offer to purchase made by Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   I thought Chair the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Offer to purchase.  I don’t think you will 
have any objection to that? 
MR MONTANA:   Oh no Chair, I don’t have an objection 
Chair, I was confusing it with some other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then page 227 is confirmation by 
Investec Bank that payment had been made to the trust 
20 
account of the transferring attorney by Precise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   For R2million is it? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   For R2million. 
MR MONTANA:   For R2million. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 180 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection. 
MR MONTANA:   I am happy with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then page 228 is a letter read into 
an offer to purchase made by Mr van der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection? 
MR MONTANA:   No maybe Chair.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then page 231 is a further letter 
from Mr ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you said 231, what about 
10 
230, is 230 part of what we have dealt with. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   230 is seemingly part of the letter 
from Mr van der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay, 231? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   231 Chairperson is a further letter 
from Mr van der Walt to the transferring attorney asking for 
more time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s 231 to 233? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No objection. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   From 233 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  234? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   234 is a letter from the transferring 
attorneys to Mr van der Walt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if you don’t say he has seen it, ja, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 181 of 343 
 
234 to 236 you have no objection. 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, 237? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then 237 is an email from Mr van 
der Walt to the attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay no objection. 
MR MONTANA:   No objection Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then 238 is again a transfer, a 
letter from Mr van der Walt to the attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   238 to 240 you have no problem? 
10 
MR MONTANA:  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   241, is – have you got no objection to 
that? 
MR MONTANA:   No Chair, in fact I think when I look – 
when I look back Chair, I go back, I think Chair when you 
look back, when you move forward all the other documents 
remaining there Chair are acceptable to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The ones that are remaining? 
MR MONTANA:   The ones that are remaining until the last 
page, page 315 I think, 317 rather Chair, 317. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they are acceptable? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, alright, so the ones that 
have been identified as objectionable if I recall correctly is 
the preliminary report and the notes, is that correct? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 182 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And you can see Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there are different notes but all the 
notes ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   There are different notes Chair and all of 
them are moving from - and that is why we are left with one 
issue Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   We are in agreement with all these 
10 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is just the notes. 
MR MONTANA:   The notes are written on the basis, on the 
premise that these properties were funded by TTM and I 
am saying that is false and I am surprised Chair, by the 
way I didn’t make this point, the evidence – I am actually 
surprised Chair, because some of these documents that 
have now gone through they confirm a completely different 
version, for example the Investec account of R2million they 
confirm the true story, the letter from Mr van der Walt, from 
20 
Mr Bredenkamp their attorneys it actually says I am under 
instruction, the instruction of my client, to do the following 
things. 
 
Now if that is the case why would for example the 
Commission then ignore those things and write the kind of 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 183 of 343 
 
note that has been written, that is at the heart of my story, 
those things, that is at the heart of my story Chair, and I 
think because there is no objection we are not fighting over 
this one, we then must get Chair to the heart of this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no. 
MR MONTANA:   Who funded these properties and we 
resolve this issue once and for all today so that when we 
all leave here we know that Mr Montana was bright, he was 
involved in corruption for these properties were funded and 
Chair I am here to deal with this issue now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no that is fine.   So the one 
thing at least that is clear is there is no objection to any 
documents other than the preliminary report and the notes. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now my understanding of the attitude 
you took yesterday Mr Soni is that you were quite happy to 
leave aside the preliminary reports.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For purposes of this. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of the – of putting things on record 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay.   Now what do you say 
about the notes?   The objection to the notes, and I think 
the objection is really that you were saying well you were 
saying that the notes are based at a certain basis, and you 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 184 of 343 
 
say if there was somebody who comes and testifies or 
depose to an affidavit and says what is said in the notes 
then you would have your opportunity to apply to cross-
examine them and so on, is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair you remember when I objected the 
fundamental issue has to do with how these things are 
funded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And the notes which informed Mr Soni’s 
thing was that this in fact we know this had been funded by 
10 
TTM.   TTM Chair, or /Siyangena and I am saying Chair 
that with all the evidence we have dealt with the – bar the 
notes that had been written ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are happy to deal with. 
MR MONTANA:   The evidence points that here is a 
company called Precise, it has got all of these activities in 
all these investors and everything, okay now the notes 
ignore all of that, all of that evidence, even in that 
statement, there is almost R40million in that statement.   It 
then wans to extract not even based on the statement, on 
20 
the notes, actually one of the notes says Mr Van der Walt 
says that that property was funded by TTM, so Mr van der 
Walt doesn’t say that Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me – let’s pause there, do you need 
the notes for your process? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 185 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We don’t need the notes Chair, its 
inferences to be drawn from the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so they can be pulled out, they can 
be ignored. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   But Chair you get the principle of what I 
say, it is easy to say we can ignore that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  But I am saying Chair ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but you are if I understand you 
correctly you are saying these notes paint a certain picture 
or are based on certain information, actually you would be 
happy if they were not here, so from what Mr Soni is saying 
he seems to say well actually if the notes are creating a 
problem they can be taken out. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, they can be taken out and then we 
continue, we can put questions to you based on the 
documents that you have no objection to. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair that is not – I am not asking for a 
concession on this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Whether the documents are withdrawn or 
not Chair you have said that the next few days you want to 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 186 of 343 
 
focus on this property issue.   In the minds of the nation 
the issue is the properties have been bought, and they are 
interested in the public entity, PRASA, that if a former CEO 
is involved in corruption it is a big problem and they have 
got a legitimate right and we know that reports have been 
made, statements have been made, that no, no, no these 
things have been paid for by TMM and Siyangena, okay. 
 
The Commission repeats that, now I have dealt with 
the procedural part which is the fact that who must do that, 
the Commission must not interrogate or enter arena and all 
10 
of those things Chair and you can hear Chair that I spoke 
to lawyers who were debriefing me, that’s why some of the 
language ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, may you did introduction to law 101 
crash course. 
MR MONTANA:   Crash course.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Admissibility of evidence. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes Chair, now Chair my objection in a 
way caused us to come to a central issue of all these why 
we are dealing with these properties. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Who paid and the selection of documents 
Chair, the way they have been lined up, okay, you know 
some of the documents that are said there – if Mr Soni 
were to go back or the legal team were to go back 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 187 of 343 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No but I understand what you are saying 
Mr Montana, but what Mr Soni’s position is, and he is going 
to tell me if I misunderstand his position, he is creating the 
position that says these notes it is not really so important 
that they be here, my understanding of them was that they 
were for convenience, that was my understanding of them.  
If you have an objection to them he is happy that they be 
taken out and then we proceed, we proceed from there, so 
I don’t expect you to be aggrieved with that, because you 
10 
are objecting to them so he says look let’s take them out 
and let’s continue then there should be no problem. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair you see part of the problem we are 
dealing with – I am a fundamentalist Chair in the true 
sense of the word, I go for maximum effects but this is not 
about that, it is about the soft principle.   I am saying that 
a statement was made Chair, and I need to ask, perhaps I 
should ask I know I am here to answer questions, let me 
ask the question through you Chair, now withdrawn is fine, 
I think they showed the biasness and everything Chair and 
20 
trying to direct this in a particular fashion, but the 
fundamental issue that made me fight Chair was when in 
those statement the Commission or those notes say – and 
this was when of course Mr Soni is making the statement, 
we know, now I want to be told – I don’t want to be taken 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 188 of 343 
 
on a journey Chair when I see where this journey is going 
to, and I want to cut the chase Chair, instead of cutting the 
chase let’s say it, does this Commission, does Mr Soni as 
he is standing there can tell this Commission with certainty 
that TMM or Siyangena paid for the properties, now this I 
know, 
there 
are 
two 
types 
of 
properties 
Chair, 
my 
properties and Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on ...[intervenes]  
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
I 
want 
to 
go 
back 
there 
Chair 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, you see when Mr Soni says 
these notes can be taken it does not prevent that issue 
being dealt with whether immediately or in due course.  It 
does not prevent – it is not like that issue that you think you 
say is fundamental it is not put under the carpet.  All it 
means is at least as far as you had raised an objection to 
certain documents that objection then falls away once these 
notes have been taken out.  Then we can proceed. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes Chair but I think the moment has 
arrived Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  For me and everyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MONTANA:  And I think let us confront it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  Mr Soni I suggest that 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 189 of 343 
 
they be taken out for purposes of progress. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, no, no I have no difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright?  And where they were 
pages can be put in that says what was taken out. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  Well why do you not we 
practically that then we proceed.  The first ones are from 
what page to what page? 
ADV SONI SC:  They are from 1 to 33 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 1 to 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – there is the preliminary report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – there is the index and then the 
preliminary report starts at page 3, is that right? 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson as I understand it Mr Montana 
also objects to the main report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is the main report? 
ADV SONI SC:  It starts at 4 to – which starts at page 4 and 
goes up to page 33. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well page 3 says Preliminary Report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is page 4 not part of the Preliminary 
Report? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 190 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you just said the – I thought you 
said permanent or final report. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no I said he – he seems to object to the 
whole part of that – that part of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he objects to the whole Preliminary 
Report. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And the Preliminary Report starts at 
page 3, is that right? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it goes up to what page? 
ADV SONI SC:  Up to page 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to page 33. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – okay that we take out and then 
– and then the notes what page 34? 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 34 to 39. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Because your position is that these 
do not make a difference to – to.. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  To the evidence  
CHAIRPERSON:  To the issues. 
ADV SONI SC:  That you need to hear Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  Then 99 – oh sorry 98 to 104. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 191 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then 135 to 143. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then 193 to 198. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that – those were the last notes? 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think – I think we have covered 
them.   
MR MONTANA:  There is one issue outstanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  The issue about the – I thought we said we 
found also in addition to the letter the annexure we also find 
the affidavit from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh – oh the affidavit.  Can I see the 
affidavit and Mr Montana can be given a copy? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get  a chance to read the affidavit 
Mr Soni to see whether it says what Mr Montana says it 
says? 
ADV SONI SC:  No I can – I can take just to save time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what you have got – what you have 
got is – excuse me – is – is an application brought by 
Siyangena Technologies Pty Limited as first applicant TMM 
Holdings Pty Limited as second applicant and MJA Ferreira 
as third applicant in terms of Rule 3.4 and 11.1 of the Rules 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 192 of 343 
 
of the Commission of – and they ask for leave to cross-
examine Mr Oellerman in relation to the contents of his 
affidavits and versions and reports with reference to the 
subject matter of the relationship and or alleged relationship 
between the applicants and PRASA and all the applicants 
and Mr Lucky Montana’s involvement in alleged property 
transactions and the relationship between the applicants and 
attorney Riaan Van Der Walt and or alleged payments 
directly or indirectly from the applicants to Van Der Walt and 
or Precise Trade and or Lucky Montana.  And Rule 2 – payer 
10 
2 is Rule 11.1 for the hearing of any further evidence 
implicating the applicants regarding or information with 
matters pertaining to or concurrent with the facts in the High 
Court application under case number X be held in camera 
alternatively be postponed until such time that the applicants 
have been granted consent to cross-examine any such 
witnesses implicating the applicants on such allegations. 
 
Okay so that – that was an application for leave to 
cross-examine 
as 
well 
as 
an 
application 
for 
the 
postponement of – or for the hearing of evidence implicating 
20 
the applicants to be held in camera alternatively to be 
postponed until such time as the applicants have cross-
examined certain witnesses. 
 
Okay now the – that application – let us say notes of 
motion in the affi – it is a 00:08:31 an affidavit by Mr Thomas 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 193 of 343 
 
Andreas Dubeck. 
 
Have you had a chance to check whether the affidavit 
says what Mr Montana says? 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson I have – I can only refer to what 
I think the relevant parts of the affidavit are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And I think it starts at page – at page 30 the 
red numbers 30 and at paragraph 69 at the bottom of that 
page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
ADV SONI SC:  He says:  I turn now to deal – perhaps you 
should read it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  For yourself and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – yes you can read ja. 
ADV SONI SC:    And perhaps Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you were going to read Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you were offering – I thought you 
were offering to read it. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  I turn now to deal with the report of Mr 
Clinton Oellerman and the evidence he will probably lead on 
the 2 n d of July 2020 and reasons for cross-examining Mr 
Oellerman. 
 
Paragraph 70 – despite neither of the first two 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 194 of 343 
 
applicants receiving any notice from the commission’s legal 
team and I submit that both first and second applicants were 
entitled to a notice.  The applicants applied for cross-
examination of Mr Oellermann’s evidence as it is envisaged 
to be led at present on the following basis. 
 
70.1 Mr Oellerman does not contextualise at least 
within reasonable measures his reports – his report. 
 
70.2  Mr Oellerman fails to report that Siyangena 
commenced the execution of phase 1 ISMS several years 
prior to the date on which it commences with his report. 
10 
 
70.3  Mr Oellerman fails to explain in anywhere 
whatsoever what the benefit from Mr Montana was or would 
have been with regards to 70.3.1 the Waterkloof property, 
70.3.2 the Sandhurst property, 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Soni.  The only 
reason I was asking for that part is simply to see whether it 
could be the affidavit that Mr Montana was talking about.  
Would you know Mr Montana whether this is the affidavit you 
were referring to? 
MR MONTANA:  Yes Chair and I want to read the – I think 
20 
that Chair is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The part about payment. 
MR MONTANA:  From page 27 of that affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I just … 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 195 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not want you to read the whole 
thing. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want the… 
MR MONTANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The parts there – if there is a part that 
says they never paid or what. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes Chair it is – it is – I just picked it up – I 
just lost it again as you spoke to me Chair.  And I wanted to 
read that part. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR MONTANA:  Where he says – sorry Chair.  Okay let me 
find it again quickly.  Where he says on the CFO of this 
company and that we have never made –  
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be at the beginning. 
MR MONTANA:  Ja – no, no towards the end Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Towards the end.   
MR MONTANA:  Towards the end I think from page 25 I will 
just find it again Chair.  I just picked it up.  So he starts – he 
starts in fact from page 27 and it goes for example Chair to 
20 
page 28 and 70.9.1 on page 28 the – Mr Tom – Mr Tom – the 
deponents Andreas Dubeck says 70.9.1 Chair can you see 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I can see that. 
MR MONTANA:  He says:  None of the payments mentioned 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 196 of 343 
 
in the report of Mr Oellerman were made from a TMM bank 
account.  I am the Chief Financial Officer of TMM and 
Siyangena and I can confirm the aforesaid and I will put Mr 
Oellerman to the proof thereof if and when allowed an 
opportunity to do so. 
 
Now Chair the bank account from which the TMM 
payments and they put it in – were made it is not a bank 
account opened by TMM or any of his officials or any of his 
employees in fact it seems as if it was – and I think Chair it 
seems as if it was a cash Money Market account opened for 
10 
M on behalf of Loubser Van Der Walt Attorneys at Investec 
Bank.  To illustrate the aforesaid I append hereto marked 
Annexure TD22 a copy of what seems to be a printout of a 
bank statement reflecting TMM payments. 
 
And Chair it continues – it continues Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is the part you were talking about. 
MR MONTANA:  So that is the part I am talking about Chair 
and now if this affidavit Chair – I am saying. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  If this affidavit was before the commission 
and Mr Soni said what he said then we are left with one 
question Chair.  Let us put the bank account – not the notes 
because currently the noise is about the notes written TMM. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 197 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  The – TMM and Siyangena they were never 
paid Precise Trade these amounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  But it seems we are dealing with notes on a 
money account.  Let us put it on the table Chair and deal 
with the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  So I think Chair the – I do not know 
because this was an application to you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja this was an application. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was brought by  
MR MONTANA:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By them but… 
MR MONTANA:  But you can see Chair considering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but what they are saying is relevant.  
Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair all is actually profound because it 
changes the foundation from which I have been sitting here 
20 
for the past two days answering questions about my 
properties.  Because I am here to answer and grill that the 
TMM and Siyan – I have said I paid for my properties and for 
those that I owned and I have entered into partnership and 
they say the money comes from TMM where I have entered 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 198 of 343 
 
into partnership and where Riaan Van Der Walt bought his 
own properties they say it came from TMM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now here is a CFO Chair under oath is 
saying no we have never made such a payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now if this affidavit has been with the 
commission since July 2020 Chair there is no way in which – 
why it was not shared with me number 1 and number 2 it was 
– it would not have been possible that for Mr Soni and the 
10 
commission not to be aware of this important thing unless if 
they have got evidence and say we have got the account 
from TMM it contradicts what you are saying.  Then we have 
got a story Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no what I can tell you Mr Montana 
is that the file that has been given here to me has got my 
notes because this was an application by these entities plus 
Mr Ferreira for leave to cross-examine Mr Oellerman which I 
made in February – early in February this year.  I do not 
know whether that means that is when it – I became aware of 
20 
it for the first time.  I may have been become – I may have 
become aware before then I am not sure but at least I have 
got notes that I made on that page.  This was an application 
by the two entities MS Ferreira for leave to cross-examine 
Mr Oellerman on his report. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 199 of 343 
 
 
Now of course 3.3 Notices would be given to you if a 
certain person implicates you in his statement.  Of course 
they do not implicate you in their statement. 
 
But of course what they do say there is important and 
Mr Soni do you want to say anything about it? 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson what one needs to do is see 
what they – what else they say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  About the source of funds in that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Because Chairperson you will recall that in 
answer to this the commission’s legal team are then 
answering affidavit to say why leave to cross-examine ought 
not to be given.  But let me go – I am just saying that I am 
aware of that.  But let me just say what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They filed a replying affidavit or – after 
that or do you know? 
ADV SONI SC:  To the best of my knowledge I have not seen 
one Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  But Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let him finish. 
MR MONTANA:  Oh so sorry. 
ADV SONI SC:  So in regard to the funds for this they say – 
I was reading about paragraph 70 and if I could just say at 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 200 of 343 
 
70.6 it is said: 
It seems as if Mr Oellerman suggests that TMM the second 
applicant made direct payments to Precise Trade. 
 
Now I am emphasising direct it is not emphasised 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
ADV SONI SC:  Paragraph 70.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.   
ADV SONI SC:  Made direct payments to Precise Trade and 
Invest 02 Proprietary Limited and or for instance transferring 
10 
attorneys Borchard and Hanson from time to time. 
 
Mr Oellerman suggests that the aforesaid payments 
by TMM coincide with certain payments to and from Precise 
Trade and Investec 02 Proprietary Limited. 
 
That is of course the transactional account that he is 
referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV SONI SC:  There is nowhere in his report – his affidavit 
or any of the further documents did Mr Oellerman at checked 
the so called source of the payment reference as TMM 
20 
payments.   
 
And this reference by Mr Van Der Walt in that bank 
account Chair.  Then they say and this is a crucial part. 
“With a little effort Mr Oellerman would have 
been able to establish the following: 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 201 of 343 
 
 
None of the payments mentioned in 
the report of Mr Oellerman were made from a 
TMM bank account.  I am the CFO of TMM 
and Siyangena I can confirm the aforesaid 
and I will put Mr Oellerman to the proof 
thereof if and when allowed an opportunity to 
do so.” 
 
Then 70.9.2 – The bank account from which TMM 
payments were made – and they put TMM in inverted 
commas meaning the payments referred to by Mr Van Der 
10 
Walt in his notes.  Says – were made is not a bank account 
opened by TMM or any of its officials or any of its employees 
in fact it seems as if it was a cash Money Market account 
opened for and on behalf of Loubser Van Der Walt at 
Investec Bank. 
 
And then they attach that.  Then they continue. 
With reference to the affidavit of Mr Loubser Mr Oellerman 
relies further on hand written notes on Investec Bank 
account statements for Precise Trade and they attach it.  
Assuming that payments into the aforesaid account came 
20 
from TMM Mr Oellerman in his report suggests that payments 
were made by the applicants for the benefit of Precise Trade.  
Where 
Mr 
Oellermann’s 
assumption 
is 
inaccurate 
and 
misplaced is where he failed to investigate the source of 
their payments.  TMM Holdings held an account with ABSA 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 202 of 343 
 
not Investec Bank.  The Investec Bank from which payments 
were currently made was an Investec Bank opened by 
Loubser Van Der Walt with client name TMM Holdings 
Proprietary Limited as is evident from Annexure TD24.  
Loubser Van Der Walt – Mr Van Der Walt informed TMM it is 
myself and Mr Ferreira on the 12t h of March that the 
aforesaid bank account was opened in order to receive 
payments in terms of the agreements concluded with the 
applicants and payment made into the account where with 
specific reference to Wetlands Wakkerstroom Farm.  I 
10 
append hereto a copy of an email received from Mr Van Der 
Walt and that email says what they are saying. 
 
Then they say 70.15 – any payments from the actual 
bank account of TMM to the aforesaid account were made in 
account – were made in accordance with the agreement with 
Mr – of Mr Van Der Walt. 
 
Then they continue at 70.16 – Mr Van Der Walt had 
full control and exclusive access to the account opened in 
the name of Loubser Van Der Walt.  The funds paid into the 
aforesaid account of Mr Van Der Walt were paid for the 
20 
referenced projects and I can categorically state that 
applicants had no further control or access to the said 
account. 
 
Mr Oellerman did not request any applicants to 
address him on the aforesaid structure and I submit that as a 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 203 of 343 
 
consequence his provisional report – reports are misleading, 
inaccurate and factually flawed.  There is – Mr Oellerman 
implicates the applicants with the answers, suggestions and 
unfounded assumptions of wrongdoing. The applicants were 
not allowed an opportunity to address Mr Oellerman while 
the applicants believed Mr Oellerman had an obligation to 
investigate the matter properly. 
 
Now Chairperson I just want to point this out because 
we 
earlier 
in 
the 
affidavit 
and 
remember 
this 
is 
an 
application to cross-examine.  Mr Dubeck says that the 
10 
purpose of the affidavit is for them to acquire a forensic – I 
mean the person – the reason for the delay is so they can 
appoint a forensic investigator who can present a report. 
 
This affidavit Chairperson is in July 2020.  What you 
do not find in this affidavit is how much they paid into Mr Van 
Der Walt’s account – whether they made any enquiries from 
Mr Van Der Walt as to the allegations made by Mr Oellerman 
and what the results of the forensic investigations are that 
they conducted. 
 
But perhaps most importantly Chairperson they do 
20 
not tell you how much TMM Holdings that is Mr Ferreira’s 
company paid into Mr Van Der Walt’s TMM account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well two aspects that seems to come out 
of the paragraphs that you have read or three. 
1. Is that they say in the paragraph that Mr Montana read 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 204 of 343 
 
that is 70.9.1 none of the payments mentioned in the 
report of Mr Oellerman were made from a TMM bank 
account.  I am the Chief Financial Officer of TMM and 
Siyangena and I can confirm the aforesaid and I will put 
Mr Oellerman to the proof thereof if and when allowed 
an opportunity. 
So he is saying in other words whatever payments are 
mentioned up – whatever payments are mentioned in that 
report – Mr Oellermann’s report those payments did not 
come from a TMM bank account.  That is point 1. 
10 
2. He says at 70.9.2 – the bank account from which the 
TMM payments were made is not a bank account 
opened by TMM or any of its officials or any of its 
employees.  It is in fact it seems as if it was a cash 
Money Market account opened for on behalf Loubser 
Van Der Walt Attorneys at Investec Bank. 
And then later he says at 70.18 – paragraph 70.18 – the 
Investec account from which payments were apparently 
made was an Investec account opened with Loubser Van Der 
Walt Incorporated with client name TMM Holdings Pty LTD as 
20 
is evident from Annexure TT24 appended hereto. 
 
So there is some TMM Holdings mentioned and then 
he says at 70.14 – Loubser Van Der Walt Incorporated Mr 
Riaan Van Der Walt informed TMM (myself and Mr Mario 
Ferreira) on 12 March 2014 that the aforesaid account was 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 205 of 343 
 
opened in order to receive payments in terms of the 
agreements concluded with the applicants. 
 
So he is saying Mr Van Der Walt told them – told him 
and Ferreira that that account was opened in order to 
receive payments in terms of the agreements concluded with 
these applicants namely Siyangena, TMM Holdings and Mr 
Ferreira. 
 
And the payments made into that – into the account 
were with specific reference to the Wetlands/Wakkerstroom 
Farm and then he appends it.  Okay – so he says that is 
10 
what they were about. 
 
And then there is some part – that is in Afrikaans 
there.  Then in 70.15 – paragraph 70.15 he says:  Any 
payments made from the actual bank account of TMM to the 
aforesaid account were made in accordance 
with the 
agreement with Mr Van Der Walt. 
 
So based on para – on that it seems that he says 
there are payments made from TMM’s actual bank account to 
this particular account but he says they were in accordance, 
in agreement with Mr Van der Walt, which I think he must 
20 
be 
meaning 
is 
the 
agreement 
concerning 
Wetlands/Wakkerstroom Farm. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So based on that, there were 
some payments he says came from TMM – I mean to that 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 206 of 343 
 
account.  It is a question of what they were for.  And then 
he says, paragraph 17.16: 
“Mr Van der Walt had full control and exclusive 
access to the aforesaid account opened in the 
name of Loubser Van der Walt Incorporated...” 
 
This suggests that they did not have access to 
the account and the monies but they – the TMM did pay - 
made some payments in that account in accordance with 
the agreement with Van der Walt.  That is at least my 
understanding and Mr Montana will give his understanding.   
10 
 
And then paragraph 17.17, he says: 
“The funds paid into the aforesaid account of 
Van der Walt were paid for the Reference 
Project and I can categorically state that the 
applicants had no further control of, over or 
access to the said account...” 
 
So again, I guess the project is the – is that of 
Wetlands/Wakkerstroom 
Farm. 
 
That 
would 
by 
my 
understanding. 
 
Okay 
Mr 
Soni, 
you 
wanted 
to 
say 
something in connection with what you read?  I was just 
20 
indicating what my impression was. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that is exactly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I submit, Chairperson, what a proper 
reading of the document – of the affidavit says. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 207 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, the point I want to make 
Chairperson is.  That we know from what Mr Van der Walt 
says that he paid from the Precise Trade account and when 
he reflected on the Precise account, the debits he made 
notes of that and when he reflected the credits, he made 
notes of them and we have been through some of them.  If 
I could just deal with the very first one on page 90 where 
he 
says 
the 
two 
credits 
on 
the 
18 t h 
of 
June 
of 
R 1,85 million and R 4 million came from TMM...  That is 
10 
what he says here.   
 
TMM does not dispute because they have had 
this report with this.  They do not dispute that those 
amounts were in fact paid into the TMM Holdings account 
from which, clearly, transfer was made to this account.  
What we have before us then Chairperson, when we get to 
the nub of the matter is, that the funds that Mr Van der 
Walt says were provided by TMM loans that he talks about 
that came into this account, were probably true and I say 
that for two reasons. 
20 
 
One is.  He says:  Here is my notes on what 
happened.  TMM, Siyangena, Mr Dubek and Mr Ferreira all 
had an opportunity to say but those payments do not 
accord with what we gave to him.  They have not done so, 
not even up to today.  Now, there are serious allegations 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 208 of 343 
 
against them.   
 
They bring an application to say:  We want the 
proceedings urgent.  Our name is being smudged.  When 
they have an opportunity they do not use it.  They have not 
used it up to today.  I ask you to draw one inference from 
that, Chairperson.  They do not have a proper answer to 
the inferences to be drawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is alright.  We are at 
eighteen minutes to five and we obviously are not going to 
finish today.  Mr Montana, you want to say something?  
10 
Say something and then we will have to adjourn because 
we have run out of today’s time.  And then I have got to try 
and see what we need to do but obviously also to the 
extent that some work connected with this need to be 
done, that may be done but to the extent that Siyangena 
had said they had initiated a forensic investigation, it 
would be interesting to see what they ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Because 
they 
can 
just 
let 
the 
Commission have the report of their investigation of these 
20 
payments.  Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think Mr Soni is to recuse 
himself. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 209 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   I think he is a – I think that he has 
demonstrated signs of being bias, signs of being – of 
having taken sides on these issues.  And I think, Chair – 
ask him a question he did not want until this is read.  So I 
think that I would argue that he has actually shown – you 
see, he has withdrawn all those notes and he is reading – I 
think that this report not reading it properly Chair.  Let me 
first just quote two parts, Chair, because I think it is not in 
the interest of justice.  Let me read first seven and eight in 
10 
page – it is page 4, I think.  Paragraph 7 and paragraph 8.  
Let me start there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You say page 4.  It cannot 
be page 4, I think. 
MR MONTANA:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 4 of the affidavit. 
MR MONTANA:   Of the affidavit, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   I think it is a standalone.  It is not part of 
the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  What paragraph? 
MR MONTANA:   Paragraphs 7 and 8.  Let me read that 
first, Chair, to go into this. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 210 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   It is submitted that fair...”  Can I proceed, 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Do you have it, Chair?  Should I proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I got it.  It starts at page 3.  Is that 
right? 
MR MONTANA:   Page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you said you want to read from 
paragraph 7? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, paragraph 7 and paragraph 8, Chair, 
before I make my point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay my ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Sorry, sorry ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...starts at page 3. 
MR MONTANA:   Is there ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   My paragraph 7 starts at page 3. 
MR MONTANA:   At page 3...  No, no I meant page 4, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yours started – let me make sure we 
have got the same ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   The same, Chair.  I think from what we 
are reading it should be the same. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 211 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Dubek’s affidavit, is that right? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in terms of red numbers, paragraph 
7 is at page 8 on my red numbers at the top. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair.  I think the red numbers is 
page 4, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   I think, in fact, it is the letter Chair from 
the attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A letter? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, before the affidavit.  Sorry, Chair.  
The covering letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The notice? 
MR MONTANA:   The notice, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The notice of motion? 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is what you are talking about.  
Okay alright.   
MR MONTANA:   Do you have that on page 4, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it.  Oh, no, no I thought 
20 
you were reading – you were going to read from the 
affidavit. 
MR MONTANA:   The affidavit itself.  Oh, no my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The notice of motion, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 212 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Yes, I have got it. 
MR MONTANA:   You have got it, Chair.  So the letter says 
– the notice says: 
“It 
is 
submitted 
that 
fair 
administrative 
procedures requires an unbiased, objective 
and transparent approach, not only in the 
presentation 
of 
evidence 
but 
also 
in 
the 
process of obtaining evidence prior to it being 
presented. 
If the evidence of Mr Oellerman and all 
10 
witnesses giving evidence are related to the 
relationship 
between 
the 
applicants 
and 
PRASA, as well as Lucky Montana, are allowed 
to 
be 
led 
without 
the 
veracity 
of 
such 
evidence, it will have a severely prejudicial 
impact on the applicant’s right to a fair hearing 
in the high court...” 
 
Of course, Chair, that related to the court matter 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   ...that was mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, let me go to the matter.  I think 
that we are dealing with three different accounts.  I think it 
is very important, Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 213 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but remember that at this stage, we 
are not dealing with whether they are right or wrong.   
MR MONTANA:   Yes – no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just – I initially just wanted to identify 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...whether this is the affidavit and you 
confirmed.  And then I wanted to establish where exactly 
where they say what you said they say and we have found 
out where that is. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, the heart of what Mr Soni and I 
quoted refers to payment from TMM to Precise Trade.  That 
is  - so the affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, from an Investec account. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That is the – no, not Investec – that is an 
Investec account, Chair, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So is clearly saying there is not transfer 
from us as TMM ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   TMM, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...to Precise Trade. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 214 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   That is the first thing he is saying, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   That is number one.  The second he is 
saying, Chair, and let us not confuse(?) them because then 
we are going to confuse ourselves Chair.  The second thing 
is that we had a relationship with Loubser Van der Walt as 
a firm which then opened an account because they were 
managing certain things for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   So when he says they have made 
payments, they are not referring to the account of Precise 
Trade, Chair.  They are referring to the account of Loubser 
van der Walt, and that is why in the affidavit they take 
exception to some of the things that is being said, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Mr Soni, of course, and consciously, 
Chair.  Consciously.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   He conflates those two to support the 
20 
view despite the fact that the notes will be drawn.  
[Speaker not clear]  You remember Chair when I said that I 
do not want a concession about these notes?  He then 
retains back to his own original position, okay?  The 
original position says they do not deny.   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 215 of 343 
 
 
Chair, let me say.  Today we are having a major 
dispute on this issue and I think Chair one of the major 
things we will ask, especially in relation to this one.  I do 
not think you should wait for the report  It is in the interest 
of justice for these chaps not be happen to verify their 
accounts.   
 
You remember why we are here, Chair?  It is 
said that R 36 million of mister – of Precise Trade comes 
from TMM.  Chair, I am still saying it is false.  They are 
saying it is false, okay?  Because they are not talking 
10 
about that – they are saying if you talk about our work with 
Loubser, the firm, the fact(?) work and that is for one, two, 
three.   
 
The allegations that have been made Chair was 
that Siyangena, which is a division of – it is one of the 
subsidiaries or whatever of TMM.  They are not one and 
the same company.  Siyangena was given R 4 billion worth 
of contracts and it paid.  That is the allegation, Chair.  
That is why I am here.  We say we must deal with the 
properties.   
20 
 
Mr Soni said, when I raise my objection, he said:  
We know for sure.  We know that these payments were 
made by TMM.  Okay?  So he ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, Chairperson. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no ...[intervenes]  
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 216 of 343 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   May I just object? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is about the fifth time 
Mr Montana said that.  Every time I put a proposition to 
Mr Montana or to you, I have said that this is what is 
indicated in the bank account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I did not say it was paid.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I said that is what Mr Van der Walt 
10 
says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And I challenge again Mr Montana 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...to get his script wherever he gets 
his scripts from to say that I said I know they have paid it.  
Chair, I did not say that.   
MR MONTANA:   Chair, it is not an objection.  If you are in 
Parliament ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...you are going to say we are going to 
study the Hansard.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   In this particular instance, the transcript 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 217 of 343 
 
and the recording will show us.  Unfortunately, Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what he is saying is.  He did not 
say he has personal knowledge.  I think that is what he is 
saying. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was simply saying this is what is said 
by Van der Walt based on the document, as I understand it. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, when I took – when I made the 
objection ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...and I think at the last and the next 
time.  So that is why it is not an objection, Chair.  He has 
got a different view.  I listened, he spoke, you spoke Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   You reverted back to him.  Now is my to 
respond to these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MONTANA:   So the objection Chair is not an objection.  
Chair, I want to say and I hope that when I bring the clip of 
what he said earlier on today, you will see that that clip 
Chair – he says exactly.  He said we know.  And I asked 
the question earlier on.  Who is we?  s that the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 218 of 343 
 
Commission or is that him or the Legal Department, Chair?  
 
And I will be able to demonstrate that to you, 
Chair.  And that is why I am saying Chair that I find myself 
dealing with an evidence leader who does not want to 
assist the Commission but is putting a particular agenda.  
Chair, the allegation before us is that TMM paid for 
properties, okay?   
 
Now TMM says:  We are not involved in that.  We 
never paid – our relationship is with the legal firm on these 
particular issues.  The allegation is that properties were 
10 
paid for from the proceeds of the tender that was awarded 
to Siyangena.  These guys are challenging that Chair, 
okay?  So the accounts must not be conflated, firstly.  So 
there is an account of TMM/Siyangena.   
 
There is an account of Lombard(?) which – what 
Robert spoke about and there is an account of Precise 
Trade, okay?  So that is the first issue, Chair.  So they are 
not saying we never paid Precise Trade at all, okay?  So 
that is the statement I am making, Chair.  And therefore 
would – they are saying, would not have been involved in 
20 
paying for Mr Montana’s properties, okay?   
 
Now this is conflated, Chair, to suggest they 
have paid some money.  It is actually an dishonest 
presenting Chair because you are saying there is pay – no.  
There is payment – there is a relationship that – there is a 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 219 of 343 
 
relationship that they described there.  And I do not think 
Chair that we should – the Chair should say:  In the light of 
this big issue that we should go and say let us wait for the 
report.   
 
The Commission made certain statements which 
are not – I want to argue Chair, they are not factually 
based.  They are based on – and that is why I even said 
the inference we draw suggests.  Now I asked Chair.  You 
said we should not go to that issue, earlier on.  I said, 
would Mr Soni says with absolute certainty to you Chair 
10 
now – I am asking you – and tell you and the conscious 
say TMM paid Precise Trade and Precise Trade, not 
inferences, Precise Trade then bought 
properties for 
Montana?   
 
My – the proposition – the different propositions 
that I have presented and which is backed by the evidence, 
it shows two things Chair.  It shows Montana buying 
properties, telling them and entering and investing in other 
properties.  That is one.  That we can see in documents 
including the annexures that I gave to you today.   
20 
 
There is no – and I mentioned very clearly, there 
is no Siyangena in all of those properties.  The second 
one, Chair.  The second proposition that is very clear, 
which he does not want to deal with, it shows a whole 
range of investors Chair.  A whole range of investors, in 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 220 of 343 
 
investing in – and I am not referring to TMM, investors 
outside investing in Precise Trade.  How did they make a 
choice that no that money does not come from all these 
other investors?  It comes from this particular on.   
 
Chair, I think it is a very important factually 
issue.  And I am saying that if you listen to what Mr Soni 
has been saying now.  Now-now, after he has read this 
thing, Chair.  And his response to Siyangena.  Somebody 
who 
is 
assisting 
the 
Commission 
would 
have 
said 
something different that is very important.  And I see that 
10 
he is emotionally – he is so invested in this matter, to use 
that word.   
 
He is so invested.  He is passionate about it, 
Chair, because if I was not here, Chair, we are going to 
move from the premise that TMM paid Precise Trade.  TMM 
did not pay Precise Trade and the fair process to follow is 
not for Mr Soni is to speak on behalf of – and Mr Montana 
and Mr Soni to speak on behalf of these guys.   
 
It is perhaps proper for either these guys to 
come and tell and say to the Commission and the 
20 
Commission asks questions, Chair.  But I feel that Mr Soni 
has cross the lined – Chair.  And I want to say Chair that I 
do not know what is the procedure.  We approach the end 
of this process, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 221 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Maybe I need to take legal advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But I think that, not only on this one, 
Chair.  Throughout has shown himself that he is incapable 
of assisting this Commission and the fact that he can 
promise you that you are going keep take out all those – 
what do you call it – notes and other documents that were 
lifted from elsewhere.  Yet when he speaks, he goes back 
to all of that to what – saying Chair.  [Speaker not clear]  
He actually affirms.   
10 
 
Now Chair, I think we should go back.  I think we 
should go back and say – and say Chair that it is important 
that we look at these issues dispassionately.  I do not think 
he is capable of doing it now, Chair.  I think that you can 
see the level of – actually the level of hostility towards 
TMM/Siyangena.  It is unprecedented from an evidence 
leader but that has been consistent.   
 
And I said on my first day when I arrived here, 
Chair.  I said Mr Soni is conflicted.  He refused.  And what 
did he do?  He then in his own statement confirmed that he 
20 
did work and was briefed by Werksmans and all of those 
things.  Now I am not surprised with the way in which he 
conducts himself.  Chair, the factual matter is.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, Chairperson.  I must object 
again. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 222 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But what are you ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I did confirm, Chairperson is, that I 
did one opinion from PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I never said I have worked 
Werksmans in relation to ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   But that is a conflict, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   It was not disclosed before I said it here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Let ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   He had a duty to disclose that to the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us do this ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   But can I finalise my point, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Because that is not an objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I said he is completed.  I am still 
repeating it now, Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, what should happen in this issue 
and maybe the issue about the verifying all of these things, 
okay?  And I know because I have done my own preliminary 
work to see where the numbers are.  I would not come here 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 223 of 343 
 
and be...  [Speaker not clear]   
 
But the network that I spoke about when I read 
the conclusion has been determined and it is quite clear 
that they are reaching out to Mr Soni in a particular way 
and that is why you hear the line that he is taking.  And I 
am saying Chair I have got an objection to that.  I took out 
– we agreed – I mean we wasted about two hours, taking 
out certain documents because I said they are based on... 
[Speaker moves away from microphone – unclear].   
 
Chair, let me ask a silly question.  Mr Soni says 
10 
with absolute certainty to you now, not tomorrow, now 
Chair and say that I know from all the documents and all 
the work that I have done that TMM paid Precise Trade who 
in turn paid for – who in turn paid for Mr Montana’s 
properties.  Chair, I think that question is better if he is 
standing there and tell us because – but Chair I have lost 
absolute confidence in him.   
 
I think that when I am invited - I am not sure, I 
think that when I am taking through my affidavit, assuming 
that I will still be invited – Mr Soni has showed Chair – I do 
20 
not think that he is helping you, he is helping the 
Commission.  He is pursuing Chair a pre-determined 
agenda and that is why the documents, some of them, are 
left out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 224 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Others are presented ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   ...in a way that will push a particular 
narrative, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have made the point Mr Montana.  
One.  We have run out of time.  Mr Soni, you may wish to 
respond to some of this now, in which case you can do so, 
but we have run out of time.  With all the time constraints 
that the Commission has, one has got to reflect as to how 
we are going to complete what remains.  And you have 
10 
made the points you have made.  Mr Soni, do you want to 
say something or do you want to say it at another time? 
MR MONTANA:   Before that Chair.  I thought you would 
clarify the process to call for Mr Soni to recuse himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am not going to decide that now 
but I heard what you say. 
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni, do you want to...? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, may I make this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is, as I recall, the fifth day that 
Mr Montana...  [Speaker ’s voice drops – unclear]  The 
initial 
enquiring(?) 
took 
place 
and 
things 
that 
get 
settled(?).  I just want to make this one point.  What 
changed today was the question I raised with Mr Montana 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 225 of 343 
 
about the Parkwood property and the fact that you would 
enter into an deal, sell a property for R 6,8 million and 
three weeks later enter into a deal to make improvements 
on the property.   
 
And I said people may say but that does not look 
proper or appropriate.  That is not what ordinary people do.  
It does not look like what you were doing.  And I can say to 
you Chairperson, you can look at the record, you can look 
at everything.  That is when Mr Montana thought that here 
is somebody who is going to get to challenge the version 
10 
he wants to put.  Now he is entitled to challenge it.   
 
Chairperson, I cannot as an evidence leader – I 
cannot come to the Commission with no prima facie view 
about what...  [Speaker ’s voice drops – unclear]  I have to 
have a view.  Otherwise, I would be wasting taxpayers’ 
money by investigating things that in a sense are not worth 
investigating.   
 
The PRASA issue has been in the public space 
from at least two thousand and...  [Speaker ’s voice drops – 
unclear]  It does not mean Mr Montana is guilty but when 
20 
the – when one looks at the evidence, one sees that 
Mr Montana has many things to answer for.  And I did not 
say it does mean that he does something wrong.   
 
At the same time, when there is evidence, my 
statements(?) to Montana as you clarified it yesterday, and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 226 of 343 
 
I want to suggest that this is what the evidence may lead 
to, I am obliged to put it to Mr Montana.  And I did that 
yesterday and I did that today and that, in regard to the 
Parkwood property Chairperson is what turned Mr Montana 
into realising that he may have... [Speaker ’s voice drops – 
unclear]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice was lowered towards the end 
of ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry.  I say, that is what turned 
Mr Montana into realising he may have certain difficulties 
10 
in providing answers.  It does not mean he has to...  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear]   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But that is a sense – that is the 
sense I got from the time that question was put. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the next question Chairperson 
was when I drew a link between the R 3,5 million paid in 
respect of the guarantee for the Waterkloof property and 
drew attention to the R 3,5 million which, according to 
20 
Mr Van der Walt, had been paid into the account earlier 
that day(?)   
 
Now, Mr Montana is entitled to ask for my 
recusal.  I will just make one point as far as that goes, 
Chairperson.  What cannot be said is that I have conducted 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 227 of 343 
 
myself in a fashion not befitting an evidence leader before 
this Commission.   
 
Now, one will hear the application.  Just make 
one final point, Chairperson, and that is the request(?) for 
the recusal of an evidence leader is very different from the 
request for the recusal of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I am not going to – but I am not 
hearing the merits of any application for recusal at the 
moment. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have heard what Mr Montana says, 
requesting a recusal, but that may have to be dealt with in 
some other way because right now we have run out of time. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We do not have the time.  So I think we 
should adjourn, that’s number one. 
Number two, we can all reflect on the issues, I certainly 
will, and one of the things that I will be reflecting on will be 
the way forward particularly given the time constraints and 
to the extent that Mr Montana insists on or pursues his 
20 
application or request for your recusal then at some stage I 
would need to deal with that but I do want to say this, that 
has crossed my mind as we face the time constraints that 
we are facing, that despite the fact that we have had – you 
said five days, I think you said six days yesterday or today, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 228 of 343 
 
I am not sure. 
MR MONTANA:   I think today, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, six days.  We have not finished but 
from the point of view, as I understand it, of the evidence 
leaders, the issue of the properties was the last topic from 
their side.  Mr Montana may have wished to still say 
something after the topic of properties has been finalised, I 
am not sure, we covered some ground. 
 
It may well be that – well one, if one can find 
another time before the end of May, that would be 
10 
preference, but if we cannot find time it may be that the 
rest of the issues may have to be dealt with in writing.  So 
questions can be put and answers can be provided in 
writing and so on.  So that is one of the things that has 
crossed my mind but the preference is, if we can find time 
and we have a hearing like this, that is what the preference 
would be.    
 
So I am just sharing with you, both you, Mr Montana 
and Mr Soni, what has crossed my mind and you can start 
thinking about it, we do not have to decide it now, I must 
20 
reflect on it as well but I must best see whether we can 
find another time when there can be a hearing like this. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I would not have a problem with that, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 229 of 343 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But I will be deeply – I would be 
aggrieved, Chair, if this Commission – Mr Soni says my 
version.  Remember too that is why, Chair, I have been 
responding to all the allegations made against me.  I think, 
Chair, it will be fair that before this Commission adjourns 
or ends, if the oral hearings that Montana is given an 
opportunity to tell his story, his side of the story because I 
have been answering questions, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I think if the Commission says you 
cannot do that, then I also think that, Chair, I will apply to 
you to allow me that I make my own affidavit publicly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But, Chair, I think we will wait until you 
give us guidance on your decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So that one exercise – but I think it would 
be unfair, Chair, considering the issues that I have raised 
20 
in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I will say I will elaborate and deal 
with them in my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 230 of 343 
 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think it will be a gross act of 
injustice for this Commission not to hear  - even if it is a 
select few issues because of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But not to hear it and admit it, Chair, I 
think that it will be – it will be unacceptable to me, Chair, 
let me be very upfront about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, you are still talking 
about the affidavit that is subject to the process that has 
been going on between yourself …[intervenes] 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair, I think it will be – we said it 
will be ready on Thursday for you to decide, Chair, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, that is fine.  We know 
where we – what the position is with regard to that 
affidavit. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay.  No, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of what you may wish to say to 
the extent that you say you would like to tell your story, 
what kind of amount of time were you thinking of, if you 
were – if we found time before the end of May? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I do not know, I mean… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thirty minutes? 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I think it may take an entire 
morning or afternoon.  Let me indicate the issues that we 
have discussed, Chair. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 231 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, do not indicate, I just 
wanted to have an idea.  Obviously I might not give you the 
amount of time you wish for. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, I will accept that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But I think the question I am raising is 
that if I say Mr Soni has taken sides, is he the right person 
to lead me, to lead me in my evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That is a big question, Chair, that we 
10 
have to look at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But on properties, Chair, I think, Chair, 
ultimately – I do not even want to pursue this anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I have said what I have said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I think that ultimately the evidence will 
guide – will be ultimately the determinant.  That is why I 
was asking that question, can Mr Soni say with absolute 
20 
certainty to this Commission that there has been payment 
from TMM and I think he has been avoiding that question, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But for now I will leave it at that, Chair, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 232 of 343 
 
and hope – and look forward to me presenting my 
evidence, Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  Let us then adjourn 
this day’s session and in one way or another there will be 
communication, Mr Montana, as to what is going to happen.  
We are going to adjourn for about 15 minutes to allow the 
evening session team to set up.  That will be evidence 
relating to Mr Gama and for the benefit of the public, 
tomorrow during the day I will be hearing the evidence of 
the Inspector General Dr Dintwe and in the evening 
10 
tomorrow we will also continue with Mr Gama’s evidence.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon, Mr Myburgh, good 
afternoon everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good afternoon, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am sorry, we are starting later 
than five o’clock but I think you were all here, you know 
what is happening, so – but once again, thank you to 
20 
everybody for all your cooperation so that we could sit this 
evening and try and cover quite some ground.  Yes, shall 
we have Mr Gama take the oath? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please administer the oath affirmation. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 233 of 343 
 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR GAMA:   Siyabonga Innocent Gama. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR GAMA:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
10 
else but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and 
say so help me God. 
SIYABONGA INNOCENT GAMA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess legal representation is the same 
as before? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is the same as before, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Thank you for 
availing yourself once again, Mr Gama. 
20 
MR GAMA:   Thank you very much, Chair, for having me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama, could I start by asking you 
please to turn to Transnet bundle 7, EXHIBIT BB28, that is 
your exhibit, and could I ask you please to go to page 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 234 of 343 
 
250.352, it is about 50 or 60 pages from the back of the 
file, I assume. 
MR GAMA:   352? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   352, yes.  You would have seen that 
since the last sitting the investigators in the Transnet 
stream got in touch with the journalist who wrote the article 
about your Oberoi stay and there you find at 352 and 
affidavit by Kyle Cohen.  I am not going to take you 
through the whole affidavit, I want to just paraphrase parts 
and then get your comment.  Mr Cohen says at paragraph 7 
10 
at page 353 that on the 19 August 2017 you responded in 
writing to the questions that he had put to you and they are 
attached as annexures and of significance for present 
purposes, if you go over the page at 7.2 he records that: 
“Gama further stated that he, Essa, had merely 
indicated he can book for me at the hotel, which I 
accepted.  Gama indicated that he would send me a 
copy of the receipt via telegram at telephone texting 
application we had to communicate.” 
And then Mr Cohen goes on to say at paragraph 8 at page 
20 
255 that: 
“Gama provided me with a copy of an invoice via 
telegram which he claimed to be from the Oberoi as 
proof that he had personally settled the bill.  The 
invoice is stamped paid.  However, the invoice does 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 235 of 343 
 
not reflect the name of the hotel nor does it reflect 
the name of the person who settled the bill.  The 
invoice reflects that it was printed in June 2017 
almost a year and half Gama’s stay at the hotel and 
roughly at the same time that I first contacted Gama 
regarding his stay at the hotel in question.  A copy 
of the invoice provided to me by Gama is attached 
at annexure KC4.” 
Perhaps I could just take you to that invoice and you will 
see that paragraph 8 that I have just read to you accords 
10 
with the journalist’s – the text of the article itself.   
 
Annexure KC4 you find at page 362 and you will see 
that it is stamped paid, it does not reflect the name of the 
hotel, does not reflect the name of the person who settled 
the bill and you will see that it was printed seems the 18 
June 2017.  Now previous in your testimony you told the 
Chairperson that the invoice that you gave to the journalist 
is that which you find at page 341 of the same bundle. 
MR GAMA:   Can you show me where I said that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Where did you say that you gave the 
20 
journalist – did I misunderstand your evidence?  Was that 
not your evidence? 
MR GAMA:   No, can you show me where I said that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, Mr Gama, I can go to the 
transcript if you want but if I have got it wrong you can 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 236 of 343 
 
correct me.  I am not - want to engage in a battle of wits, 
did I misunderstand your evidence? 
MR GAMA:   You probably did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, can you just explain – 
perhaps we will deal with it this way.  Do you accept that 
you sent the journalist by way of telegram the invoice that 
appears at page 362? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Did you then obtain the 
invoice at 341 later? 
10 
MR GAMA:   Yes, it is a different invoice. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   It is dated on a different date.  As I have said 
to you, I wrote to the hotel because I did not have a copy 
and I asked the hotel to send me the invoice and this was 
in 2018 and they sent me this invoice in 2018. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what caused you to want to get 
another copy of the invoice in addition to that at 362? 
MR GAMA:   Because the one at 362, when I changed 
phones I lost that information that was on that phone so I 
20 
had a new phone and I did not have this invoice anymore.  
But if you look at the invoices they talk to the same issues. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you accept the invoice at 341 is 
not dated? 
MR GAMA:   Sorry? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 237 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is not dated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to - Mr Myburgh, just to for the sake 
of the transcript to confirm that when you say 341 you 
mean 250.341. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I do, I beg your pardon.  Yes, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I was looking for the page and I 
forget to factor into 250.341.  Okay, I am sorry, I 
interrupted, do you want to just repeat your question or 
whatever you put to him? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I put to Mr Gama that it does not 
appear that 341 is dated. 
MR GAMA:   No, I does not have a date, as you say, but it 
is the invoice that I requested in 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course the date he does not have is 
the date when it was issued, is that right? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just has the date of arrival and date of 
departure. 
MR GAMA:   The invoice does not have a date but the 
20 
email that I requested the invoice on it will show when it 
was sent to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but that is not here, is that right? 
MR GAMA:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The email is not part of the bundle. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 238 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:   But it can be sent here if you want it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you have got it, ja. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, not I think that would be good if it 
could be sent. 
MR GAMA:   Then what the Commission has also obtained 
is an affidavit which I understood from my learned friend is 
in dispute, so we will deal with that, I suppose, from a Mr 
Cyril Petrus Lourens.  That you find at 342.  What Mr 
Lourens purports to do in this affidavit is to analyse the so-
10 
called metadata in relation to your invoice at 341 and he 
concludes that that invoice was created.  If you have a 
look at page 250.346, he concludes that it was created at 
paragraph 23.1 on the 19 February 2018.   
ADV OLDWAGE SC:   Mr Chair, I am going to object to 
what is being put to Mr Gama on the following bases.  First 
one is that this kind of a document or report by an expert, 
someone who professes to be an expert in information 
technology, as this deponent appears to be doing, will in 
the ordinary course describe the methodology employed by 
20 
him or her with reference to the retrieval of electronic data 
and 
that 
is 
governed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
Electronic 
Communications and Transactions Act.  There is no 
methodology employed and as and by way of example, 
assuming there was a mirror image made of a hard drive 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 239 of 343 
 
and in this retrieval process, that hard drive is considered.  
The governing principle is he has totals or what is 
commonly described as the algorithm is central to that.  In 
other words, you have two unique numbers and if they 
match, it is an indication that there was no attempt to 
interfere with the date and modify and so forth.  We have 
none of that methodology described so I cannot on the face 
of merely what is presented in an affidavit accept that this 
information is accurate and correct.  In fact, I can raise 
many reasons why I would object to the reception of this 
10 
kind of evidence if we were in a trial setting.  Not that I am 
deprived presently of the opportunity of doing that, hence 
me raising this objection. 
 
The second concern what actually appears in this 
document which will then tell that what Mr Myburgh now 
has done is to put that this document’s creation date is the 
19 February 2018 and to put that as a fact is wrong 
because, you see, and regrettably in small print what this 
deponent has done, is he says there is a reference to a 
footnote.  That very footnote is not of relevance but if you 
20 
turn the page, there is also a creation date at paragraph 
22.1 that talks about file created and then there is a 
footnote at number 11 in small print which reads: 
“Date created or date copied from one drive to 
another (this is not necessarily the original creation 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 240 of 343 
 
date but this is how NTFS file systems stores 
dates.) 
There 
is 
no 
certainty. 
 
One, 
from 
the 
methodology 
employed, which is lacking in this document. And, for 
instance, I just want to add to that, if you were to analyse 
hard drives you would talk about the insertion of certain 
equipment or items, a right blocker which would prevent a 
duplication or perhaps interference with that electronic 
data.  There is no reference to any of that but what we see 
in the foot note is that what is being presented here is not 
10 
certain.  In other words, it is capable of variation.  So we 
cannot put to the witness, with respect, that that is 
definitely the creation date.  If we have to have regard to 
that and I want to avoid a situation where because of the 
time pressures that the Commission is working under, me 
having to re-examine Mr Gama on this point.  The position 
is, if this document was created on 19 February 2018 and 
we look at the time zone and I am going into a bit of detail 
here to demonstrate my objection.  That UTC is something 
that applies to Europe and perhaps even the United 
20 
Kingdom.  It is not something created in South Africa.   
So if the suggestion is that this document was 
created on that date, I want to make it clear that it could 
not have been created by Mr Gama.  But we cannot begin 
to accept that there is any truthfulness or that that 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 241 of 343 
 
assertion is in fact correct by virtue of what appears in the 
very document.  So that is my objection, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chair, I think this is maybe a lot 
to do about nothing because Mr Gama himself says that I 
no longer had the invoice that was printed in 2017, so I 
asked the hotel for another copy, so it was more than likely 
printed in 2018.  We are not suggesting that Mr Gama has 
fabricated the invoice at 341, what this metadata reveals is 
that the invoice was in fact created at the UAE by the hotel 
10 
but it is the date that is of significance to show you that we 
are dealing with two different invoices.  If he has accepted 
that, that he gave the journalist the 2017 invoice and then 
he went and got another invoice in 2018, and that is 
common cause, then I suppose to a large extent the 
metadata falls away because if Mr Gama gives us the email 
where he requested the invoice from the hotel and he can 
give us the string coming back then presumably the 
creation date would correspond.  
 
But if I could just show you one thing and that is 
20 
that what the deponent says at paragraph 24: 
“I confirm the results from E K Spikes(?) assessing 
the properties of the document in Abode Acrobat 
Professional and also by extracting the metadata of 
the document with an ExiFTool, results are noted in 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 242 of 343 
 
annexure CL2.” 
Now CL2, you will see, Chairperson, is at 351 and there 
you see very clearly that this was created it says on the 19 
September 2018.  So I will consider my learned friend’s 
objections and, if necessary, we can improve this affidavit.  
But as I say, if we can get the email string from Mr Gama 
then presumably it may very well add up to this and not be 
an issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, so …[intervenes] 
ADV OLDWAGE SC:   Mr Chair, given the response by my 
10 
learned friend, I have asked that he then holds over on 
further questioning in relation to particular document.  We 
are happy to provide him with copies of the emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I certainly have no more questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I do want though to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the email can be provided by 
tomorrow after – ja, when we start, as we resume.  Okay. 
MR GAMA:   Chair, I just want to say I do not know – I do 
20 
not think we need – or we needed any expert to send you 
these kinds of documents if the issue was these invoices, 
they do not look the same.  The contents of the invoices 
are exactly the same but one was obtained later than the 
other.  That could have been verified with me, it does not 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 243 of 343 
 
need – what do you call this kind of person? 
CHAIRPERSON:   This particular expert. 
MR GAMA:   It does not need this MacGyver, I do not know 
what they calls this, physical forensic… 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Well, 
perhaps 
I 
can 
just 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine because I think there is 
agreement that – let us wait until the email has been 
provided and take it from there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think the reason why we got the 
10 
affidavit will become clear now.  So, Mr Gama, when I was 
questioning you on the 30 April at page 77 of the 
transcript, you said: 
“Yes, I did not have a copy of the bill so I 
approached the hotel to send me – I just gave them 
the dates when I was there.” 
I say: 
“Yes but this paragraph reflects that you provided 
the journalist with an invoice.” 
Mr Gama: 
20 
“Yes, it could be this invoice.” 
Now we are talking about 250.341. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, so …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just if you would bear with me?  I 
say: 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 244 of 343 
 
“But how can it be that invoice because it is 
recorded here, unless it is wrong, that the invoice 
does not show the hotel’s name.” 
We were referring to the journalist’s article. 
“It does not say you settled the bill and was printed 
in June 2017.” 
Mr Gama: 
“He probably got it wrong.” 
Myburgh: 
“Alright, do I understand that you say that you sent 
10 
this invoice 250.341 to the journalist?” 
And you say yes. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I think there was no clarity that the 
contents is the same anyway, it has not changed.  But an 
invoice that is generated in 2018 could not have been sent 
to somebody in 2017.  I think that is clear.  Here I think it 
is a matter of semantics, really.  All I said was the contents 
of the invoice are the same.  In fact, when I was asking for 
a copy of the invoice, I used the dates that I was there and 
I said these are the dates I was there, can you send me a 
20 
copy?  And they sent me a copy and the contents of the 
invoice numbers and whatever is in the invoice, it has not 
changed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then to drive the point home, you 
say: 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 245 of 343 
 
“I sent him this invoice, 250.341” 
You say yes.  I say: 
“Right.” 
You say: 
“Yes, is not any other.” 
MR GAMA:   Can we agree that the contents remain the 
same, they have not changed? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   They have changed, Mr Gama, 
because the one has its stamped date, the one has a date 
when it was printed, the other does not.  We have gone 
10 
through that but the point is that you told the Chairperson 
that 
you 
sent 
the 
journalist 
341, 
that 
is 
why 
we 
…[intervenes] 
MR GAMA:   No, I said to you – and you have just quoted 
me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   You said I said to you that it could be.  That is 
what you quoted just now.  I do not have this thing that you 
are reading from, my transcript, but if you gave me a copy 
we could both quote what you have just quoted to me.  You 
20 
have just said to me that I said it could be.  I never said it 
is.  But the contents, Chair, as I persist with this matter, 
the contents in terms of what the amounts were and all of 
that, they remain the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you do need to see the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 246 of 343 
 
transcript, that can be done, either now if there is a copy 
available or it can be obtained and later on it can be given 
to you and then questions can be put after you had a look. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, certainly, I will let my learned 
friend have my copy and he can deal with it in re-
examination, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, just to pick up on one issue 
and you confirmed what is state in the article, that you 
raised with Mr Essa or Mr Essa raised with you his 
10 
involvement in Trillian during your meeting in Dubai.  I just 
want to make sure that I understand your evidence 
correctly, Mr Gama.  At what point did you come to learn 
that Mr Essa had a shareholding in Trillian? 
MR GAMA:   It was much, much later.  It would probably be 
at some point in 2017 early, so when we were discussing 
with the journalist it then had dawned on me that what he 
had been talking about, about creating a black-owned 
consulting firm that he may in fact have been referring to 
the creation of Trillian.  So it had become public news at 
20 
some point probably in 2017 in that – he had some kind of 
shareholding or some interest in Trillian.  When I was at 
Transnet in 2016, as I indicated to you, there was a letter 
from Regiments that indicated that would be forming 
Trillian.  There was no mention of an Essa.  It was much 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 247 of 343 
 
later.  I think when one reads too many newspapers, I think 
that that is when that information had come about that 
Essa was also a shareholder in Trillian but I learnt that 
much later.  I would not know, it was certainly around the 
time when the journalist and I were having a discussion.  
Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I take you to a document that 
part of Mr Mohamedy’s affidavit?  Could I ask you to fish 
out his bundle BB3B?  Someone will help with that.  It 
should be, Mr Gama, here this side, 33B – BB3B.  Could I 
10 
ask you please to turn to page 519? 
MR GAMA:   519? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   519 and I am talking about the 
numbers at the top, MSM519. 
MR GAMA:   The bold ones? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, not the bold one, you should find 
a number above that. 
MR GAMA:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you see that?  An MSM number. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you will remember that you gave 
evidence as well that you spoke to Mr ESSA about a 
migration of work from Regiments to Trillian and this is one 
example of that, you find that at 519.  Are you there?  Do 
you see that this is a …[intervenes] 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 248 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:   No, I have never said I spoke to Mr Essa 
about a migration of work from Regiments to Trillian.  I 
have never said that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so the article says, quoting 
you: 
“Essa said the expertise would remain the same as 
core resources, would migrate from Regiments and 
that the quality of the work for Transnet would be 
unaffected.” 
I think you accept that last time, correct. 
10 
MR GAMA:   Ja, we never had a discussion about the name 
of the entity.  I never knew any name in terms of what the 
name of the entity was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, well I do not want to traverse 
ground we have already traversed, I want to try and go 
forward.  If you have a look at this document at page 
522.1, it is signed by you on the 9 May 2016, four or so 
months after your meeting with Mr Essa.  Do you see that?  
And the recommendation at that page is: 
“It 
is 
recommended 
that 
the 
acquisition 
and 
20 
disposal 
committee 
approves 
cession 
of 
the 
abovementioned contract from Regiments to Trillian, 
an increase in the scope for the detailed capital 
optimisation support serves and increase in the 
contract value from 375 million to 463.3 million.” 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 249 of 343 
 
Do you see that recommendation? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what I just want to direct your 
attention to is page 521 under the heading Discussion.  It 
says at paragraph 12: 
“On 13 April 2016 Mr Wood sent a letter to 
Transnet, annexure B, indicating that he is ceding 
his rights received from Regiments to Trillian.” 
13. 
Transnet then initiated its vendor approval process 
to ensure that there is no reason why Trillian cannot 
10 
be a vendor to Transnet.” 
Paragraph 14, over the page. 
“The process indicates the following.  The EEM 
affidavit provided for their level two BBBEE 
certification indicated that they are 60% 
black-owned shareholding.  Trillian Holdings 
(Pty) Ltd 60%, wholly owned by Salim Essa.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then it lists the other 
20 
shareholders and then at paragraph 16: 
“Trillian has in the past successfully provided 
services 
as 
a 
subcontractor 
to 
Regiments 
on 
various assignments.” 
Etcetera.  And that is how here Trillian came to replace 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 250 of 343 
 
Regiments on this particular contract. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And just – perhaps you can help me, 
is the shorthand for this contract the GFBE contract? 
MR GAMA:   Sorry, shorthand? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is this what is commonly referred to 
as the GFB Consulting contract? 
MR GAMA:   Okay sorry, I think I am lost there Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, well don’t worry about that. 
10 
MR GAMA:   You’re talking about what was being ceded? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes is this typically referred to as 
the GFB contract? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, the heading of it says it is a cession of 
the GHFB contract yes, that agreement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR GAMA:   That’s what was moving from ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I take it then  you accept on the 
assumption that you read this or let me not put it that way, 
did you I assume did you read this memorandum before 
20 
you signed it and recommended it? 
MR GAMA:   In the main what I understood from the letter 
that I had was that there was a letter from Mr Wood to us 
so I read that, that letter, I was not aware that at that time 
there was already this breakdown in terms of the actual 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 251 of 343 
 
shareholding but I note what it says, it says that there was 
a – Daniel Rooi, Johannes Fourie, there was also the 
Trillian Holdings which it says it was wholly owned by  
Salim Essa, and there was someone else, Arion nominees 
and the directors but I don’t think I went into much of that 
detail at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So on the face of this document as 
of that time Trillian Holdings Pty Limited had a 60% 
shareholding in Trillian correct? 
MR GAMA:   In this entity. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, and in fact that entity derived 
its 
BEE 
certification 
from 
on 
the 
face 
of 
it 
that 
shareholding? 
MR GAMA:   It derived its BEE certification from? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   From the 60% shareholding held by 
Mr Essa? 
MR GAMA:   Ja.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct. 
MR GAMA:   So I think that’s what people were talking 
about but I was not aware that our people actually knew 
20 
about it and had actually written it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So your evidence is you didn’t read 
this, you read the letter from Mr Wood? 
MR GAMA:   I received a letter from Mr Wood which was 
attached to the ... 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 252 of 343 
 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
At 
the 
four 
recommending 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, was that letter – was this 
memorandum attached to the letter? 
MR GAMA:   No when the cession was requested it was on 
the basis of two letters, there was a letter from Regiments 
and a letter from Mr Wood which was indicating what was 
happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR GAMA:   So I am saying that those I remember, these I 
10 
may have just glossed over and not paid too much 
attention but I see that it is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But of course the letter from Mr 
Wood would not have dealt with whether or not Transnet 
should approve Trillian as a vendor and that is by and 
large what this memo is about, paragraph 13 Transnet the 
initiated its vendor approval process to ensure that there is 
no reason why Transnet cannot – sorry Trillian cannot be a 
20 
vendor to Transnet and then that unfolds, in order to 
recommend ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   That’s the work that the procurement people 
do so I think as you will see that it is coming from the 
procurement or chief supply chain officer, he is talking 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 253 of 343 
 
about all of the work that they have done, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying you signed this 
memo without reading it? 
MR GAMA:   No, no that is not what I am saying, I am 
saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying that. 
MR GAMA:   I am saying that I may have just glossed over 
it, it was not something that was probably important at the 
time.  So it is always interesting with the benefit of 
hindsight when people say okay just look at this memo I 
10 
can see what it says, but what was foremost in my mind 
was that the work was moving to – with Wood from 
Regiments to this new entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying you didn’t read it in 
any detail, you glossed over it, is that what you are 
saying? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I didn’t read it in any detail, I was aware 
of – and I had in possession what they are saying in item 
12, where we received a letter from Mr Wood which they 
say is Annexure B, and then it was then saying that his 
20 
...[indistinct] received from Regiments to Trillian Capital so 
I think at that time in my mind’s eye he was the main 
shareholder of this new entity called Trillian Capital 
something, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 254 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I want to then perhaps move off 
this topic, but I just want to ask you one last question on 
this, a penultimate question, you gave evidence earlier 
about how you were a bit irritated with Mr Essa because he 
almost tricked you into meeting with him at the Gupta 
residence, do you recall giving that evidence? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why – I don’t know if I have asked 
you why did you agree to meet with Mr Essa again at this 
time in January 2016, in the light of your previous 
10 
experience when you met with him? 
MR GAMA:   When you say why did I agree to meet with 
him, well I met with him I had in quite cut and clear when I 
last met with him and I had voiced my anger in terms of 
what I thought was an ambush, and I dealt with that issue, 
so if somebody then says no I would like to meet with you 
about another issue then I said okay fine let’s meet, and 
then he wanted to talk about creating a consulting entity.  
It wasn’t really going to take anything away from me, I 
probably just spent an hour or so with him. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want to just give you an 
opportunity to comment on this because sometimes the 
timelines are lost on one.  By the time that you met Mr 
Essa in January 2016 in Dubai on the money flows 
investigation Chairperson I am assuming that investigation 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 255 of 343 
 
is upheld by you, what we know by that time is that Mr 
Essa had taken 50 cents in every rand of fees that 
Regiments had charged Transnet in respect of a variety of 
contracts.  Mr Essa or one of his companies had been 
appointed as a skills development partner to Regiments.  
Mr 
Essa 
through 
Tequesta 
and 
Regiments Asia 
had 
concluded business development services agreements with 
the Chinese locomotive manufacturers in respect of the 95 
locomotives, the 100 locomotives and the 1064 locomotives 
and you had authorised payment already to Trillian in 
10 
December of respect of the Club Loan of R93million, so 
while Mr Essa for a long time was in the background now 
he came to the foreground where he was effectively a 
majority shareholder in a service provider to Transnet, in 
that context that you met him all of this had been done 
before and as I put to you already the money flows 
investigation is to the effect that what I have sketched to 
you was part and parcel of a very major money laundering 
scheme involving the Guptas. 
 
That’s the context in which you met the man.  
20 
MR GAMA:   Okay Mr Myburgh is it your contention that I 
knew about these payments or these money flows that you 
are talking about?   Is it your contention that I was 
complicit in that?  So if that is your contention then put it 
to me. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 256 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am asking ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Because I really don’t know anything about 
money flows, I don’t know anything about what Essa was 
doing, I had met him at face value, I have indicated to the 
Commission when I met him.   You are telling me what was 
happening in the background, I was not aware of it, but if 
your inference is that maybe somehow I knew about it or I 
was complicit in it put it to me. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Well 
that 
is 
what 
we 
are 
investigating here Mr Gama but I start by asking you to 
10 
comment as you have and what you have said is that you 
were unaware of all of this.  Do I understand correctly? 
MR GAMA:   Absolutely, I was not aware. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you moving away from this memo? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes I am DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This memo Mr Gama at page 519 why 
would you remember that you didn’t read it but you glossed 
over it, what about this about four and a half years ago 
what would make you remember that you glossed over it, 
20 
you didn’t read it? 
MR GAMA:   No, no Chair semantics in English. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well English is not my first language 
either. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, this is my third languages. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 257 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t know about Mr Myburgh, but 
...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:  [speaking in vernacular] so sometimes you go 
through these documents, you skim through them, you 
absorb it at the time but if you ask somebody line by line 
and say this document that you read to – even if you asked 
me two or three weeks ago and you say look here is a five 
page document, I think it’s five, it is six pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, six pages. 
MR GAMA:   So we have this six page document and then 
10 
you say to me as Mr Myburgh does let’s go to this 
particular line, even if you ask me after you read it and we 
sent it to the committee to deliberate and then you say to 
me you know what there is J I Affeat is a director of that 
company, I am just looking at something, I would say look 
give me the document, let’s look at it, because I am – if 
you’re not familiar with you know the names and the people 
you might not remember all of that, so if you remember, I 
remembered all of the gist of it, and normally these 
documents when you sit and you discuss this,  you have 
20 
somebody who sits across from you, you’ve got the 
document, they have got a copy.    You go through it and 
say okay what is going on here and they say okay there’s 
an annexure, they say can I see the annexure, you read it 
you say okay everything on the face of it looks okay and it 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 258 of 343 
 
means that we can do all of the things that we want to do 
here, and really that’s what happens there, but you can’t 
have a 3 000 word document where you then say you would 
remember line by line every line that was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, I am not suggesting that you 
should, you see ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Because we wouldn’t send a document to the 
committee if we had not checked and seen that the things 
that we were saying were accurate and all of that, so that 
would have happened, but if you come and ask me six 
10 
years later if I remember everything that was in that 
document as I said to you I did learn that Essa was a 60% 
shareholder in one of the Trillian companies but I cannot 
tell you at what point, I can’t recall at what point did I learn 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the reason why I ask you is that my 
expectation is that when you look at a document that you 
have signed or that – if I look at a document that I signed 
five years ago I know that if I see my signature there I 
would know that I would never put my signature there 
20 
without reading the document.   
MR GAMA:   H’m, h’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so once my signature is there and 
I am satisfied it is my signature then I would know that I 
read it. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 259 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:   Ja, no we would have gone through the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that is – so but what was 
interesting for me is that you were saying you glossed over 
it so as opposed to ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:  No, no, not that meaning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not that meaning? 
MR GAMA:   Not saying I just glossed over it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you read it? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, no, no we skimmed through it and we 
10 
discussed it, we may not have discussed each and every 
aspect of it but we discussed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there is having a look at it and not 
reading the  whole document, reading certain parts and 
letting somebody tell you what it says, which is one thing.  
There is reading the whole document even if you discuss it 
with somebody.   So is the position that you did read the 
whole document? 
MR GAMA:   No, no I read the document ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Myburgh? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then Mr Gama perhaps I just want to 
put to you how come it never, the shareholding in Trillian 
didn’t jump out at you in the light of the fact that just four 
months before you had met Mr Essa in Dubai?  
MR GAMA:   What didn’t jump out? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 260 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The shareholding in Trillian and Mr 
Essa’s involvement. 
MR GAMA:   Why would it jump out per se, are you saying 
he wasn’t entitled to be a shareholder in the entity? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am saying in the light of the 
discussion you had in Dubai. 
MR GAMA:   I don’t understand the question really. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now we are talking about the 
cession here of this contract from Regiments to Trillian, 
you will recall that in 2015 the so-called GBF contract was 
10 
originally awarded to McKinsey and Regiments, do you 
remember that? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I think it was Regiments ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, I just want to put to you the 
money flows investigation has revealed that Mr Essa got 50 
cents in ever Rand that Regiments charged on the GBF 
contract? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I don’t know that ja, you are telling me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I want to now move to another 
substantive topic, you will remember where we ended off 
20 
last time, I had been questioning you about the ZAR Club 
Loan and there are two transactions relating to the 
financing of the 1064 that I want to deal with, the one was 
the Club Loan, the other is the success fee that was paid 
to Regiments of R189million.  Perhaps I could ask you, and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 261 of 343 
 
maybe the most convenient way to deal with this, the 
easiest way, is for me to ask you to go to the POI bundle 
please, that you find at Bundle 6, BB27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will somebody assist me, or is it a file 
that he already has? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We will get someone to help you, we 
will put that file away for you. 
MR GAMA:   Page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I will be with you in a moment.  I 
think Mr Gama has it, right.  Could you please go to page 
10 
389. 
CHAIRPERSON:   389? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   389 Chairperson yes.  I am just 
going to take you through paragraphs 2.6.1 to 2.6.4 and 
then also paragraph 2.6.6 and perhaps you can have open, 
I think you do at the same time Mr Gama, Bundle 7, Exhibit 
BB28, a collection of documents relevant to this topic you 
find at page 250.380 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last page you mentioned was 260? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.380 Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the same bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No that’s in ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In another bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In Exhibit BB28, Mr Gama’s exhibit, 
we need to deal with the POI exhibit and Mr Gama’s exhibit 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 262 of 343 
 
together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Gama if I could take you then 
please back to BB27, this is an extract from – or it is the 
MNS report on transaction advisors.   2.6 the second 
addendum to the MSA, it says: 
“On 28 April 2015 Transnet ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Which page are you at? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   2.6 at page 389. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2.6 so the page is 389 and the 
10 
paragraph is 2.6, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Are you there Mr Gama? 
MR GAMA:   I have got 2.6.8, 2.6.9, I don’t have that 2.6. 
UNIDENTIFIED COUNSEL:   Mr Chair it is the black 
number as opposed to the red, Mr Gama must look at the 
black number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   On the left hand side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look at the black numbers in the 
pagination at the top. 
20 
MR GAMA:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not the red ones, thank you. 
MR GAMA:  Sorry, 2.89. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it says there ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Sorry I am struggling. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 263 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will somebody help him. 
MR GAMA:   Is it 389? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 389.  Maybe somebody can assist  
him when there’s a need, it should not be too far away, so 
that when there is need ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, I will organise somebody to 
be more readily on standby Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, at 2.6: 
“On 
28 
April 
Transnet 
Group 
Treasurer, 
Mr 
10 
Ramasabudi, compiled a memorandum which was 
recommended by Mr Singh as well as Mr Gama and 
submitted to ...[indistinct – dropping voice].  The 
memorandum provides the following; 
A request to the BADC to approve the contract 
extension from 99.5million to 265.5million for the 
appointment of Regiments Capital or Transaction 
Advisory Services and support to Transnet on the 
1064 locomotive transaction. 
A summary of the services provided by Regiments 
20 
etcetera 
in 
relation 
to 
securing 
the 
China 
Development 
Bank 
loan 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
USD1.5billion, and a motivation for risk sharing 
basis payment of R166million excluding VAT to 
Regiments on the basis that the services provided 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 264 of 343 
 
by Regiments for a period of more than 12 months 
were at risk.” 
Now perhaps you could just keep that open, and let me ask 
you please to turn to that memorandum which you find at 
page 250.383. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that page and the 
bundle?  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, 250, so now we are in Mr 
Gama’s exhibits, DCJ you want us to read the report and 
the exhibit together. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama’s exhibit 250.383. 
CHAIRPERSON:   283?  2.283. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.383. 
CHAIRPERSON:   383? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there you find the memorandum 
which you signed and recommended on the 28 t h of April 
2015, that you see Mr Gama at page 391.  Can I then take 
20 
you to the beginning of the memorandum at 383, subject, 
request to appoint JP Morgan and Regiments Capital to 
conclude on the China Development Bank loan, and then it 
sets out the purpose of this submission is to request 
acquisitions and disposal committee to, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 265 of 343 
 
1. Approve the confinement appointment to JP Morgan to 
hedge the financial risk [interest rate, credit and 
currency risk] emanating from the US Dollar 1.5billion 
China Development Bank CDB loan bank into ZAR; 
2. Approve the confined appointment of JP Morgan to 
lead and underwrite the equivalent syndicate ZAR 
loan of 1.5billion dollars. 
3. Approve the contract extension from 99.5million to 
265.5million for the appointment of Regiments Capital 
for transaction advisory services and support to 
10 
Transnet on the 1064 locomotive transaction, and 
4. Delegate authority to the Acting GCE to approve all 
documentation relating to the confinement. 
Now if I could take you please to page 387.   Now we’re 
dealing with the Regiments Capital part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 250.387? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   250.387, paragraph 62. 
“Transnet appointed Regiments Capital ....” 
And now we’re talking about an issue. 
“...as 
the 
transaction 
advisors 
on 
the 
1064 
20 
locomotive 
transaction. 
 
In 
terms 
of 
the 
aforementioned mandate Regiments Capital was 
required to advise on deal structuring, financing 
and funding options to minimise risk for Transnet.” 
As at 64: 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 266 of 343 
 
“Regiments had been working together with the risk 
management/middle office of Transnet Treasury for 
over the last 12 months to achieve outcome below.” 
Page 69: 
“Regiments has assisted Transnet in negotiating 
with a number of potential Chinese sources of the 
ZAR funding for the ZAR syndicate loan facility 
including etcetera.” 
And then at 73, of direct relevance, and that is at 250.388: 
“The financial advice and negotiation support that 
10 
Regiments provided through this entire process 
which took in excess of 12 months was done at risk 
with 
an 
expectation 
of 
compensation 
only 
on 
successful completion of the transaction.” 
And then at 75: 
“Given the invaluable contribution Regiments to the 
successful conclusion of the transaction Regiments 
success based fee will not exceed 15 basis points.” 
And then the schedule reflects that that amounts to 
R166million, do you see that?   
20 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then in a similar vein if you go 
to page 250.390 at paragraph 97 contribution of Regiments 
to the successful conclusion of the funding transaction.  
Regiments is due a success or risk based fee of 50 basis 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 267 of 343 
 
points on yield payable by Transnet to JP Morgan or portion 
thereof subject to a maximum of 166. 
 
And the recommendation that is just to repeat the 
third bullet: 
Approve the contract extension from 99.5 million to 165.5 
million. So the difference between those two figures is 166 
million 
for 
the 
appointment 
of 
Regiments 
Capital 
for 
transaction advisory services and support to Transnet. 
 
That you signed on the 28t h of April 2015, do you see 
that? 
10 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now when this memo talks about the 
appointment of Regiments and the work that it was initially 
required to do can I just direct your attention please to an 
earlier document signed on the 4t h of February 2014 and that 
you find at page 250.380. 
 
And this is the third addendum for advisory services 
relating to the acquisition of the locomotive tender and you 
will see that it is between McKinsey and Transnet and if you 
have a look at 382 it was signed by Eric Wood title Executive 
20 
Director Regiments Capital.  And then it was signed by Mr 
Singh on behalf of Transnet it seems on the 4t h of February 
2014.   
 
If I could direct your attention to paragraph 3.1 at 
page 250.380 the deliverables for the revised scope of work 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 268 of 343 
 
as per clause 2 derived and agreed upon by Regiments 
Capital for executing the funding portion of the tender 
agreement – it is out of code – the objective of this work 
specific project is to conduct all the necessary studies and 
preparatory work to enhance Transnet’s ability to raise the 
required funding at a competitive interest rate and to achieve 
an optimal funding structure with minimal pressure – sorry – 
on Transnet’s funding liquidity. 
 
And then you will see there is a whole lot of numbers 
where the deliverables are set out for example at 250.381 
10 
seven a value – evaluating all potential funding sources and 
mechanisms and then in relation to the variation of the 
contract price you see at 4.2 that the work performed for this 
deliverable will be fixed at a price of R15 million. 
 
That is the third addendum which was on the 4 t h of 
February 2014.  Then we get the memo that you signed 
which we have dealt with at 383 and then I want to take you 
to the next document please. 
 
That you find at page 392 the recommendation that 
you made and your colleagues made to BADAC was then 
20 
accepted on the 29 t h of April this you find at 240.392.   
 
You will see that at 393 it was resolved and then the 
wording is the same as your recommendation.  And then the 
next document I want to take you to… 
ADV OLDWAGE:  Sorry Mr Chair I have attempted to follow 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 269 of 343 
 
and I am sure Mr Gama is not following because he has 
referred to a document of which it appears Mr Myburgh’s 
putting to him that it was approved by him.  It was reference 
to page 392 that is simply not correct.  That is a letter 
addressed to Whom it may concern appears to have been 
produced under the hand of one Buchle Ndlovo.  So I think 
we need to go back so we can get (talking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry may I just retrace my steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What I meant to say and I hope I 
certainly intended to is that Mr Gama and his colleagues 
made a recommendation to BADAC.  Mr Gama signed that on 
the 28t h of April 2015.  What you find at 2… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was the memorandum. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  What you find at 250.392 is a 
certified extract from the minutes of the BADAC meeting that 
was held the next day on the 29t h of April.  If you go to 
250.393 it is resolved that the committee approved the 
following and of importance is the second bullet point the 
20 
contract extension for the appointment of Regiments Capital 
for transaction advisory services and support to the company 
on the 1064 locomotive transaction from 99.5 million to 265 
million. 
 
So what was recommended by Mr Gama was then 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 270 of 343 
 
approved by the BADAC.  That is 29 April.  If I can then take 
you please to the document you find at page 250.394 this is 
a memorandum to you from Mr Singh dated the 19t h of May 
and what we see if you could go please to page 250.398 Mr 
Singh a series of people who signed this memorandum in 
May Mr Weir on the 18t h of May 2015, Mr Peter on the 18t h of 
May 2015.  I think Mr Singh on the 19t h of May 2015, you 
signed some two months later on the 16t h of July 2015.  Will 
you accept that? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if you go to page 394 paragraph 1. 
“The purpose of this submission is to request 
the acting Group Chief Executive to approve 
the contract addendum to Regiments Capital 
for 
transaction 
advisory 
and 
support 
services.” 
So 
this 
flowed 
from 
your 
recommendation 
and 
the 
acceptance by the BADAC.  So the purpose of this 
submission to request the acting Chief Executive to approve 
the contract addendum to Regiments Capital for transaction 
20 
advisory and support services on the 1064 locomotive 
transaction. 
 
If you go to page 250.395 you will see there is a 
discussion. 
 
Submission 
was 
made 
to 
the 
Transnet 
Acquisition and Disposal Committee detailing the services 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 271 of 343 
 
rendered by Regiments Capital and the successful outcome. 
7. The submission included the request for approval to 
extend the contract value. 
8. The submission was approved in its entirety by the ADC.  
That we have gone through. 
 
And what you will see then at the end of this 
document at 398 under the heading Recommendation it is 
recommended that the acting GCE approves the following: 
1. The value of the contract be increased to a capped 
amount to R265.5 million and  
10 
2. The amounts for the contract period to accommodate 
the successful conclusion of the funding and hedging 
agreements with CBD that is China Development Bank 
and JP Morgan in order to affect the remuneration 
(success) or risk based fee to Regiments Capital. 
Now what I just want to point out to you is that it seems 
that before you signed this – this memorandum which 
recommended and the purpose was to request you to 
approve a contract addendum. 
Before you signed that on the 16 t h of July 2015 Mr 
20 
Singh on the face of it authorised the payment on the 11 t h of 
June 2015.  Perhaps I could take you to page 250.399.  You 
will see that at 250.400 there is an invoice from Regiments 
in the amount of R189 – or it is R166 plus VAT gets you to 
R189 and that amount there is a payment advice affecting 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 272 of 343 
 
payment on the 11t h of June at page 399, do you see that? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you confirm that that is before you 
signed the memorandum at page 250.398? 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then what came after that was the 
second addendum.  In other words that was the contract that 
you were asked to approve and put in place and that second 
addendum you find at page 250.306.  250.306.  And if I could 
just take you to the end page of that at 250.309 you will see 
10 
– or I would ask you to confirm please Mr Gama that you 
then signed this on the 16t h of July 2015.  It was signed by 
you and it was signed by Mr Wood. 
MR GAMA:  That is my signature. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You confirm that? 
MR GAMA:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what this stirred is it – it put in 
place the contractual variation, correct and it provided for 
the payment formalised payment of the 166 success fee.  
You can go through it if you would like. 
20 
MR GAMA:  Ja you moving pretty quickly and the words are 
very small. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja absolutely.  It is – let us go through 
it if you would like to more slowly.  The preamble I think 
gives you a sense of what it is.   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 273 of 343 
 
1.1 
Regiments 
Capital 
and 
Transnet 
signed 
the 
first 
addendum – parties now wish to further varying the 
MSA.  The normal sort of introduction. 
If you go to variation of conditions at paragraph 3 at page 
250.307 it is incorporating the recommendation that you had 
made.  It is incorporating the decision that was made by the 
BDS – the BDSA.   
You will see that at 311 the scope of the work shall be 
amended to include the following deliverables.  Technical 
support development of a detailed funding plan.  
10 
Next bullet point. 
Assist Transnet in the negotiations. 
Assist Transnet in negotiating with a number of potential 
Chinese sources. 
So we are amending the scope of the work.  Recommending 
advice 
and 
assistance 
post 
successful 
conclusion 
of 
negotiations and then it goes on at 313 to provide for the 
success fee of 166 million. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You see that? 
20 
MR GAMA:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And we know that you sign this you 
concluded this contractual variation on the 16t h of July by 
which time Mr Singh on the face of it has already paid 
Regiments. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 274 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what I just wanted to ask you is a 
few questions in relation to this.  Firstly was it not irregular 
to have allowed Regiments to work on this project without a 
contract being in place?  The contract came afterwards once 
the work was completed. 
MR GAMA:  From – on the face of it they are saying they 
had allowed it – they had allowed them to work on it for the 
previous twelve months.  I was still fairly new in the group 
office here and I think it is one of them it says April 2015 I 
10 
think I arrived there around the 20t h of April 2015 but so 
when you get there and people say these people have been 
working here for the past twelve months you say okay and 
that is what you get told but appropriately I think everybody 
would want to put the horse before the cart and have the 
contract in place beforehand.   
So that was that but by going to the acquisition 
committee 
and 
informing 
them 
that 
this 
is 
what 
has 
happened it also regular – regularises that but it is a 
retrospective approval.  It is being approved after the fact 
20 
when the actual work has been done. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You see Mr Gama perhaps I could also 
just get your view on this.  What we have seen is that 
Regiments were initially appointment simply to be advisors – 
the amount that they stood to be remunerated was 50 million 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 275 of 343 
 
what we have seen from the documents we have gone 
through is they went from being purely advisors to people 
that actually did the deal – they were deal makers – they 
executed this deal.   
MR GAMA:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you say you were comfortable with 
that being regularised ex post facto? 
MR GAMA:  Well that is – that is what the people who were 
dealing with it said they have done and you have seen a very 
detailed memo that went to the BADAC that were reading 
10 
just earlier on that had 99 paragraphs if I am not mistaken. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja absolutely.  Let me just take you to 
the – to paragraph 73. 
MR GAMA:  Ja would you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And the one you have mentioned. 
MR GAMA:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you turn up page 1044 you have 
got… 
MR GAMA:  Page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1- I beg your pardon.  250.388.  You 
20 
quite correctly pointed out that they were at risk – they were 
allowed to work there without a contract for twelve months 
doing something different to what they were contracted to do 
and it records that they did so at risk at paragraph 73 at 
page 250.388. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 276 of 343 
 
 
So if – do I understand correctly that what that meant 
is that if you wanted to you did not have to pay them 
anything? 
MR GAMA:  Well if you read the whole thing it says there 
was an expectation of compensation only on successful 
completion of the transaction. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes but at risk. 
MR GAMA:  So – so they worked at risk for twelve months 
with an expectation of compensation only on successful 
completion of the transaction.  So I guess at this point they 
10 
have 
now 
successfully 
concluded 
the 
transaction 
and 
therefore that is why there is then the motivation for the 
actual payment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But could you find any trace of a 
procurement event.  I mean this is a different contract.  So 
they start off at advising you as pure advisors 50 million.  
They land up executing a deal getting paid a success fee of 
166 can you find any trace of a procurement event in relation 
to the 166? 
MR GAMA:  I do not know if you call it a procurement event 
20 
but if you go to the memorandum that I signed on the 16 t h of 
July. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  You… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is that at 394 – 250.394? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 277 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:  At page 250.394. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  Correct.  If you go to point number 5.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Point number 5 in – on the memo? 
MR GAMA:  Yes 250.394. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR GAMA:  Maybe to provide context we start at 3 but we – 
I am not going to go through all of it.  It just says upon 
phase 2 of the engagement being reached it was decided by 
McKinsey and agreed by Transnet that McKinsey would cede 
10 
the role.  So the – that is how Regiments come – comes into 
being to start structuring the financial arrangements.  So it 
was initially McKinsey and then it was ceded.  That is point 
number 3. 
 
Point number 4 then says subsequent to the cession 
agreement the contract period was extended by twelve 
months.   
 
So in whatever way that it would have been done I 
was not there so I do not – I do not really know how it was 
done but that is what they say.   
20 
 
And then in point number 5 Mr Myburgh  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  It is indicated that Regiments indicated to 
Transnet 
they 
preferred 
operating 
model 
for 
such 
engagements is usually based on a risk sharing model for a 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 278 of 343 
 
success fee.   
 
And then that number 5 the next line says:  A 
submission was approved by the GCE on 17t h of April in 
support of changing the remuneration model.  The agreement 
was then amended by value to reflect a change in the 
remuneration model as proposed by Regiments.  And it says 
refer to Annexure C.  It will be instructive if we – if we went 
to Annexure C – is it there? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright well that we have dealt with Mr 
Molefe.  Is it for your.. 
10 
MR GAMA:   Is that.. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is it before your time. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can I ask you this. 
MR GAMA:  So I am saying that all of these things that 
appear to have been done were approved by the time I 
arrived there so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Oh can I just ask you one other 
question and your comment?   I mean did Regiments not now 
have a conflict of interest because we have seen that they 
20 
were appointed as pure advisors to advise presumably 
independently on models and options.  And then what they 
landed up doing was actually executing. 
MR GAMA:  Mr Myburgh I am not qualified – you have made 
me read too many documents already in this 00:22:02 I am – 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 279 of 343 
 
I am a bit confused now.  So if you say they were appointed 
only to be advisory I have seen another document which is a 
cession document that says they will now do deal structuring 
so I do not know in terms of the financial people in terms of 
what their thoughts were and what the discussions were in 
relation to this.  So I am not – I am slightly underqualified 
Chair to comment on it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So have you got any sense as 
to whether or not the fee that was paid to Regiments was 
excessive?  Are you able comment on that? 
10 
MR GAMA:  I am not able to comment on that either.  What – 
what they say in that long memo is they try and give  formula 
that was used so they say 10 BBS – 15 BBS – 20 BBS and 
then here under 75.  They say even the – the successful 
conclusion of this transaction the fee will not exceed 15 
basis points on the yield as reflected in the NPV calculations 
so that – that in itself is probably a manner I know in which 
they deal with these kinds of things  but I do not know if this 
is the norm whether this is lower than the usual or whether it 
is higher I – I am under qualified to give an opinion. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Well I will not tax you on that 
because some evidence has been led that the market 
convention and Transnet practice will lead arrangement fee 
was 6 basis points.   
MR GAMA:  I do not know. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 280 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR GAMA:  I would not be able to. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You speak about – you made reference 
to Mr Mohammedy.  Perhaps I could just take you to his 
affidavit.  Could you please go to BB3 and can you turn up 
page 18.  I just want to ask your comment on this.  
Paragraph 5.5.9 and Mr Gama I do appreciate that you have 
come in at the tail end of this.  Page 18 paragraph 5.5.9.  
The Transnet Treasury team says Mr Mohammedy had 
sufficient experience to enter into loan transactions without 
10 
the need for external support.  In my view there was no need 
for the abovementioned arrangement fees to be incurred. 
 
Do you have any comment about that?  What was 
your sense and experience of the Transnet Treasury? 
MR GAMA:  I would not able to comment.  I think people who 
were in proximity to the treasury team would be the people in 
finance but in terms of reputation as I understood it is that 
Transnet also had one of the finest treasury teams in the 
country in terms of reputation.  So that I know but I would 
not be able to tell you okay what does that mean – what is it 
20 
that they can do and what is it that they outsource. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You see it really was – was to that that 
Mr Mohammedy spoke and ultimately what he concluded on 
this CBD loan he said it did not make any commercial sense 
and he reflected that and I quote 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 281 of 343 
 
“The only possible plausible explanation from 
my perspective would be that there was an 
agenda for payment to be made to Regiments 
ultimately 
for 
some 
entity 
that 
existed 
outside of the system.” 
 
That was his evidence.  Did he cannot... 
MR GAMA:  Which – where are you reading from? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am reading from page 144 of the 
transcript of day 30 of day 93.  This was his evidence.  
Perhaps I can read it again. 
10 
“The only possible… 
MR GAMA:  Oh it is something that is in front of you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  Oh okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So just bear with me for a moment. 
“The only possible plausible explanation from 
my perspective would be that there was an 
agenda for payment to be made to Regiments 
ultimately 
for 
some 
entity 
that 
existed 
outside of the system.” 
20 
 
But you – you confirm that the Transnet Treasury was 
well-equipped and was competent. 
MR GAMA:  Well I am – that is the reputation that Transnet 
Treasury had was that it was amongst the finest but I would 
not be able to tell you what they could or could not do. But a 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 282 of 343 
 
person of Mohammedy’s stature would have been aware 
what it is that they can do because he had acted as a CFO 
from time to time.  So he would know and I think he had 
enough time preparing for this to have a look at some of 
those things but the unfortunate thing about all of this is that 
we were trying to operate on a patient when something has 
already gone wrong.  And he is now using hindsight.  It 
would be good if he was there and he says let us not have 
these types of transaction advisors. But he did not say that 
when it was happening.  And some of us would – would not 
10 
have been the wiser whether or not it was appropriate or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your evidence that based on your 
own understanding and knowledge of the skills experience 
and expertise that the treasury team at Transnet, you would 
not be able to say what – how far they could go in dealing 
with different transaction but based on what you used to 
hear or read about them, your understanding is that they 
were one of the best ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Treasury teams in government. 
20 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Just to add to that, 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 283 of 343 
 
Mr Gama.  If you go over the page, page 19, paragraph 
5.5.11.  Mr Mohamedi says: 
“My opinion is supported by the then Transnet 
Group Treasurer, Ms Makgatho, who wrote an 
email on 21 August 2014 to Mr Molefe and 
Mr Singh, pointing out the risks of aligning 
external party to negotiate significant new loan 
agreement in isolation of the implications it 
may have had on our existing debt. 
Ms Makgatho further pointed out that in her 
10 
view the pricing of the loan was out of – 
especially due to the fact that it carried 
security of leans over the locomotive... 
At the time, she estimated the excess cost of 
the debt to amount to R 3.8 billion over the 
term of the loan...” 
 
And then the email is attached.  Do you want to 
comment?  I mean, did you during your tenure as the GC or 
acting DG, did you interact with Ms Makgatho? 
MR GAMA:   No, I knew Ms Makgatho when I was the CE of 
20 
TRF.  By the time that I became the acting DGC it was 
Ramasebudi that was the Treasurer. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR GAMA:   So my interface with Ms Makgatho was as CO 
of TRF.  I never interfaced with her as the acting GC.   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 284 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But just going back to the concerns 
that Mr Mohamedi expressed in his evidence that he 
thought that there needed to be – it is probably some kind 
of ulterior motive.  I have put to you earlier in your 
evidence what the Money-flows Investigations has revealed 
in relation to this payment of R 189 million and you 
remember I put to you that their investigation has revealed 
that R 147 million of that, 78% was paid to Albertine with a 
R 122 million then having been laundered onto Sahara 
Computers. 
10 
MR GAMA:   Yes, that is – I think – ja ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You recall that? 
MR GAMA:   [Indistinct] [Speaker not clear]  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the memorandum, I think we 
looked at a little earlier, which – I cannot remember 
whether 
that 
was 
appointing 
or 
ceding 
rights 
from 
Regiments to Trillian.  But I would have thought that where 
you 
were 
asked 
by 
people 
under 
you 
to 
sign 
a 
memorandum recommending the appointment of outside 
advisors, you would first want to know:  Why do we need 
20 
them?  Do we not have this expertise internally?  Is that 
something 
you 
may 
have 
raised 
with 
people 
within 
Treasury? 
MR GAMA:   No, Chair.  You know, at the beginning of time 
and people in Transnet will tell you, I do not like 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 285 of 343 
 
consultants.  If we can do things without consultants 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR GAMA:   ...that is what we do.  In fact, when I left 
Transnet, I had set out something that I call Internal 
Consultants.  People who actually work for Transnet and 
who can go around, using their expertise, troubleshooting 
in a different entity.  In this instance, you get told that the 
people have been here for 12-months.  They have been 
working.  So you have to assume that they are relevant 
10 
because why would you keep them for 12-months.  But also 
there is something that we are doing here that we need to 
clean up a bit.   
 
There is an interchange of words.  So you would 
talk about Regiments advisory.  It is a different entity from 
Regiments Capital Partner.  We talked about Transnet – I 
mean, what is that – Trillian Asset Management.  It is a 
different entity to – but I think everybody gets wiser 
afterwards to then say:  Okay it is not the same entity as – 
there is a number of these entities.  So advisory is the one 
20 
that was doing GFB, as I understood it, that was advisory.   
 
But 
the 
one 
that 
is 
structuring 
is 
Capital 
Partners or whatever the name that is reflected here.  So it 
is different entities.  So we must not make the mistake of 
thinking the advisors have now been appointed as skill(?) 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 286 of 343 
 
structuring.  It does not appear to me that that is what was 
the case but it is different entities. 
 
But I think when Mr Singh is here you might – he 
might be much more clearer than me in terms of these 
distinctions between these entities but I can just see it that 
sometimes we conflate Regiments Advisory from Regiments 
Capital Partners. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, perhaps I could just point out 
one thing to you.  If you have a look at page 380, the third 
10 
addendum where Regiments is appointed as an advisor. 
MR GAMA:   380 of the previous file? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, 250.380.  There you will see that 
it is Regiments Capital (Pty) Ltd that we are talking about.   
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At 382 ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   It is not in the other bundle?  380 
...[intervenes]  
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
250.380. 
 
So 
the 
original 
appointment ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Myburgh.  I think – is that in 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 7. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 287 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 250.  Point? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   380. 
CHAIRPERSON:   387 or 380? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   380. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You will see that the original 
variation, if you have a look at paragraph 3.1, relates to 
Regiments Capital. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you will see at 382, it is signed 
10 
then by Eric Wood, Regiments Capital. 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The agreement that you entered into 
to regularise the variation of the contract is at 306 and it is 
also between Transnet and Regiments Capital.  Do you see 
that, at 306? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, Regiments Capital.  So that is like for 
like.  So this is the entity that is dealing with the financial 
structuring.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I ask you?  Were you surprised 
20 
that mister – now that you see – or did you know that 
Mr Singh had paid Regiments before you signed the 
memorandum? 
MR GAMA:   No, no, no.  I just saw it now.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that of any concern to you? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 288 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:   It is concerning.  There is one of two things.  
The first memo, the long one, it was to go to the board to 
get approval.  So the board approved it but in the approval 
of it, the delegation was to the GCE in terms of authorising 
payment.  So the signing of it before the GCE approves it 
is irregular.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you think of any reason what 
would have motivated him to do that? 
MR GAMA:   No, no.  You will have to ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would not know of any 
10 
circumstances that would justify that, would you? 
MR GAMA:   No.  It was not told to me.  There is no way 
where he says:  Look, sign this but I have already paid.  
There is nowhere where he says that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I would like to then move to a 
different topic and that is the procurement of the 95 
locomotives.  Just give me a second, please. 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle are we going to go to? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to deal with the two 
20 
files together but if I could ask you, Chairperson, to go to 
the POI Bundle, Bundle 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have just a few questions for you in 
relation to the 95 locomotives.  I take it you will recall, and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 289 of 343 
 
this is dealt with in the Fundudzi Report commencing at 
page 36, Chairperson of Bundle 6.  I certainly do not 
intend to take you through all of that Mr Gama.  I just want 
to ask you one or two questions, if I may? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I take it you will recall that in 2012, 
CSR was appointed as the preferred bidder for the supply 
of the 95 locomotives.  Is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I do not know the dates but if you say it is 
2012, you can maybe just refer me where you are reading. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  We can go through all of 
this. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And do you remember what the costs 
were, the costs of those 95 locomotives were? 
MR GAMA:   No, no.  [laughs] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you go to page 93 just to get to 
the date.  Page 93 at paragraph – and you know these 
paragraph numbers are very long.  [laughs]  5.5.18.44.  
According to a letter dated 5 September from Molefe to 
20 
Pam(?): 
“Transnet notified CSR of its appointment as 
the preferred bidder. 
In a letter, CSR was requested to sign the 
agreement by no later than the close of 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 290 of 343 
 
business on 6 September 2012...” 
 
Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   Okay.  So that was the date, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I just wanted to ask you, 
please, to turn to page 39.  And, of course, like so many of 
these things, we start off with presentations being made to 
the BADC.  You see there is a heading at top of 39, BADC 
of 3 August 2011.  I just wanted you to confirm that in 2011 
Mr Sharma, if you can recall ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...listed here, was a member of the 
BADC and a Director of Transnet. 
MR GAMA:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The evidence before the Commission 
is that he was then appointed as the Chairperson of the 
BADC in the following year, in August 2012.  Does that 
record with your recollection? 
MR GAMA:   I would not know the dates but he did become 
the Chair of BADC. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In 2011, it reflects that Mr Mkwanazi 
20 
– or do you know who the Chairperson of the BADC was in 
2011? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who was it? 
MR GAMA:   It was the late Bongani Don Mkhwanazi. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 291 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Don ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is my understand correct that his 
surname was spelt with an H as opposed to the one 
...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mkwanazi is spelt without an H. 
MR GAMA:   That is correct, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So the spelling at page 39 would 
not be correct? 
MR GAMA:   That is ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without the H? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, it must have the H. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you involved in the negotiation 
of the 95 locomotives? 
MR GAMA:   No, that I can remember. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think that I have put to you that the 
Money-flow’s 
investigations 
reveals 
that 
CSR 
and 
Regiments Asia, represented by Mr Essa, entered into the 
BADC in respect of this acquisition with Regiments Asia 
20 
being due a 20% commission or kickback and their 
investigation 
has 
also 
revealed 
that 
some 
17 million 
Dollars have to date been paid by CSR in respect of this 
acquisition. 
MR GAMA:   No, I am not aware of it. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 292 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So we are going to come back to 
this, I suppose, in more detail when we deal with the 1064 
but Mr Gama with your experience, there is something that 
the Commission needs to consider and investigate is.  How 
if negotiations are done bona fide, how is it possible that 
there is enough in the pot to fund the 20% or 21% 
commission on acquisitions of this size?  And these 95 
locomotives, the contract price was some R 2.5 billion.  Do 
you want to comment?  Perhaps you can share with us your 
insights into that. 
10 
MR GAMA:   No, I would not be able to comment on that.  I 
am not familiar with that but from what I understand from 
some of the extracts, the margins on some of these 
locomotives, they are no more than about 4% that are 
made by the OEM’s as a global standard.  And the CSR 
that you talk about is among the cheapest locomotive 
manufacturers.  So I do not know how possible it is that 
you could then say there are money-flows of that nature 
from these contracts.  I mean, I do not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, none(?) of the negotiators are 
20 
doing their job properly.   
MR GAMA:   No, what I am saying is that from the 
negotiations and from comparisons that I have seen, they 
have been among the cheapest of the locomotives.  It 
might just mean that maybe the costs could even be lower 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 293 of 343 
 
but I think when people are confronting the issue, they will 
see that there is not anyone who has charged us lower 
than them in terms of locomotives.  So to then say that 
there 
are 
also 
commissions 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
the 
magnitude that you indicate, it baffles my mind.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  The last thing I just want to 
deal with briefly is.  The BEE requirement was waived in 
phase 1 in this tender evaluation process.  Are you aware 
of that? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I take you, please, to page 81? 
MR GAMA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I could ask you to go to paragraph 
5.5.16.26.  I have just one or two paragraphs to take you 
through here.   
“In their recommendation to Molefe, Gama and 
Jiyane recommended option 2 on the basis 
that option 1 would mean that foreign members 
did 
not 
have 
local 
representation 
with 
prejudice to the score zero on BBBEE...” 
20 
 
And says: 
“They further indicated that option 1 did not 
support the BBBEE Code of Good Practice 
Clause 
which 
allows 
for 
such 
foreign 
companies who had registered locally and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 294 of 343 
 
start-up enterprises to be deemed to have 
BBBEE 
contribute 
status 
of 
Level 
4, 
contributing in the first year of operation...” 
 
And then in the next sub-paragraph says: 
“The notion that foreign companies were 
prejudiced cannot be substantiated in that 
Alexco, a South African company, scored 
zero points on BBBEE. 
We determined that recommendations by 
Gama and Jiyane to Molefe to amend the 
10 
evaluation criteria to exclude BBBEE, the 
request 
was 
approved 
by 
Molefe 
on 
8 
June...” 
 
The next sub-paragraph: 
“We determined that after the conditions were 
change to remove the BBBEE requirement, 
CSR scored overall 69% above the minimum 
threshold of 60%...” 
 
And then, perhaps I could just ask you to 
comment on paragraph 5.5.16.30. 
20 
“Based 
on 
the 
reasons 
advanced 
for 
the 
decision to exclude BBBEE conditions from 
stage 
1 
process 
as 
reflected 
above, 
we 
determined that CSR was the only foreign 
entity that benefited from the said decision...” 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 295 of 343 
 
 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR GAMA:   Chair, I think the problem with some of these 
reports by people such as Fundudzi is that they are 
misleading and they will misrepresent the meaning of 
things because I think they do not understand it, some of 
these processes and then they will reach conclusions that 
are very wild.  The fact of the matter is, it is a very simple 
one and it affected all the tenderers.   
 
To evaluate BEE at stage 1 or stage 3, if you do 
it for 
all 
of the 
entities, 
it means 
nothing. 
 
It is 
10 
meaningless.  There is no change.  It does not change the 
price of that.  But here you get the times(?) of tick box 
auditors.   
 
Even that – auditing one-o-one, you do not even 
just tick box, who will then come here and give this 
Commission an impression that something went wrong by 
agreeing not to evaluate at level 1 but have evaluated level 
3.  All of the entities were evaluated at the same time.  All 
that happened here is.   
 
They said when we were out on tender we 
20 
assumed that every entity that is going to tender already 
has a BBBEE certificate but we were wrong because we 
have foreign entities who are in the process of creating 
their South African entities.  So can you allow us not to 
evaluate any of the entities?   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 296 of 343 
 
 
And then they used the example of the foreign 
entities and they said these two, for instance, would be 
affected by this.  It meant that they would drop off but we 
will still evaluate BBBEE.  Let us allow them to establish 
their local office.  Let them then go to the – not rating 
agencies, what do they call it?   
 
The BEE agencies that give people a certificate 
which tells them whether they are 100% compliant or they 
are at 50% or they are...  Let us then allow them to do this.  
We will then, at stage 3, evaluate all of the entities for 
10 
their BBBEE credentials.  So that is what happened here.  
Nobody lost any hair or anything as a result of asking for 
that.   
 
But also in addition to that, the delegated 
authority which was the JSE could consider this and decide 
on whether it makes sense, but not only that.  You then 
also go further and you inform the board that in terms of 
the criteria this is what we said we would do.  We did not 
do this at level, we did it at level 3 because of this.  There 
is not anything sinister or anything that was done.   
20 
 
Each of the entities was evaluated in stage 3.  If 
at stage 3 the entities did not have the necessary BEE 
then they would fall off.  So everybody gets evaluated on a 
similar thing.  There is nowhere where, as a result of not 
evaluating BEE at stage 1, you are advantaging anybody 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 297 of 343 
 
over anyone.  It does not arise. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think the question that I wanted to 
ask you is.  You accept that CSR was the only foreign 
entity that benefited from that decision? 
MR GAMA:   According to this, there was Alexco and CSR.  
I do not know when Alexco came from. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR GAMA:   But – so this something that the cross-
functional team decided(?). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sub-27 says: 
10 
“The 
notion 
that 
foreign 
companies 
were 
prejudiced cannot be substantiated in that 
Alexco, a South African company, scored zero 
points for BBBEE...” 
MR GAMA:   Well, they would score zero points on BBBEE 
if during the timeframe that they have been given they are 
unable to come in and provide the BEE certificate or if 
their BEE certificate comes in and say they are not 
complaint.  So that is all it is.  So their scoring zero points 
is because of them not complying.  It is not because they 
20 
were evaluated as stage 1 or stage 3.  So the issue here of 
which is one is foreign and which one is not is really 
neither here nor there.  All that was happening here was 
the cross-functional team says we did not take into account 
that 
we 
might 
receive 
bids 
from 
non-South 
African 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 298 of 343 
 
companies. 
 
So instead of evaluating BBBEE at stage one, let us 
evaluate everything else except it will be – let us evaluate 
it at stage 3 to give them time.  So if Nelesco, after being 
given time still could not comply with the BBBEE then they 
would be scored zero.  The same with the CSR itself if, 
after being given time, it does not comply with the BBBEE, 
it gets scored zero.  Everybody gets scored on one scale, 
they do not use different ways of scoring these entities. 
 
So for me it is really – we are going to get into an 
10 
argument and have a discussion which is really about 
nothing about nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what was the policy in terms of 
whether BEE should be taken into account at the first 
stage or what was the legal requirement as you understood 
it? 
MR GAMA:   It is not a legal requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was a policy requirement. 
MR GAMA:   It is an evaluation criteria. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it does not come from the policy. 
20 
MR GAMA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where does it come from? 
MR GAMA:   It is an evaluation where you say to 
everybody, as they take the documents, this is how we are 
going to evaluate you and then you come in and then you 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 299 of 343 
 
say here is a bidder.  Through no fault of their own 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, hang on, let us establish the 
rules.  When there was – there were criteria that were set 
from the beginning, is that right? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The criteria included BEE, is that right? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the criteria that were required to be 
implemented, before it was discovered who had BEE, who 
10 
satisfied and who did not satisfy, was the requirement that 
that criterion of BEE should be a factor at stage one? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was the position? 
MR GAMA:   That was the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then what happened was at a 
certain stage that was changed and it was decided that 
BEE as a part of the criteria would be applied at stage 3. 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
20 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that was based on what, on 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
of 
the 
companies 
were 
foreign 
companies? 
MR GAMA:   Yes, so the cross-functional team says here is 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 300 of 343 
 
our RFP.  As Transnet we did not foresee that there could 
be entities – there could be foreign entities who do not 
have a local domicile.  They then say this is the criteria, 
we understand it, they then say we think it will be 
prejudicial for entities who are just coming into the country 
and they such as Nelesco and Seza to evaluate BBBEE at 
stage one, they are still setting up their offices.  We will 
evaluate BBBEE in the same manner that we evaluated, we 
do not change the rating but the PPM, which is the 
Transnet procedures manual, it allows the person who has 
10 
the delegated authority to consider this and say does it 
change the price of eggs?  Will that be anybody who is 
going to be prejudiced as a result of this?  Now we are 
going to evaluate all entities at stage 3, where we are not 
changing the criteria, we are still going to evaluate BBBEE 
but we are not going to evaluate it at – so there are six 
stages of this thing.  So the entity will still fall off it does 
not comply but at Transnet you are allowed to approach the 
delegated authority to say can we move this from stage 1 
to stage 3 and that is what happened here.  So there is 
20 
nothing that changed, the criteria remained the same, all of 
the bidders were evaluated at stage three.  So I am saying 
here, Chair, that we can talk a lot about these things, there 
was no one who was being prejudiced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, I understand, you have made 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 301 of 343 
 
the point, Mr Myburgh will pursue his questions.  On the 
fact of it my immediate reaction would be unless one was 
talking 
about 
a 
situation 
about 
certain 
exceptional 
circumstances, I would have expected that if I am Transnet 
and I say these are the criteria that are going to be used to 
determine who actually gets this contract, the fact that 
somebody says oh, I just registered my company yesterday 
so give me a chance to go and register this or get that 
certificate, is neither here nor there, hard luck.  If 
somebody says I am coming from France or whatever, I did 
10 
not know about what the requirements were in South 
Africa, hard luck.  If you want to do business in South 
Africa, 
you 
want 
to 
get 
contracts 
in 
South 
Africa, 
familiarise yourself with what the requirements in South 
Africa are.  That would be my immediate reaction but it 
may well be that when one looks deeply, it might change. 
MR GAMA:   Ja.  No, here is a group of people who are 
exercising their minds, they are saying for instance, 
perhaps we did not think properly about this thing that 
there could be foreign entities who are not domicile in 
20 
South Africa because there are foreign entities, most of 
these entities …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They must familiarise themselves with 
South African situation and comply. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, when people are coming through for the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 302 of 343 
 
first time you can give them that.  The cross-functional 
team, they thought through this, it is not something that 
they just  - they thought through it, they looked a options 
and then they said okay, we think this is a better option 
and then they then said can we take it to the delegated 
authority to look at it?  And then the delegated authority 
could then agree or disagree but if the delegated authority 
can see that there is no one who is going to be prejudiced 
as a result of evaluating.  We are not saying we will not 
evaluate BEE, we are just saying we will not do it on stage 
10 
one, we will do in stage three and then that is what 
happened but if you would rely on Fundudzi type of 
reports, there is a lot of things that you will find here which 
just says that, you know, you should be a robot, you must 
not apply any logic in terms of dealing with things and then 
that is not the right way to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  I would like to turn 
to the 100 locomotives, if I may? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I just want to present something 
of an overview before I get into Mr Callard’s affidavit and 
your response.  You will recall, Mr Gama, that CSR – now 
we are talking about 100 20E electric locomotives.  You 
will 
recall 
that 
CSR 
was 
awarded 
the 
tender 
on 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 303 of 343 
 
confinement replacing Mitsui.  Do you remember that? 
MR GAMA:   I just want to go back.  Can you just remind 
me where is my… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am going to come to your affidavit. 
MR GAMA:   Ja, can you point me to it? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me take you to the page, if you 
want. 
MR GAMA:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 6, page 140. 
MR GAMA:   Page 140?  It is just useful that we – okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I am just presenting an overview.  
If you go to the middle of the page, 5.6.18 sub 1: 
“As indicated above we determined that the board 
approved a confinement of 100 locomotives to CSR 
on 24 January, estimated cost of 3.8 billion.  We 
determined that Molefe concluded an agreement 
with CSR on 17 March for the supply of 100 
locomotives at a cost of 4.38 billion.” 
Do you see that? 
MR GAMA:   3.8, ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now are you in a position to confirm 
because again the timeline here becomes important.  This 
LSA was concluded on the 17 March 2014 which was the 
same day as the LSAs were concluded in respect of the 
1064 locomotives.  Do you remember that? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 304 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:   Ja, I would not know on what date.  I know 
that the 1064 was on that particular date but I cannot 
remember that there was any other on the same day. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, let me take you to 
page 183.  Now this the section dealing with the 1064 and 
we will come to one of the agreements in time.  I will 
actually show you the one concluded by CNR (sic) but at 
paragraph 5.9.12.2: 
“We determined, however, by that time…” 
And that is dealing with the increase in the ETC. 
10 
“…the locomotive supply had already been signed 
on or about 17 March 2014.” 
So at least on that the 100 locomotive LSA and LSAs in 
respect of the 1064 were concluded around about – either 
on the same day or around about the same.  Do you have a 
recollection of that? 
MR GAMA:   No, no, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   By the way, Mr Gama, you did not 
sign the LSAs.  From what I have seen they were signed by 
Mr Molefe and Mr Singh.  Would that be correct? 
20 
MR GAMA:   What do you refer to as the MSA? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The LSA, the actual locomotive 
supply agreements concluded in relation to the 1064 
locomotives.  I am just simply asking you did not yourself 
sign the agreements. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 305 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:   Ja, ja, that is – so I do not recall what the 
dates were here. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now at this time in March 
2014, Mr Sharma was the Chairperson of the BADC. 
MR GAMA:   It is possible. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And a director of Transnet. 
MR GAMA:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that right? 
MR GAMA:   It is possible, I cannot remember when their 
term expired. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We will come to some documentation 
in due course.   
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then I think I have put this to 
you already.  Mr Essa, representing on the money flows 
investigation, representing Regiments Asia concluded a 
BDSA again with CSR for a 21% kickback.  To date 
payments of 124 million dollars have been made under that 
BDSA 
and 
the 
one 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
359 
electric 
locomotives that were part of the 1064. 
20 
MR GAMA:   Sorry, can you repeat that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Essa, on behalf of Regiments 
Asia, concludes a BDSA with CSR for 21% kickback in 
relation to the 100 locomotives.  To date 24 million dollars 
have been paid under that BDSA and the BDSA that he 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 306 of 343 
 
concluded in relation to the 359 electric locomotives that 
were part of the 1064 contract.  Do you want to comment 
on that? 
MR GAMA:   It sounds like telephone numbers.  The 124 
million? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   124 million dollars. 
MR GAMA:   In respect of the 100 locomotives? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The 100 locomotive and the 359 
electric locomotives. 
MR GAMA:   Oh, a combination? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR GAMA:   No, I do not know anything about that, I am 
hearing it from you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should take some break?  It 
has just gone past quarter to eight.  Let us take a ten 
minutes break. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chair., 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we will continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, could you give us a 
sense of how deep into the night you would like to go so 
20 
we can make our plans and also if I could look and see 
what I can finish sensibly in that time?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us do that.  From your side, how 
much – how far are you from finishing with Mr Gama? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am still some way. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 307 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What I would like to try and achieve 
this evening is to finish at least 100 locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I can go for quite some time.  
From my side we can just go – we can go to nine,  we can 
go beyond nine, I must just check with the staff and 
technicians.  From your side, Mr Gama, you are fine? 
MR GAMA:   I must just check if my team has got the tank 
to go beyond nine o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, alright.  Your counsel is 
10 
fine. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  Mr Chair, we understood that we 
would run until about eight o’clock.  It is now ten to eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  Regrettably, we also have other 
commitments.  Is it possible – because we would like to 
make those arrangements.  I am under pressure with 
papers that have to be filed elsewhere and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  Is it possible that we proceed until 
20 
8.30? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The only difficulty is we need to finish by 
tomorrow with Mr Gama’s evidence.  If the position is that 
we should be able to finish tomorrow then maybe there 
might be no problem but I think one should first have an 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 308 of 343 
 
assessment.  I think Mr Myburgh probably will not finish 
today or it depends – what can you say, Mr Myburgh, 
because when we have an idea when you might finish, 
whether it is tomorrow or after another hour or whatever? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, it is going to be some time, 
Chairperson.  The only comment that I wish to make is – I 
mean, I think that we must obviously finish tomorrow so if 
we are only going to go until half past eight tonight then I 
suppose we must commit ourselves to going on for as late 
as we have to tomorrow night. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because I - you know, I think the 
bottom line is we must finish tomorrow so  - because we 
just do not have the time.  You know, we are close to the 
end of May.  So, I do not know, in the light of that and 
maybe bearing in mind how much time you might need for 
re-examination, if any, after Mr Myburgh, what is your 
assessment? 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  Mr Chair, there is certainly going to 
be a need for re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  There is, of course, a discussion 
that has ensued between Mr Myburgh and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  And in relation to that, it was 
suggested that we consider whether we do not file a further 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 309 of 343 
 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, to combine certain things. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  By Mr Gama that deals with those 
issues.  It is not a matter that we have had a sufficient 
time to consider, it was in fact suggested this afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  But to come back to the conclusion 
of his testimony in chief, if I may term it such, we are also 
available to start earlier tomorrow.  We only started after 
five today but we can do much earlier tomorrow, if that is 
10 
needed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say much earlier, what do you 
have in mind? 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  I have other commitments from 
about six o’clock tomorrow morning but certainly by midday 
I would have dealt with those matters and we can start by 
about 12 o’clock I would imagine, subject to my client’s 
availability. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, of course, tomorrow I have 
got a day session, Inspector General is giving evidence 
tomorrow.  That is meant, I think if I recall correctly, to be 
the whole day but he might finish before four o’clock, so – 
at this stage your sense of how much time your re-
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 310 of 343 
 
examination might need would be what? 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  At least an hour an half, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At least an hour and an half.  Okay, Mr 
Myburgh, can we go at least up to nine today? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But, of course, if we stop at nine 
because from my side we could have gone even up to ten 
as well, then tomorrow it would have to be – the 
arrangement would have to be that one, you are able to be 
here earlier than four o’clock, not on the guarantee that we 
10 
will start earlier but on the understanding that if we finish 
earlier with the day witness then we can start but that we 
would then go on right into the night, to try and finish.  
Would that be fine? 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  As you please, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Myburgh, maybe we could go 
up to nine today and then …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Push through tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and then tomorrow and I think what 
would – when we adjourn this evening we could talk about 
20 
what time everybody could be here tomorrow. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think that, DCJ, it is very important 
to make an accurate assessment of that because if we 
have to come here and kick our hills, it is not the most 
efficient use of time. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 311 of 343 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And perhaps we could be on standby 
and then your registrar might tell us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no, that… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But once you travel here, there is 
very little you can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  No, no, I think that could be 
done particularly if all parties are not too far from here.  
So no, that could be done.  I think by lunchtime we would 
have an idea.  Mr Pretorius will be leading Dr Dintwe, we 
10 
would have an idea and then maybe you could make 
contact with Mr Pretorius. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At lunchtime, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And give an assessment, ja.  And then 
you could share that with counsel for Mr Gama. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  Mr Chair, might I then work on the 
assumption that we are not going to deal with re-
examination 
tomorrow 
given 
the 
submissions 
by 
Mr 
Myburgh and that that will have to be held over to some 
other date alternatively that that be incorporated in a 
20 
further affidavit by my client? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two matters.  One, I would like us to try 
and finish tomorrow.  When I say finish, I mean finish all 
oral evidence including re-examination if there is re-
examination.  That is point one. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 312 of 343 
 
 
Point two, if I understand you correctly, what you 
and Mr Myburgh have started talking about seems to 
coincide with an idea that I have begun to have in regard 
to other matters where there are challenges in terms of 
time in terms of re-examination, if the discussion between 
the 
two 
of 
you 
is 
that 
instead 
of 
having 
oral 
re-
examination, an affidavit could be furnished which would 
clarify whatever matters need to be clarified because the 
regulation says the purpose of re-examination is to clarify, 
then I would have no problem with that.  So if tomorrow we 
10 
are done but there is no time for re-examination but there 
is an agreement that such an affidavit can be furnished to 
clarify whatever you would have wanted to clarify in re-
examination, that would be fine with me. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  The only added difficulty to all of 
this is of course the issue concerning Mr Todd’s application 
for cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  And so I need to consider it in that 
context. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  So there is much to be considered 
within a very short space of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  And that is why I would like to know 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 313 of 343 
 
whether we have acquired tomorrow to present the re-
examination or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, no, that is fine but my 
recollection is that the issue relating to Mr Todd was a very 
narrow issue.  That is my recollection so if it remains a big 
deal, I know that we said let me hear Mr Gama’s evidence 
and then we can see how much dispute is left after that.  I 
am sure that if that is all that is left we could discuss and 
find a way. 
ADV OLDWADGE SC:  As you please, Mr Chair, thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Alright, so let us just take 
a ten minutes adjournment now and then we will return.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let’s continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  I would like to carry on 
then with the 100 locomotives.  Can I just ask you Mr 
Gama so you have explained to us the role that you played 
in the 1064 transaction.  Now what role did you play in 
20 
relation to the 100 locomotives just broadly speaking? 
MR GAMA:   It is such a long time ago, I ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Would it have been the same or 
different to the 1064? 
MR GAMA:   I think this one was the confinement of the – 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 314 of 343 
 
the 100 they relate to the coal line, as you say broadly 
speaking, maybe too broad.   I remember that there was a 
confinement that we tried unsuccessfully to do through 
Mitsui and then ja, it was really around taking the 
presentations to the Group Executive Committee and then 
being on standby if one is required for the ...[indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Gama what I am going to do is I 
am going to ask you to turn to Mr Callard’s affidavit, this is 
Exhibit BB4a, BB4a.  Chair in dealing with the 100 
10 
locomotives the key part of it is the sequence of events 
that Mr Callard sets out from page FQC106 through to 13.  
Now what we have seen from your affidavit is that I mean a 
lot of this is common cause between you and Mr Callard, 
but perhaps I can just run through this.  He says at 
paragraph 26 that I prepared the first business case in 
April and a revised business case in July, further changes 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, what is the page, 
I am at 106. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 6, okay.   Okay, alright, I’ve got it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So dealing with the 100 locomotives 
he says he prepares the first business case at 26.1 he 
says in September or October I was requested by Gama to 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 315 of 343 
 
update the memorandum to the BADC for an additional 119 
e-type equivalent electric locomotives, memorandum dated 
15 October 2013 was signed by Gama and others, at 27 the 
said memorandum recommended confinement to Matsui 
and company Africa Railway Solutions, a subsidiary of 
Japan Matsui & Company Limited on the basis of: 
1. Compatibility with the existing 119 e-type locomotives 
used on the coal export line,  
2. Availability of facilities without having to establish 
new facilities, 
10 
3. Saving and design, testing and type approval and 
fastest possible delivery. 
Then he is – at paragraph 29, he says that 19 e-type 
locomotives 
is 
a 
heavy 
haul 
locomotive, 
specifically 
intended for use on the coal export line, he goes on to 
explain that. 
 
He says at paragraph 30 that the memorandum 
specifically stated that the e-20 type ie 95 locomotives, the 
one we spoke about, recently awarded to CSL was not 
suitable as it is a general freight locomotive of 22 tons per 
20 
axle.  At 31 and further the memorandum also stated that 
the CSR 90 e-type locomotives still had to be tested and 
only thereafter would it be possible to say to what extent it 
could replicate the heavy haul capabilities of the 19-e. 
 
Furthermore an extension of the 95 20-e contract 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 316 of 343 
 
would not be acceptable procurement mechanism as it 
would entail material, design, amendment that could be 
challenged through the procurement procedures manual. 
 
Then he goes on to say at 32: 
“I was informed through an sms from Gama on 21 
October that the Group Chief Executive, Mr Molefe 
had 
withdrawn 
the 
memorandum 
at 
the 
BADC 
meeting on the same day.” 
And then at 33: 
“On 22 October 2013 I sent an sms to Gama 
10 
requesting direction on the way forward. Gama 
replied via sms as follows: ‘I believe it remains 
withdrawn, we are now trying to see how we can get 
leased locomotive from Queensland DC just said to 
me if i need anything it must be less than a billion if 
it is capital and for a confinement it must be within  
his authority.” 
Then he says at 34: 
“I later prepared an updated version which Gama 
signed on 25 November 2013.  On the afternoon of 
20 
Friday the 18 t h of January I received the following 
sms from Gama ...” 
And he sets that out.   If you go to paragraph 38: 
“On Monday the 20 t h of January I mailed a PDF 
version of the revised business case to Gama.” 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 317 of 343 
 
39: 
“On 
the 
morning 
of 
Wednesday 
22 
January 
I 
received a mail from Alechi from Supply Chain 
Services requesting my assistance in formatting by 
memorandum of the previous Monday.  When I 
perused 
the 
memorandum 
I 
noticed 
that 
the 
memorandum had been changed to give effect to 
confine 
an 
award 
to 
CSR 
for 
100 
electric 
locomotives.” 
And then at paragraph 40 he says: 
10 
“a comparison of my original business case of 20 
January with that received from Alechi revealed that 
the business case had been clearly amended inter 
alia ...” 
You see at 40.2: 
“The motivation to confine to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Myburgh would you arrange for 
me to get – I think there are two pages missing here. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I don’t have pages 9 and 10, which 
20 
would be – ja I don’t have pages 9 and 10 so the 
paragraphs you are reading I don’t have, but they can be 
inserted later on, I will just listen to you, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chair.   So he undertakes 
a 
comparison 
between 
the 
two 
business 
cases, 
he 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 318 of 343 
 
comments inter alia that the motivation to confine to 
...[indistinct] had been removed and replaced with a 
confinement to CSR.  At paragraph 42 at page 10  he says 
he was taken aback by these unilateral changes in the 
memorandum.  He says at 43 as the prime author of the 
business case/memorandum I was not consulted, and then 
at 44 he says he: 
“deliberated long and hard on Wednesday evening 
on the implications of what I have learnt and on 
Thursday afternoon 23 January I emailed Game and 
10 
Gianni expressing my concern at the unilateral 
change 
to 
the 
business 
case/memorandum 
I 
submitted on Monday in respect of the 19 e-type 
heavy haul locomotives to an unspecified general 
freight locomotive confined to CSR.” 
At paragraph 45 my mail – this is at page 11: 
“My mail to Gama and Gianni opens with “this is a 
difficult mail to write.   In helping to format a recent 
version of the 180 locomotive business case on 
Wednesday 
22 n d 
I 
noticed 
that 
the 
case 
was 
20 
changed 
from 
that 
which 
I 
had 
submitted 
on 
Monday.   This mail is because of the nature of the 
nature of those changes and implications, the 
implications are technical and in the rationale for 
the 
acquisition 
which 
was 
speedy 
delivery 
to 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 319 of 343 
 
mitigate MDS volumes as risk.” 
And at 46: 
“The essence of my comments inter alia covered the 
following issues.” 
Then at 48 he says that: 
“During 
the 
preparation 
of 
my 
statement 
the 
Commission provided me with three pertinent emails 
from which it is evident that Gama seemingly Molefe 
had acknowledged my concerns per the email trail 
below. 
10 
1. The first email was sent from Gama to Singh late 
on 
23 
January, 
essentially 
reflecting 
my 
concerns.   It reads “Hi Mr Singh, I am afraid the 
submission of the 100 locomotives is a mess and 
will need to be withdrawn.  The 20 e-locomotive 
is a 22 ton per axle locomotive suitable for the 
GFB while the 19 e-locomotive is a 26 ton per 
axle will be suitable for the coal line.  The two 
locomotive types are not inter-operable.  While 
CSR can make additional locomotives in China in 
20 
a very short space of time to mitigate against 
India’s volume loss this will be counter to our 
localisation strategy and will have to be spelt 
out.  The 85 locomotives to be assembled by TE 
has not yet commenced, so we cannot yet make 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 320 of 343 
 
any argument as this would reduce the risk. 
2. The second mail was sent to Gama on the 
morning of 24 January saying that we would 
discuss the matter this morning. 
3. The third email also on the morning of Friday 24 
was where Singh forwarded Gama’s mail to 
Molefe for information.” 
Then we get to the BADC meeting on the 24 t h of January; 
“the minutes of the BADC meeting on 24 January 
record the attendance of Molefe and Singh and the 
10 
partial attendance of Gama and Gianni.  The BADC 
discussed the acquisition of the 100 class 19 e-
electric locomotives,   BADC pack containing the 
revised 
submission 
was 
signed 
by 
Singh 
and 
Molefe.  The minutes do not reflect that the BADC 
was informed of my concerns raised in the email 
correspondence above.” 
At 51: 
“The minutes reflect that the BADC was misled by 
management as to the validity of the confinement 
20 
process by 
1. Creating the impression that the 26 ton heavy 
haul CSR locomotive existed when in fact this 
was not the case. 
2. Using 
Chinese 
manufacturing 
facilities 
to 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 321 of 343 
 
motivate for the speedy delivery which would 
have negated local content requirements, see 
Gama’s email in this regard. 
3. Purporting 
that 
the 
confinement 
was 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
procurement 
procedure 
manual when no previous product existed.” 
52: 
“It was accepted that the locomotives could or 
should not be confined to Matsui then the correct 
procedure would have been to go out on open 
10 
tender.” 
53: 
“The 100 locomotives were confined to CSR.” 
And then at 54: 
“On 4 February 2014 I received an sms from Gama 
in response to my email of 23 January stating I 
have just seen your email, I would explain to you 
the GC is thinking, this was not followed up 
etcetera.” 
So that is the kind of broad architecture and sequence of 
20 
events.   Now as I mentioned to you Mr Gama much of this 
is – you don’t take issue with and you provide your own 
exposition over this space, I think it is on eight pages and I 
am going to ask you to go through that. 
 
You will find your response to what I have taken you 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 322 of 343 
 
through at Bundle 7, page 250, page 1, 250.150, this is 
from your third affidavit.   You start off at paragraph 42 ad 
paragraph 26 and that deals with the original business 
case/memorandum.   You say it is correct that the 
memorandum 
dated 
15 
October 
was 
in 
fact 
the 
memorandum that was submitted to the Transnet BADC for 
the acquisition of the 100 class 19-e electric locomotives, 
the acquisition was to serve the coal line, do you confirm 
that? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You go on to say at sub-2: 
“It was my role not that of Callard to peruse/review 
the motivation and the approval of the business 
case, however my role was limited to submitting the 
business case to the GCE of the Transnet whose 
function it was to submit the business case to the 
BADC.  In turn it was the BADC’s function to submit 
the business case to the Board for final approval.” 
Is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you go on to say then that the 
Board was required to submit the business case to the 
Minister for approval.  Is that right? 
MR GAMA:   Yes in the event that PFMA approval was 
required ja. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 323 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say in this regard for me to 
attend BADC meetings I had to be invited by the GCEO to 
support him when he presented the business case if he 
found it necessary, is that right? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We know that you weren’t a member 
of the BADC. 
MR GAMA:   Yes I was not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then you go on to say in response 
to paragraph 32, you say: 
10 
“It was strange for Callard to simply invite himself 
to the BADC meeting.  This in circumstances where 
he hadn’t been requested to attend such meeting.” 
MR GAMA:   He had not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He had not, I beg your pardon.  In 
many instances I would invite him to attend the meeting so 
as to support me and me in turn supporting the GCEO.   Is 
that correct? 
MR GAMA:  That is correct yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then I want to take you if I could to 
20 
your paragraph 49, Ad para’s 44 and 45 of Callard, and 
what Callard is dealing with there is the change in the 
memorandum.   You say at 49.1 the changes to the 
memorandum were affected by Singh who signed the 
memorandum on 21 January 2014.  The memorandum was 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 324 of 343 
 
then signed by Brian Molefe on 22 January 2014.  It should 
be noted that my signature was not appended to FC14.  I 
was not a party to what is alleged to have been the 
unilateral amendment.   It was at all times known to Callard 
that I supported the confinement to Matsui and Company. 
Do you confirm that? 
MR GAMA:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Gama before I go further 
into your affidavit could I ask you please to go back to 
Bundle 
BB4A 
and 
could 
I 
ask 
you 
to 
go 
to 
this 
10 
memorandum, change memorandum, which you find at 
page 244. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What’s the page again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   244 Chairperson, that is FQC244. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I’ve got it thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you will see that it is signed at 
page 267, I think that is what you’re referring at your 
paragraph 49.1, signed by Mr Singh on the 21 s t of January 
and then signed by Mr Molefe on the 22 n d of January, is 
that correct? 
20 
MR GAMA:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So perhaps I could just stop here 
and ask you how on earth does this come about?  Mr 
Callard works on the memorandum of the business case, 
you are the business owner, these locomotives are for the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 325 of 343 
 
use presumably of TFR, how does from one day to the next 
this memorandum change so fundamentally, or the confine 
change so fundamentally, from Matsui to CSR? 
MR GAMA:   No, thank you.  The – or from what I recall I 
think as Callard has indicated to you sometime in October 
or November the submission had been withdrawn from the 
BADC, ostensibly because we had already confined to 
Matsui I think at least two times, and this would have been 
the third confinement.   So it was felt by the BADC that this 
would not be correct, and that I had in persisting with this 
10 
Matsui and this was the third submission, so it appeared 
that the BADC rejected my proposal on that date and 
therefore it was ...[indistinct – dropping voice] so I learnt 
from Mr Molefe that that submission would have been 
stillborn because of the sentiments that were experts by 
the BADC that we’d already done it twice and a third one 
was not appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – you swallowed the last word, was 
not appropriate? 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR GAMA:   Or they would not welcome it, yes.  So that’s 
how we got to renew confinement to CSR which as 
indicated in what Mr Myburgh said I had then – I had a 
telephone discussion with Callard, which I think he does 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 326 of 343 
 
not recall, he had phoned me and I think maybe at the 
same time he also sent me the email, and so we had had a 
discussion where he indicated to me that look there is a 
new submission and that new submission is to CSR and me 
and him then agreed that we did not currently have any 
experience of CSR doing a heavy haul locomotive which 
was the 26 ton, the axle locomotive.   It was on that basis 
that I then sent an email to Singh that evening to say look 
this is what I hear that has happened, I think it would not 
be appropriate for us to try and confine this type of 
10 
locomotive because we had no experience of it, at least in 
our country, the experience that we had is that one of 
Matsui. 
 
I was still at that time unaware that the BADC had 
rejected completely any suggestion that Matsui should 
have the – to have this confinement or this procurement 
confined to it, so I learnt it after that submission from – so 
I think then it was at that time that Mr Molefe and Mr Singh 
had then submitted the CSR memo to the BADC because if 
you look at the time period it would have been submitted a 
20 
day before the actual meeting, because Mr Molefe had 
signed it a day before the meeting, so that is how it came 
about, that there was that new CSR memo. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me take you back to your 
affidavit, we have got to paragraph 49.1 where you said at 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 327 of 343 
 
the end it was at all times known to Callard that I 
supported the ...[indistinct – dropping voice].   If I can take 
you over the page, page 153, that is 250.153, at 51.2 I 
recall having received a telephone call from Callard during 
the evening of 23 January when he informed me that the 
confinement to Matsui had somehow been changed to a 
confinement to CSR. 
At 51.3 
“I indicated to him that I would liaise with Singh to 
establish what was going on, I sent the email 
10 
referred to during the evening of the 23 r d of January 
after my conversation with Callard, the email was 
premised on input provided by him.  At that time I 
had not seen the email which Callard had sent to 
me.”    
You say at sub-4 I agree with Callard concerning the 
matters raised by him, is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then over the page 250.154 at 
53.1: 
20 
“I did not support the confinement to CSR at well 
known to Molefe and Singh.  The memorandum to 
the BADC was not signed by me.” 
That we have seen, correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes that is correct. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 328 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I want to get to the minutes, 
and perhaps what I could ask you to do is to turn up and 
work with them together, BB4a, and go to page 228 there, 
you will find the minutes of the BADC meeting on the 24 t h 
of 
January, 
and 
then 
I 
will 
take 
you 
through 
your 
commentary on them, in your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page on 4a? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 228 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.    
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What we see on that page is these 
10 
are the minutes of the BADC meeting of 24 January, 
present Mr Charne, he was the Chairperson, correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then in attendance Messrs 
Molefe and Singh and then we say – you see partial 
attendance by yourself, is that correct? 
MR GAMA:   Yes., 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we then go to your affidavit at 
page 215.154, you say at paragraph 54.1: 
“I have read the minutes particularly at paragraph 
20 
5.22 of the meeting of 24 January of the BADC.” 
You say at 54.2: 
“It is clear to me that no one from TFR would have 
presented anything of the kind reflected in the minutes.  As 
and 
by 
way 
of 
example 
“management 
informed 
the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 329 of 343 
 
committee that it was decided that a 26 ton heavy haul line 
by GE would perform better than a Class 19-e Matsui.  
aforesaid caption is nonsensical in that not only is the 
heavy haul line not locomotive but also that General 
Electric GE only manufactures diesel locomotives and 
therefore the specifications cannot be compared with those 
of electric locomotives manufactured for instance by Mitsui. 
Then you quote again at 54.3. 
“Management motivated for the confinement 
in favour of GE. This was motivated by a 
10 
submission that was previously withdrawn 
due 
to 
reputational 
issues 
that 
had 
emanated from an old newspaper article. 
Management 
requested 
for 
a 
contract 
extension 
for 
the 
Class 
43E 
diesel 
locomotives by CSR.  From the oh and 
foregoing it is clear that confusion reigned 
between 
the 
procurement 
of 
diesel 
locomotives 
by 
GE 
(43D) 
and 
the 
procurement of electric locomotives either 
20 
from CSR and or Mitsui.  Consequently no 
alliance ought to be placed on the aforesaid 
submissions as they are clearly wrong and 
not 
representative 
of 
what 
had 
been 
discussed.  However what is significant was 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 330 of 343 
 
the 
fact 
that 
whilst 
I 
supported 
the 
confinement 
to 
Mitsui 
the 
BADAC 
had 
rejected my said proposal on the basis as I 
understand it that such confinement would 
have been the third with Mitsui.  As it so 
happened Brian Molefe later informed me 
that my Mitsui submission would have been 
stillborn.” 
And then at sub 4. 
“Singh 
and 
Molefe 
had 
removed 
my 
10 
memorandum and prepared a new one which 
they signed and presented to the committee 
recommending 
CSR 
as 
the 
preferred 
supplier.” 
You want to comment on that further? 
MR GAMA:  Ja.  Well that is what it is I think when they 
realised that the Mitsui submission would not be supported 
by the BADAC they then put in CSR.  I think with us as 
people in the railway we had not experienced anything of 
heavy haul for – from CSR so we would not have made a 
20 
recommendation that CSR should do it.  It turned out much 
later that CSR did make such types of locomotives but in 
China and not – we had not had sight such a type of 
locomotive ourselves.  So the confinement route would not 
have been one that would support – we would have 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 331 of 343 
 
supported for CSR because we did not know anything about 
their heavy haul capabilities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your evidence to the effect that prior to 
this 
changed 
memorandum 
for 
the 
one 
that 
was 
recommending CSR – confinement to CSR prior to that 
memorandum being presented to the committee you were 
not aware that there was a change now the confinement was 
for CSR? 
MR GAMA:  The – the only bidder for 00:03:39 was the 
discussion that I had had with Callard. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Callard yes. 
MR GAMA:  Which was the evening before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GAMA:  I had then sent the email to say look I am told 
that this is what is happening but that you guys are not you 
know going with Mitsui you going with someone else and I 
think you might not be able to find what we are looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was an email to Mr Singh? 
MR GAMA:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Which he never responded or did he 
20 
respond? 
MR GAMA:  The response according to the records he 
responded the following morning which I did not see where 
he said we will discuss it in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was never 00:04:32. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 332 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:  Ja, no it was never followed up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Would that be quite unusual that 
the committee would discuss a matter such as that that 
relates to a particular division and the head of that division 
is not aware of the latest position that is being presented to 
the commission. 
MR GAMA:  Yes, no it is – it was unusual because I was 
00:05:09 on the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then as I understand it your input 
was not sought on the revised business case. 
MR GAMA:  No it was not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Gama perhaps you can assist 
with this.  Do I understand – I mean was there a meeting of 
the BADAC before the 24 t h of January where it decided 
against the confinement to Mitsui or was that an informal 
discussion that were had with Mr Singh and Mr Molefe that 
then caused the change in the business case and the 
20 
memorandum and then the presentation of the revision on 
the 25 t h of January or do I have the sequence wrong? 
MR GAMA:  No they had been a meeting but I had not 
received any feedback from that particular meeting.  There 
had been a meeting I think in November of 2013 where the 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 333 of 343 
 
BADAC had presented this but I had not been privy to this 
so I continued to send updated what do you call it – Mitsui 
confinements to say I now have an update and this is what 
it now looks like can you put it into the pack?  But I had not 
received this feedback.  I only received the feedback after 
the 24 t h of January that look this thing would have been 
stillborn these guys had long rejected any procurement from 
Mitsui. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you absence from that meeting of the 
24 t h of November you said you were absent in that meeting. 
10 
MR GAMA:  No I had not been at the meeting.  There was 
never a need for me to go to all the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  If I was required at the meeting I would then 
be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would be asked. 
MR GAMA:  I would be asked ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if a matter relating to your division 
was going to be discussed would you need to be invited or? 
MR GAMA:  Yes I would need to be invited.  I mean the 
20 
GCE can make up his mind whether or not . 
CHAIRPERSON:  He wants you to come along. 
MR GAMA:  He wants me to support him there or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR GAMA:  If he felt that he could handle it he would 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 334 of 343 
 
handle it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if we carry on with your affidavit 
at 250.155 you say at the time of sending the sms I had 
already dealt with the matter as I had spoken to Callard 
telephonically during the evening of 23 January 2014.   
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then you take issue with what Mr 
Callard says at 54.1 and that is .. 
MR GAMA:  On his 54.1? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  Where he said that it is incorrect 
when you said I had just received your email he said that 
cannot be correct because you had – you had followed up 
on it.  And you take issue with that. 
MR GAMA:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then at paragraph 57 of your 
affidavit you say I note the professional opinion expressed I 
do not differ from it and have no cause not to support it. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that is where he is talking about 
20 
the concerns that he had. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright and then could I take you to 
other parts of your affidavit that are of some significance for 
present purposes.  Could you please go to page 250.145.  
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 335 of 343 
 
Sorry my reference is wrong.  I beg your pardon.  168.  You 
dealing then generally at paragraph 77 at the foot of the 
page with the acquisition of the 120 E locomotive you say 
TFR had set out to procure 100 locomotives from the coal 
line from Mitsui in line with the 19E acquisition.  The 
BADAC determined that we had utilised confinement as a 
procurement strategy with Mitsui on two previous occasions 
and that this did not permit a third acquisition from Mitsui.  
The 
GCEO 
and 
GCFO 
subsequently 
requested 
a 
confinement to CSR and the BADAC agreed to the request.  
10 
A 
decision 
was 
taken 
whilst 
I 
was 
protesting 
the 
appropriateness of the request having regard to the fact 
that CSR had no established history with the provision of 
similar locomotives in South Africa.  Subsequent to the 
approval of the aforesaid request by the BADAC which 
motivated its decision to the board Transnet’s technical 
design team engaged with CSR to create prototypes where 
after the locomotives were delivered and employed on the 
coal line.  They were named 21E Series.  You want to 
comment and expand on that? 
20 
MR GAMA:  Yes I think I am – after the – after the – that 
meeting of the 24 t h we were then informed that we – we 
should engage with CSR which we did and they then 
created the prototypes.  Those 100 locomotives were 
manufactured and in fact with the benefit of hindsight and 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 336 of 343 
 
sometimes ignorance can be interesting because the people 
that signed the CSR memo were saying look they did not 
know anything about locomotives and this CSR locomotives 
they are better than the Mitsui locomotives.  And I think 
they have – they have fared well.  The Mitsui locomotives 
gave us a lot of post commissioning teething problems in 
the coal line.  There were lots of issues around their 
adherence and all of those kinds of issues which cost a lot 
of money in the sense that they had to be taken out for 
frequent repairs and when the CSR locomotives came in 
10 
they did assist in terms of delivery record volumes on the 
coal line and in fact the customers were very happy 
because for the first time after we took delivery of this 
Transnet reached about 77 million tons of coal in one year 
and it is something that we had never thought would ever 
happen.  And that was as a result of these CSR locomotives 
that came through – these new ones the 21 E Series. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I want to take you to parts of Mr 
Singh’s affidavit if I may and this you find and someone will 
help you with this Transnet Bundle 5(c) Exhibit BB23.   
20 
MR GAMA:  Ja.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I ask you to turn to page 1458.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is 1558? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1458 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1458. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 337 of 343 
 
MR GAMA:  Oh it is in the second bundle.  This one goes to 
– oh ja 14? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1458. 
MR GAMA:  The black numbers? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes on the left hand side.   
MR GAMA:  This one goes to 1425.  1458. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GAMA:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I just wanted to ask you to have a 
look at paragraph 119 he is commenting on a paragraph in 
10 
the Fundudzi Report.  Perhaps it is not – he says I deny the 
contents of this paragraph in that – insofar as it relates to 
the manner in which the confinement was prepared for 
these reasons. 
 
He says Mr Gama was the Chief Executive of TRF. 
MR GAMA:  TFR. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was for all intents and purposes the 
end 
user 
of 
the 
locomotives 
as 
he 
was 
ultimately 
accountable for TFR as a division of Transnet. 
 
Sub 2 he was present at the meeting at which the 
20 
confinement was present – I presume – presented and 
approved by the BADAC.  Do you want to say anything 
about that? 
MR GAMA:  Ja I was partially present.  I cannot recall you 
will see that that meeting dealt with a number of issues.  It 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 338 of 343 
 
was not only the 100 it also dealt with the one of 64.  So I 
was partially present but I do not have a recollection of my 
presence when the 100 was discussed.  But I would also 
say that even if I was present in those kinds of meetings 
that is where you go to these meetings and you speak when 
you are spoken to. (Speaking in the vernacular).   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you will have to say that in English 
for the benefit of those who do not understand Isi-Zulu. 
MR GAMA:  I am saying Mr Myburgh that the – in these 
kinds of meetings where you are invited you are – you are  
10 
partial attendee and it says – you speak when you are 
spoken to.  You are there to provide advise if it is required.  
You are not there to express any new views or anything that 
you might want to do because you know the man waiting 
outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not outside participant. 
MR GAMA:  You are not a participant at all the particular 
meeting. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Gama perhaps just before nine 
o’clock I found the reference that I missed just now.  Could 
20 
I ask you to go back to your affidavit or back to your exhibit 
28 and to another of your affidavit – your second affidavit.  
Let me ask you to go to page 144 so this is in the beginning 
of Exhibit BB28.   
MR GAMA:  BB? 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 339 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  BB28 so it is your exhibit and to page 
144.  Bundle … 
MR GAMA:  250.144? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  144 no not 250.144 that is what – I 
had confused myself I am sorry.  At the beginning 144.  Just 
at paragraph 30 at 144 you also deal with 100 locomotives 
and what we find that 30.1 are things we have already dealt 
with.  I just want to take you over the page 145 at 
paragraph 30.2.1 the written recommendation to procure 
100 locomotives from CSR was signed by the CFO, the 
10 
GCEO at the time etcetera in circumstances where I was of 
the 
view 
that 
CSR 
did 
not 
have 
the 
capability 
to 
manufacture heavy haul locomotives.  You confirm that? 
MR GAMA:  I confirm that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then the next sub paragraph 
30.2.2.  I was informed by the GCEO that Sharma the Chair 
of the Disposal and Acquisition Committee ADC had not 
permitted any further procurement by way of confinement 
from Mitsui.  
MR GAMA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I deny that I was responsible for 
making a recommendation to the ADC and that I failed in my 
fiduciary duties during the acquisition of 100 locomotives 
from CSR as [?] you confirm that? 
MR GAMA:  I confirm that. 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 340 of 343 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could you just give us the context of 
this discussion that you had with Mr Molefe. 
MR GAMA:  I think I have already said it but I can repeat it.  
The context was that we had already confined twice to 
Mitsui and that the BADAC Chair and the BADAC have then 
said look there was not going to be a third opportunity for 
us to do that so they had then – and I think that is at the 
time when they actually withdrawn that submission that had 
been made in November.  So that is the context. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And did Mr Molefe make specific 
10 
reference to Mr Sharma the Chairperson? 
MR GAMA:  Ja when we had the discussion he said look the 
Chairperson of the BADAC but normally it is not really – you 
do not work like that it is really – it is the BADAC in its 
totality.  You cannot hold one person if the others agreed it 
is the whole 00:22:16 we do not have a system of singling 
out particular people per se but ja that is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you say on this occasion even 
though that is not what it normally done namely singling 
somebody out on this occasion Mr Molefe did or are you 
20 
saying he… 
MR GAMA:  That is the information that I got and that was 
the information that I gleaned ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And what was your understanding of 
what he was saying with special reference to whether he 
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 341 of 343 
 
was 
saying 
that 
was 
the 
view 
that 
came 
from 
the 
Chairperson Mr Sharma or the committee as opposed to 
saying that was the view of the committee. Did you have an 
understanding? 
MR GAMA:  My understanding was that he – he had 
particularly been the one who was not very happy about it 
but the – the whole committee concurred with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson if this is a convenient 
time? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  no that is fine.  We will adjourn 
then.  I think that therefore the arrangement about tomorrow 
is as we have discussed and I suggest that maybe Mr 
Myburgh you could be in touch with Mr (talking over one 
another). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I will do that at lunch 
CHAIRPERSON:  With Mr Pretorius over the lunch break 
and then you can share the information.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you to everybody for 
20 
your cooperation to enable us to sit until this time.   
Thank you Mr Myburgh and your team and the 
investigation team.  
Thank you Mr Gama and your legal team. Thank to 
the technicians and staff.   
11 MAY 2021 – DAY 392 
 
Page 342 of 343 
 
Thank you very much to everybody.   
We adjourn.
