ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Mr 
Pamensky thank you for coming again I understand you are 
not coming for the first time to give testimony before the 
commission. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is good thank you.  Just by way of 
10 
the 
information 
Chairperson 
Mr 
Pamensky 
has 
dealt 
extensively with the issues of suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I have had too many witnesses 
appear before me now that I cannot remember.  So – but 
the last – at the last count I was told I had heard about 257 
witnesses. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Wow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is not a small number.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Pamensky is one of those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So thank you for coming back Mr 
20 
Pamensky. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Thank you Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes Mr – just for information 
purposes Mr Pamensky’s affidavit – the main affidavit 
deals more with the issues of suspension Chairperson on 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 8 of 94 
 
the issues of transactions Mr Pamensky had recused 
himself – yes in the matter that came before the board Mr 
Pamensky had recused himself – is it the board? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes Chair it came to the board I recused 
myself from all coal and coal procurement at Eskom from 
that date forward I was never involved in anything that 
would come coal or coal procurement whether it was at 
board level or sub-committee level. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  B.  I was never a board tender committee 
10 
member either. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You were never? 
MR PAMENSKY:  A board tender committee member. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay yes.  So – but there is an issue 
regarding Mr Pamensky’s emails that were exchanged with 
one of the Gupta brothers.  He will have to explain that 
part insofar as the transactions are concerned.   
 
And then he touches on the McKinsey matter insofar 
as he came to the board to the extent that is dealt with in 
the affidavit I think we will refer to what is in the affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to just speak up a little 
bit Mr Seleka. Speak up a little bit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh a little bit ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  I will then 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 9 of 94 
 
proceed Chairperson to lead Mr Pamensky’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do yes do so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Pamensky the evidence already just 
by way of background before the commission and I think 
you have already given this in your first appearance that 
you were one of the new persons appointed with effect 
from the 11 t h of December 2014 on the board of Eskom.  
Correct?  Just by way of background. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Could you tell the Chairperson 
10 
what is your profession? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair I am a Chartered Accountant by 
profession.  Yes that is my profession. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well was this your first 
appointment to serve on the board of Eskom 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes it is my first time to serve on a state 
owned enterprises board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or an SOE that is the – how were you  
appointed to serve on the board? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sir as I explained last time I filled in a – 
20 
from the newspaper I filled in the advert.  What transpired 
from there is we got receipt acknowledging receipt of my 
application.  Then I received on the 11 t h of December a 
letter to say you have been approved.  I did not accept that 
appointment up front.  There were certain conflicts I 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 10 of 94 
 
needed to disclose upfront.  Once those were disclosed 
everybody was happy and after the DPE Department of 
Public Enterprise and all the other members approved it I 
accepted the position thereafter in January Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know any of the board 
members prior to your appointment? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which ones did you know? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I knew Ms Viroshni Naidoo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And how did you know her? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  Socially. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your voice drops down. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Does it oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From time to time Mr Seleka.  So make 
an effort to speak up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And how do you know her? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Socially. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja just explain that? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh yes her husband Mr Kuban Moodley is 
a good friend of mine since 2001 so I have known her 
20 
since meeting Mr Kuban Moodley. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I asked her the same question 
yesterday if you followed her testimony and I asked her 
whether knowing you socially as a friend does it mean you 
were a family friend and she said yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 11 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:  I agree with that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You agree with that. 
MR PAMENSKY:  I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So prior to your appointment to the 
board can you roughly estimate how long did you know 
each other? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Twelve/thirteen years. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About thirteen years? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes about thirteen years. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you – did you know that she was 
10 
also applying to serve on the Eskom board? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  By the way you said the husband 
is a friend of yours. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja do you know the type of business 
the husband is doing? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I have been listening over here to the 
commission just hearing what the story is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But you did not know? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  No not at all. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  What do you know him to be doing? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Kuban is a business developer – Mr 
Kuban Moodley sorry Chair I should look here is a business 
developer manager – or a business development executive 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 12 of 94 
 
where he puts deals together with certain parties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  We understand that he is also 
friends with Mr Salim Essa? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You also knew Mr Salim Essa? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes I did know him Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Did you know that he also knew Mr 
Salim Essa? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the three of you knew each other as 
10 
friends? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In business? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No business. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No business? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No business.  I did a business – Mr 
Moodley left Eskom in 2011 we did a roof tiling business in 
2012 which did not work out and we decided that we are 
not going to do business together we will remain our 
friendship so we never did any business together. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Did your appointment to the 
Eskom board – let me put it differently.  When you were 
applying 
to 
serve 
on 
the 
board 
did 
you 
have 
any 
conversation with Mr Salim Essa about it? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No I did not. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 13 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So he did not know that you were going 
to serve on the Eskom board? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And did you know any other board 
member apart from Ms Viroshni Naidoo? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes I knew Mr Khoza September I would 
see him occasionally at the yearend functions at Vodacom 
– I mean at Telkom and then I knew Mr Romeo Khumalo 
also just from the year end functions of Vodacom and the 
awards so we used to go for awards at year end to either 
10 
Telkom or either Vodacom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is – those are the only three 
you knew? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Any of the Gupta brothers prior to your 
appointment to serve on the Eskom board? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes I did know the Gupta brothers Mr 
Tony Gupta as I told you last time I went for a cup of tea 
and then I joined the board of Oakbay Resources and 
Energy 
Limited 
the 
Johannesburg 
Stock 
Exchange 
20 
Company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Okay you understand the reasons 
why these questions are being asked? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I do Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do.  Because the board members 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 14 of 94 
 
have been alleged to have had connections with the 
Gupta’s and that as a result of those connections they 
have facilitated transactions that benefited the Gupta 
entities when they were at Eskom.  So that is – that is the 
reason we are asking those questions. 
 
Please turn to page 372 of your affidavit.   
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed Mr Seleka can I ask 
this question because I do not want to forget it?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand it yourself, Mr Moodley 
and Mr Salim Essa are all friends, is that correct? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes Chair that is correct but the way you 
describe it that you think we are very close the way I am 
friendly with a very lot of people Chair.  This is just one of 
my many friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no that is fine but I am just saying 
you are friends with both of them? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Evidence that has been led here 
20 
has suggested that Mr Salim Essa met with certain Eskom 
officials at Melrose Arch on the 10 t h of March of course one 
of the Eskom officials was alleged to have been present in 
those meetings is Mr Koko who has denied that there were 
such meetings.   
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 15 of 94 
 
 
Did you know his offices at Melrose Arch – Mr Salim 
Essa? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would you be willing to point where 
those offices exactly used to be for the commission?  Is 
that something you could do? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes with pleasure.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I would be very grateful because one of 
the things we want to establish is whether the people who 
say they had meetings with him and Mr Koko at Melrose 
10 
Arch can point out that this is where we were at those 
meetings.  And it is important to find somebody who can 
say well Mr Salim Essa’s offices were – this is where they 
are or they were in March 2015.  Then at least we know 
that as a fact and then we see whether they are pointing 
the right places or not. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes Sir with absolute pleasure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  You will take that 
further Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes indeed Chairperson.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Yes Mr Pamensky I was 
then – I had asked you to turn to page 372 of your affidavit 
paragraph 8.5 which is in relation to your knowledge and 
interaction with the Gupta brothers.  So it says there: 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 16 of 94 
 
“As to the Gupta’s I met Tony Gupta in 
about June 2014 when he invited me to his 
house to meet him.” 
I thought the information was insufficient – it was limping 
in the sense that we do not see how it came about that he 
had to invite you for – to his house – invite you to his 
house.  
“He – when he invited me to his house to 
meet me.” 
Did he know you before this in order to invite you? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  As I said last time to you no he did not 
know me Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but how did he – because the call 
cannot come out of the blue?  So did he? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair the calls do come out of the blue.  
I got a call out the blue it was a SMS or a call I cannot 
remember who said come over for a cup of tea.  That is 
how we do our business.  People phone you, you go there 
and you have a chat and you see what the discussions are 
about.  That is what we do in business. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes no we just want you to explain. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh sorry. 
ADV BLOU SC:  Sorry Chair can I just for the benefit of 
the commission and Mr Seleka and for my own – just bring 
my own witness into line for two seconds? 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 17 of 94 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BLOU SC:  Mr Pamensky you heard the Chair say that 
he is in 1257 Rivers, right.  You were last here when we 
were here last it was sometime last year probably – the 
year before the examiner was different it was a Ms 
Hofmeyr.  Please treat the questions as if the persons in 
this room had never heard the answers. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Understood sorry for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BLOU SC:  Now no one is suggesting that you have 
10 
not given the answers but they are not – they will not know 
them.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you very much for that 
thank you very much. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry Chair.  Sorry Advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I indicated I could not remember that 
he had been to – he had given evidence.  
MR PAMENSKY:   I could not have led a good impression 
Chair if you did not remember me.  That is – that be the 
truth. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so I – I mean we just want to 
understand how the call came about. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry the call just came about roughly in 
June I got a telephone call or a whatsapp message says 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 18 of 94 
 
would you like to come over and have a cup of tea and 
have a discussion?  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  It was as simple as that Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes no you told us. 
MR PAMENSKY:  So it was as simple as that Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Because I mean we thought maybe 
you had been referred to him – he is – your name has been 
mentioned to him that you are in this type of business and 
that is why he called you to explore the possibility of what 
10 
business they can do with you.  You know that sort of 
information one does not see here. 
MR PAMENSKY:  I hear you Advocate – I hear you 
Advocate Seleka so it was a call and we went – we had a 
meeting.  He explained to me a bit about the Sahara group 
a lot.  He explained to me more of his operations where 
they going and he explained to me his mining operations 
and then I explained to him Blue Label Telecoms what we 
do and we are doing and we left it there.  It was a very 
cool meeting. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  So are you saying nothing came of 
that meeting? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No Sir nothing came of that meeting.  
There was just a general chat.  He explained to me what he 
does in their business, what he is doing.  I said this is 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 19 of 94 
 
what Blue Label does and we just had a general chat and 
that was it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What does Blue Label – what did or 
does Blue Label do? 
MR 
PAMENSKY: 
 
Blue 
Label 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
telecommunications industry.  It is involved in all facets of 
start and prepaid airtime whether it is cellular, whether it is 
electricity, whether it is other services.  It provides a 
variety of services to – shoo it has been five years – 
excuse me – it offers a variety of electronic services to 
10 
enable end users to obtain products much easier and much 
more accessible to anyone.  So we were primarily in the 
cellular distribution game. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  Was – did you get a sense that he 
was calling you because of you being at Blue Labels and 
Blue Labels was doing? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I did not – it did not cross my mind – did 
not think about that.  He called me probably to have a 
meeting to see and also open up a relationship. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So that is June 2014.  At the time 
20 
were you an employee of Blue Labels or is this your 
company? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No I was the Chief Operating Officer of 
Blue Label Telecoms at that time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then you do also say you met with 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 20 of 94 
 
Mr Atul Gupta but just before I go there did you ask Mr 
Tony where did you get my name and number from? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Why not? 
MR PAMENSKY:  It did not cross my mind.  He sent no 
message got hold of me and wanted to speak.  You know I 
do not know where he got my number from.  Did not cross 
my mind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but this time 2014 the Gupta’s were 
well-known from a media point of view, the landing at the 
10 
military base, the wedding at Sun City and the connections 
– their connections with the former President.  Did you 
know about all that? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair asked me last time that question 
and I did not see it like that at all Chair.  You know maybe 
it was a political fight they were not near as toxic as they 
are today.  You know when I worked at ORE the listed 
company you know we had KPMG, we had the big auditors 
there 
was 
nothing 
wrong. 
It 
was 
run 
very 
well 
by 
management.  It was very impressive from my perspective.  
20 
Just to maybe give you a little concept.  ORE is listed on 
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and we meet quarterly.  
So we follow very similar to how the Eskom works.  We 
follow your board meetings and you attend quarterly and 
you have all the different committees. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 21 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes but okay.  I understand 
MR PAMENSKY:  So I just wanted to say I have never seen 
anything untoward at all. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes, now you will deal with that 
when you become a board member.  It think you will deal 
with that at that stage.  But I am just talking from an 
outside point of view hearing media reports this is what is 
happening, the Gupta’s and their involvement with the 
former President, the deals that they are making with 
government and so on.  I am asking whether you were 
10 
aware of that? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No Chair – well no.  I was aware they 
had relationships but it also seemed to me that it looked 
like a lot of fighting to do with like the media people 
because they in my mind owned TNA and all this coming 
across was just like a – a media fight but I did not see 
anything of that Chair, not at all. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you do say also that you came to 
know Mr Atul Gupta and let me just read out from your 
affidavit. 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will just read out from your affidavit. 
Again you say 8.5.2 
“Atul Gupta called me in late August or 
early September 2014 to invite me to sit on 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 22 of 94 
 
the board of Oakbay Resources and Energy 
Limited in anticipation of its listing on the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.” 
So okay I pause there again because I am trying to think 
like in the first – in the preceding paragraph why does it 
look like a call out of nowhere or is this one different? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No Chair as I said to you on that 12 t h he 
explained to me some of his companies and they have got 
mining and everything and then Mr Atul Gupta phoned me 
afterwards to ask me to come and have a meeting with him 
10 
and to say that he is going to go and they looking to list 
Oakbay Resources and Energy Limited.  And in order to list 
these companies you need to have three independent non-
executive directors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So – ja you explain. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja you will explain. Are you saying the 
call was a sequel to the meeting you had in June 2014 
00:25:02 Mr Tony Gupta? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It had no relation at all with… 
MR PAMENSKY:    No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – but then explain to us how – how 
is he calling you out – it seems to be out of nowhere? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes he is calling me out of nowhere.  
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 23 of 94 
 
This is how you get invited to boards people call you up, 
they come, they know you got expertise and skills and they 
call you up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  So it was like … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes my point is how did they know you? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh I do not know Chair.  That I cannot 
answer you I do not know sorry.  Sorry Advocate I do not 
know how they know about me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  I will just give you a story I do not want 
to mention names but you know when I joined the board of 
ORE there were two members of the board and what they 
actually said to me was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which board now? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Board of ORE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or I used the word Oakbay Resources 
and Energy I rather use the word ORE Chair because I 
have been dealing with this for four years people keep on 
20 
getting confused with the Oakbay Investments which is the 
Gupta ship and on this side.  So I created another affidavit 
to try explain and show you my role and the group.  Sorry I 
lost my train of thought what was your question Sir? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 24 of 94 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think you are dealing with the 
question of receiving this call out of the blue but you 
wanted – I think you wanted to share some… 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh so – so those board members told me 
that they joined the board because I was there.  I did not 
realise what a good name I had in the market at that point 
of time – I really did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You did not what? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Know what a good name I had in the 
market at that point of time.  You know to hear from fellow 
10 
board members they considered coming on because I was 
coming on which is quite impressive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja just – yes just direct the – I mean 
face the Chairperson as you answer. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think let us – let us just get the 
final answer on I think what Mr Seleka is trying to 
establish.  I think what he is suggesting is – is this a 
situation where you were called and invited to join the 
board without really having had any directions of worth 
20 
mentioning with the – with them you know without – without 
really having had any prior interactions of any substance? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  You know as I said last time he called 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 25 of 94 
 
me.  We sat, we had a meeting.  He asked me after what I 
had to consider it – I had to go and speak to my employer 
as well – I am employed and I had to consider my options.  
I then got a subsequent call from the company secretary 
and I duly accepted the appointment.  So I do not – no we 
never had any discussions before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay that is alright.  So Atul Gupta also 
– Mr Atul Gupta also calls you and the conversation leads 
to 
you 
becoming 
an 
elite 
independent 
non-executive 
10 
director in ORE – Oakbay Resources. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As opposed to Oakbay Investments.  Is 
this Oakbay Resources. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As appose to Oakbay Investments.  Is 
this 
Oakbay 
Resources 
the 
very 
company 
that 
was 
assisting Tegeta to acquire OCH? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, Oakbay Resources is an energy.  It 
had nothing to do with the Optimum Coal transaction. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but we know that Oakbay had made 
an offer through Bowman Gilfillan to the Business Rescue 
Practitioners.  I am asking you which Oakbay is this?  Is 
that Oakbay Resources or Oakbay Investments? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I am not sure.  It was definitely 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 26 of 94 
 
not Oakbay Resources.  I do not know which entity in the 
Gupta Group made that offer but I know it was not Oakbay 
Resources and Energy Limited. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then you came to know the other 
Gupta brothers as a result.  Is that Varun Gupta? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Mr Varun Gupta was the Executive 
Director on the board of ORE and Shiva.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you also came to know Mr AJ 
Gupta? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sir.  He was in the building when he 
10 
used to have meetings there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now I am going to go a little bit out of 
sequence because of this issue that you are talking about 
now.  The...  If ORE was not a company involved in Tegeta 
for the acquisition of OCH.  When the matter came to the 
board 
as 
form 
of 
a 
submission 
for 
prepayment 
of 
R 1.68 billion to Tegeta in December 2015.  Why did you 
recuse yourself? 
MR PAMENSKY:   If I may Chair? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR 
PAMENSKY: 
 
 
Very, 
very 
important. 
 
Roughly 
October/November, ORE and Tegeta suggested to the ORE 
Board that we purchase the Brakfontein Coal Mine in 
exchange for shares.  So that was on the 20 t h  of November. 
 
I gave a commitment.  I had to explain to the board 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 27 of 94 
 
that I am not conflicted.  The conflict was very remote.  
The Brakfontein Contract had already been awarded by 
Eskom at that time. 
 
Our 
audit 
was 
done 
by 
the 
Board 
Tender 
Committee because they deal with coal procurement but we 
learnt 
it 
was 
management 
who 
signed 
that 
on 
the 
10 t h of September. 
 
Secondly, I do not sit on the Board Tender 
Committee.  I will not be involved in any coal procurement 
issues.  It will be a very limited occasion where I would be 
10 
at the expense of the other.  Therefore, it is was a 
manageable conflict. 
 
What I committed to the ORE Board that I will 
recuse myself from anything that is related to coal or coal 
procurement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think...  Ja, just keep a distance from 
the mic a little bit.  Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry.  So I would do – I committed to 
the ORE Board that anything that came up that about coal 
or coal procurement, I would recuse myself.   
20 
 
And duly when I first came up on the 8 t h of 
December, I recused myself straight away from all coal and 
coal procurement going forward and anything to do within 
the Eskom environment.  
 
I never received board packs.  I never received 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 28 of 94 
 
anything at all that I could have influenced anything within 
those environments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So that matter, it is a submission 
prepared within Eskom by Eskom and certain Eskom 
executives.   
 
They have prepared a submission for a prepayment 
decision to be made by the board, R 1.68 billion by way of 
a Round-robin to be made at 12:00 noon, 9 December 
2015.   
 
You received the communication via email from 
10 
Ms Suzanne Daniels on the 8 t h of December.  You would 
have received it as well.  And you are saying as a result of 
receipt or that email – not as a result, after receipt of the 
email, you recused yourself because of the matter that had 
to be decided. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I am not sure I am understanding your 
question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   But when the email arrived on the 8 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   It said the pre-purchase of Optimum 
Coal and it was coal related.  So immediately I sent an 
email to the company secretary and to the chairman 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 29 of 94 
 
because that the Eskom conflict rules.  You need to inform 
them.   
 
And I asked them:  Please, I am potentially 
conflicted.  I would like to be recused from all items.  So 
my recusal was based on the ORE Board meeting that I am 
not getting involved that has got anything to do with coal 
or coal procurement at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Have you attached your email to 
your affidavit? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, to my affidavit.  The supplementary 
10 
affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, they are in the supplementary... 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Those emails? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Can we go there? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sure we can.  Chair, just before 
Advocate Seleka starts.  We put a supplementary affidavit 
in just to explain my role and to give context to where 
these mails are coming from. 
20 
 
I think it is important that maybe, with your 
permission, I can maybe explain the Oakbay Investments 
or the whole group to you so that you get a little bit of a 
quick sight.  It will not take me more than five minutes and 
I think it will put a little bit of perspective to you. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 30 of 94 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Let us give you that chance. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Thank you, Chair.  If I may ask?  Could 
you go to page 700 in the Eskom Bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got that. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So Chair, on your right hand side is 
Oakbay Investments ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you said Eskom Bundle, you mean 
the bundle we are currently using?  I think you do because 
I think the page you have in front of you is the page I have. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So Chair, on the right hand side is 
Oakbay Investments and all its groups.  One of them, we 
put down there is obviously Tegeta and Optimum.   
 
I have never been a director of any of those 
companies, nor have I had any insight into any of the 
affairs of those companies.  The role I played is on the left.   
 
So Oakbay Resources and Energy Limited and if 
20 
one asset should ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  This shows the position as 
at when?  It could not be in 2014? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, no.  I would propose as – call it 
2016, sometime in the year 2016. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 31 of 94 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Perfect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So Chair, as you know, to list on the 
Johannesburg 
Stock 
Exchange, 
you 
need 
three 
independent non-executive directors as well as a financial 
director. 
 
So we listed on the 28 t h of November 2014, ORE 
listed.  Its only assets that it had was Shiva Uranium.  That 
changed Chair on the 29 t h of February when the purchase a 
10 
Brakfontein asset in exchange for shares.  So those are 
the only assets that are there. 
 
So that is the Oakbay Group of companies.  I sat 
on the left.  I had nothing to do with any of the companies 
on the right.  I had no insight, no nothing.  It is in the 
affidavit.   
 
So I think that just gives you a bit of clarity that I 
would not have seen what was going in Tegeta, Optimum of 
Oakbay Investments and their group of companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Oakbay Investments was the 
20 
majority shareholders in ORE? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, it was an 80% shareholder and 20% 
was owned by public shareholders also included in the 
RDC(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  And Shiva was the...  Oh, no ORE 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 32 of 94 
 
was the majority shareholder in Shiva? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And Tegeta was a minority 
shareholder in Shiva.  Is that right? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   It became a minority shareholder.  We 
have 
no 
duties, 
we 
have 
no 
relationships 
with 
shareholders, there are no obligations to shareholders.  So 
they become clearly a shareholder.  They have no board 
10 
representation or no board seats but they become a 19% 
shareholders in Shiva. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So in context with that email...   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Can I start? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but I want us to go to the email. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, I am going to go to the emails now.  
20 
So I am just putting in context. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MR 
PAMENSKY: 
 
 
Now 
Chair, 
roughly 
in 
October/November, 
Nazeem 
Howa 
is 
the 
CEO 
...[intervenes]  
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 33 of 94 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is in 2016? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, this would be October/November 
2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   He approached the ORE Board and he 
wanted to make a Group Investment Committee which 
would monitor investments, corporate governance and all 
those elements.  I was very keen to serve on that board, 
that is my expertise.   
10 
 
So the emails I am going to bring into context, that 
Oakbay 
Investments 
was 
created 
and 
Investment 
Committee 
for 
the 
Oakbay 
Investments 
Group 
which 
ultimately did not happen.  It fizzled away end of January 
and with due respect, thank God.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
MR PAMENSKY:   Thank God.  Anyway ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why do you say that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Because Chair we had no idea what was 
going on and what is coming out of this Commission, is a – 
20 
I just would rather not just comment, you know?   
 
Because I am sure that if there was an Investment 
Committee these things would also have been hidden from 
us completely because you do not know what is going on 
behind the scenes, you know.  
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 34 of 94 
 
 
So I just want to put me in – while we are sitting 
here and discussing this, I am putting context into my 
emails and I am not involved in the Gupta affairs or their 
business and that is what I am here to explain to you.   
 
I have lived with these emails for years.  I am 
happy to explain.  Sorry, I am hoping I am not talking too 
much. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, are you getting permission to stop 
you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your counsel’s laughs gives me the 
10 
impression what he thinks about that. [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR PAMENSKY:   My apologies.  So in connection with 
those emails.  It is in context of the Oakbay Investments 
Committee that was going to be formed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So Mr Nazeem Howa – you also 
knew – you and him knew each other? 
MR PAMENSKY:   On a professional relationship, he was 
the Chief Executive of the holding company. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Of Oakbay Investments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Investments.  Oh, that is how you 
came to know him.  Ja, but let us go to the emails then. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the email, the first one?  I see 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 35 of 94 
 
one on page 717. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the email – and tell us how we 
should read them?  Where do we start? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I think you would start on Eskom 
717 and it would say:  Hi, Chair.  Above that seems to be 
the Gupta leaks that have gone out.  It seems to show that 
Mr Atul Gupta then forwarded this onto others. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So what we have then.  If I may 
identify the email?  It is an email from yourself, Mark 
10 
Pamensky.  The email is there, markpam2@mac.com.  It is 
dated November...  22 November 2015 at 07:40 p.m.   
 
It is an email to Atul at ANN7.com.   
MR PAMENSKY:   And CC’d Varum Gupta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is right.   
MR PAMENSKY:   Because these are in relation to... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now I am pausing because I 
remember 
ANN7 
being 
mentioned 
yesterday, 
that 
Ms Naidoo said she had attended – a what?  I think it was 
breakfast or whatever occasion, function it was with her 
20 
husband which was an ANN7 occasion when Mr Salim Essa 
was present.  Have you been invited to such occasions? 
MR PAMENSKY:   I have been invited to certain occasions 
but I cannot recall that one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 36 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   It was the SATI Awards that you get 
invited to, that big function that they have for the year-end 
awards. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Were you invited to the Sun City 
wedding? 
MR PAMENSKY:   [No audible reply] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Sun City wedding, were you 
invited? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, I was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but that is before 2014. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh, no.  Sorry Chair.  I was not invited.  
Blue Label Telecoms was invited to attend the wedding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who was invited? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Blue Label Telecoms. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I do not know why the invitation came.  I 
took the invitation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You took it? 
MR PAMENSKY:   I took it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   And I went because I am a single, 
everyone else is married. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR PAMENSKY:   I took it and went to Sun City for the two 
days.  I never met the Gupta’s or anything there but I went. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 37 of 94 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was 2013, is it not? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is before 2014. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes.  I have never met them.  I was 
invited to the wedding and I went – or I was not invited, 
Blue Label was invited to the wedding and I took the 
invitation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you suggesting they just sent an 
10 
invitation to a company that they had nothing to do with it? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes! 
CHAIRPERSON:   That they did not know anything about? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes!  It came.  It was like okay.  What I 
know was:  Let us okay.  I will go anyway.  It is a free 
weekend. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Ja, that is.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]  Had the CEO agree to you 
taking the invitation? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The CEO? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not him, but you? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, they are all married, as I said to 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 38 of 94 
 
you.  So they did not want to go.  So I was happy to go 
because it was a free weekend. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Yes.  No, the wedding was 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but Mr Pamensky are you saying.  
You went to the wedding and you never met the Gupta’s? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is exactly what I am saying Chair.  
That is exactly what I am telling you.  I never met the 
Gupta’s there.  There were hundreds of people 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you bring a present for the couple 
10 
that was getting married? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, we did.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, it just sound strange that they 
would send an invitation to a company that they had never 
interactions with.   
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, from my mindset, we saw the 
invitation coming in.  It was a massive box.  We said:  
20 
Well, let us see what this is.  We opened it.  Oh, it is a 
Gupta wedding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR PAMENSKY:   So we came. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said to the CEO:  I will go.  Do not 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 39 of 94 
 
go. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, no, no.  We all – we, the CEO sit in 
the same office at Blue Label together.  So it came in.  I 
said:  Oh, it is a free weekend.  But I will go.  He said ja.  
As simple as that Chair.  It was nothing to it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but I think what the Chair is 
saying.  It is surprising that they would sent an invite to a 
company they do not know, that has nothing to do with 
them.   
MR PAMENSKY:   Correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So we are trying to establish what 
is the link, what is the connection? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I cannot answer you on that.  I 
was invited or Blue Label was invited and I was happy to 
go. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because some of us were not invited 
and we had nothing to do with the Gupta’s.  I mean, it 
could have also come to chambers and say:  Hey, Mr 
Jonathan Blou you are invited.   
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I cannot answer you that.  I do 
20 
not know.  I do not know what they said.  I...  Blue Label 
was invited and I attended it and I did not meet them there 
Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.   
ADV BLOU:   Mr Seleka, you do not know that I was not 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 40 of 94 
 
invited. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  [laughs] 
ADV BLOU:   But I will place it on record that Johnny Blou 
was not invited.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just repeat what you have 
just said. 
ADV BLOU:   He...  This is silly.  Mr Seleka said but I was 
not invited, right?  And out of the blue, he mentioned me, 
saying you were invited.  That never happened.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV BLOU:   I am confirming that it never happened.  
Chair, 
but 
can 
I 
just 
say 
this? 
 And 
I 
wonder 
if 
Mr Pamensky should not be out? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you would know better in terms of 
what you want to say. 
ADV BLOU:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So we can excuse him for a few minutes 
if you ...[intervenes]  
ADV BLOU:   Perhaps I will address you on something on 
20 
the end and he can leave.  But I just want to say Chair that 
– and I do not want to place anything on Mr Seleka 
yourself but I think you will find that perhaps – and this is 
a position on my part because I do not – but I do not know 
how many people were invited to that wedding.  I cannot 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 41 of 94 
 
recall the number.   
 
But this is a – it seems to me to be a company, at 
least in those days, that would reach out to anybody with 
whom it might have – think might have influenced anywhere 
whether they have dealt with them or not but I am going to 
put in my own words.   
 
In other words, for the proposition to be correct, 
one had to look at all the invitees and see whether or not 
they had been or not.  That is all I am saying, on the 
probabilities.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BLOU:   That is all I am saying.  I do not know about 
it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV BLOU:   I am just saying, it might be worth of an 
inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  Yes, let us 
continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Pamensky, let us 
go to the emails. 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The email then reads:  Meeting of even 
date:  “Hi Chair.”  So you are addressing Mr Atul Gupta? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says: 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 42 of 94 
 
“Thank you for the conversation today.  I will 
action all the items and ensure that they are 
completed. 
I will send an email to Terry regarding the lead 
independent role and that you as chairman has 
decided to take a more conservative approach 
and would like to appoint him. 
This is the correct business decision for ORE. 
We will have the Shiva Uranium Board sorted 
out by Tuesday. 
10 
This will allow us to vote on the Tegeta 
acquisition with no related parties. 
I would like to conclude this approval urgently 
so ORE and Shiva Uranium can implement the 
transaction. 
In terms of the Investment Committee, I am 
available to start straight away as I am at the 
tail end of the main acquisition of Optimum 
Coal. 
Please ensure that a condition precedent is 
20 
that 
the 
R 2 billion 
plan 
from 
Eskom 
is 
withdrawn or it becomes the seller ’s problem. 
I am happy to get involved to assist with this 
acquisition 
and 
monthly 
monitoring 
and 
analysing of all investments from today. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 43 of 94 
 
I can meet anyone you require. 
If you need me in Indian or Dubai to discuss, I 
will meet you there. 
Travel safe and look forward to seeing you 
soon. 
Once again, thank you for today.” 
 
Now 
it 
is 
that 
paragraph, 
the 
penultimate 
paragraph we would like to concentrate on for now.  In that 
penultimate paragraph, can you explain to the Chairperson 
what are you talking about there with Mr Atul Gupta? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry, Mr Seleka.  I am not sure what 
you are asking.  Are you asking me for the paragraph or 
are you asking me for the sentence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the penultimate paragraph. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Travel safe? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one in terms of investments 
...[intervenes]  
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh, yes Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair.  As I have said to you.  
20 
Mr Nazeem Howa approached us in October/November.  As 
I said to you...  So he approached us, that is the 
Investment Committee. 
 
As I said to you, on the 20 t h of November, ORE 
agreed to purchase the assets in exchange for shares in 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 44 of 94 
 
Tegeta with the Brakfontein contract. 
 
Mr Gupta was the Chairman of ORE.  He did not 
attend the meeting.  I then met him two days afterwards on 
the 20 t h to appraise him of those events.   
 
The first event, as you can see, is Mr Terry would 
be Lead Independent.  I felt that the Lead Independent of 
ORE should have no relationship with Eskom because I 
was the Lead Independent.   
 
In terms of the Shiva transaction, the Shiva Board 
had to approve.  Everybody was a related party on the 
10 
Shiva Board.  So I had to go onto the Shiva Board.  So 
those are the two elements. 
 
Now in terms of the Investment Committee.  That 
was the Investment Committee to come up.  That is why I 
stated that point. 
 
Second of all.  I am coming to the tail end.  Oh, 
sorry.  We just jumped back.  So met Mr Gupta on the 22 n d.  
And Mr Gupta...  I filled him in on those two points.  And 
he said to me at that meeting for the first time that they 
are looking to buy OCM and the teams are in due diligence. 
20 
 
I said to Mr Gupta:  Is it ORE?  Because I did not 
see it on the agenda.  And he said to me:  No, it is not 
ORE.  And that was the end of our discussion. 
 
Hence, after our meeting I then wrote the email on 
what our discussions are. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 45 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry Mr Pamensky.  Which Mr Gupta 
told you that they are buying OCH? 
MR PAMENSKY:   OCM, it is Optimum Coal Mine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Mr Atul Gupta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Did he tell you that at the 
meeting? 
MR PAMENSKY:   He told me at the meeting of the 20 t h. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, the 20 t h. 
MR PAMENSKY:   22 n d, when I went to fill him in.  He did 
not come to the board meeting.  I needed to appraise him 
on what went on.   
 
It is normal for a chairman without chairing the 
meeting.   So it is normal for a chair to go and fill in the 
chairman if he did not attend that meeting. 
 
And it was at that meeting, he first said to me, 
Mr Atul Gupta, that they are looking to buy Optimum Coal 
and the teams are in due diligence. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So when he says:  We are 
looking 
to 
buy 
OCM. 
 
That 
is 
on 
the 
22 n d  of November 2015.  Was he referring to ORE? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, I asked him specifically when he 
said we. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 46 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I said:  Mr Gupta, it was not on the 
agenda of ORE.  And he said to me it is not ORE who is 
purchasing it.  That was the end of our conversation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But I wonder whether it makes a 
difference, whether it is ORE or ORI of the investment or of 
the resources because they are inter-related companies. 
MR PAMENSKY:   First of all they are not inter-related 
companies.  They are standalone companies. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   ORE is listed on the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
MR PAMENSKY:   All our transactions are at arm’s length 
with any company even its related party.  So these are 
arm’s length transactions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:   The difference is Chair if it was ORE, 
the difference is I sit on the Board of ORE and there will be 
different JSE and implications on that by me sitting on the 
20 
Board of ORE. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but they are related entities, as 
you say, and you find the same people or some of the same 
people in the same entities.  The Gupta brothers would 
have been in the same entities. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 47 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   I cannot comment on that but the 
chairman was an ORE. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   And Mr Varun Gupta was an ORE. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I am not sure the other vehicles that – 
or companies that they were in but they were definitely 
directors of other companies.  I am not sure which ones. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So you are not given a direct 
answer as to which of the Gupta entities has decided to 
10 
purchase OCM? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No.  He just said to me it is not...  I 
asked him specifically is it ORE because it was not on the 
agenda and he said no it was not ORE. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, okay.  So let us go back to the 
email, that paragraph.   
“In terms of the Investment Committee, I am 
available to start straight away...”  
 
Which Investment Committee is that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, this is the one I explained to you 
20 
when Mr Nazeem Howa suggested that we form this 
Investment Committee for the holding company to oversee 
invest and monitoring investments, governance.  So this 
would be that committee because it is specifically an 
acquisition. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 48 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And Mr Nazeem Howa is the...  
Did you say he is the CEO of Oakbay Investments? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that would have meant you 
are dealing with people at – both in Oakbay Investments 
level and Oakbay Resources level? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And then the paragraph 
continues: 
“...as I am at the tail end of the main 
10 
acquisition of Optimum Coal. 
Please ensure that a condition precedent is 
that 
the 
R 2 billion 
plan 
from 
Eskom 
is 
withdrawn 
or 
it 
becomes 
the 
seller ’s 
problem...” 
 
What are you talking about there? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, first of all.  I am available to start 
straight away, means that I have not been involved in this 
transaction Chair, number one.  Because it is the first time 
I have heard of it, I am coming in at the tail end.  So I am 
20 
not involved in this.   
 
In appearing for the Commission, on the 11 t h of 
November which is 12-days before, I picked up from 
Glencore’s affidavit that Oakbay Investments had signed a 
terms sheet already with Optimum Coal.  If I am correct. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 49 of 94 
 
 
So just...  No, I think it read the terms of the 
penalty.  So I am just not involved.  So my comment there 
is a very simple comment. 
 
In terms of the condition precedent, I do not 
believe that this – I do not believe that the purchaser 
should acquire the entity with that penalty.   
 
In other words, to not detract from the value is that 
the purchaser shall ensure Chair that is a condition 
precedent for this deal to go through that the file is either 
withdrawn and the miner tender withdrawn.  I will get to it 
10 
in a minute.  Otherwise it becomes there problem.   
 
So in terms of the transaction, I wanted the 
penalty to come to an end in terms of this transaction.  So 
I suggested that the seller procure either the settlement of 
the farm or it takes on it within its balance sheet purely to 
ensure that we do not detract from an underlying entity of 
OCM.  So those were my words. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay let us start to contextualise this 
so that we understand exactly what you are talking about.  
I think – what I wish to say to you is this.  Just give the 
20 
Chairperson the facts as they happen.  And I will put this 
to you so that I see whether we are talking the same thing 
in this regard. 
 
Eskom has a contract with OCM.  It is a coal supply 
contract.  This contract, at least with OCM dates back to 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 50 of 94 
 
2012 but it is a contract that has been ongoing for quite 
some time.  Glencore took over from the previous owner.  
 
In the process of OCM having this contract with 
Eskom and particularly in 2014/2015, there is an issue 
about penalties that Eskom raises with OCM in the region 
of R2.1 billion, R2.17 billion and the penalties are said to 
arise from OCM not supplying coal with is up to spec.  Is 
that the penalty you are talking about? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is the penalty I am talking about, 
Chair. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay.  Now that penalty was 
sought to be enforced against OCM by Mr Molefe and Mr 
Koko acting on behalf of Eskom.  I add that so that it does 
not appear – it does not get to be interpreted as being in 
their personal capacity.  So the penalty is sought to be 
enforced against OCM and particularly at a time when 
Oakbay/Tegeta is also, on the other hand, seeking to 
acquire OCM.  
 
It was clear on the part of Eskom that whoever 
acquires OCM will take that liability as well.  So when your 
20 
write here: 
“In November 2015…” 
You would have known about that liability or the penalty, 
you would have known that Eskom’s position is that 
whoever acquires OCM is the one taking that liability and 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 51 of 94 
 
…[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry, can I correct you there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, please. 
MR 
PAMENSKY: 
 As 
you 
know, 
the 
Optimum 
Coal 
transaction never came to the board.  What I did know was 
that in the press that I read in August that Eskom was 
fanatical that Mr Molefe said that we will collect this fine 
because why can we not collect from Soweto or the 
municipalities.  So that is all I knew from the press, Chair.   
 
I had no idea, was your second point, where you 
10 
are saying that they were enforcing it, I would not know 
that.  My mindset was at the time that Eskom was very 
vocal that it will collect its money. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so you knew from the press, from 
the media that Eskom’s view was that whoever takes over 
OCM will be also taking that liability? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No.  What I am saying was Eskom was 
very vocal in August when the first time I picked up that 
there was this penalty and this arbitration came out in the 
press and that is when I asked Mr Molefe what is going on.  
20 
So I knew at that time in Eskom’s head we are going to 
collect this money because Brian said we are going to 
collect this money.  I knew nothing about new purchasers 
or anything, all I knew on that day, that Eskom was very 
vocal that it will collect its money. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 52 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  No, I understand what you are 
saying.  Whether you came to know through Mr Molefe or 
you came to know through what you say did not happen, a 
discussion in the board, it is neither here nor there.  I think 
the fact of the matter is when you write this email in 
November you had knowledge of Eskom’s position that 
whoever takes – or acquires OCM will also be liable for 
that penalty. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So when you are writing then 
10 
…[intervenes] 
MR BLOU:   Sorry, Chair.  Mr Seleka has put a compound 
question twice, that he knew about the claim and that he 
knew about who would assume liability for the claim as 
between buyer and seller and he is – it is a compound 
question been put twice and Mr Pamensky has now given 
an answer seems to me he does not answer the question.  
Can it put separately? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka, I think the request is if 
you could put the question separately because you may 
20 
have put them both at the same time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, I – if I understand my learned 
friend, it is I was saying whether he came to know it from 
Mr Molefe or whether he came to know it through board 
discussions, which he says it does not happen.  Is that the 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 53 of 94 
 
one? 
MR BLOU:   Sorry, the line of questioning started that he 
knew about the fact that there was a penalty that Eskom 
was claiming.  In the same question, when he started, he 
said and he knew that it would be the responsibility of the 
buyer.  In other words, whichever – who the acquiring 
entity was, namely Oakbay Investments, whoever was 
buying would assume the penalty.  You put that to him as a 
compound proposition. They are not the same question.  
He says he knew about the transaction from the press.  
10 
Whether he knew about the fact that the purchaser that 
had already been agreed in Eskom that the purchasers and 
who I believe is a separate question that he must answer 
separately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you might just want to put them 
one by one before you put the final proposition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may have been saying he knew 
about this and that because you know from his evidence 
that he does but you might wish to – you might wish to 
20 
confirm to say you knew this or you did not know this, you 
not know that and then maybe then once those have been 
confirmed, one way or another, you might wish to put the 
proposition that you wanted to put. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, no, Chair, I thought it was 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 54 of 94 
 
quite clear to the witness so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe it was, I may have missed 
something but… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe what you can do is repeat 
what you said to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And repeat what his answer was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then let us take it from there. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I think on the one hand, Mr 
Pamensky – well, my question really was that prior to 
writing this email you would have known Eskom’s position 
that 
whoever 
acquires 
OCM 
will 
also 
take 
up 
the 
responsibility in respect of the penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us get him to confirm he knew that. 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, I do not agree with that, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am just asking a question. 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh.  No, I had no idea what Eskom’s 
position was in connection with a transaction that is going 
to purchase that entity, I do not know.  What I knew 
Eskom’s position was, was from the press that they wanted 
to collect their money.  So Eskom was adamant in its head 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 55 of 94 
 
that it wanted to collect its money.  That is what I knew. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so what you are saying then is 
you did not know that Eskom’s position was whoever takes 
OCM will also be responsible for the liability.  That one you 
did not know. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So did you know about 
Pembani’s offer to acquire OCM? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not know that.  So you did not 
10 
know that the collapse of that offer was on the very basis 
that Pembani was told if you take OCM you also take the 
responsibility for the 2.1 billion.  You did not know that. 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, I am not involved in that transaction, 
do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So if you did not know that, help 
us understand your sentence here where you write to Mr 
Atul Gupta and you say make – ja, please ensure that a 
condition precedent is that the R2 billion from Eskom is 
withdrawn or it becomes the seller ’s problem.  Let us 
20 
understand why do you write along those lines? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair, maybe the word withdrawn is the 
correct thing, my attorneys tell me that the word withdrawn 
means for no value, it was never my intention at all.  My 
intention was very simple, that the seller should either take 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 56 of 94 
 
on the liability and settle it or it becomes their problem.  In 
other words, it comes on their balance sheet .   
So, in other words, the acquiring should not take on 
this liability as it would detract from the value.  As a simple 
term to tell you, if I am purchasing your house, there is a 
buyer and a seller, the seller had the relationship with the 
bank.  It does not make sense to purchase the house with 
the liability, so the seller must go and settle or procure that 
liability is paid.  So that was the context of my exact 
meaning here, sir. 
10 
And just to reiterate, sir, I just have to say this.  It 
was impossible that my mind could have the mindset that it 
could have been for nil value.  First of all, it did not cross 
my mind. 
Secondly, Eskom was extremely vocal.  When Mr 
Brian Molefe’s newspaper article is out, was there, that 
they were always going to collect.  So it never crossed my 
mind and I always knew that Glencore had a guarantee, so 
Glencore – Glencore – Eskom had a guarantee from 
Glencore and they were always going to get paid.  Again, 
20 
who was going to bear the risk?  I said that should be the 
seller, should bear that risk, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:  Mr Seleka, sorry, just Mr Seleka, so in 
order for this transaction to occur, I am saying to the 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 57 of 94 
 
purchaser do not buy this asset unless the seller resolves 
those two issues and if he does not, do not take on this 
transaction because I do not believe it takes the underlying 
value.  But also, Chair, it is a very high level comment, you 
know, it is on here, I am just given a comment here and 
you can see it is all dealt with before, so it is not intended 
for that meaning at all and I am not involved in Eskom that 
does board tender committees, that does penalties and all 
that, fine.  I sat here last time and I heard you guys.  I left 
Eskom in November 2016.  This penalty was resolved post 
10 
my event, just for the record.  So I had no involvement, not 
nothing.  Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is alright.  Okay, I have 
difficulty if you say your attorneys have told you what 
withdrawn mean there because when you were writing the 
email I do not suppose for one moment that they would 
have been there with you helping you to draft this email. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct, Mr Seleka.  My mind – 
withdrawal does not mean for no value in my mind.  
Withdrawal means that they take on that liability. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, no, I am not fighting with you. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am just pointing out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let me ask this question.  Is the 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 58 of 94 
 
position not that when you wrote this letter your knowledge 
as far as this R2 billion claim by Eskom was concerned 
was that Eskom wanted the OCM to pay this amount and 
therefore it is reasonable to think that if there are 
negotiations for sale, this issue would arise, namely the R2 
billion claim and therefore you were concerned that the 
purchaser, as far as you are concerned, should under no 
circumstances enter into a deal where this R2 billion would 
be the purchaser ’s problem. 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct, Chair.  Normally like a 
10 
house bond, Chair.  If you go and buy a house and you are 
a purchaser, you tell the homeowner you go and settle your 
liability, I do not want to take on your house with that 
liability, it does not make financial sense to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did you talk along those lines 
with your board members, your fellow board members at 
Eskom? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, Chair, this was a commercial 
transaction between the buyer and seller, this had nothing 
20 
to do with Eskom, my comment in that sense.  And no, I 
never discussed any of my conversations, I never shared 
anything out of the boardroom, so I never discuss any of 
these comments with any of my Eskom board members. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, sure.  
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 59 of 94 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I follow with – please do not forget 
your question, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How had you acquired the knowledge of 
this claim by Eskom? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Chair, I gained my knowledge roughly in 
August 2015 when it was in the press.  You know, there 
was all the press going around that Glencore and Eskom 
are having this fight.  So that is when I first learnt.  
What occurred after that was, there was a board 
10 
meeting set in September where I wanted to ask Mr Molefe 
and we got an email to say it is cancelled and in my email 
back to them, say thank you, but I have been reading in 
the press in the press and all of that, have we got a 
problem with our coal, is everything okay?   
So I gained my knowledge from there.  That is 
where I gained my knowledge, it was not from Eskom, it 
was never discussed with us at Eskom as you hear, so that 
is where I gained my knowledge from, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that answer to the effect that you 
20 
gained your knowledge particularly from the press but also 
partly from your interaction with Mr Molefe via email? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, no, no, no one responded to my 
email, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 60 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:  So I will tell you – if you – do you want 
me to tell the story what happened? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not necessarily. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Okay.  It is in the pack. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that you acquired the 
knowledge the press full stop? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No but you did say also you spoke to 
Mr Molefe.  
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes, I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And he also told you – what did 
he say to you? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, Mr Molefe informed me that this deal 
was not in the best interests of Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And it was unaffordable.  And from that 
perspective they could not agree on price or quantity.  That 
is all he told me. 
 
The second thing he told me, I said are we all okay 
20 
for coal?  He said we are all okay for coal.  I said to him I 
see there is penalty, he says yes I raised the penalty 
because 
it 
would 
prescribe. 
 
And 
that 
was 
our 
conversation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, in your answer I hope the 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 61 of 94 
 
question still has the force it requires.  You were saying 
the transaction has nothing to do with Eskom, you did not 
discuss this matter with your fellow board members but the 
penalty had everything to do with Eskom.  It was an Eskom 
matter and it is in that context that I am asking you 
whether this issue of the penalty, which you were raising 
here, did you discuss it with your fellow board members or 
even the executive, I might add, in Eskom, like Brian 
Molefe, Mr Brian Molefe, to say well look, this is my view 
on this matter. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well… 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry, Mr Seleka, why would I have – 
sorry, Chair, also, why would I have discussed my view 
with the management of Eskom.  This was a – just sorry, 
this was a transaction between a buyer and seller and I am 
not telling Eskom to withdraw its claim, I am telling that the 
buyer must pay Eskom and resolve it, end of story.  I am 
missing your question maybe, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am only asking you to explain to 
20 
the Chairperson whether the same conversation you have 
here …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   …you would have had within Eskom. 
MR PAMENSKY:  No. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 62 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, because – I mean at that stage 
Eskom is adamant that OCM must pay this penalty, this 
2.17 billion penalty and you say you had left – what 
happens ultimately with this penalty, is that it gets to be 
recalculated on the basis that there were errors in the 
calculation.  Partly errors in the calculation but also that 
there is a period which had already been paid, so we are 
not going to charge for that period.   
 
And it gets riddled down to what becomes a payable 
amount, some R255 million.  Even of that R255 million, 
10 
Tegeta does not pay the full amount, it pays only R171 
million and then it goes into business rescue. 
 
But when you read the affidavit from CDH, the 
attorneys for Eskom at the time, they had already given 
Eskom advice that you will face challenges in your claim.  
Did you know about that? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, completely unaware, Chair, nothing 
to do with Optimum Coal or any coal after I recused myself 
came forward to me.  So I was not involved, I recused 
myself and everything, I left in December 2016.  I 
20 
understand that in December from Ms Daniels’ affidavit is 
when she started engaging in arbitration and all of that.  I 
was not involved, I had left Eskom.  And again, it never 
came to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so just finally on your use of the 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 63 of 94 
 
words: 
“Please ensure a condition precedent that the claim 
is withdrawn.” 
Just from your explanation, what did you mean by that? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Clearly that a condition precedent must 
be in terms of that fine, it is settled.  So, in other words, 
that Glencore, which is the seller entity, must settle their 
claim.  If it does not settle their claim it must take it on its 
balance sheet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but the settle is the subsequent 
10 
sentence.  There is first withdrawn, so I want your 
explanation of withdrawn. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes, R2 billion penalty must be settled.  
If it is not settled, then they must take it on their balance 
sheet .  So if Glencore does not settle Eskom their money 
or 
goes 
to 
arbitration 
 
- 
said 
the 
context, 
sorry, 
withdrawal… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Withdrawal is said to me in the context of 
an arbitration, Chair.  I am not a lawyer, Chair, but in terms 
20 
of an arbitration, in my mind it is settled, dismissed or 
closed out or resolved.  So, as I said was, in terms of this 
arbitration we all knew as the seller who is a party to the 
arbitration, he is the person, he must go and settle the 
matter of arbitration.  What does settle mean?  I do not 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 64 of 94 
 
know, get to a deal, talk about it, they are involved, I do 
not know what it involves but it is just a very high level 
contact that they must go and settle this matter in 
arbitration or should I say resolve this matter and then 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, I understand your explanation 
there insofar as it relates to: 
“…or it becomes the seller ’s problem.” 
10 
So let me say to you so that you can come and then on my 
proposition to you.  So this other one says it becomes the 
seller ’s problem.  So the seller will have the problem, 
whatever they do, either settlement or pay it, because that 
is what it means there, but when you say withdrawn, only 
Eskom can withdraw that claim, the seller cannot because 
it is the liability of the – the seller is the debtor.  
 And this is what I want to say to you so you can 
comment.  What you mean there is that Eskom should 
withdraw their claim so that even the buyer is not liable for 
20 
that liability.  Is that a fair comment? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is definitely not my mindset was 
thinking at all.  First of all, I am not involved in these 
things, I cannot influence.  My comment was very simple, 
that the seller must settle this liability.  I never ever 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 65 of 94 
 
suggested that Eskom should withdraw the settlement, it 
never crossed my mind, Eskom is not a party to this 
negotiation and I do not have the authority to speak on 
Eskom’s behalf and I do not get involved in that, Chair, it 
sits in board tender, so it is not my place to say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I just want to indicate we are 
at seven minutes past eleven. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of pacing yourself. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the rest of your questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair, thank you, Chair, I 
am also keeping my eye on the clock.  Ja, but you are 
saying you are not involved in this but your sentence 
carries on, the paragraph carries on to say: 
“I am happy to get involved to assist with this 
acquisition and monthly monitoring, analysing of all 
investments from today.  I can meet anyone you 
require.  If you need me in India, Dubai to discuss, I 
will meet you there.” 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes, Chair, I am happy to get involved in 
terms of the investment committee to get involved in this 
transaction, to understand it and everything, maybe there 
is more information they want to give me.  This is a – this 
must be a huge acquisition for any company that is coming 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 66 of 94 
 
in, so I was happy to get involved and assist in that sense, 
my corporate finance skills. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Take us through …[intervenes] 
MR BLOU:   Sorry, Chair.  No, just in fairness, just to 
speed things along.  In fairness to the witness and I just 
point out, Mr Seleka, the previous statement that he was 
not involved and could not become involved related to his 
position at Eskom, so it is not fair to say that there is 
contradiction in the next sentence.  He can just ask the 
witness to explain.  But anyway, the witness has done it.  
10 
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think he does the witness has 
explained, Chair. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes.  Sorry, Mr Seleka, if you are asking 
me that I could assist internally within Eskom and get this 
withdrawn, resolved, whatever, no, it does not involve me, 
I does not sit in my committees, it sits in board tender.  
Remember, this is a huge public outcry that has happened 
in August, you know, it is a big thing. 
20 
 
And second of all – well, I thought, but there is all 
red tape within Eskom, there is all internal controls, there 
is procedures, as all your witnesses have told you, you 
have got to go up and you have got to prepare the 
documents.  So it was never in my mind that – or could I 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 67 of 94 
 
ever assist – I could never assist any of the Guptas to get 
that fine withdrawn, was never my wording.  If that is what 
you are asking, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, well, I put a statement to you just 
to comment on. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, that was never my intention, I was 
involved in the investment committee to be formed, I would 
assist with that perspective. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let us go to the next email, the 
other email. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes.  So, Chair, this other email comes.  
It was publicly announced, this transaction.  So again, I am 
not involved in this transaction, I never have been.  What I 
gained was from the press.  Mr Gupta never replied to any 
emails except this one.   
 
There is nothing untoward about me congratulating 
him, I strongly believed that this group was growing a huge 
resource company.  You had us who had the gold and 
20 
uranium 
we 
just 
purchased 
in 
Brakfontein, 
they 
are 
purchasing Optimum Coal, then I think this group is going 
to be a huge resource group.  I do not know what is going 
on in there, so I am sending a congratulation email to him 
based on what I saw in the press. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 68 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and let us see that congratulation. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Let us go there. 
MR BLOU:   No, Mr Pamensky, please, just then just wait 
for the question. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the email reads – is that on 
page 718?  Eskom bundle 17.  I believe Mr Pamensky it is 
the bottom one, hey? 
MR PAMENSKY:  That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On 10 December 2015 at 22.32, it is 
from yourself.  It is an email to who?  It is no apparent 
here. 
MR PAMENSKY:  It would the Chairman, Mr Atul Gupta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Say: 
Hi Chair, congratulations.” 
The Chairman of…? 
MR PAMENSKY:  I am saying Chair, Hi, it is the Chair of 
ORE. He is ORE’s Chairman. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
I 
see. 
 
Okay, 
so 
you 
are 
20 
communicating with him in his capacity as the Chairperson 
of ORE. 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, I am emailing him – Chair, is how 
you would respect him.  I am emailing him in general to 
congratulate on an acquisition, I am not congratulating him 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 69 of 94 
 
as the Chair of ORE. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  No, no, I understand that.  But 
did you understand my question?  Are you communicating 
with him in his capacity as Chairperson of ORE? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, Chair, I am …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Generally. 
MR PAMENSKY:  I am giving him a general here to wish 
him congratulations. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, thanks.  You say: 
 
“Hi Chair, congratulations, Mazel tov.” 
10 
That is congratulations, is it not? 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes, it is Jewish word for mazel tov, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Yes, sorry, Mr Seleka, I did not put up my 
hands like you thought, sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you did not. 
MR PAMENSKY:  There was no board meeting, I am 
sending the email, I know nothing is wrong, I do not yes, 
yes, I really think it is a - but let us go, sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  
20 
“It is on a brilliant and well-thought out, planned 
and strategise that position of the Optimum Group 
of Companies.  Well done, I am proud of you all.” 
That where it sounds like you are putting your fist in the air 
there.       
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 70 of 94 
 
“This is only the beginning of the resources group 
growth and many more to come into play.” 
So this is very deal with are talking about, Tegeta acquiring 
OCM and – well, ultimately it became OCH that they 
acquired.  And you are congratulating him for that, this is 
on the 10 December 2015.  That is the same date that they 
signed the agreement which had suspensive conditions.  
So you knew about that. 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, what I knew was from the press.  I 
knew nothing, everything I gained was from the press. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what did you know from the press? 
MR PAMENSKY:  The press said that they have one a 
transaction, I think it was the business rescue practitioners 
put out a press release, so that is what I knew from it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you did not know from Mr Atul 
himself? 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, no one informed me, no one replied 
to my emails, I was not involved, I have never been 
involved in this transaction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I …[intervenes] 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:  Fortunately not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Yes, I – so you – the BTC 659 
prepayment you were not involved as well …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, I was not involved. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not serve on BTC. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 71 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:  No, as I said to you before, I also 
recused myself with coal or coal procurement-related. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, no, but I am saying you did not 
serve on …[intervenes] 
MR PAMENSKY:  Oh, I never served on BTC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:  And I was unaware of it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  That is fine, so that is – Chair, I 
am trying to finalise this.  So you know from the fact – 
well, I do not know whether you know, but the evidence 
10 
that has cropped up from the Public Protector, from the 
parliamentary portfolio committee and here before the 
Commission that decisions that were being made by Eskom 
and in particular in regard to the submissions that were 
made to the board, one to the board and the other to the 
BTC for these prepayments that were meant to go to 
Tegeta seem to have been made in order to assist Tegeta 
in acquiring OCH, OCM.  I accept that you did not take part 
in the decision-making in December 2015, explain to you 
that the evidence as it emerges appears to point to an 
20 
assist – an effort on the part of Eskom to assist Tegeta in 
the acquisition of OCH, financially.   Do you think you have 
any comment on that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   I cannot speculate Chair, that is 
unfortunately your role, I cannot speculate, I have been 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 72 of 94 
 
watching but I cannot speculate Chair, I can only say I am 
not involved in those transactions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you Mr Pamensky.   You 
have dealt also with this issue in your affidavit of the 
cooperation agreement, I mean you did mention it as you 
were talking about this transaction. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry Chair, sorry Chair, I have never 
known about the cooperation agreement, it has never been 
mentioned to us, all that we are aware is the 4 t h 
Addendum. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The 4 t h Addendum.   
MR PAMENSKY:   That is ja sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No that’s fine for that correction, 
because the other board members have mentioned a 
cooperation agreement, or the negotiation process that 
was ongoing at the time when Mr Molefe comes to Eskom.  
To cut a long story short that matter comes to the Board on 
the 23 r d of April 2016, no 2015. 
MR PAMENSKY:   2015, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we heard evidence that the Board 
20 
was met in Cape Town and that this was a more of an 
informal meeting, can you recall that? 
ADV SELEKA SC: Can I stop you there, not an informal 
meeting, I heard it yesterday, I re-looked at the minutes 
again, you can see there’s three topics there, you have the 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 73 of 94 
 
Corporate Plan so you have to have the management and 
all that there otherwise it would be impossible, you had 
also, the war room, the people who were engaged in the 
war room were Management, not the Board, we weren’t 
involved and I even went a step further Chair, if you don’t 
mind.  Chair this will come as a revelation to me too, 
whether it’s in the Bundle or not we’ll all find out right now.  
So, yesterday I heard it was an…[intervenes].   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
[Laughter], 
sometimes 
you 
get 
something like this, and you get very useful information. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and we’re here seeking the truth, 
so I’ve got no difficulty, Mr Pamensky, is this in the 
Bundle? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, it’s not, but I’ll just tell you now that 
I did it this morning, so, to let you know straight away is, 
yes I heard yesterday it was an informal – it’s impossible, I 
re-looked 
at 
the 
minutes 
there’s 
resolutions, 
there’s 
everything and then I looked at the email from the company 
Secretary, Wayne Venter to determine the Board meeting 
and you can see everyone is on it, all Executives and 
20 
everything to that extent.  So, they would have had to be 
there to present who was going to present to us, so I went 
to look at that, so it was definitely not an informal Board 
meeting, so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say you looked at the minutes, you 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 74 of 94 
 
saw 
that 
none 
of 
the 
Executives 
names 
are 
on…[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, they are, if you go look in the 
Executives, when you go look in it…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh is there and…[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, no, no this is 2015, 23 r d of April 
2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Mr Singh’s not there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no correct, you’re right. 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   But if you look in the minutes the GE for 
Generation is talking to us, so they must have been there, 
no-one’s going to talk to us about – and make decisions 
without management, that’s the only people who are going 
to give us the information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but we’re talking now in respect 
of the issue of the addendum, the addendum that gets to 
be referred to Mr Molefe. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, that matter gets to be referred to 
20 
Mr Molefe? 
MR PAMENSKY:   That’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have explained in your affidavit, 
you don’t know who asked for it to be referred to Mr 
Molefe. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 75 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   That’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja because he was fairly new there.  
Why do you think it was referred to him and not to the team 
that was negotiating the matter? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Well, first of all Chair, you always, from 
the Board go through the CEO, you don’t speak, as my 
understanding, when you go to there, you speak to the 
CEO, the CEO goes and resolves it, so the CEO will go and 
speak to the PD Department or whoever he needs to, to 
gather that information.  You don’t go, as I – my 
10 
experience 
is, 
you 
don’t 
go 
and 
instruct 
the 
other 
Managers you go to the CE and the CE deals with 
it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You speak to the leader. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, you speak to the leader, correct 
and he handles it Chair.  It was also, just to let you know, 
Mr Zola Tsotsi was very formal at the beginning when we 
first joined and said, all communication must go through 
him and the CEO because that’s the protocol within this 
organisation. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so your – from your point of view 
it was not an issue – it was not an issue relating to the 
negotiating team or the Executive not being able to answer 
questions that the Board had, it was not about that, do you 
understand my question? 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 76 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   Can you just rephrase your question to 
me, are you saying to me, sorry, that we referred it to Mr 
Molefe regardless…[intervenes]? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, no I’m saying, from your point 
of view the referral of the matter to Mr Molefe was not 
because the negotiating team or the Executives involved in 
the negotiations were unable to answer questions which 
the Board had, from your point of view was, well here we 
have a leader let’s refer it to him. 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, no Chair, the truth of the matter is, I 
10 
can’t really remember that – I can’t go and tell you that 
perspective. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s fine and I see from your 
affidavit that you clearly say, the Board did not, what is 
it…[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:  Accept or reject. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That’s right, did not accept or reject, 
approve, or disapprove, it simply refers the matter to 
Molefe, and it refers to him, with the understanding that he 
will come back, is that your understanding? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is my understanding, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You heard the other Board members 
say that he didn’t come back, they picked up this, either in 
some report in September and by that time he had already 
terminated the negotiations.  What’s your recollection, did 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 77 of 94 
 
he come back? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair my recollection was this, I think I 
explained to you earlier.  My recollection from my side 
was, we had a Board meeting set, I then got an email to 
say the Board meeting has been postponed and it was 
there that I was noticing on the press, with Glencore the 
month before, I wanted to find out what’s happening, 
what’s going on.  Anyway, I wrote an email, can someone 
please tell us what’s going on you know, what’s the 
Delegation of Authority say, you know, at least tell us, and 
10 
let us know what is going on.  There was no response to 
that and then – and I think the date would have been, for 
me, when Mr Molefe filled me in when he said it was not in 
the best interest and unaffordable and it does accord with 
my initial impressions, would have been the 10 t h or 11 t h of 
September because we are onboard Breakaway and I don’t  
interact with the CE you don’t phone him and you don’t 
have that relationship, you know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, is the Chairperson able to hear, 
are you able to hear Mr Pamensky, Chairperson? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m hearing him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay thank you Chair.  Right, Mr 
Pamensky did you, prior to you hearing from the media, 
when was that, when you heard and then you sent an 
email? 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 78 of 94 
 
MR PAMENSKY:   At the beginning of August was a lot of 
this going on and then our Board meeting was set, I think, 
for the 14 t h or 18 t h of September and on the 27 t h we got a 
notification to say the Board meeting is going to be 
postponed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so when do you make your 
enquiry about what you’ve – you hear in the media? 
MR PAMENSKY:   I do my enquiry in that email, I wanted 
to speak to the Board…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In September? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   In September. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, I see because my question, like I 
did all the Board members is, when you referred the matter 
to Mr Molefe on the 23 r d of April 2015, which is a matter of 
significant importance it would appear, did you follow up 
with him because he’s given an assignment, go get 
information and come back, report back to the Board, give 
us feedback because we haven’t – we have neither 
rejected nor approved this thing, does the Board make a 
follow-up with him? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I can’t talk the Board, but I made 
the follow-up, you know, the next time our quarterly Board 
meetings come would be – the quarterly meeting was one 
in May and then there was one in September.  So, the first 
time he came back, I saw in the press is when I asked but 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 79 of 94 
 
also to your question, Mr Seleka, you know, if there’s a 
problem with coal or the supply, management will come to 
us in that sense but to answer your question, yes, I did 
ask. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but we couldn’t find anything to 
show that any Board member made enquiries before Mr 
Molefe terminated this cooperation…[intervenes]. 
MR 
PAMENSKY: 
 
 
Oh 
yes, 
none 
of 
us 
knew 
the 
transaction, none of us – we weren’t involved, we didn’t 
know.  I found out from the press what transpired, we 
10 
didn’t 
know 
that 
he 
had 
terminated 
whatever 
his 
negotiations were, we were unaware. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, because my question was in 
relation to that, whether there was any follow-up with him 
from the part of the Board, prior to him terminating? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Oh, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Chair I – I think I’ve 
exhausted this part, the -  the suspension issues are little 
bit longer, but I would have like to have summarised them 
with Mr Pamensky except that we know that time is not 
20 
necessarily on our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is – you can still have about 15 
minutes before we might need to make a…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, thank you Chair.  Yes, Mr 
Pamensky, quickly on the suspensions, just a few points 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 80 of 94 
 
there, Mr Pamensky and you deal with it in your affidavit, 
maybe I should turn to that affidavit so that if you need to 
make reference to anything in your affidavit you can use it.  
You will provide us with that document, you read from, in 
due course, the one you pulled out from your bag. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, I’ll just hand it to – I’ll give you a 
copy as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so quickly on the suspensions, I 
think you deal with them – you deal with that on page 375 
of your affidavit onwards.  This is the evidence before the 
10 
Commission, on the 9 t h of March 2015 – well there’s a 
cancellation of a meeting on the 26 t h of February, a 
scheduled Board meeting and you complained about it.  On 
the 9 t h of March, a meeting is convened, 9 March 2015 by 
Mr Tsotsi by email on the evening before, the 8 t h of March.  
He had been, on that day, the 8 t h of March which is a 
Sunday, he had been at a meeting with the President in 
Durban and he comes to the meeting on the 9 t h, I think you 
joined the meeting by telephone, you were not there in 
person and a discussion ensued about what Mr Tsotsi says 
20 
was his meeting with the President and what the President 
requires of the Board.  
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In that meeting, we have – well about 
that meeting we have had some – well I think the Board 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 81 of 94 
 
members are unable to recollect, whatever the position is, 
but 
some 
have 
given 
various 
versions 
about 
what 
transpired in that meeting.  I’ve seen in your affidavits and 
I want to ask you a few questions, so that you can tell the 
Chairperson.  Other than the inquiry – the request for an 
inquiry, did the Board members discuss the issue of 
suspensions, on the 9 t h of March 2015? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, we did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You didn’t, thank you, Mr Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, almost all the witnesses, Mr 
10 
Seleka, have said that that on the 9 t h there was no 
discussion on the suspensions, some of the Executives 
were in that meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I’ve had to put that to them Chair, 
when we get it from the Executives, the Executives said 
they were there, they didn’t discuss the – how can they 
discuss the suspensions of themselves…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the point I’m making is, don’t you 
want to go to points where there seems to be disputes on 
the issue of suspensions because with regard to whether 
20 
the suspensions were discussed at the meeting of the 9 t h, 
my recollection is that nobody says they were discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no Chair, that’s – we have 
overcome that hurdle, you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 82 of 94 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because they were saying, some of 
them, the suspensions were discussed…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then comes the meeting of the 15 t h 
– of the 11 t h sorry, Mr Pamensky, 11 March 2015 where the 
Minister is present and the Minister, again, as I’ve seen 
from your affidavit…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I put this question to him while you 
are looking at your question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I’ve 
looked 
at 
your 
affidavit 
Mr 
Pamensky, one of the things that you don’t say in your 
affidavit which some of the Board members have said is 
that in that meeting between the Minister and the Board, 
on that day, that morning, the Minister did specify the 
portfolios whose heads would need to be suspended.  Now, 
I’m saying, need to be suspended but a number of the 
Board members said the Minister said, I’m not instructing, I 
can’t instruct the Board as to who to suspend but for 
example, I think Mr Khoza made it clear that it was quite 
20 
implied that, that’s what she wanted.  So, do you recall 
that, or do you not recall that? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Chair 
my 
recollection 
is, 
she 
mentioned the four areas, and she mentioned the four 
areas that were affected within the four departments.  I 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 83 of 94 
 
don’t remember her specifically saying – but I remember 
something very clearly in my head, I will not protect them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PAMENSKY:   So, in my mind was, it was a moot point 
because we had to decide on the suspensions but in my 
mind exactly what I said to you, was we had a support but I 
can tell you now, the seed or the first time that the 
principle of the four Executives to, you know, we shouldn’t 
have a problem with us putting them to step aside if you 
want to put it, was in that meeting, that’s where it came 
10 
alive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes and one of the things that has 
been said or that has emerged is that apart from Mr Tsotsi 
who had been to the Durban meeting on the 8 t h where this 
issue of the suspension of the Executives came up as well 
the issue of an inquiry, apart from him it doesn’t appear 
that, officially, any Board member knew about the idea of 
the suspension of Executives until the Minister raised it. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct? 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously there may or not have been 
some Board members who might have known, unofficially 
but in terms of what I’ve heard, that’s when this whole idea 
it wasn’t of a suspension or stepping aside was mentioned 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 84 of 94 
 
for the first time to the Board. 
MR PAMENSKY:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when, later on, after the Minister 
had left, Mr Tsotsi spoke, he also spoke, obviously about 
the suspension but everybody knew what the Minister had 
said, you know, and of course he was telling the Board 
also about what he had heard at the Durban meeting, he 
might not have said there was a Durban meeting but he, 
clearly, 
was 
talking 
about 
interactions 
involving 
the 
Presidency and so on, is that right? 
10 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, Chair, the only time he mentioned 
the Presidency was on the meeting of the 9 t h, he said 
clearly that, A, he drafted this submission he’d seen the 
President three times as recently as yesterday and the 
President has instructed him and us to do an inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, on – are you saying on the 11 t h he 
didn’t refer to his interactions with the Presidency in 
relation to the inquiry and the suspensions? 
MR PAMENSKY:   No, on the 11 t h it started off the 
meeting, it was clear he was pushing for four he explained 
20 
misdemeanours of three, I don’t recall the misdemeanours 
of three.  We, as a Board pushed back, what was told in 
that meeting was, Mr Tsotsi told us that he’d been – that 
the Presidency had been working on this for months, he 
was given a thick report like this, it’s in a thick report like 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 85 of 94 
 
this that covered all the bases and all of that and he had 
obtained a legal opinion that the Executives could, lawfully 
be suspended, he didn’t mention anything about the talk in 
Durban or anything, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What about the evidence that I’ve heard, 
I think from Mr Tsotsi and from other Board members, I 
think Dr Ngubane is one of them, that the discussion by the 
Board of the suspensions of the Executives was on the 
basis that it was – the suspensions were not linked to any 
allegations of misconduct, that the idea was simply to say, 
10 
we are not making any allegations against the Executives, 
allegations of misconduct but we are simply saying, in 
order for the inquiry or the investigation to proceed 
smoothly, we would like them to be suspended  or to step 
aside, do you remember that discussion? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair I think that was at the 
meeting I was at, remember I left at 1h30 and we only 
agreed three resignations, not four.  Sorry could you 
repeat your question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you remember….[intervenes]. 
20 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry, you’re right, the idea was to let 
them step aside without any charges or looking for 
wrongdoing that was it, it was to step aside so that they 
don’t impede or slow this investigation down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes now, against that background, 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 86 of 94 
 
to the extent that, as I recall, but Mr Seleka might correct 
me, as I recall, Mr Tsotsi seems to have denied having told 
the Board about misdemeanours of Executives to support 
suspension, Mr Seleka is that correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, he has denied giving them a 
list…[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Can I answer that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no before you say anything.  You are 
not the only one, you are not the only Board member who 
says he told the Board about allegations of misconduct by 
10 
some of the Executives or all of them, I’m not sure, but I’m 
wondering 
why 
he 
would 
talk 
about 
that 
if 
the 
understanding was that the suspensions were not going to 
be based on allegations of misconduct, do you want to 
comment on that? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Sorry Chair, I don’t think I’m fully 
understanding 
that 
question, 
what 
I’m 
thinking 
is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me say, I’m saying you and some of 
the Board members maybe all of them, those that have 
20 
testified have said that Mr Tsotsi did tell the Board 
members about allegations of misconduct on the part of 
some, at least, I don’t know if all…[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Three. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, some of the Executives that were 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 87 of 94 
 
sought to be suspended. So, my question is, I wonder why 
he would be telling the Board members about allegations of 
misconduct in circumstances where it was understood, 
within the Board, that the suspensions were not going to 
be based on allegations of misconduct. 
MR PAMENSKY:   May I answer that Chair?  He first 
started off pushing for suspension with charges. Mr Baloyi, 
as I recall, was quite against it so he came in with the 
concept to push for charges, you know, and the Board 
members felt that there was not sufficient information to do 
10 
charges, we’d rather step aside at that point in time.  I just 
answer you one last question Chair, sorry I don’t want to 
take your time.  On the meeting of the 19 t h, if we didn’t 
have this recording, I think we would all be in trouble here. 
In that recording, as clear as daylight, what I put down 
there, that he admitted to all these items in black and 
white it’s in the recording, so he can’t deny it, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
There 
might 
be 
room 
for 
20 
one…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One or two – yes, talking about that, 
Mr Pamensky, his, what is it, admissions or concessions 
are not in relation to the charges that he alleged, 
misdemeanours, I’ve seen what you set out in your 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 88 of 94 
 
affidavit.  One is that Tsotsi – Mr Tsotsi told us that the 
President had the report, that investigation and in there 
was a report about misdemeanours but he didn’t produce 
that report, do you recall that, that’s page 389? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   389 of your – of the Bundle where 
you’re dealing with the removal of Mr Tsotsi and he 
admitted to having erred by not properly introducing Mr 
Linnell to the Board, that’s one of the reasons.  He did say 
that you’re right, but we know that from the evidence of – 
10 
and in particular, Ms Klein say we did embrace we didn’t 
reject and Mr – no not Mr but Dr Ngubane said, look Mr 
Linnell we are contracting with you and after that, after the 
meeting of the 11 t h, whichever last meeting it was, Mr 
Linnell received an invitation to assist the Audit and Risk 
Committee and the new build and programme of Dr Pat 
Naidoo.  So, the Board did, even invite him after the 11 t h of 
March. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair, I can’t comment on that I’m not 
aware of any of those meetings, first I’m coming to be 
20 
aware of all of this is on the 19 t h where he admits to me, 
on the 19 t h, he didn’t follow Procurement, he admits that 
he didn’t engage Nick Linnell without properly introducing 
him to us, he told us in that meeting, for the first time, this 
man was given by the President, we didn’t know we felt it 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 89 of 94 
 
was imposed on us, I think people were quite upset and he 
also admitted to engage in the services of Mr Nick Linnell 
without the Board approval, so it’s there, he admitted to it 
but I don’t know those meeting before, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think we’ve run out of time for 
today, but I think it’s going to be important for Mr 
Pamensky to come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, can we arrange it mutually? 
MR PAMENSKY:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because there are matters that, I 
10 
think, he feels strongly about, in terms of different versions 
that need to be canvassed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What I would like you to do, Mr 
Pamensky, in the meantime also, is to look at what I put to 
some of the Board members including Ms Naidoo yesterday 
when I was saying…[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I was hoping to do that today, Chair, I’ve 
got it all written down, I’ve got a point for you on all of 
it…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughter] you’re ready 
MR PAMENSKY:   I’m ready, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so if – before you come 
back, if you could put what you wanted to put to say in 
relation to that in a supplementary affidavit, an affidavit 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 90 of 94 
 
that would be helpful but when you come back it doesn’t 
mean I won’t give you a chance to say it…[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair if I may, Chair, I hear your request 
but if you look at my affidavit, I think it covers it.  I think 
it’s for me to speak to you, each level, to say listen Chair, I 
could not recall why, I’m not involved here, I’m not involved 
here, I’d love to give you that opportunity…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, if it’s covered in the affidavit, you 
don’t have to do another affidavit, then when you come 
back you can – we deal with it.  What I didn’t mention to 
10 
Ms Naidoo, I forgot to mention is, also how Mr Tsotsi was 
kicked out, I say kicked out, but I know that in the end he 
resigned but I think it’s quite clear that he resigned 
because the Board didn’t want him anymore.  Looking at 
the charges you may or may not have heard the questions 
that we have put to other Board members about the 
charges.  I can say to you that, I have difficulty with, I 
think almost all the …[intervenes]. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Yes, Chair, the problem I have with it, I 
can’t answer you it was left to PMG and the lawyers 
20 
drafted it, so I can’t answer you on that question, 
unfortunately.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no that’s fine but when you deal 
with the question that I put to – the picture that I put to Ms 
Naidoo, all I’m saying is that I didn’t factor in how Mr 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 91 of 94 
 
Tsotsi was kicked out, it’s part of that picture.  You might 
say, on that part I have no comment but on the other parts 
of the picture I’m able to comment, this is my comment, 
and you’ll do that when you come back when you come 
back. 
MR PAMENSKY:   Chair I just want to say two things 
quickly before you leave, number one, yes what you were 
saying was, the enabler to come into this business to allow 
these people to come in and then the transactions so that’s 
what you were asking for, I can do that. Number two, I just 
10 
want to thank you for the opportunity, Chair, I’ve waited 
five years to explain these emails I have been lambasted, 
I’ve been kicked out of the Jewish community let them 
hear, on these emails people think I was involved in this 
transaction, I’ve never been involved in this transaction.  
So, at least I had my chance to come forward and tell it all 
today, and I think it’s in that supplementary that you’ve 
got.  So, for me, it’s a big, big thank you from my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that’s fine but the real point that I 
was talking about, certainly you will deal with the issue of 
20 
the transaction but what I was really talking about in terms 
of the picture I put to Ms Naidoo is the one of saying, it 
looks like there may have been people from outside of 
Eskom who were influencing what the Board was doing and 
people within the Board were doing, so if you can listen 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 92 of 94 
 
again to that part of the question and then to the extent 
that you are able to when you come back you can deal with 
it. 
MR PAMENSKY:   I look forward to deal with it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV BLOU:   Chair we will also assist in that regard, I 
haven’t been following this like it is a running a brief, I 
think Mr Pamensky would be complaining about insolvency 
if I was on a daily basis following all the evidence in the 
Commission, but we will get the record of the matters that 
10 
you have referred to and we will either, if it hasn’t been 
covered by the affidavit at all we will consider with Mr 
Pamensky’s consent dealing with it on affidavit, in a short 
supplementary, or we will deal with it orally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV BLOU:   We will assist in that regard.  Chair might I 
just say one other thing before the irrepressible Mr 
Pamensky says something else, is in relation to the 
Melrose Arch question I think we will engage with the 
Commission’s investigators directly and Mr Seleka, I do not 
20 
believe it is the sort of matter that has to be on the record 
given the type of investigation that you wish to clarify in 
that regard, I think it is probably best simply supplied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you said in relation to? 
ADV BLOU:   Into the Melrose Arch address.  I don’t think 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 93 of 94 
 
it should be necessarily on the record, I think it should be 
given to the – or you can put it on the record if you wish, 
but we will give those details directly to the investigators 
because it might be that they want to use it for purposes 
before it becomes public. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no I think you are right ja, ja.   
You will deal with Mr Seleka and then we will take it from 
there.   No, no, you are right. 
ADV BLOU:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   Okay we are going to 
10 
adjourn for now, we have to adjourn because I have got 
another commitment so we won’t be able to sit for the rest 
of 
the 
day, 
I 
apologise 
to 
all 
concerned 
for 
any 
inconvenience.   Tomorrow also we won’t be able to start at 
ten as normal, but as soon as my commitment is over I will 
rush back to the hearing and we should be able to start at 
about one o’clock so those who will be involved I hope they 
are listening while not here, they should have their lunch 
between twelve and one. 
ADV BLOU:   Might I just confirm that we are not on the 
20 
agenda for tomorrow? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, no. 
ADV BLOU:   Thank you for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will probably start at around one 
o’clock 
and 
I 
will 
sit 
up 
to about 
four 
or 
five 
or 
11 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 342 
 
Page 94 of 94 
 
thereabouts.   
 
Okay, thank you very much to everybody, we 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
