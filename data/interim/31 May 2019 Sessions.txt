PROCEEDINGS ON 31 MAY 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Morning Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mnyandu when we 
parted yesterday we had completed annexure – slide I am sorry – slide 
27 and we now get onto 28.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Okay Mr Mnyandu then you can lead us 
through slide 28 when you are ready.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you counsel.  Chair at slide 
28 we now seek to take you through the approval process of the 
relocation costs.  In particular we deal with first a memorandum that 
was done by – compiled by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe in respect of the CNR 
OEM.  The memorandum was prepared on 22 July 2015.  It was a 
request for the approval of the relocation costs for CNR at an amount 
of R647 181 494.00.  Chair that is to be found in your Volume 13 at 
page 9135.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got Volume 13 it is page 912? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  9135. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It starts at 9134 Chair but that is the cover 
note.  The actual document is 9135.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 3 of 212 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may interrupt youMr Mnyandu my 
apologies.  We ought to have started on the assignment I think that 
Chair gave you yesterday.  Could we deal with that and dispose of it 
and then we can continue with your testimony this morning? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes we may Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It related to the question of when the term 
relocation first appeared in this entire transaction.  Were you able to 
determine that? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair upon reflection you will 
recall that we – the documentation we took you through yesterday and 
10 
specifically a document contained in the Exhibit BB8[c] noted that there 
was email correspondence written to at least one of the OEM’s in 
relation to them having to put up a price for the Durban or factor in the 
price for manufacturing from Durban.  Now Chair we also took you 
through the fact that the agreements that were concluded on 17 March 
2017 did not make mention of the allocation of Durban as such.  And 
therefore as the processes morphed out and as discussions were had 
with each of the OEM’s it seems the word relocation reared its head 
during the course of those negotiations firstly by email correspondence 
– by way of email correspondence and for now we can say in relation to 
20 
the memorandum done by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe requesting the acting 
Group Chief Executive at the time Mr Siyabonga Gama to approve the 
negotiation team.  However Chair in discussions with the evidence team 
of the commission we have requested an indulgence in order to confirm 
this fact, reassess on the documents on hand and come back to the 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 4 of 212 
 
commission in the statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  It may prove significant, it might 
not prove significant but it might be helpful to try and trace where it got 
used for the first time and one can take it from there.  But the other 
questions that I would want you to deal with at some stage before you 
finish your evidence is whether the use of the word ‘relocation’ may 
have – it may have been simply the use of a wrong term but other than 
that everybody understood what was happening.  In other words was it 
just the use of a wrong word – incorrect word or were there – was there 
some motive to choosing to use that word because for example that 
10 
might seem on the face of it to justify charging certain costs.  You 
understand? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  So you do not have to deal with 
that now you can deal with it at some – at some stage before you finish 
your evidence and if it is something that you are not able to say 
anything you just tell me. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I would like to say that we – 
I will deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  When I deal with our conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  And in regards to the 
question about when the term relocation first reared its head you will 
respond to that having perused all other documents that do not form of 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 5 of 212 
 
the record currently and you will respond by way of statement? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And based on your answer then the Chair will 
determine whether it is necessary for you to – to return and perhaps – 
for some engagement on that statement. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and in that regard it may be that the 
documentation you look at for that purpose if the documentation that 
you can look at is limited in the sense that maybe you cannot look at 
documentation that other witnesses used then we would want those 
10 
witnesses also to do the same.  But if you are able to have a look at 
everything that would be fine. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is understood Chair thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair and thank you for that Mr 
Mnyandu.  We then can turn to your Volume 13 page 31 – 9134 and I 
think the Chair has located it in the file. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may then lead us through it. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we would like to now read 
out the salient parts of the memorandum in respect of the approval for 
the costs of relocation for CNR? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the one starting at 9135? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 6 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it is addressed to Siyabonga 
Gama in his capacity at the time as acting Group Chief Executive.  It is 
from Mr Ravi Nair who was at the time the acting Chief Executive of 
Transnet Freight Rail which is the operating division that was 
concerned with the purchase of the 1064 locomotives.  The subject 
reads: 
“Request for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  If you are able to tell me 
during this time when Mr Gama was acting Group Chief Executive was 
10 
that the time when Mr Brian Molefe had left Transnet or was he just 
away temporarily? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  He had left at this stage Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  And Mr Nair was acting in the 
position in which – in the position that Mr Gama had occupied before 
when Mr Molefe was there? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you.  Chair the subject read 
– reads: 
20 
“Request for acting GCE to approve the relocation of 
CNR Rolling Stock South Africa [CNR] to TE’s 
facilities in Durban for the manufacturing of 233 
Class 45D electric locomotives.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a good chance that this is the first time that 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 7 of 212 
 
this word relocation is being used in a memorandum at this high level?  
Or you might not be able to say? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I stand to be corrected but if 
we go back to the memorandum that we dealt with yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  To request the acting GCE Mr 
Siyanbonga Gama 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  To approve the negotiation team 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The word relocation is mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was used as well. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Because it might also be important to see 
when did senior people within the – within [indistinct] start using the 
same terminology. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair under purpose the 
memorandum reads: 
“Request for acting Group Chief Executive to 
a.  Note the final outcome of the negotiation for the 
relocation to Durban with CNR. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 8 of 212 
 
b. Approve the variation order for the relocation to 
Durban to a maximum value of R647 181 494.00 
with CNR and  
c. Sign off a letter to be issued to CNR to accept their 
final proposal.” 
The memorandum then goes on to deal with the background.   
“It notes that on the 17 March 2014 Transnet acting 
through its Transnet Freight Rail division entered 
into various locomotive supply agreements with CSR, 
CNR, GE and BT after negotiations which started in 
10 
February 2014.” 
It then says Chair at 3: 
“During negotiations BT and CNR were informed that 
they will use the Durban Transnet Engineering TE 
facility for the construction of locomotives which 
were allocated to them.  The Durban facility and the 
move were introduced to both CNR and after the 
tender had closed and evaluations were done.” 
At number 4 it then says: 
“On the 10 June 2015 the acting Group Chief 
20 
Executive approved the team to negotiate the 
relocation to Durban with CNR.” 
Number 5. 
“TIA which is Transnet Internal Audit was present 
during negotiations and are in the process of 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 9 of 212 
 
finalising their report.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thanks for – for reminding me of that full name of 
that acronym because there are so many of these acronyms one gets 
confused sometimes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Confused.  Alright Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And then under motivation number 
6 reads: 
“CNR’s final offer to Transnet is R647 181 494.00 
which has been absorbed.  Below that the primary 
10 
drivers of this increase are inflation and finance 
costs detailed below.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry let me interrupt you.  Do you understand 
what – which has been absorbed means there? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you.  Continue. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   
a. “Inflation costs increased from R166 million to R204 
20 
million [increase of approximately R38 million.] 
b. Finance costs on forward contract increased from 
R81 
million 
to 
R88 
million. 
 
Increase 
of 
approximately R7 million. 
c. Interest 
on 
stockholdings 
which 
rather 
would 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 10 of 212 
 
increase from R16 million to R21 million [increase of 
approximately R5 million]. 
Therefore total project cost is an increase from R669 
million to R719 million.  Increase of approximately R50 
million.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you could just pause there for a moment Mr 
Mnyandu.  Again we always trying to keep track of the increases.  The 
last we had of increases was R669 as per the memorandum of June 
20… 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  15 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  15 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  From Ms Mdletshe. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that was the approval that was being 
sought from the acting GCE? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the time. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The request was that it be kept at 
R669. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Be kept as R699? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is at Volume 13 page 9111. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For reference purposes.  This memorandum 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 11 of 212 
 
comes a month after that approval.  I see it is dated 22 July 2015 at 
page 9137 the signature page. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then since the approval of a cap of R669 
million in a month according to this memorandum am I interpreting this 
memorandum correctly to understand that there was a further increase 
taking the total cost now to a new level of R719 million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Insofar as it was advanced by 
CNR.  Indeed it is so Chair there was a further increase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  R719? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  I follow.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The new project relocation cost 
estimate amounts to R719 090 548.00.  On this price CNR’s offer – 
CNR offers a 10% settlement discount amounting to R71 909 054.00.  
This results in a revised project relocation cost of R647 181 494.00.  
Any further delays in commencing the project beyond five months will 
have further cost implications that will have to be taken into 
consideration.  The following payments terms have been proposed by 
CNR.  50% payable within 14 days of signature amounting to 
20 
R323 590 747.00 the remainder being 50% payable in 24 equal 
instalments 
of 
R13 482 948.00. 
 
The 
“[relocation 
payment]”  
Commencing the end of the first month that the project commences 
provided that the project is on track.  Therefore CNRRSSA  will invoice 
for 24 monthly instalments of R13 482 948.00.  Transnet is currently 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 12 of 212 
 
holding cash of approximately R4 billion with a cost of carry of 
approximately 4% which provides support for taking advantage of the 
discount based on the proposed payment regime.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you proceed.  That last point what did 
you interpret it to mean?  That Transnet is holding cash of 
approximately R4 billion with a cost of carry of approximately 4% which 
provides support for taking advantage of the discount? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  What we understood that to mean 
was that there were monies which we understand to be part of the R4.9 
billion contingencies that Transnet was holding and therefore would not 
10 
have to request capital expenditure outside of the contract.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the payment of this R649 – 7 million 50% 
upon signature and then over 24 months instalment would be payable 
out of that R4 billion? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As part of – which was part of the contingency 
10% contingency for the… 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  1064 – thank you.  Please proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Alright.   
20 
“9.  Refer to annexure A for the final detailed proposal.  Budget 
implications.   
10   The board at its meeting of 28 May 2014 approved an amount of 
R4.9 billion in contingencies as part of the revised ETC which means 
the estimated total costs.   
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 13 of 212 
 
11.  The contingencies budget were to following items.   
a.   Capital spares beyond the warranty period.   
b. Variation orders and options [such as electronically controlled 
pneumatic braking and wire distributed power etcetera]. 
c.   Relocation of the programme to Transnet Engineering’s Durban 
facilities.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I would like you to pause once again.  Are we 
to understand that paragraph 11 to mean when the R4.9 billion – when 
the R49 billion ETC was approved with the R4.9 billion contingency the 
contingency already made provision for the relocation? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that appears in the – in which document?  
Where do we do find that? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair that would be in a document 
that has been presented to the commission.  It is a memorandum 
prepared by the then acting Group Chief – sorry the then Group Chief 
Executive Mr Brian Molefe to the board. It is dated 23 May 2014 and in 
it Mr Brian Molefe sought to rationalise to the board the justification for 
the increase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For the increase and in doing so as to what 
20 
covers – what contingencies are catered for relocation is one of the 
items? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Even though the word relocation in 
the memorandum does not appear yes the subject of allocating the two 
OEM’s to Durban is covered. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 14 of 212 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Under paragraph 12. 
The current status of the utilisation of the contingency’s budget is as 
follows: 
You will see that below Chair there is a description of what the 
contingencies have been approved for and there is an amount related 
to each specific line item.  Contingencies approved R4.9 billion.  
Variation orders approved to date R1.2 billion.  Relocation of BT R618 
million.  Relocation of CNR R647 million.  Then there is unutilised 
portion of contingencies amounting to some R2.519 billion.   
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then another – if I may I am sorry to interject.  
On read – on the reading of paragraph 12 particularly in respect of 
relocation of BT and CNR regard being had to the amounts the budget 
referred to in here cannot be the budget of the business case because 
that was the year previous? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that could not have been a budget spelt 
out in the memorandum of Mr Molefe because that was in May 2014 and 
at the time the relocation cost at least insofar as CNR is concerned was 
not R647? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   Indeed Chair even though a 
specific amount was made out for contingencies as it were. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes for contingencies. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Ye.s 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So my question then is – is there any 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 15 of 212 
 
document that reflects this budget as set out in paragraph 12 by Mr – 
by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Apart from the first line item. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Which is set out as we have said in 
the memorandum dated 23 May. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  2014 prepared by Mr Brian Molefe 
there is no other document that lists this budget. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we are seeing it for the first time in this 
10 
memorandum? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is seeing for the first time here. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair then – if 
the Chair turns overleaf to 91 – page 9137 paragraph 13 reads: 
“Consequently an amount of R647 181 494.00 is part 
of the contingencies budget included in the final 
approved 
estimated 
total 
cost 
the 
project.  
Recommendation.” 
Paragraph 14 reads: 
20 
“Request for the acting Group Chief Executive to 
a. Note the final outcome of the negotiations for the 
relocation to Durban with CNR. 
b. Approve variation order for the relocation to Durban 
to a maximum value of R647 181 494.00 with CNR 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 16 of 212 
 
and 
c. Sign off a letter to be issued to CNR to accept the 
final proposal.” 
Chair what then appears below are the names of the people that   
a. The compiler of the memorandum and the individuals that then 
recommended as well as the approval signature by Mr Gama 
which dated 23 July 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the memorandum was compiled by Ms Lindiwe 
Mdletshe who signed.  It was recommended by the – recommended by 
Mr Ravi Nair acting Chief Executive Transnet Freight Rail. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was signed by him on 22 July 2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was also recommended by Mr Ndphiwe Silinga 
Group Executive Legal and Compliance and signed on 22 July 2015 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was recommended by Mr Anoj Singh Group Chief 
Financial Officer on 22 July 2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was recommended by Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani on the 
20 
same date and signed on the same date as well as by Mr Garry Pita 
and then the following day it was signed by – approved and signed by 
Mr Gama in his capacity as acting Group Chief Executive of Transnet? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know whether you have picked up 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 17 of 212 
 
something that I cannot see or have not been able to see in this 
memorandum.  This memorandum seeks approval that a very large 
amount of money what R647 000,00 be approved for… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Million Chair. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Million yes.  Million be approved to be paid for what 
is called relocation costs but I cannot see anything in the memorandum 
where those who Ms Mdletshe and those who recommend and ultimately 
Mr Gama who approves which says why is this amount a reasonable 
amount to spend on this so called relocation.  All I can see is the 
10 
background and the fact that the amount falls within what was budgeted 
for under contingencies.  But the fact that there is budget for an item is 
not justification for paying a certain amount for that item.  You must 
still check whether that amount is justifiable.  I have not seen that here 
on this memorandum so I wonder whether you have seen that? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we have not been able to see 
anything that speaks to either a critique of the final proposal or the 
final amount or that justifies or details a support of the final amount 
which is being requested for approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So approval … 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Chair your microphone is off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  The – that this amount be spent on the so 
called relocation is recommended by various senior people and 
approved by the acting Group Chief Executive without any of them 
asking this very critical question would we be spending – would we be 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 18 of 212 
 
justified to spend so much money on this relocation – so called 
relocation?  How is this amount justifiable?  Why is it R647 million and 
not R100 million?  Why is it not R50 million?  And nowhere here in this 
memorandum is – is that amount of R9 million that was first given by 
CNR reflected... 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say that is where we coming from initially these 
costs were estimated at R9 million but now we are talking about R6 
hundred and something million rand.  So that the full picture is shown.  
That is not mentioned. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is not dealt with Chair not 
mentioned at all.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in your investigation did you find that Transnet 
and maybe the previous witnesses would have dealt with this I just 
cannot remember now – did we have proof that Transnet did receive 
that estimate of R9 million or acknowledged having received it and 
responded to it in one way or another that was made initially? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair the best way to answer it 
even though we did not have proof of email correspondence that 
responds to the offer of R9 million the documentation that included that 
20 
quotation of R9 million which is addressed to Mr Garry Pita and Ms 
Lindiwe Mdletshe was received from Transnet itself.  It was received in 
particular from the supply chain services personnel at Transnet Freight 
Rail.  When Ms Mdletshe became the interface for us to receive 
information that was required to be perused for the course of our 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 19 of 212 
 
investigation so the documents that we have perused came from 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So certainly it was received by Transnet? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Certainly it was received Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm – but were you able – were you only able to tell 
that Supply Chain Management received it but you did not find any 
evidence that other people in Transnet the GCEO, Mr Gama, Mr Molefe, 
Mr Pita, Mr Anoj Singh did you come across anything that suggested 
that they at least knew of this amount at some stage or another? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair.  I however would like to 
10 
also point out that at the time that the quotation is sent was during the 
final stages of the negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The R9 million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The R9.7 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Is received a week prior to the 
conclusion of the negotiations which were concluded on 17 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is when the agreement was 
then signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you have not come across – have you come 
across anything that shows that the Board was told of this R9 million 
quotation? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 20 of 212 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not found anything? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay because it is important to find out to establish 
that Transnet received this quotation of R9 million for this cost.  It is 
important to establish what their reaction was to it because that 
becomes quite important for them to justify how they were reacting to 
offers of hundreds of millions of Rand for something that they would 
have known at some stage produced a quotation of R9 million and I 
think from what Mr Mnyandu said even with that R9 million maybe 
10 
should – should have been lower – you know - I think.  So - so it is very 
important to connect all of these things.  Who was aware of this R9 
million quotation?  What did they do about it?  How do they justify – 
how do they justify approving R600-and something million afterwards?  
Where is the interrogation of these amounts that they were obliged to 
undertake on behalf of Transnet in order to protect Transnet’s interest 
and the taxpayers money. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Perhaps on that score then let us just clarify 
20 
at least now did you make enquiries Mr Mnyandu from Ms Mdletshe - 
who is the author of this memorandum we just went through and as you 
say was the interface between Transnet and MNS during the course of 
your investigations – did you inquire from her whether she did receive 
the R9 million quote – original R9 million quote - from CNR … 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 21 of 212 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what was her response if you did? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I cannot recall with certainty 
whether that actual question was posed with her – to her - rather.  Let 
me say this for the record Chair that as for forensic investigators who 
are tasked with perusing certain documents, conducting certain 
interviews with personnel who were involved in a myriad of transactions 
you are tasked with number one, reading documentation and making 
necessary deductions.  You have to reach certain conclusions because 
it is not each and every witness who is going to be one, willing to 
10 
speak to you in the first place but moreover be willing to answer certain 
questions that would in any event seem as though you are laying blame 
or placing responsibility on them.  The Chair will recall that in any 
event yesterday we informed the Chair that whilst Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe 
had first - who was the lead interface insofar as the collation of 
documents were concerned for MNS Attorneys might not have been 
hostile but when it got certain discussions she was.  So in explaining 
that I am trying to point out to the Chair that it is not each and every 
detail that would have been interrogated with her in order to reach 
certain conclusions and having said that I would go further but not 
20 
speak out of turn.  In relation to the approval of these costs Chair you 
will recall that yesterday we took you through prior to getting to this an 
email sent by Mr Garry Pita on 10 July.  In particular he requested that 
not only should she compile the documentation for the approval of the 
relocation costs but that she should also get the sign off from 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 22 of 212 
 
Transnet’s Internal Audit Team.  The Chair will note from page 9137 
which we have just taken you through that not only is it not signed by a 
representative of the Transnet Internal Audit Team but there is actually 
no signature line that was ever added to the memorandum.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is – that is understandable and – and I 
accept that it is not all the questions that I might think of or Ms Sello 
might think of that you and your team may have thought of and not all 
the questions that we think of are questions that people watching from 
their homes can think of.  There will always be questions that 
somebody else thinks of that you might not have thought of and that on 
10 
its own and depending on the question - on the nature of the question – 
and what your task was and what you had before you – you know – 
there might be no blame – you know.  So obviously there may be 
certain questions that are too obvious so that if you do not ask them 
people say but what was he doing if he did not ask this question.  So – 
so – but at this stage I – I understand – you know.  I understand that 
there are certain questions that you may not have asked but of course 
there are some that even if a witness is hostile if they are important 
you have to ask and if they do not answer that is – and you have no 
power over them – just record that they did not want to answer but … 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  So we might have to – to 
look at all of these things to really establish who knew what in – you 
knew about this … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 23 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  R9 million quotation and later got to know about over 
R600 million for the same thing … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why was the R9 million not accepted but as 
Mr Mnyandu implies even that R9 million should not have just been 
accepted.  They should interrogate everything that has got cost 
implications for – for Transnet and for the taxpayers. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the Chair will recall that that R9 million – 
10 
that quotation was first introduced by Mr Gonsalves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will go back to Mr Gonsalves … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Files and see what – how much of the answer 
- of the question we can begin to answer and to the extent that we still 
have a gap.  Then our investigators will be requested to see if they can 
close that gap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thanks and I do not know if we asked 
Mr Gonsalves but we need to know whether from his side he knows any 
20 
reaction that may have come from one or other official from Transnet in 
regard to it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will determine that through the papers … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the transcript and if the question was not 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 24 of 212 
 
posed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We perhaps may pose it to Mr Gonsalves … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And to the extent necessary he will file a 
supplementary statement in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is fine, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Yes Mr Mnyandu we may – 
we may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  It is now 
10 
necessary for us to move to slide 29 to take you through the 
memorandum prepared in respect of BT.  The memorandum was 
prepared on the very same day.  It is to be found at Appendix 15 which 
is contained in volume 13 of the Chair’s files at 9129. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  9129 being the covering page and 
the document beginning at 9130.  Chair I will read the memorandum 
just like I did with the previous one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  “The purpose is to one, 
20 
request the Acting Group Chief Executive (GCE) to 
a, note the final outcome of the negotiation for the 
relocation 
to 
Durban 
with 
Bombardier 
Transportation SA (BT).  B, approve variation order 
for the relocation to Durban to a maximum value of 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 25 of 212 
 
R618 457 125 with BT and c, sign off a letter to be 
issued to BT to accept their final proposal.” 
Below that it says “The Background”. 
“On 17 March 2014 Transnet acting through its 
Transnet Freight Rail Division (Transnet Freight 
Rail) 
entered 
into 
various 
locomotive 
supply 
agreements with CNR – CSR, CNR, GE and BT.  
After negotiations which started in February 2014.  
During negotiations BT and CNR were informed that 
they will use the Durban Transnet Engineering (TE) 
10 
Facility for the construction of the locomotives 
which were allocated to them.  The Durban Facility 
and the move were introduced to both CNR and BT 
after the tender had closed and evaluations were 
done.  Number four, on 10 June 2015 the Acting 
GCE – Group Chief Executive – approved the team 
to 
negotiate 
the 
relocation 
to 
Durban 
with 
Bombardier Transportation SA.  Five, TIA was 
present at the negotiations and are in the process 
of finalising their report.” 
20 
Below that is the “Motivation”.  Paragraph 6 reads as follows: 
“Bombardier’s 
final 
offer 
to 
Transnet 
is 
an 
additional discount of 2.5 percent and the following 
cost which has been absorbed.  A, further price 
escalation.  B, financing cost of own additional 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 26 of 212 
 
efforts suppliers and already accumulated stock and 
C, claims from the suppliers that BT has already 
rescheduled and delayed.” 
The Chair turns overleaf.  It says: 
“A, further price escalation the cost of the further 
price escalation of material, layby and other 
expenses were evaluated at 4 percent due to the 
additional time for deliver.  2.5 percent was due to 
the increase of the Euro/Rand ration over the last 
year since the instruction to change Transnet 
10 
Engineering Facility was received from Transnet 
Freight Rail and since Bombardier Transportation 
submitted the first notice of company proposed 
variation on the subject.  The additional financing 
cost due to our ongoing expenses on the internal 
efforts and cost from our suppliers in addition to the 
logistics and warehousing cost (negative cash flow) 
create an additional 2.5 percent (two and a half of 
the cost).  In addition the escalation mentioned 
above claims from suppliers were costed at 1 
20 
percent (one percent).” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can I just inquire at times under A at page 
9131 - the section you just read – there is reference to “our”.  Do we 
interpret the “our” to be referenced to CNR and not our Transnet.  So it 
is not Transnet speaking here? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 27 of 212 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It seems to reference BTs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  BT rather sorry. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is a – seemingly a direct quote from the 
BT proposal? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  “If the variation order is 
not issued by 24 July 2015 the value of BTs notice 
of company proposed variation order will increase 
10 
by 20 percent.  BTs current offer represents a total 
discount of 32.5 percent.  When taking into 
consideration the indicated potential price increase 
of approximately 20 percent in instances where by 
the notice of company proposed variation or the VO 
is not approved by TFR by 24 July 2015 (validity of 
BTs offer).  The 32.5 percent is the sum of the 10 
percent absorbed cost of further price escalation 
the above mentioned 20 percent increase price 
after 24 July and a further 2.5 percent discount 
20 
given by BT.” 
The following payment terms have been proposed by BT in accordance 
with Section 1.2 of Schedule 1 (Pricing and Payment Terms) of the 
Locomotive Supply Agreement.  It quotes: 
“The first two milestones (the effective date and the 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 28 of 212 
 
6 months after effective date) amounting to a 
combined total of 18 percent of total contract price 
of all locomotives have already been achieved due 
and will be invoiced by BT once the variation order 
is issued.  The third milestone payment to the value 
of 9 percent of the total contract price of all 
locomotives will be due 17 months after the 
effective date and will be invoiced accordingly.” 
Chair what follows below even though the wording is not clear we know 
this from previous email correspondence that was needed to be 
10 
checked by the Legal Department is that this would mean – what 
changes would need to be effected to the Locomotive Supply 
Agreement. 
“One, definition – TE Facility - as it reads currently 
Koedoespoort Gauteng amended to definition – TE 
Facility Durban KwaZulu-Natal.  Two, Clause 9.1.1 
– as it reads currently Clause 9.1:  if the 
acceptance 
of 
a 
locomotive 
occurs 
after 
its 
scheduled acceptance date (a delay) the contractor 
shall subject to Clause 9.2 (delay penalty cap) pay 
20 
a delay penalty to the company in respect of the 
delayed locomotive at the applicable rate.  A delay 
penalty grace period for three months shall apply to 
the initial six locomotives scheduled acceptance 
date.  Amendment to Clause 9.1.  If the acceptance 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 29 of 212 
 
of 
a 
locomotive 
occurs 
after 
its 
scheduled 
acceptance date (a delay) the contractor shall 
subject to Clause 9.2 (delay penalty cap) pay a 
delay penalty to the company in respect of the 
delayed locomotive at the applicable rate.  A delay 
penalty grace period of three months shall apply to 
the initial 35 locomotives scheduled acceptance 
date.  An additional grace of two months shall apply 
to the remainder of the fleet.” 
Budget implications under paragraph 9 it reads: 
10 
“The Board at its meeting of 28 May 2014 approved 
an amount of R4.9 billion in contingencies as part 
of 
the 
revised 
estimated 
total 
cost. 
 
The 
contingencies budget were to cover the following 
items:  a, capital spares beyond the warrantee 
period; b, variation orders and options (such as 
electronically conclude pneumatic breaking and 
wire distributed power and c, relocation of the 
program 
to 
Transnet 
Engineering’s 
Durban 
Facilities.” 
20 
Under paragraph 11: 
“The current status of the utilisation of the 
contingencies budget is as follows.” 
The Chair will recall that this was a table referred to in the previous 
memorandum.  Under paragraph 12 it says: 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 30 of 212 
 
“Consequently an amount of R618 457 125 is part of 
the contingencies budget included in the final 
approved estimated total cost of the project.” 
And if the Chair turns overleaf at page 9133 there is a recommendation.  
Under paragraph 13: 
“Request the Acting Group Chief Executive to a, 
note the final outcome of the negotiations for the 
relocation 
to 
Durban 
with 
Bombardier 
Transportation; b, approve variation order for the 
relocation to Durban to a maximum value of 
10 
R618 457 125 with BT and c, sign off a letter to be 
issued to BT to accept their proposal.” 
As the Chair will then note the memorandum is also compiled by 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe.  She has signed it but has not dated.  
Mr Ravi Nair Acting Chief Executive at Transnet Freight Rail who 
signed it on 22 July 2015 in recommendation.  It was also signed and 
recommended by Mr Ndiphiwe Silinga a Group Executive Legal and 
Compliance on 22 July 2015.  It is also signed and recommended by the 
Group 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
at 
the 
time 
Mr Anoj Singh 
on 
22 July 2015.  Also signed and recommended by the then Chief 
20 
Executive 
of 
Transnet 
Engineering 
Mr Thamsanqa Jiyane 
on 
22 July 2015 as well as Mr Garry Pita Group Chief Procurement Officer 
on 22 July 2015 and then below that is the approval signature of 
Mr Siyabonga Gama on 23 July 2015. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
Before 
we 
leave 
that 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 31 of 212 
 
memorandum I would like to take you back to page 9131.  At 9131 
under the heading a, “Further Price Escalation”.  You read four items 
and at times it would appear that it is a direct - as you confirmed I think 
– a direct quotation from the BT proposal? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now I would like to refer to the paragraphs 
that follow that.  There are two paragraphs the first starting: 
“If the variation order is not issued by 24 July and 
subsequent …” 
Can I take that to now be the drafter of the memorandum speaking?  It 
10 
is no longer a quotation – direct quotation – from the proposal. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is drafted in that manner but it 
comes from the letter sent by BT to Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I under – but now this is what Ms Mdletshe as 
a drafter is saying – is informing. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Is communicating. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am interested in the paragraph thereafter 
and I want to see whether you – you consider it in your investigations 
20 
and whether you have got a clear understanding of it and if so to share 
the understanding with us.  It reads: 
“BTs current offer represented total discount of 32.5 
percent 
when 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
indicated potential price increase of approximately 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 32 of 212 
 
20 percent in instances where the notice of 
company proposed variation or the VO is not 
approved by 24 July 2015.” 
I have gone back to your slide 19 where you have listed the various 
price offers given by BT.  The highest was 634. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The highest known and the accepted offer – 
the lowest was 618 million which turned out to be the accepted offer? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am trying to understand this 32 percent 
10 
discount.  Where and how do I factor it in?  I do not if – unless my 
mathematics is failing me.  If you go to your slide 19 you will see the 
prices compared. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it is not explained. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In fact if one has regard to 
EXHIBIT BB8 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And at page 95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second please. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You now – you now want us to turn to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where – where are we – which page are we going to 
… 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 33 of 212 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are back to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just – just tell me again what the question was. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The question Chair emanates from page 9131 
of volume 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The volume at hand.  There is reference in 
that memorandum where it is stated that the B- Bombardier’s current 
price represents a total discount of 32.5 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I then referred Mr Mnyandu back to page 19 
10 
of his slide which has shown us all BTs cost offers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The highest coming in at 634 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the lowest coming in at 618 million.  It is 
against that background I seek an understanding as to where the 32.5 
percent saving … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is to be found accepting that perhaps I – I 
may have made an error in my mathematics. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Mnyandu is attempting to answer that 
question for me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Has referred us now to BB8C that is the slide 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 34 of 212 
 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And he has referred us in particular to page 
95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That will be under 6 Chair. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have got it thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  We have located TTM6. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair Ms Sello says in attempting 
10 
to answer the question when I am actually trying to compound the 
confusion even more. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh, okay. I was overly optimistic there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess you are – you are answering it by 
compounding it. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair this is a letter sent by 
Bombardier Transportation.  It is dated 7 July 2015. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is the covering letter of what was 
the final proposal sent by BT which as we have explained to the Chair 
20 
did not change materially but for what is recorded in the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is addressed to Transnet Freight 
Rail.  It is for the attention of Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe as well as 
Mr Frikkie Harris.  It says: 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 35 of 212 
 
“Copy 
to 
Mr Anoj Singh, 
Mr Thamsanqa Jiyane, 
Mr Garry Pita.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is titled:  “Price Reduction on the 
Notice of Company Proposal Variation Durban VO.” 
“Dear Lindiwe/Frikkie, we refer to our last notice of 
company proposal variation submitted to Transnet 
Freight Rail …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or rather latest? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To our latest. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Refer to our latest. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Latest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to last. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Oh, apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  “We refer to our latest 
notice of company proposal variation submitted to 
Transnet 
Freight 
Rail 
(TFR) 
as 
per 
our 
correspondence 
which 
has 
a 
reference 
of 
BT/TFR/C/15/0034 
dated 
10 April 2015. 
 
As 
20 
discussed into our ongoing discussions …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or described. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Oh described. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
“…into 
our 
ongoing 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 36 of 212 
 
discussions 
Bombardier 
Transportation 
has 
endeavoured to minimise project impact from the 
change of TE Facility from Koedoespoort to Durban.  
As a further show of good faith BT is willing to offer 
an additional discount of 2.5 percent.  In evaluating 
the discount please take into consideration that this 
reduction in reality is much higher due to the fact 
that since our first offer notice of company 
proposed variation in 2014 we have already 
absorbed 
the 
following 
costs: 
 
further 
price 
10 
escalation, financing costs of our own additional 
efforts, our suppliers and already accumulated 
stock and claims from the suppliers that we have 
already rescheduled and delayed.  The revised 
amount after the 2.5 percent discount will be 
R618 457 125.” 
Chair for the purposes of what we are trying to communicate we can 
stop there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In reading this letter … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But even on BTs own account 
insofar as this letter is concerned on 7 July … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Which notes the final offer made … 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 37 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  There is no talk or mention of a 
discount amounting to 32.5 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is 2.5 percent? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So I guess it is a question of the author will 
10 
explain to us whether 32.5 percent discount is derived from? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because that is what is communicated to the 
Acting GCE? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we get there though was there any 
documentation you were able to come across in the course of your 
20 
investigations that would support a claim of a 32.5 percent discount? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I would like to say to the Chair at 
this moment that as we said yesterday there is documentation sent by 
Bombardier Transportation towards the end of 2014 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 38 of 212 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Which will be provided to the 
Commission which sought to be explanatory or letters that were 
explaining or expanding on the offers of Bombardier Transportation to 
Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja but – yes I understand but an analysis of 
that very documentation together with what we have before us were you 
able to establish definitively that this would – the negotiations have 
resulted in a 32.5 discount? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No we were not. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you made the point that the memorandum that 
you were reading talks about a certain discount.  Is that right? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Discount which you say cannot be found in this letter 
from BT.  Is that right? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the amounts once they talk about different 
figures that should affect the amounts.  Does it affect the amounts – 
the final amount or does it not affect – I just – did not - have not looked 
at it.  The amounts that they talk about in – in the memorandum in 
20 
regard to BT compared to the amount BT talks about in this letter where 
they do not mention this other discount that the memorandum talks 
about. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair if one has regard to the fact 
that the first offer in September 2014 … 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 39 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Is some R634-odd million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  A 32.5 percent discount … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Would be much more significant 
than the amount moving from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  634 to 618. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not do the exercise of – of establishing – 
establishing exactly what the amount would be the real amount if … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair we did not do the 
exercise based on the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  32.5 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So I think it would be important to – for 
somebody to do it if we have not done it also. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair it would be an arithmetic exercise 
20 
really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it is an arithmetic exercise. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is a calculator. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The first offer is 634. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 40 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The last and acceptable offer is 618 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now one can work out on a calculator what 
that represents by way of percentage – the discount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is what I am talking about, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What I was trying to determine is – is there 
another figure we are missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That if we incorporate into the calculation will 
10 
give us the 32.5 percent discount because whatever discount there may 
be from 634 to 618 is not 32.5, that would bring us closer to the 
400million mark if it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what I’m looking at is to see whether there may 
have been some genuine errors somewhere by somebody or whether 
there is much more to it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will Chair, it may be – instead of 32.5 it 
might be 3.25, we will do that calculation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Mr Mnyandu you make the point that both 
20 
the BT and the CNR memoranda to Mr Siyabonga Gama were approved 
on the same day. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the costs of relocation as quoted by both 
were accepted by Transnet. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 41 of 212 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may proceed then from there. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair having taken you through the 
approval process followed we now deal with the involvement or the 
limited involvement of Transnet Internal Audit…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we do that, what it does mean is that when 
you put the two amounts approved for both BT and CNR then you have 
about what, 1,4billion? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It’s an aggregate amount of 
1.2billion. 
10 
CHAIRERSON:  About 1, - I think it should be about one more than 
that, both are more than 600million…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  647 and 618. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – or is it just under 1.3? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    It’s just under 1.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright, for the relocation – for the so-called 
relocation costs. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Of both OEM’s, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, now before we proceed let me ask this question.  
20 
When you look at both memoranda, the one from CNR and the one from 
BT, they appear to say, look, this money that we are asking you to 
approve has already been – or falls under contingencies, contingencies 
that have already been approved, so it’s really not a problem, you 
know, just approve, okay and it looks like, then Mr Gama is satisfied 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 42 of 212 
 
and then approves.  So now, since we know that from the memoranda 
that was sent to him, both in regard to BT and in regard to CNR, did not 
really include motivation by the compiler of the memoranda as to why 
those amounts were acceptable.  The question would be, whether, when 
contingencies 
were 
approved 
there 
was 
anything 
that 
related, 
specifically to these so-called – this so-called relocation or whether 
contingencies were simply approved on the general basis, whatever 
contingencies may come up, they should be taken care of under this 
amount we’ve put aside for four comma something billion rand as I 
recall.  So is that something that your team looked at as to see whether 
10 
one can say, look the approval of the contingencies, the information 
that was before those who approved contingencies was such that there 
was no need when this request was made, to interrogate this issue 
more because it had already been dealt with, is that something you 
looked at? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Chair, I’d like to draw your 
attention to the fact that we’ve said the 23 May memorandum prepared 
by Mr Brian Molefe, insofar as it relates to 4.9billion rand for 
contingencies it makes mention of the use or the allocation of Transnet 
Engineering Durban facility in order to stimulate, amongst other 
20 
reasons, the economic trade of South Africa along the coast line.  
However, there is no line item that speaks to a certain number that then 
budgets for the “relocation”.  However, Chair even if there was, our 
view, based on the findings we have come to and what one would 
expect from standard contract management protocol, even if it was, that 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 43 of 212 
 
an exact amount of 1.5billion rand had been set aside, that would not 
excuse Transnet and its officials from reviewing, critiquing and seeking 
a justification from each of the OEM’s for the costs.  One certainly does 
not work from the premise that there is 2billion rand in the kitty and 
therefore if one claims a billion, which is 50 percent of that I’m going to 
be comfortable with it.  It’s something that we considered and we came 
to that conclusion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would really expect them to interrogate these 
issues but I’m just trying to see  what kind of possible justification they 
might have because it’s a lot of money and you expect that they – any 
10 
memoranda that seeks to say such big amounts must be approved 
would deal with why it’s acceptable to pay in the first place and why it’s 
acceptable to pay the particular amount in the second place, how is 
that amount made up, what are the items, you know, and that’s lacking 
in both memoranda, so – ja, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Chair.    It is, as the Chair states, 
and the reasons perhaps might be advanced at a future date when the 
Chair has the opportunity to talk to some of the drafters and approvers 
of these memoranda’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes – no we’ll have to hear from them it’s a lot of 
20 
money and as Mr Mnyandu says you don’t expect people to say, look 
there is budget for it so we can just pay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You are now turning your attention Mr 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 44 of 212 
 
Mnyandu to the involvement or non involvement of TIA. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair, Chair just as an 
overview we cover this in our report, the Transnet Procurement 
Procedures Manual which was applicable at this time of volume 3 2015 
requires that for any contract negotiation or variation, that exceeds 
50million rand as an estimate must involve the high value tender team 
which is Transnet Internal Audit who must undertake through each and 
every stage of such negotiation, what are called, gateway reviews.  You 
will recall Chair that when we took the Chair through the transcript of 
the meeting held – rather the meetings held with each of the OEM’s on 
10 
19 June 2015 there was a representative from the high value tender 
team or the Transnet Internal Audit team.  Chair we’ve got a report from 
Transnet Internal Audit dated 7 June 2017, it is found in volume 13 of 
page rather at page 9147, it’s not necessary to take the Chair through 
the report because in the slide we highlight the salient parts.  They 
confirm that they attended the initial meeting held - or rather meetings 
held with each of the OEM’s on 19 June 2015.  The report specifically 
records that the lead of the negotiations Mr Anoj Singh was the Group 
Chief Financial Officer at the time, requested that the bidders submit 
revised proposals that would explain their offers in more detail and the 
20 
report also confirms that a follow-up meeting was then scheduled for 23 
June 2015 for further negotiations.  The report also then recalls that 
unfortunately Transnet Internal Audit was not invited to subsequent 
meetings where the negotiations for the relocation costs then 
continued.  The report also makes mention of the fact that a 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 45 of 212 
 
representative of Transnet Internal Audit Ms Emma Moletsane was 
copied in the email correspondence of Mr Gary Pita on 10 July 2015, in 
which, as we’ve taken the Chair through this morning, there was a 
request that Transnet Internal Audit sign off on the – to use the word 
loosely, the prudency of the costs of relocation, having confirmed that 
the necessary gateway reviews were undertaken.  As we’ve taken the 
Chair through it, it is made mention of in the report that, that request 
for a signature – a review never came through to Transnet Internal 
Audit and therefore the report concludes by saying that, unfortunately 
the Transnet Internal Audit team is not able to confirm that, indeed, the 
10 
process followed was in accordance with what is required by the 
Procurement Procedures Manual. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I see at page 9147, which is the actual 
report, it is addressed to Mr Siyabonga Gama, the Group Chief 
Executive. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it’s a report by Internal Audit for Mr 
Siyabonga Gama dated June 2017.  At page 9152, which is the 
signature page of that document, I see Mr Siyabonga Gama has signed 
it which means he became aware of his contents. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Understanding then that TIA – TIA’s 
involvement 
in 
this 
entire 
transaction 
was 
minimal 
to 
none?  
Understanding from this report, that there is no confirmation that what 
you call gateway reviews were conducted at all relevant points or 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 46 of 212 
 
junctions. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you know what Mr Gama’s response or 
reaction to this report was? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it is actually at page 9152, 
apart from noting it, and it is dated that he noted it on 8 June 2017, he 
has scribbled a note and I’d like to read it into the record for the 
Chair’s benefit. 
 
“in a letter to acting Group Chief Executive on 23 July 
 
reference is made to the effect that the high value tender 
10 
 
report is being finalised.  I would like that the Edge VT report 
 
is produced.  Further all information required for same must be 
 
made available to the CAE”,  
 
which is for Chief Audit Executive, the Chair will see that next 
to Mr Siyabonga’s signature is the name Ms Mmathabo Sukati who was 
the Chief Audit Executive and she has signed.  Chair the letter that Mr 
Gama refers to in this regard can only be the two memoranda that we 
read for the Chair, for the approval of the costs, the Chair will 
remember that under background and just before motivation it notes 
that TIA, Transnet Internal Audit, was part of the negotiations and the 
20 
finalising the report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the – I see now where Mr Siyabonga Gama 
has signed it reads now, Group Chief Executive, and this is June 2017 
and by this time had been a permanent appointee to that. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 47 of 212 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when he says in the note, in a letter to 
AGCE, that’s Acting Group Chief Executive, who is he talking about? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  He is referring to himself Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh he’s speaking about himself in the third 
person? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    In the third person. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay besides that note, do you know whether 
Mr Gama took any particular steps in regard to the process followed 
and the concerns raised here or recorded in any document what he 
proposes be done about non-compliance, which I think this report 
10 
constitutes? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your investigation did not find anything suggesting 
that the high value team report that he said should be made available 
to CAE, namely the Chief Audit Executive, you found no evidence that it 
was made available to the Chief Audit Executive? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We found no record Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did you ask the Chief – the particular Chief or 
did the Executive whether she – is it a she? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is a She. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  She ever received it? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes we did ask but it was never 
received.  Chair I would just like to note as well that the note in itself 
and the request to use the word used by the Chair yesterday is strange.  
It is strange for the reason that the report from Transnet Internal Audit 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 48 of 212 
 
records that in light of the fact that we have not been able to fully 
partake in the negotiations out of, not our fault, we are unable as the 
Internal Audit Team to provide assurance that the process was followed 
out in accordance with the spirit and purport of what’s contained in the 
procurement policy manual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay when and where do they say that, is that 
something we have just dealt with or is it one of the things we didn’t 
read in relation to this letter to the date of this signature by Mr Gama, 
when was this, when they said this? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair this was in 2017 – it’s 7 June 
10 
2017 it is something that we did not read into the record but if the 
Chair is able to, we’d like to turn your attention to page 9151.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I would just like to read the 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes this is just – just – this is a memo from Transnet 
Internal Audit addressed to Mr Siyabonga Gama, Group Chief Executive 
and what date – there’s no date given on the first page, what date was 
it…(intervention). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair the first date – the first page 
20 
notes a date at 9148 as 7 June 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  7 June 2017, there is a stamp on the right-hand side, 
on the left-hand side it’s…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 9148? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  9148, apologies Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 49 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it was received by the office of the Group Chief 
Executive, which would have been Mr Gama at that time. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It was received on the 7 t h of June 2017 and it 
was coming from the internal auditor, is that right? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so now we know that’s June 2017 and – that’s 
June 7, so he is making this note the following day? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might or might not have seen it yet, isn’t it? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I beg yours Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He might or might not have seen it yet.  What do you 
say, if it arrived the previous day in his office and he signs the 
following – he signs this memo the following day we don’t know whether 
he had – it had reached him or am I missing something? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair he comments on the actual 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this is the memorandum he’s commenting on? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay in a letter to – on 23 July reference is made to 
20 
the fact that the HVT report is being finalised, I would like that the HVT 
report is produced, is this the HVT report? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In his note that we’re talking about after – below his 
signature, he talks about a letter to himself, as you have told us, which 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 50 of 212 
 
is dated 23 July, this is not this note at 9148/9149 hey? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair can we take you to 9148. 
CHAIRERSON:  Yes I am at 9148. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The subject reads HVT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  HVT negotiations for Durban relocation, yes, CNR 
consortium and BT, Bombardier, yes for your approval/signature, 
comments.  You might be able to read that better, that handwriting AD 
Thomas/ Gary Pita, kindly ensure that all information that was required 
for the HVT report is produced or be produced – is made available to 
the CAE in order for the HVT to finalise its report.  So who is writing 
10 
there because that is addressed to Mr Gama isn’t it? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you go to his note on page 9152 he seems 
to repeat that. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that why you say he’s commenting on it? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the letter of 23 July is some other letter? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair as we’ve said we haven’t 
found a letter of 23 July, it can only be, in our deduction, the two 
20 
memoranda that were prepared for him in respect of BT and CNR 
respectively for him to approve the relocation costs.  We say so 
because in the memorandum, it is recorded that Transnet Internal Audit 
was part of the negotiations and is completing its report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, so – and those were signed on the 22 n d we 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 51 of 212 
 
might just have made a mistake by saying 23 instead of 22. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes they were compiled on the 22 n d 
and everybody that signed and recommended did so on the 22 n d, he 
signed them off the next day on the 23 r d. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he signed on the 23 r d so that’s maybe the reason 
why he used the 23 r d. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so what do you make of his – you were making 
a certain point about is note below his signature at 9152, that is what 
triggered my questions, yes there was a point you were making. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In order to try and…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was strange that he made this note. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just repeat that point. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   And we would like to take you to 
9151. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The request was that we read for 
you, Chair, the conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  There are three paragraphs, they 
read as follows, 
 
“TIA was not invited for subsequent negotiation meetings  
 
where negotiations on relocation costs were discussed with the 
 
bidders in attendance as required per the high value tender 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 52 of 212 
 
 
methodology.  Paragraph 7, despite the Group Chief Supply 
 
Chain Officer’s request for Transnet Internal Audit to sign off 
 
on the memo that was to be sent to the acting Group Chief 
 
Executive for approval, Transnet Internal Audit was not 
 
provided with the memo or the outcome of the negotiations or 
 
the letters of acceptance of the proposals by the acting Group 
 
Chief Executive.  Finally, paragraph 8 records, based on  
 
Transnet Internal Audits limited involvement in the process  
 
indicated above, a formal report to indicate adequacy and/or 
 
effectiveness of the process undertaken in the Durban 
10 
 
relocation negotiations could not be produced”.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh now I see the point you are making, you were 
saying – you were saying how could he be talking about the production 
of that report because he had just been told in that memo that TIA 
cannot – could not produce anything because of their limited 
involvement. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then following on that, what one would 
expect from a Group Chief Executive is to engage with the conclusions 
20 
and the consequences – the conclusions drawn at 678 by the internal 
audit and then to address himself to the consequences of the exclusion 
of internal audit from the process? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  One would expect so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is there any documentation that would reflect 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 53 of 212 
 
that he did? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No there isn’t. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, are you aware of whether or not Mr 
Siyabonga Gama ever made any follow-up, either on this report or the 
note he makes on the report itself? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   No Chair, we are not aware. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, if that’s all you intended to highlight on 
the internal audit report, we are ready to proceed but I think the Chair 
might not – might want to have – might have a question or two on the 
report still. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No we can continue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair prior to 
taking you through slide 32 I’d like to give you context as to how it 
came about that we instructed the people that we instructed on behalf 
of Transnet to conduct an assessment of the relocation costs and the 
negotiations.  Having formed a prima facie view on face value that the 
costs of relocation of both OEM’s were excessive we deemed it prudent 
to acquire the services of a rail logistics company that also is in the 
business of manufacturing locomotives and would therefore have the 
20 
necessary knowledge on how much it would cost to set-up production 
lines in the coast.  We then instructed Loliwe Rail Solutions, a team led 
by Mr Kevin McGill of the company to conduct an assessment for us 
and provide a report on the final proposals accepted by Transnet in 
respect of the relocation costs.  Chair this is to be found in volume 13 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 54 of 212 
 
on page 9446, what we have tried to do for the Chair in slide 32 is to 
summarise the salient findings made by Loliwe Rail Solutions as an 
independent expert as it were which supports he prima facie view or 
views that we held in relation to the relocation costs approved and 
accepted by Transnet and basically Chair Loliwe Rail Solutions, in their 
report come to the following conclusions.  That there was no relocation 
of either OEM, that the variation orders were inflated intentionally by 
the OEM’s and inadequately evaluated by Transnet prior to the 
conclusion and approval of the amendment of the contracts.  That 
there’s no justification for either the direct or the indirect costs 
10 
presented by BT and CNR.  That it was improper for Transnet to have 
agreed to lump sums for the relocation.   
 
The Chair will recall that when we took you through the 
memorandum of – in respect of CNR there was a request that CNR be 
paid an upfront payment 323million rand which is 50 percent of what 
had been agreed to.  That the approval of the direct and indirect costs 
was done without the presentation of valid and substantiated 
documentation and finally, that the process followed in the approval of 
the relocation costs was not in accordance with the standard contract 
management protocol.  Just on the last point Chair, we’d just like to 
20 
draw your attention to the fact that when reference is made to standard 
contract management protocol it is not a drafted standard by anybody 
who approved and gazetted by anybody but it speaks to the norm in the 
industry of manufacturing, construction and  engineering and what it 
actually points out is to the fact that if there is to be a variation that 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 55 of 212 
 
the parties accept is going to increase in cost because in certain 
instances what only increases, is the duration of a contract or a 
project.  If there is to be an increase in cost then there is an agreed 
amount that is reached or rather reduced to writing and people or 
contractors alike then claim on proven cost, to say, this is how much we 
agreed upon, this is now what I’ve produced, here are the invoices 
related to the particular claim and therefore you need to pay me this 
certain amount.  Chair arising from our prima facie view as well as the 
findings of Loliwe Rail Solutions we then take you through our findings 
which is the conclusion of the presentation and note to you our 
10 
recommendations to Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you have said something about invoices and I 
was still to ask whether apart from the fact that the two entities gave 
their quotations and there was – there were terms of payments that 
they put forward which Transnet agreed to payment ultimately when it 
was done was it done on the basis of any invoices and supporting 
documents and so on?  Here I have in mind that if you have had to buy 
some material which are for this so called relocation you can produce 
what you have spent on them? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair without speaking out of turn 
20 
because we have been advised by the evidence leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That a witness from Transnet  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Will come and testify as to the 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 56 of 212 
 
payments done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We can confirm  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That insofar as firstly CNR is 
concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  An invoice was drawn for an 
amount – drawn up for an amount of R368 million this is inclusive of 
tax. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  At 14% at the time and it was 
subsequently paid.  The details in relation to payment will be as we 
say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Expanded upon by a different 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Insofar as BT is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We can confirm that as at the date 
on which Transnet took the decision to stop making payments in 
relation to the two variation orders an amount of R248 710 000,00 had 
already been paid in respect of its relocation costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay thank you. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 57 of 212 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  That then leads you to MNS own 
findings.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May you proceed? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair the first and the most 
obvious finding that we have made is that the relocation costs were 
excessive.  I would just like to add to that Chair that it seems Transnet 
communicated to both OEM’s that they would be located at a different 
facility as opposed to the Koedoespoort that had initially been 
proposed or spoken of.  It is not clear as to why Transnet then chose to 
10 
lock itself into agreements that would necessitate the execution of 
variation orders.  As I say Chair it is not clear and we have not been 
able to find the reason for this but it was certainly not prudent to 
conclude the agreements on the basis of one aspect that is clearly not 
going to be beneficial for Transnet.  Chair insofar as the approval of 
the relocation costs are concerned we have found that the former 
Group Chief Executive at the time Mr Siyabonga Gama breached the 
provisions of Section 76[3] of the Company’s Act insofar as he was 
required to exercise fiduciary duties and to take particular care and be 
diligent insofar as the execution of his duties are concerned in that he 
20 
authorised the expenditure of R1.2 – an aggregate amount of R1.2 
billion without satisfying himself as to the cost analysis that had been 
done by his team that negotiated on behalf of Transnet or a third party 
that would have been appointed by Transnet.  Chair this would have 
been reasonably expected of a Group Chief Executive, a person in his 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 58 of 212 
 
position who had been with Transnet at the time for well over fifteen 
years.  Had served not only as the Group Chief Executive but had the 
knowledge and expertise experience of being the Chief Executive of the 
particular operating division that was making the acquisition in this 
regard.  We have found Chair as a result that a portion of the amount 
which unfortunately cannot be quantified and it cannot be quantified for 
a reason I will explain amounts to fruitless and wasteful expenditure.  
Because Chair you raised a question earlier on and you requested that 
I deal with it before concluding the evidence.  It is accepted that the 
tender proposals were based on one understanding.  It could be 
10 
accepted by two parties – there is no entitlement – but it could be 
accepted by two parties contracting at arms-length that as soon as you 
change something as significant as my location then my price might 
change.  As I say Chair if it has not been provided for in the contract 
that we have signed then it must be dealt with by way of a variation 
order.  It having been accepted it would then have to have been 
quantified properly. In this case we found that it was not.  When one 
reaches the conclusion that the relocation costs were unjustifiable and 
therefore excessive there is the incurrence by Transnet of fruitless and 
wasteful expenditure which is contemplated by Section 1 of The Public 
20 
Finance Management Act.  Chair we have also found that the critical 
aspects of the advice that had been given by PWC during the beginning 
of 2014 was not carried through.  You will recall Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it might be convenient that I ask you questions 
in relation to what we have just dealt with before you proceed. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 59 of 212 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in relation to this – the use of relocation from what 
you are saying it would seem to me and I would like your comment it 
would seem to me that a relocation may have been just a wrong term to 
use but there would be legitimacy to any extra costs that may have to 
be discussed and negotiated that may have had to be discussed and 
negotiated between Transnet on the one hand and CNR on the other 
and between Transnet on the one hand and BT on the other arising 
from the fact that Transnet said you are now going to have to do this 
job from Durban and not from Gauteng.  It seems that to the extent that 
10 
that would give rise to certain costs there would be nothing wrong in 
principle in the idea that there will be – there would be additional 
costs.  What would remain is whether those costs are reasonable and 
whether procedures processes are followed that are supposed to be 
followed before those costs are approved and paid.  Does that accord 
with your understanding? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I would like to say instead of 
a statement that says they would have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I would qualify it by saying they 
20 
could have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And I say that or rather we reached 
the conclusion on the basis that it could very well be 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 60 of 212 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That we contract on the basis of 
R54 million per locomotive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And your base price and everything 
that you have included into the tender proposal or the agreement 
reached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Is actually reduced  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  By your location. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  So it does not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think we are on the same – on the same page.  
What I am saying – talking to the principle.  So you still have to justify 
the cost but in principle if the agreement was you will operate from 
here and then later on there is a decision to say no you have to operate 
from somewhere else if principle there is no problem with there being a 
difference in price or there being a possibility of higher costs – more 
costs – extra costs but they must still be justified.  If you are being 
moved from Pretoria to Johannesburg the cost might be minimal or 
20 
maybe there might not be any.  But if you are being moved from a place 
that is closer to one that is much further there may be more costs but 
each item of cost must be justified.  I think that – that is what you 
probably are saying as well? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 61 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Agreed in full. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the principle that there could be extra costs has 
no problem. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether those costs if they do arise 
are justifiable. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then if I may just follow up on that Mr 
Mnyandu.  But if the RFP and the contract subsequently concluded says 
you – let us say the RFP you are required to bid for production of the 
locomotives in Koedoespoort or any other location in South Africa and 
read that as a complete term.  If it read that way one would expect that 
in calculating your costs as a bidder you would take into consideration 
that this site for production might not necessarily be Koedoespoort and 
might be another position in South Africa and you will have catered for 
that eventuality.  Would that be an unreasonable expectation? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I am going to answer yes and 
no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I know what your answer should be.  Your 
answer – your answer has to be when you put in your bid for that you 
will say well if it is in Koedoespoort this is what the cost will be.  Since 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 62 of 212 
 
you have not mentioned what other place in South Africa I can only 
quote once I know which other place.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But the issue being that it is not really a 
change per se if the RFP contemplated that the production place might 
be different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it is not a change of place but in terms of course it 
makes it – it may make a difference. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It may make a difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It may result in an increase in cost or it may 
10 
result in a savings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In a decrease. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you only know whether it is an increase or a 
decrease once you know where? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then… 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did I guess your answer correctly? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair hundred marks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will test that after the hearing whether he 
did guess it correctly Chair.  You may continue Mr Mnyandu. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  As we have said 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 63 of 212 
 
we have found that the advice that was offered by PWC was not carried 
through in the negotiations.  The Chair will recall that the two points of 
advice that we gave evidence in respect of yesterday were that the 
OEM’s were to be requested to justify their costs.  And that secondly if 
the costs were going to be prohibitive then Transnet were to seek 
alternative measures where loosely used in the report of PWC 
additional costs would not be incurred.  And we reach this conclusion 
having regard even to the fact that there might have been those 
concerns that were raised initially in particular we draw your attention 
Chair and take you back to the email correspondences shared between  
10 
the – amongst the negotiation team members where Mr Laher writes to 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe and says:  here are my 18 areas of concern.  She 
responds two days later and she says:  Here if the revised proposal. 
And then he responds further to say:  Well my concerns have not been 
addressed save for a different offer in relation to payment terms.  So 
that engagement with the OEM insofar as it does not in the end result 
in a justification of costs means that there has not been an execution of 
the advice given originally by PWC.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did you establish who at Transnet got to know 
about the PWC advice?  Did you get to know a number of people who  
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who can say did become aware of it at one stage or 
another? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we confirm that we were 
advised by Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani his transcript is one of the appendixes 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 64 of 212 
 
to our report on relocation that the then Group Chief Financial Officer 
was the one who spearheaded or sought the actual advice from PWC 
and that he came back to them with a report from PWC and told them 
what it said.  So certainly the negotiation team prior to the conclusion 
of the contract knew of the advice from PWC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is going to be important to take further. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One the proof that they were aware of it but we also 
need to know whether the Group Chief Executive or Activing Group 
Chief Executive depending on when it was became aware of it and to 
10 
the extent that it was not followed what reasons – why it was not 
followed.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is just like the R9 million we need to establish 
each and every person in the hierarchy 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who got to know about it and what they did about it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But one thing we can establish already and 
20 
based on Mr Mnyandu’s response to the Chair’s question if that was – 
that report was – PWC Report as contracted for by Mr Anoj Singh and 
that is the Group Chief Executive you suggest. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Group Chief Financial Officer. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Group Chief Financial Officer.  We know from 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 65 of 212 
 
evidence adduced by Mr Mnyandu that Mr Anoj Singh was part of the 
negotiating team  
CHAIRPERSON:  He was the leader actually. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the negotiating teams for the relocation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So already one can – at least one member of 
that team was aware of the report [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A very important member. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A very important member of that team 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What would remain is the GCE. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Chief Executive of the Rail and Freight. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Freight yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Unit yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes we will close that loop Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we have 
found that there was a breach of the PPM by the entire negotiation or 
negotiating team of Transnet in particular Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe having 
20 
been the lead interface insofar as she failed to deal with the concerns 
that were raised to the satisfaction of her colleagues and in the interest 
of Transnet.  We have also found that the concluded agreement or 
rather the agreement concluded between BEX and CNR is a very 
suspicious one.  It brings into question and to sharp light the question 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 66 of 212 
 
of fraud and corruption which we get back to when we refer to our 
recommendations to Transnet.  We make the point in slide number 35 
that as an SCS which is Supply Chain Services Official and the lead 
interface for the negotiations Ms Mdletshe failed to adequately make 
use of an important internal structure even when she had been 
requested by the Group Chief Procurement Officer.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for the record that structure is? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The Transnet Internal Audit. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  We have found 
10 
that as – we already been highlighted that all members of the 
negotiation team those who recommended the costs did not act in 
manner that would have been expected of senior officials within the 
organisation of Transnet in their respective positions.  Chair in our 
recommendations and as a first base principle which is something 
related to a point that the Chair has raised this morning on invoices.  
We have recommended to Transnet that the two OEM’s be requested to 
provide a statement and debasement of the monies paid in respect of 
relocation thus far.  We have also recommended that Transnet consider 
the whole issue of the variation orders related to relocation within the 
20 
context of our findings in Volume 1 and to expand on that Chair just to 
explain in our legal analysis of the variation orders we have found that 
if the contract itself is unlawful for want of compliance with amongst 
other things Section 54 of the Public Finance Management Act then 
everything that follows from it is unlawful.  And so in the judicial review 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 67 of 212 
 
application that must now ensue Transnet must seek a just and 
equitable remedy that also incorporates the consideration of the 
relocation variation orders.  As a measure in order to limit the exposure 
already 
suffered 
by 
Transnet 
thus 
far 
we 
have 
specifically 
recommended to Transnet that they stop making all payments in 
relation to relocation. And finally Chair in relation to the CNR and BEX 
agreement that I said raises sharp interest and focus in relation to 
allegations of fraud and corruption we have recommended to Transnet 
that they consult law enforcement agencies in order to take the matter 
forward.  And that Chair brings us to the end of the presentation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are done. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am done Chair.  That brings us to the 
conclusion of Mr Mnyanadu’s testimony before you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Subject of course to the filing and 
consideration of the supplementary statement in respect of the issues 
raised by the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At that juncture the Chair will make a 
determination whether Ms Mnyandu – Mr Mnyandu need appear any 
further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 68 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  And there is also the affidavit that we 
talked about for the witnesses who came without an affidavit.  It may 
well be that when one takes the transcript of their evidence and one 
puts annexures – I am not sure it may well be that it might serve that 
purpose I am not sure but if – if it is – if one could have an affidavit 
that basically repeats the evidence that they have given but now puts it 
in affidavit form without the interruptions and everything that may be 
very convenient. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will look into that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if there is difficulty in one or another about that I 
10 
am open to another option that involves using the transcript. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But when you talk about Mr 
Mnyandu and Mr Sedumedi these are lawyers  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once they have got to transcript of their own 
evidence they could even prepare that themselves and just bring you a 
draft of their affidavit and you can just have a look but it must be 
something that you know goes in accordance  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That has got value. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the evidence they have given.  And as an 
affidavit it might then attach annexures.  If it does not attach annexures 
it could just indicate that the particular annexure appears in volume 
whatever. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 69 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what page then it would be convenient.  So at least 
with regard to them  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have a big job to do. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may on that we will give the affidavit a 
first shot we will see if it works.  Mindful of the fact that we do not want 
to make the Chair’s record unduly voluminous.  But if there is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is the Chair that prefers it that way. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The result might come with more 17 volumes 
and I am sure the Chair would not appreciate that.  But we will give it a 
shot Chair and if you permit us should we run into difficulties or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – ja if there are difficulties you… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Should it – if the affidavits fail to address the 
point that the Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Raises we shall revert Chair and we will 
consider other ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think with lawyers it is much more easier. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will leave it to the two lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because your involvement will be limited.  They can 
draw the affidavits themselves. They know what their evidence was.  
They know what documents they referred to in their evidence. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair I just need to check that both 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 70 of 212 
 
lawyers are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are here. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes they are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they both agree. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They both agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you very much Mr Mnyandu for coming to 
give your evidence to the extent that there might be – there will be 
some aspects that still need to be addressed you will address them 
together with the Ms Sello but thank you very much.  You are excused. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair we know we have encroached on the tea 
break somewhat but we are done.  The next witness is ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He will be led by my leader Mr – Advocate 
Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I do not know if he would like to address you 
now or after tea when he takes the podium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not look like he is keen to address me now. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then it will have to be after fifteen minutes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we will take the tea adjournment.  It is now twenty 
five past eleven we will resume at twenty to twelve.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 71 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How are you feeling? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well at the moment I am feeling 
okay but if necessary I will let you know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  No that is alright.  Okay, thank you.  The 
10 
files that I have here are they new files or what? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No those are old files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You can set them aside.  I am 
about to hand up a new file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair the evidence under the 
auspices of MNS Attorneys continues.  The author of Report 2B is 
Dr Jonathan Bloom and he will testify in respect of that report.  May I 
hand up his presentation which is EXHIBIT BB8D. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is based on MNS Report 
volume 2B.  I understand that during the course of his evidence 
Dr Bloom will on at least one occasion refer to the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry.  You just said it is based on 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 72 of 212 
 
MNS Report … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  2B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2B? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That report is in the files behind 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
In 
volume 
8/17 
but 
for 
convenience I have asked that a further copy of the report be made 
10 
with the same pagination number to save you having to look behind 
you.  If you want that I can give it to you otherwise you can rely on the 
one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please give me that.  That will be convenient.  
Zonneke (Chair speaking to Registrar).  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair the annexures and the 
report are volumes 8, nine and 10 I am informed but you will not have 
to go there.  What you have before you is sufficient for present 
purposes.  Then Chair the evidence goes to an explanation and expert 
opinion of Dr Bloom - we will qualify him in due course – but as a 
20 
precaution the legal team the evidence leaders in relation to Dr Bloom 
requested this week that the Secretariat nevertheless notify those 
persons mentioned of the fact that that evidence has been given.  That 
elicited a response from Nedbank and after discussions between 
ourselves and Attorney Gerhard Rudolph of Allen & Overy representing 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 73 of 212 
 
Nedbank there was a request to place a statement on record which if 
you give me leave Chair I will do now.  It is the following: 
“According to the legal representatives of Nedbank 
– Nedbank was first provided with the MNS 
Preliminary Report volume 2A and 2B on the 
evening of 27 May 2019.  Nedbank and its advisors 
are studying the report with a view to providing the 
Commission with its comment thereon as soon as 
possible.” 
As I understand the intention of that communication it is simply to state 
10 
that they have not had enough time to respond in full but intends to 
cooperate with the Commission by giving full submissions.  What I have 
not placed on record and do not intend to do it at this stage is  the fact 
that 33 notices were issued earlier and the fact that there have been 
interactions between MNS and Nedbank prior to the 27 May but I do not 
want to go into any (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then Chair if I may by way of 
brief introduction explain or state what Dr Bloom is going to put before 
you Chair.  As you know the purchase of locomotives from China the 
20 
1 064 or part of the 1 064 involved a foreign manufacturer delivering 
locomotives across borders into South Africa.  Transnet could not pay 
for these locomotives immediately.  It had to borrow the money firstly 
off shore in Dollars and then later locally a syndicated loan in Rands in 
South Africa.  The contracts involved payments to China North Rail and 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 74 of 212 
 
China South Rail in Rands in South Africa.  The money loaned off shore 
would be in Dollars and exchanged across the border into Rands when 
brought into South Africa.  Further Chair the loan would not be drawn in 
one sum - at one time - but in a series of tranches or amounts over a 
period of time.  These are referred to as drawdowns and over this 
period of time obviously exchange rates which fluctuate and interests 
would fluctuate.  Inherent then in such a loan arrangement are risks.  
There is the risk that the exchange rate could alter to prejudice the 
borrower – Transnet – or the other way around.  There are interest rate 
fluctuation risks that higher interest rates might have to be paid over a 
10 
period of time if a floating rate loan was entered into.  There are credit 
risks.  There is the potential risk of Transnet – the borrower – being 
unable to pay the interest on the loan in some time in the future and 
there is what is known as and what will be referred to as a further 
related risk a contingent credit risk and that is the risk that Transnet 
might be unable to pay because of external factors.  A downgrade or a 
collapse in the economy or something that might have the result 
external to Transnet but also to Transnet that it could not pay the loan.  
Those are all risks that are attached to the transactions that were 
entered into and what financiers have done in their wisdom Chair.  They 
20 
developed a range of instruments to address these risks.  Some more 
complex than others and Chair the language attached to these risks 
derivatives hedging, contingent credit risks and the like is a foreign 
language and the purpose – one of the purposes – of Dr Bloom’s 
evidence is to facilitate an understanding of this so that our 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 75 of 212 
 
understanding can be used later in dealing with other witnesses and 
making submissions to you Chair.  So the evidence will seek to explain 
these financial instruments that are used to mitigate risk, hedging 
instruments.  The evidence will also show how these hedging 
instruments and the transactions related – Chair just to save you the 
trouble I have had this introduction typed out.  I do not know if you 
want a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, please. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So firstly Chair the evidence will 
seek – this is at the bottom of the page - to explain the use of hedging 
10 
instruments.  Secondly the evidence will seek to show how the 
implementation and use of these instruments were manipulated to 
benefit – to prejudice Transnet that should be – not benefit and to 
benefit third parties.  Thirdly to show how the financial advisors 
involved benefitted from these financial transactions and fourthly to 
place an opinion before you that in the view of Dr Bloom internal 
resources could have been utilised by Transnet making it unnecessary 
to outsource for these costly exercises.  Once this and other evidence 
is given Chair the legal team and its investigators are obviously not 
limited to the MNS mandate.  Our investigations and evidence will go 
20 
further and we will seek to build a picture of who made all these 
decisions.  When were these decisions made?  Why were these 
decisions made?  Who benefitted from these decisions and to try and 
establish … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what knowledge …? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 76 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Lings 
between 
all 
these 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess what knowledge they had in this sector.  
Did they have the right knowledge to make the decisions because one, 
if they had the right expertise but nevertheless made certain decisions 
that were maybe inexplicable that might point to an intentional … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To prejudice Transnet but if they did not have the 
required expertise that might not show intention but it might show 
negligence or even gross negligence but it might show – it might raise 
10 
the question of why they make decisions in a field in which they knew 
nothing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in fact Chair what Dr Bloom 
will help us with is to point us in the direction of those questions that 
we should be asking and also begin to build up some picture of 
possible answers and then the investigation and legal team will build 
on those hopefully to present before you a picture which might form the 
basis of findings that you may make which go much further than just the 
20 
transactions themselves.  Finally Chair in accordance with the directive 
you have given this week we will in the course of – of the next few 
weeks prepare an expert report in the normal form with expert 
qualifications and the like to present to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  That is fine. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 77 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  May the witness then be sworn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but just before that I think it would help if at the 
beginning of his evidence I could just be alerted to certain specific 
terms that one needs to understand from the beginning that he may be 
using that obviously I do not know about not being in his field of 
expertise. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – so that I – as we go on one know there is 
this term. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is what it means and so on. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We have tried to avoid in the 
first part … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that is not long … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The reference to any specialist 
term … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And at the appropriate time we 
20 
do intend to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  As long as by the time they 
are used … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have been alerted and (intervenes). 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 78 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair and – and I must say that 
for someone including that is not used to these terms … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Very often what an expert would 
do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is be confronted with a question 
about the proper meaning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of a particular term … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then use another technical 
term to explain it which does not really help someone in my position 
and I understand your position too Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we will – we will and with 
your assistance Chair to stop us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When necessary we will attempt 
to clarify … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  An understanding of these 
instruments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Pretorius that does happen and sometimes it 
is a bona fide mistake on the part of – of the expert.  Sometimes it is 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 79 of 212 
 
meant to show you how little you know. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In this field I am prepared to 
accept that we start from scratch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am sure other people say lawyers do the same. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of course we do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is just a different language. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just a different language.  The witness may be sworn 
10 
in please or affirmation maybe administered. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Jonathan Zorah Bloom. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that all the evidence you will give will be 
20 
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise 
your right hand and say so help me God. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  (duly sworn, states) 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 80 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Dr Bloom first up would you tell 
the Chair of your qualifications and Chair in this regard may I refer you 
to the green divider at the end of your bundle?  You will see there an 
abbreviated CV.  You must … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Dr Bloom with reference to that 
would you please tell the Chair of your qualifications? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Thank you Chair.  I hold a BCom 
Degree with majors in statistics and finance from Stellenbosch 
10 
University.  An Honours BCom Cum Laude from the same institution.  A 
MCom Cum Laude from the same institution.  A PhD in Business 
Management with the Corporate Finance Specialisation from the same 
institution. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And would you tell the Chair 
please of your experience in the field about which you are to testify? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sir I am sorry.  It is BCom from Stellenbosch you 
said. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And BCom Honours Cum Laude Stellenbosch? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then MCom Cum Laude … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  From Stellenbosch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which university, Stellenbosch? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 81 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  All the degrees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then PhD Cum Laude? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No.  Unfortunately there is no cum 
laude for a PhD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You thought you had had enough.  It is fine if you just 
get the degree.  No, thank – thank you Dr Bloom. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Your experience. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I have had the opportunity to – 
to consult on various financial matters to financial institutions in the 
10 
Financial Services Industry.  Also from a finance point of view in the 
Development Industry where – where Stellenbosch I held the position 
as Professor of Real Estate Investment and Financing and the idea 
behind that was that we – we prepared students for a chartered 
financial analyst qualification and I was part of the team that did that.  
So for the last 22 years although I was part – at Stellenbosch at that 
point in time as well I had the opportunity to consult in the industry and 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will tell the Chair of the 
20 
various financial instruments that financiers use and institutions use to 
mitigate risk in transactions such as the loans involved in the purchase 
of locomotives from China? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have experience in 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 82 of 212 
 
studying these instruments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair.  I – I investigated as part 
of this assessment the – the various instruments used and unpacked 
them to understand what Transnet did or what the service provider that 
assisted Transnet did in the execution of these instruments.  So the 
focus was essentially on the instruments used to hedge the risks 
related to the financing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  We will come to your 
actual work … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what you learnt from that 
work during the course of your evidence but the question I am asking is 
a more general question.  You have - and I may ask it again when the 
particular opinion that you express is relevant – but do you have 
general experience in the study and understanding of the use of risk 
avoiding instruments … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I do Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In financing? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I do Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  You were part of the MNS 
20 
Team that studied the transaction involved in Report 2B? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Over what period of time have 
you been working on this project? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair since September last year and 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 83 of 212 
 
it continues. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and what was your brief in 
sum? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM: 
 
My 
brief 
consisted 
of 
several 
components.  It started off by looking interestingly enough at the local 
content contributions and assessment thereof of the – of the OEMs 
specifically the China North Rail and China South Rail Locomotive local 
content.  It moved to understanding the advisory services that were 
provided through an LOI and an MSA.  In other words (intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is LOI and MSA? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The Letter of Intent and the Master 
Services Agreement that was actually testified to in this Commission by 
Mr Sedumedi in volume 2A and then after that I moved over to 
understanding how the – how several transactions were introduced in 
the financing of the vehicles and how the hedging of those – of the – of 
the risks associated therewith was – was done. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You have already 
introduced a word in the foreign language in which you are an expert – 
hedging.  Let us leave that for the moment. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But for the moment financial 
instruments used to mitigate risk. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And I have in my opening 
mentioned these briefly and you will deal with them in detail in due 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 84 of 212 
 
course? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As I understand it your evidence 
here deals only with the part of that part of the locomotives 
transactions involving China North Rail and China South Rail? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and as I understand it you 
have examined how the purchase of these locomotives were firstly 
financed.  Is that correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have also examined how 
the risks associated with the transaction - the loan transaction in 
particular – were dealt with.  Let us just put it that way for the moment. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we may then go to your report 
and deal with what we have placed on record by way of introduction 
more methodically.  At page 2 you have an introduction.  Would you just 
take the Chair through that please? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes.  Chair this is a – this is a 
prelude to the – to the actual work but it is necessary to provide the 
20 
context in what – in which the work that I did actually happened.  So 
the presentation deals with Transaction Advisory Services and as 
Mr Pretorius indicated it refers to 232 diesel locomotives from China 
North Rail and 359 electric locomotives from China South Rail.  So as – 
as part of the introduction Transnet appointed Transaction Advisors in 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 85 of 212 
 
2012 to provide it with a Transaction Advisor Services related to the 
acquisition of 1 064 locomotives and Transnet awarded at that time the 
Transaction Advisory Contract to the McKinsey Consortium in July of 
that year.  The scope of the contract was amended from time to time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  So before we proceed 
even before it enters into any transaction Transnet appointed advisors 
to assist it in obtaining a loan and determining how that loan would 
work - as I understand it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and that transaction 
10 
advisory contract was awarded to McKinsey in July 2012? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Tell the Chair of how the 
Consortium was initially composed please because we will see in the 
course of time the development of a transfer of the work to particular 
institutions which are central to the investigative work of the 
Commission. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The McKinsey Consortium Chair was 
led by McKinsey Incorporated - the South African branch of the 
company. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You are at page 3? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Page 3.  Correct Chair.  Comprising 
of McKinsey Incorporated as the main bidder, Letsema Consulting as 
the co bidder and then several sub-contractors - Advanced Rail 
Technologies, Nedbank Capital, Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs – ENS – 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 86 of 212 
 
(indistinct) Young Incorporated and (indistinct) Capital.  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then let us go to page 4 and we 
begin to see changes in who the transaction advisors are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry.  This might be a question that has 
nothing to do with you.  I just see that there is an indication of at page 
3 of those who were sub-contractors but I wonder whether they had – 
they had been put in as part of the consortium from the beginning but 
as I say it might be something that you know nothing about.  Somebody 
else would tell me about it. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright.  Mr Pretorius is there something that 
somebody wants to do to assist the witness? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you could just bear with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am just concerned that the 
progress on the screen is not as it should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We have wrestled control … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We have wrestled control from 
others over the screen Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we will take responsibility for 
any errors. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 87 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but – but I was concerned about the movement 
… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  That is – that is it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has been sorted out now? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I hope it has been sorted out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am told it can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay because any movement to the witness while 
the witness is giving evidence one needs to be careful about it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I understand that Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was entirely in order to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Take control of the screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I am – I mean I am advised if I am informed then it 
helps. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I do not know I do not know what is happening and 
… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anybody watching might be thinking the witness is 
being told what to say.  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  So … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I can assure you that that would 
be very difficult with Dr Bloom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I can imagine. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 88 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One would have to first learn a 
new language. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are we – are we okay now? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Can we go to page 4 
please?  Just explain at a very high level what happened to the 
sequence that you outline here … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And particular the composition of 
10 
the financial advisors. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  On 22 August 2012 Transnet raised a 
conflict of interest between Letsema and (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Dr Bloom. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do hear you, but maybe if you can just raise your 
voice a bit that will help. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   On the 22 n d of August 2012 Transnet 
20 
raised a conflict of interest between Letsema and Barloworld, it was 
based on this conflict that Transnet advised McKinsey or the McKinsey 
Consortium to consider the replacement of Letsema.  At the date of the 
appointment McKinsey Consortium excluded Letsema and it was 
replaced by Regiments. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 89 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right, so the first entry of 
Regiments into the Consortium was to replace Letsema? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And then what happened? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   And then subsequently Regiments 
would also replace Nedbank and Utu who were a consortium on their 
own or a partnership on their own, due to the conflict of interest as a 
member with the McKinsey Consortium and this occurred on the 19 t h of 
October 2013. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Just a comment, and I’m not 
10 
sure that you’re equipped to deal with it, but ordinarily when entering 
into arrangements of this sort and appointing transaction advisors in 
such an important series of transactions, one would imagine conflicts of 
interest would be dealt with before the appointment of the consortium? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair because 
typically you would ask the consortium members, do they have any 
conflicts of interest and it – and then that would be – in other words 
they wouldn’t be able to participate as a consequence so yes, you 
would sort that out, or you would address that right in the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And apart from asking, maybe, you may be expected 
20 
to do your own investigation of what may be in the public domain? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Absolutely Chair, it’s all part 
of…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Something very basic at least. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct it’s all part of the 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 90 of 212 
 
procurement process and the evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And then if you would go to 
page five please, there has been evidence and there will be more 
evidence concerning a session that took place in February 2014 and 
the proprietary in nature of that session but without going into any 
detail would you just tell the Chair please what happened then? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair on the 5 t h of February 
2014 McKinsey purported to cede their rights and obligations to 
Regiments for the transaction and that related to the 1064 locomotives 
10 
and what is important in this context is that Regiments was now 
responsible for the whole of the advisory services.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So if one reviews at a very high 
level, the sequence of events, in relation to the appointment of 
transaction advisors, one will see that initially Regiments was not part 
of the consortium but over a period of time in successive steps came to 
be the transaction advisor. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And the details of the manner in 
which this happened and any implications for our own investigations 
20 
and evidence that, that might have been the subject matter of other 
evidence. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What does volume 2 (B), that is 
the report that you authored I understand it. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 91 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What does volume 2 (B) 
provide? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   It provides a technical analysis and 
comment of the transactions, the regular transactions concluded by 
Transnet on the advice of transaction advisors. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And that would be transactions 
related to the borrowing of money to finance the purchase of 
locomotives. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And the financial instruments 
used to mitigate against the risk involved in this loan transaction or 
these loan transactions. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words it’s the product of the work of the 
transaction advisors to Transnet, to say this is our advice and this is 
the analysis on which it is based. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair that would be a typical 
situation to…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   To expect from that kind of report. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So if you would just go to the 
second bullet then on page six and tell the Chair what your 
presentation entails. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 92 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Chair the presentation and the work 
as well entitled the services and analysis of the services rendered by 
the transaction advisors, principally Regiments and he fees paid to 
them, that’s the first part.  The second part, the loans that Transnet 
concluded to purchase the Chinese locomotives which covered, and I 
think this is important to provide context because this is actually where 
it starts, a requirement existed for a loan of 2.5billion US Dollars to 
finance 
the 
Chinese 
locomotives 
that 
we 
are 
talking 
about…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   When you say CDB loan, what 
10 
is that talk of? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   It was the loan that was sourced 
from the China Development Bank in China and that was for an amount 
of 2.5billion.  What happened, subsequently, is that, that loan was split 
into two portions, 1.5billion that was drawn down as Advocate Pretorius 
also indicated in the introduction and a further 1billion that was 
reserved as a facility that Transnet could draw on should the need 
arise.  There was – just related to that 1billion rand facility Chair, there 
was not – there were no commitment fees that Transnet paid and we 
will see later that, that was shelved in favour of, what is the last bullet 
20 
on that slide, in favour of a 12billion syndicated South African Rand 
Club Loan. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right before you go on, the 
initial arrangement was that the loan entered into to finance the 
purchase of the locomotives from China would entail a loan from he 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 93 of 212 
 
China Development Bank in the amount of 2.5billion Dollars. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Then there was the change of 
mind and it was decided that only 1.5billion rand would be loaned from 
China, from the CDB. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And that another loan would be 
entered into which we’ve called the Club Loan or which was termed the 
Club Loan. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:    That’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   That was a loan entered into 
between Transnet and a syndicate of lender, principally. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   For the amount of 12billiion 
rand. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And then if you would go over 
the page to tell the Chair what else you’re going to deal with. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Chair the – what else is assessed is 
the risks associated with the loans and the processes to mitigate them 
20 
and there’s specifically, as Advocate Pretorius also indicated, there’s 
specifically three type of risks that we are interested in and that are 
applicable to the transactions.  The one refers to interest – movement 
in interest rates…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright so when I borrow money 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 94 of 212 
 
I pay interest to the lender. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   If – well in any situation 
whether it’s cross border or local those interest rates, as we know, 
fluctuate. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And what does – why is that a 
risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Because Chair, what can happen is, 
is that you borrow money at a certain rate which is fluctuating, which is 
10 
variable and if interest rates increase it will increase your cost of 
borrowing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right and then the second sub-
heading there, fluctuations in the exchange rate, you will also deal with 
that. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Why is that – well as we know 
that would only be a risk if the lender is outside the country and the 
borrower is inside the country. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You’ll have money crossing 
borders and exchange rates. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Why is that a risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   As we saw, the money that was 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 95 of 212 
 
borrowed was from the China Development Bank which was 1.5billion 
Dollars, that money had to be transferred to a South African bank and it 
arrives here in Dollars and because the contract with the OEM’s for the 
payment of the vehicles is in rand the money – the Dollars had to be 
converted to rand.  So if the rand starts to weaken then the cost of that 
borrowing also increases because they would want their money back in 
– the repayments on that loan they would want it back in Dollars.  So 
that places the borrower of the funds at risk. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So if the exchange rate moves 
against the borrower or to prejudice the borrower it could find itself in a 
10 
position where it could feasibly no longer afford to repay to the foreign 
lender. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Then the third category of risk 
is credit risk and you talk of two categories of credit risk what are 
those? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   The first category is the 
…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry just before you proceed, please don’t forget 
the question you were answering, I just want to go back to the answer 
20 
you gave to the previous question.  Does that – does the instruments 
that you’re talking about to mitigate some of these risks arise from the 
fact that if the borrower in South Africa and the lender in China, if their 
agreement simply said, this is what you owe me, maybe you’re going to 
pay me in two years time without making any other – including any 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 96 of 212 
 
other arrangements the lender could end up being paid at a much – at a 
lower amount in value, in real value or that’s not really what it’s about? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Chair I think basically what it boils 
down to is, that when the lender, especially a foreign lender finances 
something in a currency other than their own, then they would expect to 
obtain the repayments on that loan in the currency that they lent that, 
in other words US Dollars.  So they wouldn’t be worse off if I can put it 
that way, the risk shifts entirely to the borrower because the borrower 
is expected to pay in Dollars and therefore, in this particular case if the 
rand had to weaken substantially that would result in a tremendous 
10 
cash outflow for the borrower. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes well – so that makes it why it’s important for the 
lender to specify that the repayments would be in their currency if they 
were to allow the repayments to be in the currency of the borrower they 
might run the risk that the currency of the country of the borrower 
weakens and then they end up getting payments – repayments that are 
much less than the value that they lent. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s entirely correct Chair in other 
words – but they would never do that because they wouldn’t take the 
risk. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well there has been some evidence, I just can’t 
remember the details, there has been evidence in regard to something 
in this Commission, I think, about these transactions, I don’t know 
whether it was about Eskom or Transnet where the transaction was in a 
currency that was quite unexpected. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 97 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Volatile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can’t remember. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Volatile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can’t remember but the question, when you saw it 
that your answer is, but whey did they agree to use that currency 
because, you know, that’s not what you expect them to do, I just can’t 
remember the details, yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   As I understand it and by way of 
summary Dr Bloom, in this case and in many other cases, the foreign 
lender for example the China Development Bank says, if you want to 
10 
borrow money from me, I will lend you money in Dollars but you repay 
me in Dollars. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   If you have a problem with the 
exchange rate, then you must deal with it. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And the borrower then, in South 
Africa, might be faced with a situation where the rand weakens it has 
to, in effect buy Dollars to make a repayment of the loan from time to 
time or repayments from time to time and might find itself in financial 
20 
trouble or difficulty in repaying the Dollar amount 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Char. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Due to circumstances beyond 
it’s control, correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 98 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So what it says is, I have a 
substantial risk, just arising out of fluctuating exchange rates, they may 
move against me, right I must insure myself against that risk and that’s 
what we’re going to attempt to deal with in part of the evidence that 
you’re about to give. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if the – say South African, the rand strengthens, 
that might or maybe not might, will benefit me but that doesn’t 
necessarily mean the lender gets prejudiced, is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair, in other words 
10 
you’ll be paying less because the rand is strengthened so it’s working 
in your favour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but the lender remains in the same position that 
they were because it’s their currency that counts for them. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s entirely correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, and you’re also going to 
discuss the charges that the service providers charged for their 
services in relation to these transactions. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You say in the second bullet in 
– or on page seven, and you’ve described how the services were 
initially to be provided by McKinsey Consortium and subsequently 
Regiments, what in sum were the services, if they were contracted to 
provide. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 99 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Chair related to the raising of the 
finance, in other words accessing the finance for the acquisition to also 
deal with the – or structuring the deal in other words the negotiation of 
that loan and other advisory services relating to the mitigation of risk. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so they would advise on 
how to obtain finance, capital raising you call it. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   How those negotiations should 
be conducted and the final loan agreements should be structured. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And how Transnet should deal 
with the risks that you’ve talked about so far in your evidence. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What insurance policies you 
need and how these should be structured, I use the word insurance 
policy very loosely but it gives us an idea of what the third tranche of 
advice was about, that there are – that’s all there’s no real coincidence 
between an insurance policy and a financial instrument used to mitigate 
risk and we’ll clarify that in due course.  You deal on page eight with 
fees at a very broad level and you’ll go into more detail later what do 
20 
you say there on page eight, will you tell the Chair please. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair it – as previously 
discussed by other witnesses an initial contract for the advisory 
services was fixed at an amount of 35.2million, and it’s important to 
note Chair the words in parenthesis or in brackets where there was no 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 100 of 212 
 
performance fee payable. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Or no success fee you use the 
word success fee later. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct no success fee 
however, the role of Regiments expanded so did the fees payable to it 
but if I could continue, the contract value increase, in other words the 
capped amount of 35.2million…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   That’s fees for Regiments. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair, in December 2012, 
increased to 41.2million in February 2014, increased further to 
10 
78.4million in April 2014 and by July 2015 the amount that was paid to 
Regiments was 265.5million.  Just by the way Chair, these amounts 
exclude VAT or tax. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what was it within two and a half years they had 
increased from 35.2million to 265.5million? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes somewhere in new 
regulatory instrument within Transnet there is a provision that advisory 
services of this nature, in other words, professional advisory services, 
even in financing should be charged out an hourly rate, effectively, are 
20 
you aware of that? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair that’s correct and that is 
also the norm that advisory companies or firms charge their staff out is 
at a hourly billable rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And just on the face of it, to 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 101 of 212 
 
advise on a limited number of loans and a limited number of financial 
transactions to mitigate risk, 265million seems an extraordinary 
amount. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair it is – it does appear to be 
excessive. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you can say that from your 
own experience? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair, especially if – it would be 
very difficult to – you would have to have a tremendous number of 
people at very high rates working on that contract for an extended 
10 
period of time to get even close to that number and as a consequence 
that is – that appears extremely excessive for the purposes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   But you’ll deal with that in your 
evidence? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So if one looks at the 
information you’ve set out in the table on page 9, one can compare the 
total capital loaned by Transnet and the advisory fees charged by 
Regiments and actually paid by Transnet.  Could you tell the Chair of 
that please? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair in rand terms the 
2.5billion Dollars that we’ve been talking about translates to 28billion 
rand.  If we take the fee paid to Regiments, the 265.5million, excluding 
VAT that would represent about – almost one percent of that loan 
amount and as said this is well above the capped fee of 35.2million 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 102 of 212 
 
which is, as indicated, that is quite excessive. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Just to revert to the make up of 
the 28billion rand, there was an initial China Development Bank loan of 
2.5million rand only, right – 2.5billion, billion rand, sorry I have a cold 
so it may not have come across correctly, 2.5billion rand. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair, Dollars. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry 2.5billion Dollars, only 
1.5billion Dollars was actually utilised and then another loan replaced 
the 1billion Dollars that was the 12million rand Club Loan. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair the 12billion. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right on page ten you deal with 
what you’ve termed irregular success fees, please…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, Dr Bloom seeing that you are 
a numbers person as I understand the position, an increase from 
35.2million rand to 265.5million rand would be an increase of what 
percentage. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Chair if you give me one minute I’ll 
tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Chair that would imply a difference 
20 
of 754 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   754 Percent increase? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In two and a half years. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 103 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   On page ten you begin to 
explain some of these – or some components of these increases 
because there were various increases that happened over a period of 
time and you deal with some of those in detail. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Please tell the Chair what 
happened in April 2015 please. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That is when – Chair that is when 
Transnet’s Group Treasurer, Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi submitted a 
10 
memorandum to the Board Acquisition and Disposal Committee of 
Transnet BADC (indistinct) for inter alia, the following two points. The 
confinement of JP Morgan to hedge the financial risks, in other words 
to mitigate the risks which referred to interest rates, credit and 
currency and – which emanated from the 1.5billion CDB loan, that was 
then back into South African Rands and there’s a second part to the 
first bullet there Chair, that refers to also lead and underwrite the 
equivalent syndicated ZAR loan of the US Dollar.  In other words, that 
is to arrange the loan for 1.5billion Dollars, it’s the same – so the one 
is to hedge the risks or to mitigate the financial risks and the other is 
20 
to actually negotiate the loan. So there are two points in the first bullet.  
In the second one, to also motivate the contract extension of 
265.5million, the number that we’ve just spoken about for the 
appointment of Regiments Capital for an advisory or an Transaction 
Advisory Service and to support the Transnet 1064 locomotive 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 104 of 212 
 
transaction.  It sought to justify the extension of the contract by 
proposing a success fee of 166million and we’ve heard previously 
Chair, that success fees and performance fees were not permitted.  So 
this seems to be a bit irregular. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright we’re now back in April 
2015, as I understand the recommendation or the memorandum 
motivating approval of BADC dealt with the appointment by confinement 
and Chair has been told about confinement appointments of JP Morgan. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And they were to do two things, 
10 
one they were to assist and advise Transnet, mitigate against the risks 
inherent in these loan transactions. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   But also to lead and underwrite 
the equivalent syndicated ZAR loan of 1.5billion Dollars. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so it was risks and 
advisory services in respect of the loan itself. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And then there’s also a contract 
20 
extension to 265million, the 35million had by this time already been 
extended on occasion you’re not dealing with that. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   But you’re dealing with an 
increase of 166million which allowed the full amount to reach 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 105 of 212 
 
265million. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And that Mr Ramosebudi said to 
the BADC let’s give them a success fee or a performance fee. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you’ve stated that, that 
wasn’t allowed in the original contractual arrangement. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What did the BADC – isn’t there 
a duplication here. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well Chair the… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or we dealing with different 
loans? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No we dealing with the 1.5 billion 
CDB loan. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Only that loan in respect of these… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  J P Morgan and in relation to 
Regiments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In relation to Regiments that is the 
20 
265.5 million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, no what – what transaction 
advisory services are the subject matter of the contract extension? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words  
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 106 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words are we not dealing with a situation 
where two different people are asked to do the same thing? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair in other words they 
were – you – they were paid to do that work under the transaction 
advisory contract.  In other words that was not the – and it – there was 
no reason for the need to – to engage in a success fee arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think Mr Pretorius may be asking and that is 
part of what I also want to ask is once Regiments was there could they 
not do cover all of this or is this a part that they could not cover and 
10 
therefore J P Morgan had to be brought in? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that is - that is a duplicate – 
that could be a duplication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The – that is possible yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is possible. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is it something that you might be able to speak 
more confidently on after maybe reviewing more documents because it 
would be important to know if it is indeed a duplication in terms of work 
20 
to be done or whether it is not? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair yes I can maybe just add. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  To enlighten that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 107 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That in this transaction when J P 
Morgan was appointed when they started this Regiments was their 
supply development partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So they were part of J P Morgan and 
then they were – it appeared that they were still doing other work and 
being paid. So what the arrangement between Regiments and J P 
Morgan was I am unclear about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But it appears that they did not have 
10 
the in terms of hedging the – or in terms of mitigating the risks 
Regiments could not do that part of the exercise because J P Morgan 
had a very strong balance sheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And in order to have sufficient 
financial muscle you would need a firm such as them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So I will look into that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And come back to you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us stay with the 
insurance analogy for the moment.  We going to ditch the insurance 
analogy in due course but the insurer who insures against risk must 
have the capacity – the financial capacity to meet its obligations. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 108 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that is why J P 
Morgan was considered and appointed as the for the moment insurer? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The risk mitigater counterparty.  
Right.  But you say that Regiments already had a presence in that 
arrangement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  As the supply development partner 
yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To J P Morgan? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Regiments had a presence in 
both these series of arrangements? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It appears so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But what did BADAC decide then 
after this recommendation was put before it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair they decided BADAC or the – 
decided not to appoint J P Morgan to lead and underwrite the US dollar 
1.5 billion loan.  In other words that one – one recommendation that 
was made to this committee was removed at that point.  So only – the 
20 
only thing that J P Morgan was – was mandated to do in terms of this 
approval was to essentially hedge or mitigate the risk related to that 
loan. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So J P Morgan then was 
appointed with Regiments in the wings to deal with the risk mitigation 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 109 of 212 
 
aspect of this group of transactions that you are going to talk about? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And who was the lead 
underwriter – the leader and underwriter of the loan, the loans involved 
or the 2.5 – 1.5 billion dollar loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well Regiments – Regiments 
arranged that in terms of or they – they were – they – because BADAC 
did not approve J P Morgan’s appointment for underwriting or lead and 
underwriting that was taken over by Regiments.  And the under – the – 
who underwrote … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But Regiments was already in 
the picture because of the transactions you have already described.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct this was in addition to the 
work. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  As the Chair has 
requested perhaps a thorough analysis of the agreements and 
arrangements. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Between Transnet and its 
advisors will be included in your final report. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That we will present.  But on the 
face of it a question that arises and I am not sure you can answer it 
now or it has been answered to date is there just seems to be a 
duplication in the recommendation by Mr Ramosebudi if one has regard 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 110 of 212 
 
to the wording you have used in your presentation.  Because if you look 
at the first bullet J P Morgan was requested to be appointed on 
confinement to lead and underwrite the equivalent syndicated rand loan 
of 1.5 billion dollars and it seems that the same appointment exists in 
the second bullet and had already been made in terms of the 
arrangement you have already described? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Is that correct?  Alright.  Then if 
you would go over the page please to page 11 you there deal with the 
success fee or performance fee and you make a comment, what is that? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair as we – as mentioned 
previously no success fee Transnet does not permit success – the 
charging of success fees so no success fees should have been charged 
or paid as services performed as part of the transaction advisory 
services for Regiments as they had already been appointed and this 
issue will be dealt with separately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay but there are two points 
you make.  The one is that the Transnet policies do not permit the 
payment of success fees. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or performance fees. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  They are presumably 
too subjective and too random and incapable of precise definition. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 111 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair it is a – it is essentially 
about what percentage you want if I can put it that way and what is the 
amount that a percentage is being applied to?  So yes it – from a 
success fee basis it is a question of you take risk if you doing it on that 
basis.  In other words if you are not successful in terms of what your 
mandate is then you do not get paid.  If you are you do get paid.  But 
that was not Transnet policy. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but in this case the success 
fee was just one component of a much larger fee? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is not as if Regiments took 
any risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They just got an added success 
fee as a bonus or thank you? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But anyway you say that – you 
say two things I think or you have already said two things.  One is 
Transnet policy does not permit success fees. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you also say that the 
original contractual arrangement did not permit a success fee? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair that is true. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and then the second bullet 
what do you say there? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 112 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that just to follow this – so are you saying as 
you understand Transnet’s agreement with Regiments it was that – they 
would be paid for their services initially without any success fee.  There 
was no success fee mentioned because Transnet policy does not allow 
that. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So whether they had succeeded or not they would still 
have been paid, is that right? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  As part of their transaction? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of that kind of arrangement. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct as part of their transaction 
advisory fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but later on what happens is that Mr Phetolo 
Ramosebudi prepares a memorandum which recommends that apart 
from being paid what had been agreed which would have nothing to do 
with success or failure they must in addition be paid a success fee. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are saying that when one talks about the 
success fee in this context a success fee generally applies if the – if 
the basis is if you achieve your target you will be paid but if – this is 
what you will be paid.  But if you do not succeed you will not be paid 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 113 of 212 
 
anything. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So here we get a combination of the two regimes that 
is part of the point you make. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair.  As you correctly 
pointed out the success fee is on top of the advisory fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  For which they have already been 
paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And one should normally choose one or the 
10 
other and not have both. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you make an important – 
then you make an important observation Doctor Bloom in the second 
bullet on page 11.  What is that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair in 2014 when the – the CDB 
loan was being negotiated and concluded Transnet had a – or Transnet 
had a funding team that included three highly experienced funding 
managers and an analyst.  Between them they had cumulative 
20 
experience of in excess of fifty years in fund raising in most capital 
markets.  So as a consequence one begs to ask the question why was it 
necessary to engage an external party to do the work where the 
expertise and capacity existed within Transnet at that time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And as I understand it 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 114 of 212 
 
and you may say this elsewhere it was not – it is not only your opinion 
the capabilities and expertise that resided within Transnet had been 
recognised externally as well. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  Yes because 
there is – the people that were – if I can put it this way the – the 
treasury department with – and aligned with the funding team were 
recognised and we will see that later as well in a survey as being one 
of the best treasuries in the world in 2010 which – which points to the 
fact that that would not occur if the necessary capacity and skills was 
not available within the institution.  So yes that – it just – one just 
10 
wonders why was this particular situation allowed to occur. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What do Transnet policies say 
about that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair in terms of the Transnet 
procedure procurement procedures and procurement manual the PPM 
by leveraging third parties to lead an under – to lead, arrange and 
negotiate the CDB loan while having a full capacitated internal debt 
raising team.  And I would like to Chair if I may refer you to a page in 
the – in the report. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You talking of report 2B now. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  2B.  Report 2B it is page 6864 on the 
left hand – the left hand page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius I am looking at what you gave 
me that will not have the same page numbers or will it? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes the same page numbers 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 115 of 212 
 
have been put in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And they are in the top right 
hand column. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay what is the page number Doctor Bloom? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  06864. 
CHAIRPERSON:  06 – Mr Pretorius I only see a page with a 06 on the 
last page cover but what I have inside does not have 06.. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Pages I have got 95. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Otherwise I can… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got 95, 81, 77 I got 64.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair if I could assist? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I looking at the right thing? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes you are. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes if one has the two pages in 
front of you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if one jut turns it sideways 
that – the other way Chair.  So you have – you have unable to read the 
20 
one page next to the other page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you look at the top right hand 
corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they… 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 116 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will see the pages there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They put the stapler there so it makes it difficult to 
see the page numbers. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ah yes Chair we changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think the – I think this… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair can I assist?  Can I give 
you another copy? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which is not – where the page 
numbers are not obstructed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you.  Take this one. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 6864. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  6864 yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ja I know it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to need this copy or not really? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have been given another copy 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Will your junior need this one? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps we could take that one 
back. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe take that one.  Ja okay thank you.  I think it 
can be used if you know where the page numbers are or you get the 
staple to be on a different corner of the document.  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay.  Thank you Chair.  Okay it is 
on the left hand – in the left hand page on that double page.  
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 117 of 212 
 
Paragraph – I would like to refer to 16.2 which is – which is amended 
Transnet Procurement Procedures Manual version 3 dated 1 June 2015.  
And I would like to refer to the first paragraph which is 16.2.1. and just 
read it by way of explanation?  Chapter 8 of the said manual refers to 
the identification of strategic specialist units but what is interesting is 
that in this particular manual in the amended one the treasury is not 
included as a strategic unit.  And therefore in 8.3 that refers to the 
compulsory utilisation of specialist units the manual states the 
following: 
“The specialist units mentioned above must be 
10 
utilised by other Transnet entities for required goods, 
construction works and services falling within their 
scope and this is important. The external market may 
not be approached for goods construction works and 
services falling within this strategic specialist units 
or division core competency areas.  This would also 
include specialist services that are required which 
may be performed by a particular internal function 
and – and I use the example of group treasury and 
group tax.” 
20 
So Chair this just aligns with the point on – in 2014 when the CDB loan 
was being negotiated that the necessary expertise was available and in 
terms of the procurement and procedures manual they were required to 
use their internal expertise. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 118 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Except for the fact that in this – as 
you can see this was in June 2015 and that was prior to – so this was 
changed then when it came to further ana – further utilisation of 
internal units. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Doctor Bloom you have 
just quoted from the report which has in turn quoted from original policy 
documentation of Transnet. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In your final affidavit your final 
expert report we will obviously have to refer to the original document in 
10 
force at the time these transactions were entered into. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what you saying in sum is 
that where specialist units existed within Transnet there was an 
express policy prohibition against going out to the market for those 
same services. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but is the point being made at 16.2 of the report 
the one you have just read or were you also making the point that at a 
certain stage the - t–e internal policy was amended in such a way that 
20 
treasury was excluded? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair as a – in other words that – 
that would have permitted if in terms of the PP manual as amend – PPP 
or the PPM 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 119 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  PP manual as amended that would 
have resulted in them having – having the ability to go out to the 
market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Because the strategic units such as 
treasury in this case is excluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But – but your understanding is that that 
exclusion was not applicable at the time of this transaction? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct because this was 
2014. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And this was – this was 2015 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But Chair it will become applicable 
when we proceed further that is why I have highlighted it here so I can 
just refer you back to that section 8.3 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we are past one o’clock but 
20 
perhaps if I could just finish this Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So are you saying that that 
exclusion of treasury or the – let us put it a different way which is more 
accessible to us at least.  That the provision in Transnet policies which 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 120 of 212 
 
would have prevented going out to market was removed certainly in 
respect of treasury? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes from the 1 June 2015. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that was relevant to further 
transactions that you are going to deal with? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is possible that someone within Transnet 
would have seen we cannot go out to market we have to amend the 
policy so we can employ external advisors? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It appears to be so. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is this a convenient time Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I just want to say this before we – we 
adjourn.  We just have to keep our eyes on certain things that we are 
getting as we go along.  We have seen that in regard to the fees for 
this transactional – transactional advisory services an amount of 35, 
something million had been fixed but then the amount went up to more 
than 700% as I understand it 700% that is – that is very huge and 
earlier today and yesterday I was hearing evidence of similar things 
where – I mean we dealt yesterday with evidence that a supplier said if 
we do this for you Transnet it would cost R9 million but we know that 
20 
ultimately it costs R600 and something million.  So here we have that 
kind of situation but we have heard I think in regard to Eskom maybe 
with regard to Transnet as well already situations where the risk 
capacity within the entity within a parastatal for certain work to be done 
but that work is given to and outside supplier in circumstances where at 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 121 of 212 
 
least so far we have not heard any evidence what was wrong with using 
internal capacity and from what you have said treasury here Transnet’s 
own treasury had the capacity and had people who were internationally 
acclaimed as good people for doing the – providing the services that 
were now being given to outside entities at huge amounts.   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair I think what is 
important just to note is that we are specifically talking about the 
funding side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  We will still get to the  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Use of the treasury when it comes to 
the mitigation of the risk instruments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But at least the funding side there was proper 
capacity that could have been used. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  We… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair may I just say  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That we will in the report deal 
20 
with the sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With all of these things. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of appointments  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will also deal with the 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 122 of 212 
 
sequence of cost escalation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But they are also dealt with in 
report 2A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which is  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not within the province of report 
2 B 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we will do it in any event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair is this a convenient time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is alright.  We will take the lunch adjournment 
and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Dr Bloom 
20 
before we deal with the contents of page 12 of your presentation.  I 
would just like to take step back.  You will recall your evidence that in 
respect of certain advisory services the McKinsey Consortium was the 
original appointee? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 123 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A series of events occurred the 
result of which was to introduce Regiments to larger chunks of the 
contract until eventually it ended up as the sole service provider for 
what was originally McKinsey’s contract.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The question arises any – in any 
of those steps in which Regiments took an increasing part of the overall 
function 
contracted 
out 
by 
Transnet 
were 
proper 
procurement 
procedures followed? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I am – I am unsure about that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because that is not your area. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No I just highlight that Chair to 
point out … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That that is part of evidence 2A 
but we will incorporate it in the report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  2B. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Volume 2B of the report but my 
instructions are that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No procedures … 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 124 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No procurement procedures … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or open tender procedures were 
followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In each of those steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have also told the Chair 
Dr Bloom that from 35 million – the original contract price – to 265 
10 
million – the – at least a final payment although it appears there were 
more which you have not dealt with in your report – several steps took 
place between the 35 and 265.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One of them was an increase of 
what you refer to as the success fee? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of R166 million.  You have 
investigated how that fee was calculated and with your experience and 
knowledge in the trade as it were you are able to give an opinion to the 
20 
Chair as to how that was made up and whether that is within 
reasonable parameters or normal acceptable parameters. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is the task we are going to 
do now. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 125 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So you say in the first bullet on 
page 12 that the invoice for R166 million excluding VAT was made up of 
two amounts.  What were those amounts?  We are on page 12 Chair. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  An amount of 152.7 million  - 0.8 
million – for Lead Manager and Debt Originator services related to the 
CDB loan and Chair there were two other amounts which are combined 
in the second bullet which refer to assistance Regiments purported to 
provide for certain of the hedging instruments that we will discuss later. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
That 
is 
the 
debt 
risk 
10 
management instruments? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct.  So there were – there were 
specifically two of the instruments that we are going to discuss through 
the testimony that relate to fees or relate to that particular component 
of the 166. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what do you say in the 
second bullet there – second principal bullet there on page 12? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The one based – where it says based 
on my financial (intervenes)? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us – before we go there. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have experience in the 
financial industry.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  (No audible reply). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have told the Chair that 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 126 of 212 
 
you have – and you must say yes because a nod … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Will not be picked up – and you 
have told the Chair that included in your raft of experience is risk 
management – financial risk management and the fees charged 
therefore.  Is that correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So you are able to make 
– pass a judgment on whether fees charged are out of the norm or 
within the norm and you are able to say what the norm is.  Am I 
10 
correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So what is the norm?  
How is a fee for a Lead Manager and Debt Originator for a loan made 
up? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM: 
 
Okay. 
 
Chair 
there 
are 
two 
components.  It is normally a value.  In other words the – the amount to 
which the percentage of the fee – the percentage that is – that is the 
fee is calculated. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us deal with the first one – 
20 
the amount of money. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is that amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That amount could also be two 
components depending on – on what decision is made.  The first 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 127 of 212 
 
component would be on the – on the capital value.  In other words for 
instance if you are applying for a home loan and you take – and it is 
R1 000 or R1 million or whatever the case may be and somebody is 
taking a fee which is a percentage.  It would be a percentage of that.  
That is the capital value. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The original capital value 
loaned? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct.  It is also referred to in the 
trade as notional.  The notional value. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the first term of art – we will 
10 
get to hedging later but the first time of art is notional? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any loan it is the original 
capital amount of that loan excluding interest? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  So that is notional. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just so that I understand that – that part.  Are you 
saying when one wants to – when one is dealing with fees for a Lead 
Manager and Debt Originator of a loan - in this context – one of the 
first things to know is what the capital amount of the loan is? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And depend – maybe depending on a number of 
things you might have to bear that in mind because the fee might be or 
a component of the fee might be linked to the amount of the loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 128 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of course said there were two 
matters to bear in mind when one deals with the amount.  You have told 
the Chair that what one does when one calculates a fee is one has an 
amount and one applies a percentage then to that amount.  So my fee 
for example would be one percent of that amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now you have also told the Chair 
that one could use the original capital value of the loan – notional – as 
the amount to which one applies the percentage? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you could use something 
else.  What is that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reference to the original capital is that the 
amount that ultimately gets granted as a loan or is it the amount that 
your client may have asked you to get as a loan but you might have got 
a lesser amount?  Reference to original what does it relate to? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that would be per agreement.  
In other words if – if I was for instance sourcing a loan for you we 
would agree that this is the amount of the loan and that would be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I want you to get for me? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 129 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, 2 billion for example? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so when the two of us are – when I am giving 
you a mandate for our purposes that is the original loan that you are 
talking about? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Original amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair because that is 
10 
what you are looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So that is – that is my mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If - if you only succeed to get me 1 billion 
instead of two the – when we talk about the original it will remain 2 
billion and the 1 billion you got would not be referred to as the 
original? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct because that was – 
that what was not part of the mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The mandate was 2 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that always the case or does 
it depend on the agreement between the parties? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is about the – it has got to do with 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 130 of 212 
 
the agreement between the parties because what might happen is that 
the percentage changes.  If I … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us not go to the percentage. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No, with all the fees. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The Chair is just talking about 
the notional or the original amount of the loan.  Is it always what is 
mandated or is – could it be what loan was actually received? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It would be – it would be on the loan 
that is actually received because that was what you were able to 
achieve. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, but now you have said two 
things to the Chair.  So let us go back a step.  When you talk about a 
fee you talk about an amount of money on the one hand and a 
percentage applied to that amount of money. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So let us leave aside the 
percentage applied for the moment and let us just look at the basic 
amount of money to which you apply your fee.  The Chair asked you 
that amount of money is it what I as the borrower want from you the 
lender in my mandate to the loan provider. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or is it what the actual loan 
capital amount is?  So the Chair postulates a situation where I could 
get to Regiments and I could say listen I want a R2 billion.  You come 
back or Regiments comes back to me and says sorry you cannot have 2 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 131 of 212 
 
billion but I can get you 1 billion, right.  What is the figure on which the 
fee is based? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It will be 1 billion. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  So Chair I am afraid … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I hope that clarifies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay - to the extent that the term of original amount 
may still be used must we understand it therefore to refer to the amount 
that is loaned? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is actually loaned? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now the – we are still in 
the amount of money box at the moment or category rather.  That – one 
amount that can be used to apply a percentage is the actual amount of 
the loan.  There is another amount that could be used.  What is that 
amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that is a – that is an amount 
which includes an aggregate of all the repayments made over the full 
20 
term of the loan.  In other words it includes all the costs in everything 
that is involved with – with regard to that loan.  It is referred to yield to 
maturity.  That is just the term for it but it is a - let us put it.  If I can 
put it another way – it is a much higher value than what we were 
referring to as the notional value of the loan in the previous example.  
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 132 of 212 
 
So this is – this is the amount that is repaid in aggregate over the full 
period of the loan. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is capital plus interest? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Capital plus interest and over the – 
over the tenure but there is – yes we can leave it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you have just said now is it another way of 
arriving – is it another way of determining a fee for transactional 
advisors such as Regiments?  In other words one way – are you saying 
one way of doing this is to say to a transactional advisor I want a loan 
for R2 billion.  You – you raise it and I will pay you X percentage of the 
10 
amount of loan that you get me? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is one way? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying therefore there is another way and 
another way is – is that the fee is calculated on a different basis and 
the different basis is you look at the repayments over a long period 
including interest? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now as we know from bond 
repayments if I take the capital amount of the bound that I have to pay 
and I add the interest I end up paying more than double for my home.  
If I buy a home for R1 million and I take the full amount of capital plus 
interest I end up paying more than R2 million for it.  Is that correct? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 133 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the yield to maturity as you 
have referred to is a far higher amount - much higher amount – than 
just the notional original capital amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  Can I …? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now I can choose either.  
Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair yes.  It depends on what 
agreement is reached between the parties … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But the norm in the industry is a 
percentage on the notional value not on the higher value. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is the – that is the norm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you mentioned a term for the regime in terms of 
which your fee is - as a transactional advisor – your fee is determined 
on the basis of the repayments.  I think Mr Pretorius has got the 
terminology already.  I have not yet got it.  Something yield to value or 
something.  What is that? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is yield to maturity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yield to maturity? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – that refers – the yield part refers to your fee 
and maturity refers to the capital and interest over the period that 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 134 of 212 
 
repayments are made? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the yield … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is quite convoluted – a convoluted way of – of 
putting it. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I think rather see the – when we talk 
about a yield … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  We talk about the interest rate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is applicable over – over the 
10 
entire period that is to maturity … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Over the entire tenure of the loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so it is interest over that whole long period of 
repayment? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Plus all the capital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Capital and yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Let us just … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hopefully we will get there Dr Bloom. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair you are doing well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hopefully we will get – we will get there, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Let 
us 
just 
confirm 
the 
terminology.  Capital only the smaller amount the original capital 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 135 of 212 
 
amount you are going to refer to as notional? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Capital plus interest repaid over 
the full period of the loan you are going to refer to as yield or yield to 
maturity? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and we will always refer 
back to the underlying substance of the terminology when we go 
through your evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So there are two choices.  I can 
use the smaller amount – notional or – and that is the industry norm 
you say? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But also it is not unheard of for 
parties to agree that the larger amount – the yield – is used? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes it is used but it is – it is more the 
exception to the rule. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If … 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The next step. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that Mr Pretorius.  If I want to distinguish 
between the two correctly I want to call them it is regime this regime 
that.  The one would be yield to maturity regime – I would imagine.  
Would that be - would that be a good description? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 136 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Very much so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the other one you would call what? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Notional. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Notional … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Amount?  Notional value (intervenes). 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Or notional amount is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Notional amount regime? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we can have those regimes? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That might not suit you Mr Pretorius.  It is just 
for my own. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No it suits me absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Except as with lawyers … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Financiers – it is not notional at 
all.  It is actual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is exactly what I am thinking. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You can be forgiven for doing so 
but we will take it step by step. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you have two base 
amounts.  One the smaller amount – notional – or the bigger amount – 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 137 of 212 
 
yield or yield to maturity? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One applies a percentage to 
either of those amounts to determine the fee? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So I can say - and we will get to 
the actual percentages – I as the transactional advisor to you Transnet 
I want 1 percent of the smaller amount or one percent of the larger 
amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair.  Normally … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do not get complicated now. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One would image however that 
there are also industry norms about the amount of that percentage or 
the size of that percentage one applies.  Is that correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you are aware of those? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you are going to tell the 
Chair about those in a moment but just at a conceptual level if we may 
20 
– notional level – sorry – conceptual level just at a conceptual level 
one would imagine that if one is using the smaller amount the 
percentage would be bigger? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And if one was using the larger 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 138 of 212 
 
amount the percentage would be smaller? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What happened here? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair if we can maybe look at the 
numbers that will be – that will be adequate for the explanation in - on 
slide 12.  If we … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is a diagram on slide 12 
Chair which attempts to explain this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is on the page that you have 
10 
before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am still on – on your question.  You – you say 
if one uses the notional amount regime the percentage should be what? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Smaller. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Smaller. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Within a range which is the 
market norm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you say if you use the yield to maturity 
regime it should be bigger? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Smaller percentage. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Smaller than if you use the …? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe if Dr Bloom can explain that to me why? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair because the value – the 
notional value – is a lot smaller if one wants to put it that way - than 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 139 of 212 
 
the yield to maturity regime.  In other words it is a much smaller 
number because remember as we discussed the yield to maturity 
includes all the repayments and all of that over the maturity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, small in terms of – of the Rand – of the amount 
not smaller in terms of the percentage? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair and that is what 
why the percentages become important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I thought – I thought it was in relation to a 
percentage.  The percentage could be the same but because the 
amounts are different one is higher than another one the actual amount 
10 
received would be different? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So by way of example if there is 
a loan of R100 1 percent would be R1? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is notional.  If at the end of 
the day I finally end up paying R200 but I still want 1 percent what am I 
paying? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Two. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  R2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So let us – let us deal 
with your diagram or the diagram that we have discussed if we may. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair the diagram relates directly to 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 140 of 212 
 
the R1.5 billion loan from the CDB on the … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which – but you have translated 
them to Rand? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So let us start with the - with the 
right hand column if we can.  The notional over there is R18 billion.  So 
in other words that represents the US$1.5 billion loan from the China 
Development Bank that in Rand terms it is 18 billion.  Just by the way 
Chair this is the information that Regiments used in the calculation of 
10 
their fees.  So that we can just align as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So in actual fact the two 
– the R166 million - at least in large part - fee was calculated as you 
have set out here.  It was based on notional.  Well that is going too far 
too fast. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry.  We start with a 
notional.  That is the basic amount of the loan – original capital? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  This is – this is merely by way of 
example that the notional is included here because the way Regiments 
did the calculation was on the yield to maturity.  So – so essentially if 
we can move then to the - the left hand portion of the diagram the yield 
– the yield to maturity of that $1.5 billion loan was R102 billion. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 141 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that is capital plus interest 
over the full period of the loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Over the full duration maturity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that about R102 billion. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So the R102 billion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is based on the yield to maturity regime? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Is the yield – it is the yield to 
maturity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a yield to – ja. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  What happened then was Regiments 
took … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us what the norm is 
first.  The norm would be - if you are going to use R18 billion what is 
the industry norm in relation to the percentage that you would apply to 
R18 billion? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chait that – that differs what – what 
the market is – what the market dictates and – and who you are talking 
20 
to and whose prices – whose pricing you are comparing with who 
etcetera.  So to say these – this is exact – this is what the percentage 
would be is – is almost impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is difficult, ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct.  So … 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 142 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you would be able to say I would imagine 
that below a certain percentage is - would be hard to get? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To get somebody who charge below a certain 
percentage and it should be possible to say it would be very 
extraordinary 
to 
find somebody 
who charges 
above a certain 
percentage? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So somewhere in between then you could have what 
you regard as more or less not shocking? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair.  So in the – at the time 
when these transactions were ongoing the – the basic rates that one 
could achieve or the percentages, fees that one could achieve in the 
market was between more or less 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  (Intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  (Intervenes) if you take the 
lesser amount you could achieve between 0.2 and 0.5 percent.  So that 
is the right hand column? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is the norm? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct at the time of the 
transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now please tell the Chair if you 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 143 of 212 
 
used the yield - the higher amount – the R102 billion what percentage 
could one apply as the norm? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that would be about 0.01 
percent.  It would be 0.01 percent or less.  This is not what is stated 
over there but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But Advocate Pretorius has asked 
what the norm is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So if we compare what is stated over 
10 
there 0.15 percent … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  To what the norm would be which is 
0.01 percent … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  This is 0.14 percent more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So if we want to – let us 
just have this picture reflect the norm for the – to start with because 
the right hand column reflects the norm.  Correct? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in that box underneath 
ZAR102 billion if we want to see the norm let us put 0.01 percent.  
Correct/ 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 144 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  So we now have a picture 
Chair if you are going to use the bigger amount … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you want to be more or less 
within the norm … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  The notional regime. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of 102 billion you would use a 
factor of 0.01. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you were going to use the 
10 
lesser one 8 billion – 18 billion – one would within normal parameters 
use 0.2 and 0.5 which is a far higher percentage … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Than 0.01. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  We are on the same page 
so far. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What did Regiments do? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Regiments applied 0.15 percent to 
20 
the yield to maturity which is a rounded figure of 102 billion and if I 
may the – if you do that calculation then you would get to the 152.7 
billion – ag – million that you – that is stated at the top of the slide. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright but let us take it step by 
step. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 145 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A norm which you know - from 
your experience and in your opinion that you are giving to the Chair – 
the norm is if you use the higher amount you use a lesser percentage? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you use a lower amount – the 
notional – you use a higher percentage? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you are saying to the Chair 
what Regiments did was they used the higher amount and a higher 
10 
percentage? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:   That is correct Chair even – if you 
want to you can compare the – the lower percentage of on the notional 
side.  In other words the 0.2 compare that to the 0.15.  It is only 
slightly less … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But the basis on which it was applied 
was substantially different. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So let us just summarise there.  
You have a higher amount and a lower amount as the base on which 
20 
you apply your percentage to calculate a fee? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you use the lower amount the 
norm says you can use the higher percentage? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 146 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you use the higher amount the 
norm says then you must use a lower percentage? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   If you use the higher amount 
the norm says then you must use a lower percentage, logical. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What Regiments did was to use 
the higher amount and a percentage beyond market norms. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct, alright and you 
10 
explain that then on page 13. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s right Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you say that the fee 
Regiments charged .15 on yield is equivalent to .85 on the notional 
amount of 18billion, right? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And if one goes back a page 
you will see the norm there is .2 to .5. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And if you do the math they 
20 
were .85 if one bases it on the notional amount of 18billion.  In short 
what you’re saying is that it was beyond market norms. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair well beyond market norms. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Well beyond market norms and 
you tell us by how much you estimate that to be on page 13, so if you 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 147 of 212 
 
would just take the Chair through page 13 please. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair, so as was indicated by 
Advocate Pretorius the 0.15% which we know of on the yield, is 
equivalent to the 0.85% on the notional value, which is the R18billion 
that we've used.  The second point refers to the market conventions 
and Transnet practices to pay lead arrangement fees on notional and 
not on the yield to maturity as Regiments did or claimed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Let’s pause there, because  you 
have two sources of information on which you base your expert opinion, 
right. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The one is your own experience 
in the financial industry, financing industry, correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The other is your examination of 
what happened historically in Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And against the norms produced 
in the industry and produced in Transnet itself was the Regiment’s fee 
within those norms or outside of those norms? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Outside of those norms. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Both, both the Transnet practice 
and industry norms? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair that’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   If you go to the third bullet. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 148 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   So that is what we’ve been 
discussing, so the – based on market norms or conventions the fee 
would have been charged of 0.2%, between 0.2 and 0.5% on the 
notional value. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Okay if you just go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, on market conventions your 
point number two, market conventions and Transnet practices are to 
pay lead arrangement fees on notional and not on yield to maturity as 
Regiments did.  Market conventions wouldn’t that be what we talked 
about when we talked about norms in the market? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair.  In other words 
the fee that is payable is calculated on the notional value and not the 
yield, that’s what’s the norm in the market. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is insofar as the lead arrangement is concerned 
and as far as the debt origination if I can call it that, and what’s the 
market conventions and practices or is that something that you are still 
going to come to? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   This was a – it depends, lead 
manager and debt originator is in this particular case a consolidated 
term if I can put it that way, so it was – it depends on if you’re the lead 
20 
manager you are the debt originator in certain cases, but the, what 
we’re referring to here is their – Regiments requirement or the 
Regiments that acted as the lead manager and debt originator for which 
they’re claiming this fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you know I thought, you see on page we talked 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 149 of 212 
 
about that amount of R152million, R152,7million that they were, 
Regiments were to be the lead manager and debt originator and here 
on point 2 at page 13 you say market conventions and Transnet 
practices are to pay lead arrangement fees on notional and not on yield 
to (indistinct), I thought that what you meant is lead manager and debt 
originator are – can be two separate people or entities but sometimes 
it’s one. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought what you meant was these conventions, 
market conventions and practices that you are talking about in bullet 
10 
point number two on page 13 relate only to the lead management role 
as opposed the debt origination role, but you are now clarifying to say 
you meant a combination of both in regard to this transaction. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   100% correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now I understand, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and when you say market 
convention is to base the fee calculation on notional, a smaller amount. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You’re saying that there may yet 
be exceptions? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And if one uses by way of 
exception the higher amount then the percentage should be much 
lower? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 150 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Logic.  Alright so what do you 
say then in the third bullet, if Regiments was to use notional? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   So if we assume that the market 
norms or we accept that the market norms in that period of time were 
between 0.2 and 0.5% and if you look at the first bullet Chair the 
equivalent, in other words in the 0.85% that’s what one would be 
comparing 
this 
with, 
which 
indicates 
that 
Regiment’s 
charged 
excessively higher fees on their notional equivalent than what the 
market norms were.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So you take 18billion which is 
10 
the original capital amount. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Market norms say you must 
charge .2 between .5% on your calculations they charge .85 which is 
beyond the norm and that is a substantial amount you say. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair, I didn’t calculate it 
but if one just subtracts the 0.85% from the 0.5% one gets a good 
indication. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right the next bullet you say if 
however Regiments were to say, as they did, we don’t want to use a 
20 
smaller amount, we want to use the larger amount. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The larger amount being 
102billion as opposed to 18billion. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Correct Chair.   
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 151 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Then the percentage fee that 
the market would ordinarily dictate would be what? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   In the region of 0.01% in other – ja I 
said previously. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Well here you say in the fourth 
bullet 0.06. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Okay let me explain that now it’s – 
what happens is if one reverses the calculation so if we want to 
compare something, so what I did in terms of the calculation I said if 
the market norm is between 0.2 and 0.5 and I took the average of those 
10 
two, which is then 0.35 and I compare that, if I take that percentage as 
an assumption and I compare that to what the – what would that be, in 
other words I’m doing the calculation in reverse, so how much percenta 
would that be on the yield to maturity, not the 15 basis points, 0.15% 
sorry Chair, that Regiments charged but if through market conventions 
then it should have been 0.06% and 0. – ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   I’m afraid you lost me there and 
I’m sure the Chair followed you to the letter, let me take a step back if I 
may, in the fourth bullet you talk about market convention and Transnet 
practice, I would imagine in telling the hair what market convention and 
20 
practice was you are referring to an external norm, do you follow what I 
say? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   So what would that external 
norm be, if one was to apply the yield to maturity, you told us that a 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 152 of 212 
 
minute ago on page 12. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   0.01%. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright so in fact we should 
correct the fourth bullet, if we’re talking about market convention and 
Transnet practice, rather than your complex calculations. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   No Chair the – what that 0.06 
represents is not the – yes from that perspective you’re right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Well it’s not from that 
perspective, it’s the words in bullet four. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct, that would be if the fee was 
10 
based on yield market convention and Transnet practice it would dictte 
a percentage of 0.01%, that’s right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, so can – would you be 
comfortable if we took 0.06 out, I’m sorry to – my apologies for setting 
your calculations aside, we’re talking about external convention and 
Transnet practice, now whether it’s external historical facts you say 
that would produce a figure of 0.01. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s the market convention and Transnet practice? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can we go to the next bullet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Transnet practice is it always in accordance with 
market conventions, in the – here in what we are dealing with?  I’m just 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 153 of 212 
 
trying to understand if there is any particular significance in always 
pairing them, the market convention and the Transnet practice because 
if the Transnet practice is always in accordance with the market 
convention then all one needs to know is just the market convention. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Yes Chair Transnet as far as I 
understand and in the discussions that is what they do, they would use 
market norms and conventions in order to price certain transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And they had a skilled treasury 
to guide them in this regard. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ultimately are we amending that 0.06 on page 13 
to be 0.01? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, as I understand you’re 
comfortable with that? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  I’m comfortable with that Chair but I 
think we shouldn’t lose sight of the 0.06% ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  For a different point? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  For a different point. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  I will come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can – you will make that point in due course? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But here we can say 0.01. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 154 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And in fact did Regiments 
charge 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  0.1 ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On the higher amount, yield. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  0.15%. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now was that within market 
norms? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Was it slightly out or ... 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   From – if one compares 0.01% to 
0.15% it doesn’t sound like a big difference but on a very large amount 
it makes it a substantial difference so that’s why ...(intervention)   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Well correct me if I’m wrong, 
it’s 15 times the amount? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That must be quite high. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me ask you this question then, it’s part of me 
trying to look at this with as much benefit of your knowledge as 
20 
possible, would this be shocking to somebody who is familiar with the 
market convenetion? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  I believe so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Of course the question that we 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 155 of 212 
 
will ask in due course who made these decisions, why did they make 
them, when did they make them and for whose benefit, we begin to deal 
with those question in future pages.   
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so in the sixth bullet you 
come to a conclusion and what do you say there? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Chair that Regiments charged a fee 
that is not nearly in line with market convections and Transnet practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually when you say not in line you’re being kind to 
them isn’t it?  Way out of line? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Yes it’s way out of line Chair, that’s 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well one way of looking at it is 
15 times more than it should. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you’ve put an estimate on 
that, we needn’t go to how you calculated that because we’ve got 
enough maths to do as we go along.  What is your – in your opinion the 
overcharge estimated to be? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Chair based on – and these 
calculations as I indicated previously are based on the data that 
Regiments used in their calculation of the fee, so if you look at it from 
the perspective of they charged 152.7million and you use what they did 
and you convert then they’re overcharged by 90million, in other words 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 156 of 212 
 
152.7 minus the 90 is what the fee should have been based on the data 
that they used but that, as we’ve determined that is well beyond market 
convention. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Alright let’s go to the last bullet 
you qualify everything that you’ve told the Chair up till now and if you 
do the math there’s an overcharge on your estimate and in your opinion 
of 90million rand. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But what is the point you make, 
finally on page 13? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:    Chair this relates – the last point is 
the that Regiments should not have been paid any fee for this work 
because as we determined previously, there was sufficient capacity and 
knowledge and skill within the Transnet Funding Department or the 
Debt Raising Department as it was then to perform the required 
function.  So in my opinion there was no need for Transnet to actually 
outsource this function to an external party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the overall point you make and then the other 
point is the one you have been dealing with I think is even if there was 
justification to give Regiments this work to do, there was no 
20 
justification for charging the amounts that they charged, is that 
correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM: That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in terms of what you consider to be in excess of 
what the norm was or what they should have paid or what one could 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 157 of 212 
 
expect to be an advisor in their position, to have been paid for this kind 
of work, is there anything that you came across in terms of 
documentation that says to you, maybe they can come up with some 
justification or is it one of those situations where you are able to say, 
there is just no way in which anybody can justify this kind of amount for 
this kind of work. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Chair I never came across any 
documentation which purported to indicate that, you know, that there 
was insufficient capacity or that this – these are the types of fees that 
could be charged for the nature and the scope for the work that was 
10 
being done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let’s just summarise to there, 
the analysis that you’ve done up to now to which loan did that relate.  
Remember we had the 2.5billion Dollar split into 1.5 and 1billion, right 
and then we had further amounts.  When we’re talking about the 
12billion Club Loan that you talk about on page 14, you have told the 
Chair that the 1billion Dollar portion of the 2.5billion was shelved. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it was – what was – it was 
20 
replaced with a 12billion rand which was then, presumably more or less 
equivalent to 1billion Dollars, not really but almost, the 12billion rand 
replaced the 1billion rand, portion of the 2.5billion. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Yes Chair the 1billion Dollar which 
was shelved in favour of the 12billion Club Loan. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 158 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now that was a loan raised 
domestically, in South Africa. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Fromm a syndicate of lenders. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We’ll talk about that in due 
course. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright you deal with that loan on 
page 14.  If you could just tell the Chair of those facts by way of 
10 
background that appear on page 14. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Chair as we’ve discussed the 1billion 
portion of the 2.5billion US Dollar CDB loan was shelved in favour of 
the 12billion syndicated Club Loan.  What is important just to note, 
which we haven’t spoken about yet is the duration of that loan, in other 
words how long will it be till it gets paid off, which is 15 years and that 
it was concluded using a variable interest rate or what we term – if I 
can introduce another term Chair, the floating interest rate which is the 
same as variable interest rate on the majority of our loans. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes some witness told me about a floating interest 
20 
rate, I think there is a floating and a fixed interest rate. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair, we’re going to 
talk about that a lot. 
CHAIRERSON: Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We know that out there in the 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 159 of 212 
 
market place interest rates fluctuate. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Interest rates are determined in 
various ways, we have the repo rate which is determined by the 
Reserve Bank but it varies from month to month almost. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right but in any event if you 
enter into an agreement with a floating interest rate, you pay a rate 
that is undetermined, fluctuating and unpredictable. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And you’ve told the Chair that, 
that’s sometimes risky. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   For the borrower at least. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s true.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay what happened on the 12 t h 
of May 2015 in relation to the Club Loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Chair on the 12 t h of May, JP Morgan 
was named as the preferred bidder to lead, arrange and underwrite in 
other words we can see those – we can take those three concepts as 
20 
one if you like for now, the Club Loan and there was a letter issued and 
signed by Mr Anoj Singh where he indicated to JP Morgan that they 
would be the preferred bidder for this work. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right, were Regiments involved 
in some way? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 160 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Regiments was the supplier 
development partner of JP Morgan as indicated previously and they 
were part of that process. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay what happened then on the 
– we go to page 15 on the 27 t h of August 2015? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That is when Eric Wood who was the 
CEO of Regiments and Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi the Transnet Group 
Treasurer, they agreed to conclude the 12billion Club Loan and there 
are five parties that participated in this syndication for that loan. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As parts of the lender? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who were they? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM: Nedbank that contributed 3billion, the 
Bank of China 3 billion, Absa 3 billion, Old Mutual Finance 1.5billion 
and Future Growth 1.5billion. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then what happened on the 
1 s t of October 2015? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  The Board Committee dealing with 
this process…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The BADC? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:   BADC, approved the memorandum 
approving the replacement of JP Morgan with Trillian in respect of lead 
arranging and underwriting services for the loan. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay now Trillian come onto the 
scene. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 161 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A month before or in the 
previous month, September 2015, you deal with this in the last bullet of 
the 
next 
page 
but 
let’s 
fast-forward 
there 
for 
the 
moment…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius you talk about the previous month – oh 
previous because we have…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So 1 October JP Morgan moves 
off the scene and Trillian enter the scene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the Club Loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was looking at 27 August…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes sorry so that’s on 1 October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you are right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But something happened that is 
significant for our big picture Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A month before or in the 
previous month and that is dealt with in the last bullet on page 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that is contained in the 
volume 2(B) report, what happened? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  In order for Trillian to participate in 
the – as part – in the transaction and also to become a service 
provider, Salim Essa became the controlling shareholder in Trillian in 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 162 of 212 
 
September 2015. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Trillian enter the scene in 
October 2015. 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the previous month Salim 
Essa about whom we are here, a substantial amount, in due course 
became the major shareholder in Trillian? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let’s go then to page 16 if we 
may, what happened on the 17 t h of September 2015? 
10 
DR 
JONATHAN 
ZOHAR 
BLOOM: 
 
 
This 
was 
then 
prior 
to 
the…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   (indistinct) must I pause there 
or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe, I’m just – Mr Essa becoming controlling 
shareholder of Trillian happens in September and Trillian replaces JP 
Morgan early in October, no that’s what I wanted to connect. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The first bullet on page 16 you 
20 
say what happened on the 17 t h of September 2015, what was that? 
DR JONATHAN ZOHAR BLOOM:  That was when the acting GCE, Mr 
Gama submitted a signed memorandum to BADC requesting the 
appointment of Trillian as the lead arranger of the Club Loan thereby 
replacing JP Morgan.  A couple of days later, on the 22 n d of 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 163 of 212 
 
September…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you do that and you must just tell me 
if this is something you come to deal with because it’s not really – it 
doesn’t have much to do with finances.  That memorandum that Mr 
Gama submitted to the BADC Committee, requesting the appointment of 
Trillian to replace JP Morgan, I’d be interested in the reasons that were 
given for that change. So – but this witness might not have forecast on 
that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Noted chair and it will be in the 
comprehensive report, I take that point Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I believe that, that memorandum 
is part of the 2(A) report but I understand that when one has a 
sequence of events as has been presented one wants the detail in that   
presentation.  It doesn’t help to have to go to other bundles to find out 
what one wants, so I understand your concern Chair and we will meet 
that concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And sometimes you have dealt with something many 
months ago in a Commission such as this and you can’t really 
remember and now you want to connect the dots as it were. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well Chair you only have to 
deal with hundreds of thousands of pages at the end… 
CHAIRPERSON:   (Laughing) and that’s nothing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We understand Chair I don’t 
want to make light of it but it’s a real issue. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 164 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So you were at the first bullet on 
page 16 describing the sequence of events. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair.  So then on the 22 
September of that year 2015 the recommendation to replace J P 
Morgan with Trillian was submitted to the GCE and the appointment as 
indicated on the previous slide was approved BADAC on the 1 October 
2015.  On the 18 November of that year the club loan facility was 
signed by Mr Daniel Roy of Trillian, Mr S Gama was the acting GCE at 
the time and Mr Garry Pita who was the acting GCFO at the time.   
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now this is the agreement 
between Transnet and Trillian it is not the actual loan itself? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I understand that – I am not a 
hundred percent sure on that item Chair I just need to check.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No well we know from your later 
evidence that the load was actually signed on the 23 November. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  2015 but we getting there. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right because that date is 
20 
important when compared with the events that occurred in December 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us not go there yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that fourth bullet point on page 16 is the reference 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 165 of 212 
 
to loan – to club loan facility agreement then correct. From what you 
have just clarified in – I am getting the impression that – from the 
clarification you have given to Mr Pretorius to his question I am getting 
the impression that that agreement was the mandate being given by 
Transnet to Trillian to say our relationship and this is what you will do 
for us and this is what we will pay.  That is what that agreement was 
about and not about the actual loan. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ye so I am just saying I am not sure whether calling it 
a club loan facility agreement is correct but maybe that it is I must just 
10 
– but you say it is the authorisation – is their appointment to perform 
this job. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the loan 
concluded… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to the club loan facility. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A few days later.  It may be that 
that is actually the title of the agreement but we will check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And perhaps in brackets in the 
report we will  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Describe it so that there is no 
confusion. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 166 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and then in the last bullet 
you say what you have already told the Chair that a month and two 
months prior to these events Mr Salim Essa enters the scene through 
Triallian? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right let us move to page 17 
where you comment on the fees charged by Trillian. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So Chair in November. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Now let us just  
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Sorry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Establish this.  Trillian is 
appointed in terms of an agreement dated 18 November 2015. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We know that and you will tell 
the Chair in due course in a different context that the loan for which it 
was appointed was entered into days later? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fact a few days later? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Five days later. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And given that its appointment is 
finalised contractually on 18 November 2015 what happened in that 
very same month? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 167 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair Trillian for the work that they 
purported to have done issued an invoice to Transnet for a figure of 
R93 million inclusive of VAT which they as I said purported to have 
rendered as lead arranger for the club loan.  And I would like to just 
clarify even if they did not do the work which I – I will further talk to a 
bit later Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so let us just look at the 
time sequence because that is instructive in itself quite apart from 
anything else. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   It is appointed in November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18 November. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On the 18 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The agreement is entered into 
on the 23 r d the actual loan agreement for which it is appointed to 
advice. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And arrange. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right five days later.  In the 
same month it issues an invoice for R93 million for being the lead 
arranger for that loan. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 168 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just having regard to the dates 
and in your opinion is it likely or probable that they actually did any 
work? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have – on 18 November 2016 Trillian is appointed  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  2015 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 18 November 2015 Trillian is appointed then you 
10 
mentioned 23 September I am trying to look for that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No 23 – so I am sorry Chair 23 
November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  November? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The same month, five days later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  23 November yes . 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That loan for which it is 
appointed to arrange and advise is actually entered into. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking for that 23 November. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will not find it yet Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is yet to come in a different 
context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so but 23 November is when they issue their 
invoice? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 169 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I am unsure about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or when the payment happens? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I am unsure about the date Chair but 
it happened in November should it – I am assuming it would have been 
around that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Now are you then saying looking at the 
work that an entity performing the kind of function or doing the kind of 
work that it was appointed to do and the amounts involved and so on it 
could not have done work to justify that – the kind of amount that they 
issued an invoice for? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – the kind of work that would have been involved 
in doing what it was appointed to do to justify an amount such as – was 
it R93 million?  In your experience would have entailed – would have 
taken over how long in terms of – obviously could vary from one 
transaction to another 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But generally speaking 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair it would have been months 
because if you recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  This was a syndicated loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 170 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And there were five parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So you would need to enter into 
agreements, loan agreements will all those parties negotiate with all 
those parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Etcetera, etcetera and loan 
negotiations 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Is not a – is not an overnight 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It takes time and a number iterations 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And so on.  So from a timing 
perspective these just do not add. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is it possible that the work had been done by J 
P Morgan? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I cannot answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot answer. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  If the work was done was J P 
Morgan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe would the position be that if there was any 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 171 of 212 
 
work that had been done already it would have been done by somebody 
else 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is as far as you can take that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes by Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja by Regiments. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But not only can you express an 
opinion I understand Doctor Bloom by reference to the time periods and 
10 
it would seem that that would accord with common sense and at least to 
Chair’s legal experience and my own legal experience and the legal 
teams legal experience but you actually looked at the documentation? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is not as if you making your 
conclusions just based on the timing? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Not at all Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So what do you say in the 
second bullet by way of summary having examined the documentation? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well that the appointment of Trillian 
20 
was irregular that is the first point Chair.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Why do you say that just in 
summary? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Because Trillian were not the party 
that did the work in this – given the time frames and everything like 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 172 of 212 
 
that they were not the party that could – that did the work it was 
Regiments that did the work. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright that is your second point. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct.  And that is why it is 
irregular.  In other words they were invoicing for work that they did not 
do. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that had already been done 
you say? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct by Regiments in that context 
and that is why Trillian could not have done the work that they charged 
10 
for. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And this is all part of the report 
2A am I right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so when you talk about work that had been 
performed by Regiments you – you – are you saying you look at the – 
you looked at the documentation and looked at whatever else you 
needed to look at in order to form an opinion and you are able to say 
that that work was actually done or must have been done by Regiments.  
In other words is it a situation where you say look it is Regiments who 
20 
did it or is it the situation where you say it must have been done by 
Regiments because the work was done but we know that Regiments 
was there? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair.  What – if one takes – 
looks at the situation from when the deal was signed in other words on 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 173 of 212 
 
the – that Advocate Pretorius was referring to the 23 November for the 
club loan all the work that preceded that would have been done 
because the contracts and the loan agreements etcetera would have 
been in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So somebody would have – somebody 
must have done something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But it could not have been Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You make – you draw a 
conclusion in the last bullet on page 17 what is that?  This is your 
opinion. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Now Chair the R93 million invoice 
that was submitted to Transnet by Trillian purportedly as part of 
transaction advisory services was – was – appears fraudulent, 
irregular, unjustified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And notwithstanding was – the work 
that was paid – or the money that was paid to Trillian for not doing the 
20 
work and they further flouted Section 8.3 of the Procedures and 
Procurement Manual as we have discussed before. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Remind us. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Which is the necessity to use 
specialist units within Transnet with the necessary capacity and skill 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 174 of 212 
 
and this is – remember we are talking about a loan here so it would 
have been part of the debt raising department so that was the – that 
was available that skill was available to use. 
ADV 
PAUL 
JOSEPH 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Was 
there 
anything 
extraordinary or exceptional about this club loan that would have 
required the appointment of a highly specialised external advisor? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair not in my opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That leaving aside whether 
Trillian was actually that. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – and we will need to – to know you know 
compared to a team that you said Transnet had which was 
internationally respected from what I understood you to say.  So one 
could compare to say what was wrong with using internal people? Was 
there anything special in terms of the skills and expertise from Trillian 
and Regiments and so on? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us move on then to 
a new topic and here we are going to talk of risk management and your 
20 
opinion and regard to how the risks that you have told the Chair existed 
in relation to these loans were managed and what financial devices or 
financial instruments were used to address this risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But as the Chair says we have 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 175 of 212 
 
got to take a step back and explain what hedging derivatives risk 
management is all about? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am going to just ask one question relating to 
what you – we have finished.  In your involvement with NMS to assist 
them with the financial aspects of these transactions you have not have 
you – you have not had the chance to so to speak confront Trillian and 
whoever to say how do you justify this and hear what they have to say 
and you are able to say this is what they said and just maybe I can 
understand where they are coming from but this was wrong, this was 
not justified or whatever they say just does not make sense. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair I have had no engagements 
with any of the parties.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Except for Mr Ramosbudi but this was 
when I started the process in September as I indicated previously.  It 
was an initial discussion to try and get an understanding of how things 
fit within the treasury but also in terms of certain – of the transactions 
but that was only one engagement and there was no further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  That will be our task Chair.  
20 
I would like to heed the request of the Chair that before we start 
dealing with these specialist terms we actually explain them.  So if we 
may just deal for the moment with the second bullet on page 19.  
Right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 176 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In respect of the China 
Development Bank loan the 1.5 billion dollar and the club loan the R12 
million club loan, syndicated club loan raised domestically right.  There 
are certain risks that the borrower undergoes.  You lending or you 
borrowing rather huge amounts of money – billions right. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV 
PAUL 
JOSEPH 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 And 
because 
of 
the 
circumstances which prevail when you enter into that loan and the 
future circumstances that might prevail during the course of the loan 
you have risks.  Just summarise please for the Chair what those risks 
10 
are? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair in the context of the 
transaction there were three risks that were addressed or that were – 
were mitigated.  The first one had to do with the exchange rate. In 
other words the borrowing of the – the US dollar funding from China 
and converting that into South African Rands and then repaying them in 
US dollars that related to the CDB loan. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right you borrowing money from 
China – China Development Bank. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You borrowing the money in 
dollars.  You bringing it to South Africa converting it to rand, correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When you repay you take your 
rands and you convert them to dollars so the exchange rates both on 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 177 of 212 
 
the receipt and repayment of the monies? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the risk that you have told 
the Chair about is the fluctuating interest rates? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair.  You want to try and 
remove the risk by – by using the instrument.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You take out insurance. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  You take out insurance correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the moment.  We will ditch 
that analogy soon.  For the moment it is good enough. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second one? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The second one has to do with the 
possibility or the probability that there could be default of interest 
payments that are attributable to the borrower that is called – Chair 
that is called credit risk. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is where it is attributable to 
Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is attributable to Transnet 
correct Chair.  And as Advocate Pretorius also indicated previously this 
20 
particular instrument that was used here had a contingent component 
and that meant that there was a further risk mitigation that had to deal 
with potential circumstances that are beyond the control of Transnet for 
example certain economic events as we said down grading and those 
types of events that could – that could cause interest rates to increase 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 178 of 212 
 
significantly and could place liquidity pressure on the borrower.  So it 
is – this is a mechanism to try and cover that.  This is a – that type of 
instrument is a very difficult instrument to understand and we will see 
later Chair that that instrument was actually Transnet would not have 
had the ability or the capacity and the skill to be able to do that.  That 
is why J P Morgan were involved with that particular instrument but we 
will see that later.  And the last one Chair has to do with the interest 
rate movements and this was only applicable to the 12 billion club loan.  
So it is important to understand that there were no interest rate risk 
mitigation that was considered for the – or for the CDB loan but that 
10 
would have been – that was covered in the exchange rate as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the fluctuating exchange rate that is something 
that the borrower would be concerned about? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the lender would not be concerned about insofar 
as the – the repayments would be in the lender’s currency? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then in terms of the credit risk I guess that 
would be – would that be the lenders concern as well as the borrowers 
concern? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The borrowers concern from the point of view what if I 
end up not being able to honour the agreement. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair that could also – it has got 
– there is a flip side if you like to that.   
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 179 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And that could mean that this was a 
requirement  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  By the lender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Because that protects by – by 
introducing this instrument 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  You would be protecting the lender. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the – so I guess the more importantly is the lender 
that needs protection but I guess the borrower also does not want to be 
in that situation where they cannot honour. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their agreements. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – and then the third one is financial costs 
also the borrowers concern? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  This is specifically the borrowers 
concern Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So let us leave page 20 for the 
moment and go to page 21.  In explaining the terminology we are going 
to concentrate on firstly the club loan, the R12 million domestic club 
loan.   
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 180 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the risk that is addressed in 
this diagram and in your further evidence is the risk of fluctuating 
interest rates. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So let us start – Chair 
on page 21 with the right hand diagram.  Okay.  There you have a 
lender that is the club. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have the borrower at 
10 
the bottom of the page Transnet, correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have the content of the 
loan.  We will learn as a matter of fact because we are only wanting to 
understand terminology which you are going to now use frequently in 
your evidence.  For illustrative purposes but we know that at the end of 
November 2015 Transnet enters into a loan agreement with the 
syndicate to borrow R12 billion on a floating interest rate, correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is the risk attached to that 
20 
type of agreement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well the risk lies more with the – with 
the borrower because the interest rates depending on the environment 
within which one is functioning, the economy etcetera may result in 
interest rates increasing significantly placing further liquidity pressure 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 181 of 212 
 
on the borrower so entering into a floating rate or a variable rate 
regime would be – would – that would be the risk that would be 
associated therewith. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if Transnet at the borrower – 
as the borrower says look I have now borrowed R12 billion on a floating 
interest rate I have no idea well research institutes can advise but 
never with certainty.  I have no idea with any certainty what that 
interest rate is going to do and I therefore am at risk. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So what does it then decide to 
10 
do? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Well then it can enter into a risk 
mitigation measure which is called an interest rate swop which is the 
left portion of the figure. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright but before we go there let 
us just explain a term.  Let us leave derivatives out of our terminology. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At least for the moment.  
Transnet says I want to find a way using financial institutions to deal 
with this risk.  I want to mitigate the risk or I want to ensure against the 
20 
risk and I use that term very broadly and soon we will not use it 
anymore.  I want to hedge my risk. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:   Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So what does hedge mean? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Hedge means – very, very simply put 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 182 of 212 
 
Chair hedge means that you taking the risk away or you removing the 
risk from a potential negative situation but in order to do that we will 
get to that it costs money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it means you are guaranteeing against the risk 
almost?  You are protecting somebody against the risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But whether it is guaranteeing on something less than 
that we will get to hear in due course? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So let us just deal with one 
issue that I think is important to deal with because it becomes 
important later.  You can never guarantee the interest rate in the right 
hand box unless you enter into a fixed rate agreement. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now the decision of whether to 
enter into a fixed interest rate agreement or a floating interest rate 
agreement is something you are going to deal with in due course. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But anyway what happens here 
20 
is that Transnet decide to enter into a floating interest rate loan – R12 
billion – a lot of money, right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It cannot ever guarantee what 
the interest rates are going to be it is at risk.  So what it does it says I 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 183 of 212 
 
want to protect myself against the consequences of what I have done. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So whilst you can never 
guarantee an interest rate what you can do is say if things do not turn 
out well for me I can at least put in place another financial arrangement 
separate from this to mitigate the adverse circumstances of the 
decision I made to enter into a floating risk – floating rate arrangement. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so what is important 
because we talk about swops?  Right you talk about swops.  Noting is 
10 
swopped.  That original agreement on the right hand side remains the 
same. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Throughout your obligation to 
pay a floating interest rate remains. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So when we talk about swops we 
are talking about something entirely different from that word might 
indicate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Right so let us go to the 
left hand… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well will that still – is that still an elaboration on 
hedging because I just want to … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so… 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 184 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Finalise on hedging. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Hedging broadly 
speaking as I understand it is what you have described as the act of 
using financial instruments to deal with your risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  More particularly to protect 
yourself against the consequences of you having entered into a risky 
arrangement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So hedging is the broad 
10 
term used to describe the taking out of financial insurance as it were? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know why I am associating the word 
“hedging” with like fencing off. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Fencing off maybe in that way in this context maybe it 
is fencing off the risk.  I am not sure but I do not know why I am 
associating it with that. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that is not – that is actually a 
very good analogy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Because that is essentially from the 
borrower’s side what you want to do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  You want to protect yourself so let me 
take this money and enter into an arrangement that is going to take any 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 185 of 212 
 
risk out of out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So if I wanted to almost seclude 
myself in a sense if I can use that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  As an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Then I am going to put a hedge 
around me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  If I can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Relate to you on that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if the hedge protects.  A 
financial instrument called a hedge would also protect? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But a swap is one example of a 
20 
hedge? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Swap is one way in which you 
can hedge your risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 186 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or protect yourself against risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  The question arises of 
course which we deal with later is why this risk should have arisen in 
the first place. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we will come there and that 
is in fact a central part of your evidence? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fact the question arises if you 
10 
are now going to spend a lot of money hedging your floating interest 
rate risk why did you enter into a floating agreement in the first place? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because Chair you will learn 
that mere weeks after entering into a floating interest rate loan of 12 
billion Transnet commits itself to the spending of hundreds of millions 
of Rand to put itself in the position it would have been in a worse 
position but on a fixed rate basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and of course I heard evidence - I do not know 
whether it was two weeks back - about a situation where - I think it was 
20 
Transnet and I cannot remember if it was this transaction because 
there has been an overlap of evidence – where the initial arrangement 
was floating interest but then somebody came from Transnet at some 
stage and said no it must be changed to a fix rate … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 187 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in that context the witness was – was criticising 
the introduction of a fixed rate and I think indicating that in the context 
of that evidence that introducing a fixed rate was going to put Transnet 
in a worse off position … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I will – I will hear and we will try … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well you will hear Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That this insurance policy 
arrangement … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This hedging arrangement in a 
form of a swap … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was really very harmful to 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Transnet ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It lost a lot of money but that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We are getting there in due 
20 
course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think you – you will just – the legal team will 
just have to – members will have to liaise with one another to see who 
was leading a witness who was dealing with that … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we will get there Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 188 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see that it was not the same thing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the moment we are just at the 
level of principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. You wanted to say 
something. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No I think Chair … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do not confuse us please. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No, I will – I will not Chair.  I think 
the – I think you are referring to Mr Mahomedy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It could be.  I just cannot remember. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Of Transnet … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I think I am – my testimony is going 
to unpack … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  A lot more - the figures and numbers 
20 
that he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Referred to and with certain updates 
as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay thank you. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 189 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So at the moment we are just 
describing the hedging instrument.  The fact that it turned out to be a 
poor instrument which caused even more loss to Transnet.  We will deal 
with in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But for the moment Chair we 
have hedging as the utilisation of a financial instrument in order to 
mitigate against your risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And a swap being a form of hedging? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A swap is a form of hedging. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we are now going to 
describe what a swap is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So when one hedges – and in 
this case enters into a swap arrangement one does not swap anything 
with the original lender.  Your obligations remain fixed? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One can put a wall around that 
right hand box.  That stays the same? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the lender consortium are 
sitting happily in their offices in Sandton knowing that they are going to 
get their return - whatever the interest rate might be? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 190 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you remain liable to pay it? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry but they may - the idea that there should 
be hedging may come from them or not really – from the lender? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they want some certainty that … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Not necessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  I think it is – it has got to do with – it 
10 
has got to do with the ability of the borrower to meet his obligations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So in – and also to remove risk which 
gives them certain – then gives further certainty in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In the context.  So it – it is not 
necessarily that it would come from the lender as a – as a requirement 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  But if - if you take a view or if 
20 
Transnet were taking a view on – on interest rates then that would be 
an important consideration … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In the decision to either fix or to 
enter into a floating agreement. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 191 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well what I was thinking and I do not know if it 
has anything to do with the example of an insurance that Mr Pretorius 
has been or used earlier.  What I am thinking is that - you know – a 
bank might insist that you must take insurance when you buy a car and 
they help you to buy a car.  You must take insurance and you cannot 
start driving it until you have taken insurance.  They just want to make 
sure that if something happens then they will be covered.  So I was 
wondering whether a lender in this case might be interested that you – 
you as the borrower is it take a swap – a swap or do some hedging.  So 
– because they want to be double sure that they will be fine or not 
10 
really? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No Chair.  No you are absolutely 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In this particular context … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It would mean that the lender would – 
would cover his risk … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  With risk in the interest rate that is 
20 
charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So a higher interest rate would mean 
I perceive more risk … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 192 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In the person who is borrowing this 
money from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  The – the converse of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Is the - where the borrower says 
listen but I am a little uncomfortable with what potentially could happen 
going forward in the next year or two or whatever the case maybe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And that I need to do something 
10 
about that to protect my cash resources. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It is a – it is very much a cash flow 
and a cash flow issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Arrangement? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And I do not want to stay on the 
point for too long or dwell on it but you have already told the Chair that 
a lender may require a borrower to mitigate the risk of a downturn in 
20 
the economy for example? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that is an exception to the 
rule that you have just put out? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is possible. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 193 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, alright.  So let us get back 
to the box on the left hand side if we can.  We now have Transnet 
saying I want to find someone who I can deal with to mitigate my risk of 
having entered into a floating rate loan of … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  R12 billion and those parties 
Transnet on the one hand and the party that Transnet will deal with are 
called counterparties? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the – in the terminology 
10 
generally applicable … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the circumstance. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then the term is used 
elsewhere but here that is what the term is … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For both parties? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we know that in this case 
20 
Nedbank was the counterparty? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Transnet was the party 
seeking assistance or seeking insurance or seeking to enter into a 
swap arrangement to mitigate its risk? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 194 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So explain to the Chair 
Transnet says oops I am at risk.  I need help.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It goes to Nedbank and says I 
want us to enter into an arrangement called a swap? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which will protect me from the 
risk that I have entered into. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I want you – Nedbank – to insure 
my risk. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  How is that achieved? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair there is normally – let us – let 
us look at … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry – may I pause? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes of course. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If one was to extend – this is 
where the insurance analogy fails, right.  If I was to insure against any 
20 
risk for example my car being stolen I would pay a premium determined 
by actuaries and determined by the insurance company and if the event 
occurred I would be compensated for the loss of my car? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is not how it works here? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 195 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  There is – there is a second leg to it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Let us deal with that 
second leg. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM: 
 
Okay. 
 
Chair 
when 
the 
two 
counterparties come together and start discussing the whole or the 
potential of entering into a swap arrangement then they would – 
because we are dealing with interest rates and we are going to be 
dealing with that a lot through the testimony I would like to use that as 
10 
the analogy.  In other words both parties would have different or should 
have different views on interest rates.  The one is saying interest rates 
are going to go up.  The other one is saying interest rates will go down 
or will stay – or will stay more or less stable.  So you have to have the 
two opposing views to enter into such a transaction.  Now when it 
comes to the … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry may I interrupt you here? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When Transnet goes to Nedbank 
and says please I want to enter into a swap arrangement to protect me 
20 
against the risk because I am scared that they are going to go very 
high and I am not going to be able to pay, right. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Transnet wants a situation that it 
wants to pay a fixed rate? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 196 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So having entered into a floating 
interest rate agreement it is now going to pay a lot of money ultimately 
as we will learn to achieve a situation where it is going in effect when 
all the books are balanced pay a fixed rate? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So what is a swapped is the 
cash flow arising out of a floating interest rate with a fixed rate.  Now 
that maybe going too fast.  So you have got to unpack that slowly 
please. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay.  So Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but before you do that … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A swap arrangement would be between the borrower 
and - like the bank - or who would it be between?  You were saying 
earlier on when the two parties discuss that is the borrower and who? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And a party a financial institution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A - a third party? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  A third party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That would be interested in becoming 
a part of a swap agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and usually that would be a financial 
institution? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 197 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The point that the Chair raises is 
for our purposes a very important point because if you look at the left 
hand side of the diagram – the left hand box.  Counterparty Transnet 
and counterparty Nedbank enter into an arrangement completely 
separate from the static arrangement on the right hand side – the loan. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Nedbank as counterparty to the 
swap arrangement has nothing to do with the consortium of lenders in 
the right hand box.  It is an entirely separate third party? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair.  In this 
particular instance they were also part of the lending. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  (Intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Notionally – and I am sorry to 
use that word because I am now using it in the correct sense – 
notionally they are separate. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the transaction in the right 
hand box remains intact? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Nothing is swapped in or out. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 198 of 212 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct?  In the left hand box 
however it is an entirely separate financial arrangement with entirely 
different financial obligations that are not dependent in anyway on the 
financial obligations in the original loan agreement in the right hand 
box? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  So we are dealing with a 
separate arrangement with not separate parties but Transnet with a 
different hat on.  It is now protecting itself against risk? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And a counterparty who is 
entering into an arrangement to deal with Transnet in that aim? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the aim in this case in swap 
arrangement which was a hedging instrument would be for Transnet to 
be in a position where it knows and has certainty about the interest 
rate it will pay.  In other words 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words akin to a fixed 
interest rate? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you tell us then 
please how this deal is structured and how it works. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  So Chair because there are two 
parties the one – the one is to pay – because Transnet wants to enter 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 199 of 212 
 
into the fixed rate in other words or assume a fixed rate on the - in this 
particular context.  They would pay the fixed – the interest using the 
fixed rate to the counterparty Nedbank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry – you said they would pay 
the interest.  You must be careful here.  They are not paying the 
interest that arises from the agreement between the lender and the 
borrower in the right hand box. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  They are paying the fixed rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They are paying a fixed rate. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  A fixed rate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not the fixed rate. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The fixed rate belongs … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  In this context. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, well – they are paying a 
fixed rate negotiated between Nedbank and Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They are paying an amount 
equivalent to a fixed rate? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But let us not get into that 
detail. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And Chair Nedbank would do the 
same.  In this particular case they would be paying the floating rate.  
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 200 of 212 
 
So – so they – they would have the view that interest rates would 
remain stable or might increase slightly or whatever the case may be.  
So that would as I – as I indicated previously they have to have 
opposing views in what – how interest rates would move but what is 
important to understand it says there pays the floating rate and – and 
Transnet pays the fixed rate.  The – they do not literally pay the rates 
to each other.  They would – they would – because there is a – we are 
talking about an amount.  The one – you would calculate the amount 
using the floating rate and you would calculate the amount using the 
fixed rate and you would substrate the from each other and depending 
10 
on how the move – the interest rates have moved only the net portion – 
the net part of that amount – would be paid to either or one of the – 
either of the parties.  Does that make sense? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us go back to the role players. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have Transnet wanting to borrow R12 billion and 
then you have a consortium that is prepared to lend R12 billion to 
Transnet? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  They enter into an agreement in terms of 
20 
which the interest rate that Transnet will pay will be a floating interest 
rate.  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now Transnet becomes concerned about the – 
the fluctuation of the interest rate.  Is that right? 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 201 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And wants to protect itself against that? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where the hedging comes in and the swap 
coming in as well as form of hedging? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now normally would the lender in the main agreement 
– if we can call it that relating to R12 billion – the lender in that 
transaction would not be the one that takes part in the swap 
arrangement or would it? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words if I am getting the 12 million – R12 
billion from you and there is a fluctuating interest rate that we have 
agreed and now I want to protect myself against the fluctuation of the 
floating interest.  I need somebody else to talk to or can it also be you? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It can be the same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It can be the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be the same? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what is the norm? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  No there is no norm in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no norm, ja. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  It depends on the transaction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 202 of 212 
 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  And it depends on the parties 
involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words I can – you can say to me well we 
are agreeing on a floating rate – floating interest rate in regard to this 
R12 billion but should you want a swap we can talk about that but that 
would be a separate transaction. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is important Chair in an

entirely separate transaction. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes an entirely separate transaction.  So in this case 
you have pointed out that Nedbank was – was a member of the 
consortium … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was lending Transnet the R12 billion … 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was also a party that was dealing with Transnet 
with regard to concluding a swap arrangement? 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So just to summarise.  
In the right hand box of this diagram on page 21 Transnet has borrowed 
R12 billion at a floating interest rate.  Those obligations remain fixed 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 203 of 212 
 
for the duration of the loan? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Transnet sits down however and 
thinks about what it has done and says but I think interest rates may go 
through the roof.  They may go to such a high level that it is going to 
put us in financial difficulty.  Correct? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So it says I need to find 
someone – a counterparty – in this case Transnet to enter into a 
financial arrangement to hedge my risk.  Correct? 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It then sits down with a 
counterparty Nedbank.  Now Nedbank on the other hand (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Sorry Mr Pretorius.  I just want to make sure I 
follow.  I do not know whether you made a mistake or I misunderstand 
the way you – you put it.  It was as if a concern would arise from 
Nedbank. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then I was wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought it would arise from Transnet? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Transnet sits down … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And says – did I say Nedbank? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Late Friday afternoon.  I could 
easily have said … 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 204 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I may have misunderstood but that is how I – I 
understood. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well let us – let us not 
argue that point (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright.  So the concern from the borrower? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  The borrower says look I 
have entered … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have - now I am thinking about 
it.  I have entered into a loan arrangement with a floating interest rate.  
10 
What if interest rates go through the roof?  I better protect myself.  So 
it goes to counterparty Nedbank and moves into a discreet separate 
transaction using a swap as a hedging instrument. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and it says to – Nedbank 
on the other hand say your fear may not be so real.  I will insure you, 
right? 
DR JOATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I will let you pay me the 
equivalent of a fixed rate and I will pay you floating rate. 
20 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So if interest rates go 
through the roof all you have to pay me is the fixed rate. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I will pay you the floating rate 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 205 of 212 
 
and then you can pay your lender. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Nedbank also takes a risk 
now in this hedging? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Yes Chair they do if – if the – the rate 
– the floating rate starts to increase then it is to the benefit of Transnet 
because remember they said they – they worked on a certain floating 
rate.  So if that – if floating rates start to edge off or rates start to edge 
up then – then that would be to the benefit of the – of the party that is 
paying the fixed rate. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So let us just talk about 
the insurance policy – the hedging – the swap – for the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you do that Mr Pretorius please do not 
forget the point you wanted to put.  I just want to follow this correctly.  
You – you emphasised at some stage earlier that for a swap 
arrangement it is important that the two parties should have different 
views as to what is likely to happen with regard to interest rates? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the more we talk about it the more I begin to 
understand why it is necessary to have that but you will talk more about 
20 
that in due course but a swap arrangement would not be necessary – 
would it – for a borrower who before entering into the main agreement 
would have done his or her homework properly.  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do your homework properly in terms of what is 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 206 of 212 
 
likely to happen in the interest rates in the years to come and you are 
confident of the assessment you have made.  You would choose 
whether you go for the floating interest rate or the fixed rate and you 
would then say because I am comfortable I do not need that – a swap 
arrangement.  Is that right? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Chair that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Generally speaking? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Absolutely right and that is actually 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  A fundamental part of the testimony 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That we will get to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when you go to – in this case – when 
Transnet having concluded its agreement with the consortium for the 
loan of R12 billion when it goes to Nedbank it then enters into a fixed 
term kind of rate. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which it could … 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At huge costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja at – at whatever cost which it could have done 
with – with the consortium? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That is correct Chair and as I said 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 207 of 212 
 
that would be – that is going to be a fundamental part of - of how … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your evidence? 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Of the evidence and the timeline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  That we are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it is 4 o’ clock and I do not 
know what your arrangement are (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes we did not talk. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But I just what to highlight two 
10 
issues … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If I may at this stage? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I will – I will allow you … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have raised a very important 
point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which is fundamental to the 
evidence to come that within days of entering into this floating rate 
agreement Transnet is entering into the swap arrangement on the basis 
20 
of a fixed rate.  The second point is the fixed rate in the swap is much 
higher than the fixed rate it would have entered into on a market loan 
and the added point is the only party benefitting here - the only parties 
to benefit from this arrangement are the service providers who are 
arranging these swaps. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 208 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not Transnet? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is all at the cost of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Chair the question arises is 
why was it done in by this way.  By whom was it done for whose benefit 
and those are the questions that arise in this testimony and hopefully 
will be answered in full by the end of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The Transnet testimony as 
whole. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no thank you.  We did not talk about when 
we will end today but we normally end at four unless we have made 
other arrangements.  Today we are going to end at four but we are not 
done with Dr Bloom.  So we will have to continue on Monday.  Is that in 
order? I know there is a witness for … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Monday we have a witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who must be called on Monday. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So it will have to be fitted in 
after that and I will discuss it with you Chair having discussed it with 
the legal teams planners. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let me – let me just say I do not know what 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 209 of 212 
 
your plans are.  What I had in mind based on the understanding that at 
some stage you may have thought that Dr Bloom’s evidence would take 
one day.  I was thinking that depending on how much more time we 
need with him it would be good if we did not break the evidence but I 
do not know the other witness whether he is going to be here for a few 
days or he would have to leave. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The planning is rigid around that 
I am afraid given the travel arrangements … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Health and planning … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But maybe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I was thinking from my side – I do not know 
– I was thinking if we needed for example another two hours or three 
hours or how much more … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you think? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Almost a day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Almost a day? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No that – that is fine.  It is just that it 
would – it is a pity if we are going to have a long break. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This kind of technical evidence once you are in to it – 
it would be better to go on and finish but there are things that we 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 210 of 212 
 
cannot disturb in terms of  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Next week’s arrangements. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair and we will when we 
resume review this particular point 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will make sure that we 
understand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The terminology to allow us then 
10 
to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Refer to these concepts … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As we do frequently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because these – this swap 
arrangement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is fundamental? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is fundamental to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To his evidence. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A point that the witness will 
make. 
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 211 of 212 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let us look early next week in terms of fixing the 
date when Dr Bloom would come back … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As soon as possible. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It will be next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It should 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Given availability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it – it can be sometime next week? 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja that – that would be very helpful. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be very helpful, ja.  Okay.  Then we are 
going to adjourn now until Monday.  Mr Pretorius you – I know you are 
not leading the evidence of the witness on Monday but do you – do you 
know whether he is likely to finish in one day or should we start earlier 
than normal? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have any idea? 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes two days have been 
allocated to the witness.  10 o’ clock would be in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  We - we will adjourn then for now and 
we will start at 10 o’ clock on Monday.  Dr Bloom thank you very much 
but you will still come back to continue with – with your evidence.  
31 MAY 2019 – DAY 103 
 
Page 212 of 212 
 
Hopefully it can be sometime next week before one forgets the – the 
part that you have given today. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank very much. 
DR JONATHAN ZORAH BLOOM:  Pleasure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will then adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
