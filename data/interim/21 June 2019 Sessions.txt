PROCEEDINGS ON 21 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon Ms Hofmeyr, good afternoon 
everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed.  Chair, there are two legal 
representatives who’d like to place themselves on record if they may.  
The second of them want to raise some matters for your consideration.  
I propose that he be afforded an opportunity to do so and then if 
necessary there’ll be a response from the legal team.  And then 
10 
thereafter my learned friend Ms Buthelezi will be presenting the 
evidence of Ms Phatudi.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV JULIAN KNIGHT:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JULIAN KNIGHT:  My name is Julian Knight, I’m appearing on 
behalf of witness Tlatsana who’s been summoned to appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Good afternoon, morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
20 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  I’m Nqabayethu Buthelezi appearing 
on behalf of Mr Brian van Wyk.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You’ll just have to raise your voice. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Mr Brian van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  I understand you’d like to raise some 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 3 of 224 
 
issues. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Indeed so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Firstly Chair, we want to bring an 
application for condonation on several points.  One, for non compliance 
with the rules of the commission in that it is our submission that we 
were not served with any of the notices.  Now Mr van Wyk is already 
implicated by Mr Ngwenya, I understand now yesterday it was by Mr 
Phiri and we anticipate that he’ll be implicated by witness Phatudi and 
witness Tlatsana.  Now we canvas the point the evidence leaders about 
10 
the service of the notice and we say that Mr van Wyk was not served 
with these notices.  The query now becomes this point, the email 
address to which they were served is an email address received from 
one of the witnesses in what they said was the correspondence 
between them and we dispute the veracity of that email address to say 
is it Mr van Wyk’s email address, it’s a gmail account and that is the 
only source of that email address.  Now what the challenge then 
becomes Chair, is that if indeed somebody implicated to the extent that 
Mr van Wyk is implicated by up to four witnesses, I would have thought 
or would have anticipated that the owner’s to ensure that he receives 
20 
the notices was mere would go beyond just sending to an email address 
that you yourselves have never verified number one.  And nothing 
stopped the Commission from even picking up a telephone to say, dear 
Mr van Wyk, can you give us your email address?  There’s documents 
we’d like to serve on you.  That step was never taken Chair and all we 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 4 of 224 
 
have is just the evidence as produced by Ms Tlatsana.  Now it’s not 
relevant at this point but it will be in the future because this company 
Koreneka that is now the substance of the disputes with SA Express , is 
in litigation in the Northwest High Court under case number M40/216 
where the persons that Ms Tlatsana or have been stated by Mr 
Ngwenya to have been implicated by Tlatsana, have not or have taken 
legal action with regards to this issue.  And I’m not sure if the 
Commission is aware but it is our knowledge that Ms Tlatsana herself is 
out on R 500 000 bail on fraud charges relating to very similar issues.  
Now we want to say Chair, and we come before this Commission to 
10 
state that Mr van Wyk has not received notice and we feel extreme 
prejudice to the extent that we will now go onto the third witness 
without us having one considered any of the statements as produced 
and to the fourth witness which I understand would be Ms Tlatsana who 
has video or voice recordings or something along those lines where we 
don’t know what they say.  So we seek one chair, to be allowed to 
consider the statements of Mr Ngwenya, the statements of Mr Phiri 
even though that they now have given their evidence.  Number two, if 
the Chair can rule in our regard to say the evidence of Phatudi and 
Tlatsana to stand down for us to then submit to the Commission our 
20 
responses to their statements as alleged to have been submitted to us 
and we understand appreciate that this now could have the effect of 
derailing the scheduling and everything else around the Commission 
but Chair if we take it to the extent that we’ve got somebody implicated 
in the way that Mr van Wyk is implicated, I think it’s in the interest of 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 5 of 224 
 
justice Chair as a starting point and in the best interest of this 
Commission Chair to at least to be placed in a position where the 
Commission can consider Mr van Wyk’s statement before proceeding 
with these witnesses as is the rules of the Commission Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will hear what the evidence leader has to say but let 
me ask you certain questions so that we can see what progress we 
make. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, you worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I said last week, I say quite often in this Commission 
we want to ensure fairness to everybody and therefore we want to 
10 
strike a balance between the interest of peace and persons who are 
implicated, the interest of witnesses, the interest of the public, the 
interest of the Commission which must finish its work within a certain 
said time which is not very long.  Now one well in terms of bringing an 
application if you wish to, if Mr van Wyk wishes to apply for leave for 
cross-examine any of the witnesses including those who have already 
finished giving evidence there is an opportunity to do so.  If he was 
given notice in terms of rule 3.3 but is outside the (inaudible) time 
period, he can apply for condonation and give reasons if there was a 
delay in him actually becoming aware he can put all of that in. 
20 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if leave to cross-examine any particular witness 
is granted, he would have that opportunity if he wishes to and then he 
would have the opportunity to give evidence himself or to call another 
witness you know all of that just needs to apply, you need to apply for 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 6 of 224 
 
leave to do that.  Now one of the sub rules in rule 3 of the rules of the 
Commission makes provision that if you as an implicated person feel 
that you were not given by the Commission or the legal team enough 
time between the date when you received the rule 3.3 notice and the 
date when the witness gives evidence to apply for leave to cross-
examine, you may bring an application before the Commission and for 
such relieve as the Chairperson may consider would be appropriate to 
make sure that you are not seriously prejudiced by that.  So there is 
that provision and it’s meant to take care of situations where people get 
rule 33 notice late.  So that is still possible and can be done.  What has 
10 
happened sometimes is that a witness a person who is implicated was 
not notified of a witness who’s going to come and implicate or her and 
in those circumstances where the legal team of the Commission didn’t 
really send anything.  I have been inclined to say the witness should- 
we should adjourn the evidence of the witness until later when that 
person has can be notified or last week I said that the witness could 
give evidence but leave out for now evidence that would implicate a 
particular person and with a view that after that person had been given 
a rule 33 notice then arrangements could be made for the witness to 
come back and then give evidence.  I just thought I must just give you 
20 
that framework. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because maybe from it you might be able to say to 
me Mr van Wyk and yourselves want to cooperate with the Commission, 
you’re not seeking to frustrate the proceedings of the Commission in 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 7 of 224 
 
any way but you would just like a way to be accommodated and then if 
you might, we might be able to look at way in which that can be done.  
So I thought I must just mention this framework before I can hear what 
the legal team might say.  I don’t know whether you want to say 
anything in response to this framework. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Yes, please Chair.  I appreciate 
those points Chair.  It is not our intention to stall or frustrate the 
Commission in any way, our biggest concern is after having learned- 
the horse is bolted on the evidence of Ngwenya and the evidence of 
Phiri.  The best we can do in those circumstances is to come back with 
10 
an application to cross-examine on the back of our own version with 
regards to Phatudi we don’t carry much apprehension towards Phatudi.  
The concern in this particular instance is that of Tlatsana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Whom I believe that the evidence of 
Ngwenya as it stands was a corroboration of her own evidence but, 
sorry Chair- having done it in reverse.  Excuse me.  No we would like to 
in particular there is reference made to things like telephone recordings 
and before these get played out in the public domain as its alleged the 
least we could ask is to be granted time to actually verify that is it 
20 
really Mr van Wyk, nobody had heard Mr van Wyk’s voice.  And before 
the Commission takes on record, we need to say well let them go ahead 
and lead that evidence, we’ll counter it after.  But we need to be placed 
in a position where we can be with certainty say, that is Mr van Wyk 
and the authenticity of those recordings can then be verified.  So 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 8 of 224 
 
prayer to you Chair in this regard is to say, if the Commission- we 
would not object to the Commission continuing with Phatudi but we 
would ask to be furnished with everything that regards to Tlatsana in 
the earliest time possible and then have a return date as soon as even 
next week or whenever the Commission sits again.  So we stand-down 
Tlatsana just for today for us because the issue that primarily concerns 
us is that she’s going to leading evidence on voice recordings and 
those voice recordings are most concerning for us because once the 
evidence is out on that whether they are authentic or not then we 
cannot reverse that process.  And that is the prejudice that I anticipate 
10 
and am cautioning against.  You know I will not cause dispersions the 
integrity of the Commission in any way however I will revert back to the 
points that difficult as it is the work of the Commission, I had a 
discussion with Ms Hofmeyr earlier with regards to there isn’t a process 
in these proceedings to come back with a return of service.  However I 
would think that there would be a standard applicable to the extent that 
if somebody is implicated up to four times or by four witnesses that a 
mere provision of his email address that you have not verified with that 
individual would require you to just ascertain that it may not bounce 
back as an email sent.  But if it’s sent to some dormant email account 
20 
that was used or created for that specific purpose that he no longer 
checks then we cannot hold it to be true that he received it and I think 
it may assist the Commission going forward to say there should be 
double check step to say, so and so can you confirm that this is your 
email address.  That’s all and that’s even where that’s via text or via a 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 9 of 224 
 
phone call and we’re saying in this instance before the Commission is 
saddled with tape recordings which we find a very suspicious for 
reasons that are of inferred and insinuated towards to say there may be 
other motifs at play here.  We just want to be granted that opportunity 
to one, witness the statement and listen to the tapes and then allow the 
Commission to proceed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’ll hear what Ms Hofmeyr has to say and then we can 
take it from there.   
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, just to deal first of all with the facts in 
relation to the efforts that were taken by the Commission to ensure that 
rule 33 notices were sent to Mr van Wyk.  I’d like to go into that in 
some details so that you have those facts before you but in advance of 
doing that Chair, I’d like to pick up a point that my learned friend raised 
at the end.  He correctly raised the point that I made to him in our 
discussion earlier that it is not a requirement that these rule 33 notices 
be served as that notion accords with process in the course of civil 
20 
criminal proceedings.  There’s a important distinction in our regulations 
of this Commission between service of summonses which must take 
place that’s a requirement of the Commissions act.  The rules by 
contrast in relation to rule 33 notices simply talk about notifying and 
Chair in that regard my learned friend was questioning, well what level 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 10 of 224 
 
of satisfaction should we then have.  And for that purpose Chair, I’d 
like to draw your attention to the Constitutional Courts decision in 
Sebola.  The reference is 20125SA142 Constitutional Court.  Chair, 
you’ll recall that’s a decision about Section 129 of the National Credit 
Act which requires certain notification to be given to consumers by 
credit providers before litigation can be engaged in and a very similar 
question arouse there.  Well, what level of satisfaction must the credit 
provider have when it’s dependent on things like a postal service that 
may or may not be working etcetera.  And as I understand the upshot of 
the judgement in that case is that there must be a reasonable grounds 
10 
for regarding it to be probable that it was received.  It’s not a service 
requirement, 
it’s 
not 
returns 
of 
service 
and 
sheriffs, 
it’s 
a 
reasonableness test.  Have enough steps been taken to make it 
reasonable to regard there as having been adequate notification.  So 
my submission is that that’s the test that should frame the question that 
has been placed before you and with that in mind I’d like to give you 
those facts.  Chair, the notices was sent as my learned friend indicated 
to the email address that was used by Mr van Wyk in all of his 
correspondence with Ms Tlatsana in the course of their engagements 
and it was gleaned from the documents that have come into the 
20 
possession of the Commission.  And to that email was sent notices, I’ll 
give you the information.  In relation to Mr Ngwenya on the 30 t h of May 
at 16h46 in the afternoon, in relation to Ms Phatudi on the 4 t h of June 
at 12h04 in the afternoon, in relation to Mr Phiri on the 6 t h of June at 
15h18 in the afternoon and in relation to Ms Tlatsana on the 14 t h of 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 11 of 224 
 
June at 15h44 in the afternoon.  There were no none delivery messages 
received by the Commission pursuant to those emails being sent out.  
Chair, I’m also informed by the investigators who are with us today in 
the hearing that numerous attempts over the course of the investigation 
have been made to contact Mr van Wyk including at the time that we 
were preparing the rule 33 notices in order to establish that email 
address.  For privacy reasons I’m not going to read all of them but six 
different phone numbers associated with Mr van Wyk from the public 
records that the Commission could access were phoned repeatedly by 
the 
investigators 
of 
the 
Commission. 
 
Chair, 
it 
is 
in 
those 
10 
circumstances that we proceeded with the evidence of Mr Ngwenya and 
Mr Phiri.  And it is my submission that we should continue with the 
evidence of Ms Phatudi and Ms Tlatsana today.  So let me deal with 
that aspect.  Why do we continue today despite an issue having been 
raised this morning and a contention that there has not been receipt 
despite all of those steps being taken.  Chair, it’s my submission we 
continue because as I ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I should have asked Mr Buthelezi but I raise this with 
you so you can address it and ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If need be you can address it later.  He didn’t I don’t 
remember that he told me what as a matter of fact is the relationship 
between the current relationship between Mr van Wyk and the email 
address that was used.  Does it remain his but he doesn’t check it?  
Does it now belong to somebody else?  So I didn’t ask him to address 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 12 of 224 
 
to deal with that so he will deal, I’ll ask him when he responds. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if it’s necessary I’ll make submission 
thereafter.  I would however at this point make the submission that the 
test is, was it reasonable for the Commission to assume that the 
notification required under the rules have been given and it is my 
submission to you given those facts that there was no notification or 
any step that was not taken that should have been taken nor an 
indicator that the Commission should have done more than what it did.  
10 
And in those circumstances it will be our submission whatever Mr van 
Wyk’s relationship to the email address is that we are entitled to 
proceed with the evidence.  And I’d like ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s just that if he has a certain relationship with the 
email. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might make it difficult for him to continue to 
complain. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it’s another relationship, you might feel yet he can 
20 
still complain. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair, and ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I understand what you are saying.  Yes, but that’s 
the reason behind the query, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course Chair.  The high watermark of his 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 13 of 224 
 
argument however I submit whatever that relationship is is to have to 
respond to whether the steps were reasonable or not and I submit no 
matter what that relationship is, the steps taken by the Commission 
were reasonable.  And Chair, if I may there’s a greater significance to 
these points and it’s a point that Chair you made in your debate with 
my learned friend.  This Commission has a limited time in which to 
complete its work, it cannot possible be in a position where despite 
taking reasonable steps witnesses can arrive on the day of evidence 
and say it cannot proceed.  There is a balance as you’ve said 
repeatedly Chair but against these facts we submit that balance must 
10 
stand in favour of the evidence proceeding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course, I think in the case that came up last 
week involving Ms Tlatsana and Ms Jiba.  I think it was a fact if I recall 
correctly that Ms Jiba had not been even informed you know that there 
was somebody who was going to give evidence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there was, it wasn’t the legal teams case that 
they had taken a number of steps to try and bring these facts to the 
fact of a witness coming up to give evidence implicating her to her 
attention and so on.  So you say this is a case where the legal team 
20 
and the Commission have done every reasonable, have taken every 
reasonable step. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To try and make sure that Mr van Wyk gets the rule 
33 notice and if despite those steps he didn’t get it that doesn’t mean 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 14 of 224 
 
that there’s been no compliance with the rule. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Chair, then just to deal with the question of 
prejudice because that’s ultimately what this debate must be about.  As 
I understand my learned friend submission, the principle prejudice 
relates to a recording that is going to be played in the course of the 
evidence this afternoon.  Chair, if Mr van Wyk disputes that it is him in 
that recording that he was there at the time, that version can be put up 
to this Commission in due course in any affidavit that he wishes to 
10 
present.  And on the question of condonation, I should go on record 
and say as a legal team we would certainly not oppose any 
condonation.  It is in the interest of this Commission that we find out 
what the true facts are, we want to hear it is our submission from 
implicated persons.  Mr van Wyk can put on affidavit in due course 
whether he makes an application to cross-examine Ms Tlatsana or other 
witnesses or whether he simply wishes to place his version before this 
Commission.  He can set out the precise grounds on which he disputes 
it, we can consider it at as legal team and we can make submissions in 
due course and even approach you Chair to summons him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To give further evidence in due course in these 
proceedings.  So on the question of prejudice Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We submit Mr van Wyk’s version that is what 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 15 of 224 
 
fairness is about.  It’s about giving people an opportunity to be heard.  
There’s no sense in which Mr van Wyk will not be heard in the 
processes of the Commission.  If he follows the rules even with the 
necessity of condonation, if he puts his version up it will be 
interrogated as all versions are interrogated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair, those are our submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Buthelezi, do you want to start with the question 
that I didn’t ask you earlier? 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Indeed so Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Mr van Wyk’s version with regards to 
that email address is that it’s an abandoned email address that he is no 
longer using. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean it remains his email address but he 
doesn’t use it anymore? 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  That’s what I’ve been led to 
understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  And there’s been years ... 
20 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he, so it’s still operational but? 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  I’d say it’s dormant Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm? 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  It’s a dormant email address. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 16 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, does it receive emails?  Well, from what I’m 
hearing it looks like it may have received it the emails but the may or 
may not have come to his attention because from what you say he has 
abandoned it. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  By way of illustration Chair, how 
some of these things work just not even analogy but practically.  You 
sometimes will set up let say even a gmail account, forget the password 
and never go around to rectify and remembering the password.  And if it 
was created for a specific purpose at a specific time, you then abandon 
it.  Where I bring it back to Chair is here, is that my learned friend here 
10 
states that they took reasonable steps and we say there was no 
reasonable steps.  Let’s start this point, Mr Ngwenya who is a former 
employer of Mr van Wyk has far more personal information or the 
domicilium of Mr Ngwenya- of Mr van Wyk sorry, and other details 
where he’s easily contactable.  Now ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are talking about a witness another witness. 
ADV 
NQABAYETHU 
BUTHELEZI: 
 
No, 
I’m 
saying 
they 
were 
collaborating with the evidence leaders they could have easily cross 
referenced the correctness of the information as to say if this person is 
a former employee, what details do you have? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they say they have, they got up to six numbers.  I 
don’t know whether they were all cell phone numbers or landline and 
cell phone numbers which they’ve tried. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  The question becomes from who 
tried.  From who Chair? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 17 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm? 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  Where do they receive them from? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I’m sure they can give you all those numbers if 
you want. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  But the point and that’s the point I’m 
going to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  The point I’m going to is that you 
can- it’s not sufficient to say we tried six numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
10 
ADV NQABAYETHU BUTHELEZI:  We need to have tried six numbers 
from credible sources that make it probable that these numbers are 
yours.  So on these two points, one that this email that they sent it to, 
the never verified or cross referenced whether it’s still active, they 
received it from correspondence and they pick it up on line and they 
take no further steps to ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I do not know much about technology … 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you no longer want people to use an email 
address that is stealing your name are you not supposed to take steps 
20 
that will make sure people cannot use it to communicate with you? 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Indeed so Chair. However the only source 
and the only person the communication thus far - based on what we 
know – the correspondence only happened with Tlatsana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 18 of 224 
 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  So if the relationship breakdown … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  You said that the relationship between 
Mr van Wyk and the email address … 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that it is an abandoned email address. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So from what you said it seems to me that it is 
accepted that it is his email address. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The only difference is that as far as he is concerned 
10 
it is abandoned but it seems from what I hear from the legal team it 
seems like it still receives emails.  That is why I asked you the question 
whether if you have an email address and you no longer want people to 
use it to communicate with you there is not something you are 
supposed to do to make sure nobody can use that email to 
communicate with you because if there is such a way then Mr van Wyk 
would only have himself to blame if people continue to use that email 
address to communicate with him and he does not see correspondence 
that is sent to him because he – he does not check that email address 
anymore. 
20 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  I am with you Chair on that line of 
thinking to a certain point and then I abandon you Chair.  What you – 
the proposition that you put Chair with regards to how this email would 
be managed is correct. 
Where there I then want to abandon you Chair is this point:  
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 19 of 224 
 
is the source of where this email address comes from is - is 
problematic for the Commission because if it is coming from a person 
who is implicating Mr van Wyk and it is being gleaned from alleged 
correspondence which is now being presented to you Chair a fact to 
say we have emails where they corresponded and the veracity of those 
emails whether they are authentic or not has not been subjected – has 
not been subjected to the legal process Chair and we are now being 
told this is a legitimate email address based on the correspondence 
between the parties on evidence that is not admitted in this 
Commission yet Chair to say is this correct or not.  That is the first 
10 
point. 
The second point Chair is that we then need to look at the 
time when this correspondence took place.  If I – like we say it is an 
abandoned email address or how (indistinct) well there needs to be a 
second form of correspondence from someone else who can then say I 
too corresponded with van Wyk on this address and I am saying the 
submissions that we accept as true everything that comes from 
Tlatsana I think is premature.  We are not there yet Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is an email address … 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I am told was used to send the Rule 3.3 Notices 
to Mr van Wyk. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Based on what you have said that email address is 
Mr van Wyk’s email address … 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 20 of 224 
 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from what you say or what you have been 
instructed he did not receive the Rule 3.3 Notices from the 
Commission. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The legal team of the Commission says they were 
sent to that email address and there was nothing that the legal 
received back to say it was rejected or the notices were not received 
into the email – email – into that email address. 
So you say in support of the proposition that Mr van Wyk did 
10 
not receive the email you say but you people used an abandoned 
address – an email address and all that amounts to is it is an email 
address that belongs to Mr van Wyk but which he has chosen not to 
check anymore … 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the difficulty I have with that is if anybody 
chooses to – no longer to use an email address that still remains 
available to people to use then he cannot complain if people use it.  
That – that is where I come in.  It is common cause it is his email 
address.  The legal team says the Rule 3.3 Notices were sent to that 
20 
email address. 
As I understand it you are not in a position to dispute that it 
was sent … 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say - you say my client never – does not 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 21 of 224 
 
check that email address anymore because he considers it abandoned.  
So the question is as long as it remains available for people to 
communicate with him he cannot complain if the notices were sent to it. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  I can accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand that? 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  I am with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So unless there is something else my inclination 
would be to allow the evidence to continue but if you or Mr van Wyk 
wishes to apply for leave to cross-examine you – you should feel free 
to do that.  He should feel free to do that and the application would be 
10 
looked into in due course and he will – if granted leave to 
cross-examine – be able to cross-examine the witnesses in respect of 
whom he will get leave to cross-examine. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  I am indebted to you Chair.  I think what 
we wanted to be is to be brought on – onside with regards to our own 
non-compliance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  With bringing all the applications that are 
necessary to either to bring our own evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Or to cross-examine etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  So with your condonation Chair we ask to 
be – to bring all those applications as well as the (indistinct) but where 
we are short now Chair is that what is the process now if we allege that 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 22 of 224 
 
we do not have these notices to then receive these documents Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you – if – if for whatever reason it is 
convenient for you to obtain all of those notices today … 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instead of going to check on the email address. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure the legal team will make arrangements to 
make sure you – you are given all the notices and everything that was 
sent to that email address. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  That is the only request.  We just ask to 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  To provide them with a different email 
address … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  For them to be resent (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I am sure that – I am sure that can be 
arranged, ja. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That can be arranged.  Ms Hofmeyr does hear and 
20 
she has got colleagues here.  So make arrangements with them.  They 
will accommodate you. 
MR NQABAYETHU MKHIZE:  I am indebted to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr I do not think you want 
to say anything? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 23 of 224 
 
MS KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We are indebted to you for your 
ruling … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Buthelezi will continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Than you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Our witness for today is Ms Phatudi.  She is

MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  (duly sworn, states) 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Before proceed I had had in mind that we 
would take lunch at the normal time which is 1 o’ clock but we have had 
some delay.  It would be better that we finish with Ms Phatudi I think 
before we take the lunch break.  So that when we come back we can go 
into the next witness.  So I am – I see her statement is 109 pages. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I imagine that we should be able to finish – what – 
in 30 minutes – 45 minutes? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  45 minutes to an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least not later.  Not more than an hour. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 25 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Not more than hour.  I will try. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, at least let us see whether we can finish by 
maybe half past … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  One. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we have not finished by then we will take the lunch 
break anyway.  Is that fine? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair the affidavit of Ms … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms – Ms Phatudi I have just changed the lunch – the 
lunch arrangement.  Is it fine with you or were you having some plans 
for lunch? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  No it is okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is okay.  Alright, thank you.  Let us go ahead. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair the affidavit of Ms Phatudi is on 
EXHIBIT DD7.  Chair there are some – there is an … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing Ms Phatudi’s statement 
will be marked EXHIBIT DD7. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair there is a statement of the current 
HOD for the Department of Transport North West.  It is the statement of 
Ms Mofokeng that has been added to this bundle.  We do not intend to 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 26 of 224 
 
call oral evidence for this witness.  She is merely corroborating the 
evidence of Ms Phatudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  At some stage we will need to 
– you will need to read out important features of the affidavit so that if 
we are not going to lead her evidence or use her evidence. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that the public has an idea what she or he was 
going to say. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Phatudi would you please turn to 
EXHIBIT DD7 page 1. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you confirm that is the affidavit you 
made for the Commission? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I confirm that this is the affidavit I 
submitted to the Commission Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And you confirm that the signature on page 
10 of this document is your signature? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I confirm that the signature on 
20 
page 10 of the affidavit is mine Chairperson. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Are there any corrections that you 
would like to make on this affidavit? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  On my affidavit on point 
17. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 27 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Paragraph 17 or paragraph – paragraph … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Ja.  Page 4 - paragraph 17 on page 
4.  The sentence reads: 
“As per SLA the department was to make a 
prepayment subsidy to the value of 112 million 
relating to 2014/2015 financial year.” 
It should be 2015/2016 financial year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So we change 2014 to reflect 2015 … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then 2015 to be 2016? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  And then paragraph 18: 
“The department received an invoice from SA 
Express valued at 51 million.” 
This should be – the 51 million should be – should read 50 
million and the correct invoice was provided or has been provided. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  There is an invoice attached as 
Annexure KP3 on page 65 of your – your affidavit.  Chair, may I request 
that that invoice be exchanged for the correct invoice?  Annexure KP3 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I have numbered this invoice as – as per 
what is on Annexure KP3. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 28 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Okay.  The other correction is on 
paragraph 38.  The amount stated on the first line: 
“Valoteck issued their first invoice of 15.06.” 
Is actually 15 850.  So this was an error but the – the attached invoice 
is of the correct amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it 15 850 000? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The last correction is on paragraph 
39.  The first sentence there says: 
10 
“Valoteck was appointed to do ground handling 
services sometime in 2016.” 
We want to add the month there.  It is sometime in June 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What para - what paragraph did you say that it is? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It is paragraph 39 Chair the first 
sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just tell me what you are saying about that. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The first – the first sentence reads: 
“Valoteck was appointed to do ground handling 
services sometime in 2016.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  the correction that we are making 
is that: 
“Valoteck was appointed to do ground handling 
services sometime in June 2016.” 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 29 of 224 
 
We missed the month there.  So we are putting that in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  These are all the corrections that 
we would like to make. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Ms Phatudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – you will prepare a supplementary affidavit 
… 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To take care of that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will do so Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Phatudi would you please give us your 
credentials, your qualifications and the position that you currently 
hold? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI: 
 
Thank 
you 
Chair. 
 
My 
qualifications:  I have a BCom Degree and major subjects were 
accounting and management.  Further to that I also did a Master’s in 
Business Administration – the finance stream.  My current occupation is 
I am the CFO for the Department of Community, Safety and Transport 
Management in the Department of North West. 
20 
I started – I held this position since July 2013 to date.  
Before I was appointed as CFO I held the position of Director Finance 
in the same department from 2009 to July 2013.  Thank you Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and who do you currently report 
to? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 30 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I currently report Ms B A Mofokeng 
and she – I started to report to her from 1 April 2017 to date. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Before I reported to Mr Buti Chuma 
who was Acting HOD from 22 August 2016 to 31 March 2017.  Before 
Mr Chuma it was Mr (indistinct) who was also acting as Head of the 
department from 1 April 2016 to 21 August 2016. 
Ms (indistinct) acted for a few days from 15 March 2016 to 
31 March 2016 and then before that – before the acting positions it was 
Mr Bailey Mahlakoleng who was he Head of the department from 2013 
10 
to March 2016. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So at the time of conclusion of the 
agreement between SA Express and your department.  Mr Magkuleng 
was the HOD. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is that correct? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  Mr Magkuleng was the 
HOD at the time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and on paragraph 6 you deal with what 
your position as CFO entails. 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Briefly place that on record. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Okay.  Chair as the CFO I – I 
oversee the general financial management of the department and this 
includes but not limited to supply chain management, budgets and 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 31 of 224 
 
expenditure management. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  The purpose of your evidence before 
the Commission is to enlighten us as to how the department ended up 
having this contract with South African Express.  In paragraphs – in 
paragraph 7 you talk about: 
“The intention of the department to revive the 
Mafikeng and Pilanesberg Airports.” 
How far were the plans of the department in as far as reviving 
these airports were concerned at the time? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  In the year 2014 Chair the 
10 
department had included reviving the airports as an activity or priority 
in their 2014/2015 annual performance plan but that was at a very early 
planning stage to the extent that at the time there was no budget 
allocation yet.  So on 26 August 2014 the North West Government led 
by the Department of Tourism was invited to Sun City. 
I was invite – the - the invitation was for – was to hear a 
presentation from six airlines that were invited. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry.  Who – who invited you?  Who was 
responsible for that meeting? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I was invited by the Office of the 
20 
HOD at the time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who called or arranged for this meeting 
that took place on 26 August 2014? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  What the Office of the HOD 
confirmed was that the Department of Tourism was the one that was – 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 32 of 224 
 
that had coordinated the meeting and had sent the invites to the 
department. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Proceed.  You said six airlines were 
invited … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Oh. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  To make presentations. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Okay.  Six – according to the 
information received at the meeting six airlines were invited to come 
and make presentations but only four of those airlines showed up and – 
and they made presentations. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Phatudi if I may ask was your 
department involved anyhow in the selection of the six airlines that 
were invited? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  No.  Our department was not 
involved in selecting the airlines. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do …? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I specifically was not involved in 
the selection of the airlines. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you have any knowledge on how they 
were selected? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I do not know how they were 
selected. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Then only four came.  Then what 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 33 of 224 
 
happened? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes.  Only four came and they 
made a presentation to the collective that was there.  The departments 
that were in that – in that presentation was the Department of 
Community, Safety and Transport Management, the Office of the 
Premier, the Department of Finance and the Department of Tourism.  
Those are the departments that were present in that presentation Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And following that presentation take us 
through the events that followed the presentation.  In paragraph 10 you 
speak about a memorandum that was addressed to Exco after this 
10 
presentation. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes.  After the presentation I am 
aware that the HOD prepared a – or the department prepared a 
memorandum summarising the proposals made by – by those service 
providers that or the potential service providers the airlines that were 
there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  When you say the department were 
you part – were you part of – of formulating this – this memorandum? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I was not part of formulating the 
memorandum. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Were you contacted? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Sorry ma’am. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Were you contacted for your …? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI: 
 
I 
became 
aware 
of 
the 
memorandum after it was finalised. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 34 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Proceed. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes.  The – the purpose of the 
memorandum was to make – was to make a presentation to the Exco 
which is the Executive Council of the Province to - to present the – the 
– to summarise what happened in the presentations that were held at 
Sun City. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what were they asking for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Or what were the recommendations? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Buthelezi. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the background leading to the conclusion of 
agreements that were concluded by the department and SA Express we 
do not need to get too much into it and much of it I assume will not be 
in dispute in terms of what the Provincial Department did.  So you can 
just lead her quickly in terms of that. 
Otherwise we need to get to how the agreement was 
concluded, whether she accepts that that is an agreement that was 
concluded between SA Express and – and them and then deal with how 
the circumstances - if she knows them - of how it came to be concluded 
20 
and then we move on. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Mofokeng do you 
confirm that on that – Phatudi – do you confirm that on that 
memorandum there was a recommendation that the two airports be 
revived and that SA Express be appointed as a supplier and that is on 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 35 of 224 
 
page 20 of the recommendation that was sent to Exco? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you know that that is what is in the 
memorandum.  You do not have to go to it. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  I confirm that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI: 
 
That 
is 
what 
was 
on 
the 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and do you also confirm that the 
10 
said 
memorandum 
was 
signed 
by 
the 
HOD 
at 
the 
time 
Mr Bailey Mahlakoleng and the MEC Mr Oageng Molapisi? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I confirm that Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  What I want to understand from you 
Ms Mofokeng is it … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Phatudi. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms – sorry – sorry.  Ms Phatudi is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is wrong with the evidence leaders this week? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I apologise Chair.  Ms Phatudi … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you – what I want to understand from 
you is that is it procedural for your department to seek approval from 
Exco before the appointment of service providers? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The process for appointment of 
service providers Chair would be that the department would advertise a 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 36 of 224 
 
bid if it was one of the priorities that were bade for that would be 
included … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Ms Phatudi I have been requested to 
ask you to bring the mic closer to you. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Oh, oh. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Thank you.  Sorry Chair.  The 
process – the correct process would be that the department would 
identify priorities or projects that they would advertise or – ja.  They 
would advertise or go out on tender for in a particular financial year.  
10 
Those will be included in the plans – in the procurement plans and that 
would be budgeted for. 
So what would happen is that the department would go out on 
tender, advertise and go through the normal departmental bid 
processes where the bid – the specifications would be presented to the 
Bid Specification Committee and for approval by the Head of 
Department but will also go through the Bid Adjudication Committee for 
recommendation and once the – the advert has been advertised and 
closed the bids would be evaluated and adjudicated and the HOD would 
approve. 
20 
So that is the – the summary of how the process of 
appointment should be.  The appointment is done and concluded by the 
Head of Department. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and in this particular instance you 
confirm that no supply chain management process was followed? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 37 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes.  This – this project was not 
advertised - did not go out on tender. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  As – as CFO what was your view on 
this in this instance? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  My view was that this needs to be 
advertised.  The department needed to go out on tender.  I advised the 
HOD to say especially because it is a new – it was a new environment 
to us.  As it was the first project of its kind.  We did not know what was 
on the market, what the market could offer generally including pricing 
and costing and all that. 
10 
So it would be – it was advisable for the department to go out 
on tender.  So that we could get the best – you know – the best … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Best bids. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Option that could be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Offered by the market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  So my advice was that we go out 
on tender but that advice was not taken.  The response was that the 
collective at the meeting of Sun City has – has recommended that the 
20 
process be taken up or – or a memorandum be prepared to Exco and 
this be presented to Exco for – for approval. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who formed part of that collective that 
made that decision? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   At the Sun City meeting as 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 38 of 224 
 
indicated earlier it was the Department of Tourism, Department of 
Community Safety and Transport, Treasury and the office of the 
Premier, I don’t remember, Chair, who represented the office of the 
Premier but for the other departments, the HOD’s and the MEC’s for all 
the departments were there and I also, together with the Chief Director 
responsible for Transport Operations were invited. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Yes so the decision to appoint SA 
Express was made by those four, the MEC’s and HOD’s from those four 
departments. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I would Chair…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:      I think she said recommendation. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes the recommendation to go to 
Exco with …(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    A proposal.   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   The proposal to appoint SA 
Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know the names of the – you said you didn’t 
know, I think, who represented the office of the Premier.     
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I don’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Ja but tell us the names of those who represented 
20 
the other departments at the time, if you know them. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   The office – the Department of 
Tourism was represented by the acting HOD at the time it was Mr 
Charles Ndabeni who represented the Tourism Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Mr Charles Ndabeni?  
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 39 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay. 
MS 
KUTLWANO 
INGRID 
PHATUDI: 
 
 
The 
Department

Community…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was his position in the Tourism Department if 
you remember, he was acting…(intervention).    
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   He was acting HOD at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Acting HOD? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And then the other deparment? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Department of Community Safety 
and Transport was represented by Mr Bailey Mahlakoleng.   
CHAIRPERSON:      Mr? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Bailey Mahlakoleng. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay do you want to spell the surname for the sake 
of the transcribers.   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Okay Mr Mahlakoleng is M-a-h-l-a-
k-o-l-e-n-g. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes and what was his position? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   The Head of Department. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:      Head of Department, of your department? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   And the Treasury – Department of 
Finance was represented by Mr Israel Guneni? he is the Head of 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 40 of 224 
 
Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay, no thank you, but you were part of that 
meeting. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I was in that meeting Chair but I 
must also state that I tried to get the minutes of the meeting, I couldn’t 
get the minutes because I don’t remember whether there was a meeting 
after the potential or the airliners presented where formally the 
decision was reached, so I wanted to refer to the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So is the position that, although you attended the 
presentations that were given by airlines, while you were there, no 
10 
decision to recommend anything was taken by a group of people that 
included the two HOD’s you’re talking about and the Acting HOD and 
yourself, you were not party to any such decision, (indistinct) 
recommendation.   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair I was not party to any – 
to that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:     You left after the presentation?  
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you left were there other people who came 
who represented different departments still there, did they remain?    
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I don’t know whether there was 
another meeting after this one but what I know is after the presentation 
we left and I was not part of the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So you – the other person, you say we left, the 
other person that you left with, I assume, was the acting HOD for your 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 41 of 224 
 
department or was the HOD…(intervention). 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   No I didn’t come with 
him…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:      You left on your own? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I left on my own, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And when you left the rest of the people were still 
there, who came from different departments or you don’t know? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Chair I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:      You just left after the presentation? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes, yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but subsequently you say you were told that 
they took a decision.     
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes subsequent to that, when I 
spoke to the HOD back home at the department to say…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:      The HOD of your department? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   The HOD of my department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   That my advice is that we go out 
on tender because this is a new project it’s a big project we have never 
had this type of project before, we don’t know what the market offers, 
20 
what’s available in the market, we go out on tender to advertise and 
then his response was that the collective – there’s a recommendation 
that SA Express be appointed and a memo to that effect was prepared 
for presentation at Exco.  
CHAIRPERSON:    How soon after the – that presentation did you have 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 42 of 224 
 
this conversation with the – with your Head of Department, a week, a 
day, 2 days, a month? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   It was within a short space of 
about maybe three days or a week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.     
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Ja it was a short space of time 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And he said to you that a decision to make a 
recommendation to Exco had been made by a collective by a certain 
collective. 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And The collective he was talking about which one 
did you understood -  who did you understand him to be talking about?  
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   He said the collective that was at 
the meeting of…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     The presentation?  
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes so I’m not sure who exactly, 
whether it was the HOD’s or both HOD’s and MEC’s that is why Chair, I 
said I tried to locate the minutes of that meeting so that I could have 
…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You could have something in writing.    
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja did you ask him for a copy of the minutes? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   He is no longer in the department 
so he…(intervention). 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 43 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I mean at that time after this conversation and you 
were looking for minutes.     
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh you only looked for minutes for purposes of this 
Commission?  
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes I tried to locate them for the 
purpose of the Commission yes Char. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so your conversation with him then ended on 
the basis that he was saying that a recommendation had been made 
that Exco should appoint or should decide to appoint that SA Express 
10 
should be appointed?   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And did you ever have another discussion about 
this issue with him in regard to the way forward or that was the end for 
that time? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I don’t remember having another 
conversation – meeting or conversation about this yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you, proceed Ms Buthelezi. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Thank you, Ms Phatudi was it at that 
stage when these memorandum was being prepared for the Exco when 
20 
you had this discussion with HOD? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair because at the time 
when he told me that department will be presenting that Exco memo. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay for the benefit of everyone when you 
refer to Exco, who is Exco?     
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 44 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Exco is the Provincial Executive 
Council which comprises of the Premier and the MEC’s.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Yes and then what is the role of Exco in 
the appointment of service providers? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Like I indicated, Chair before, I 
indicated that the service providers are – there’s a process of 
appointing service providers internally in the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes and does that ever include the Exco, in your 
experience? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   No Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     It hasn’t – before this happened it had never 
included the Exco as far as you know…(intervention).  
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   As far as I know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Included in the appointment of service providers.    
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      So this was an exception. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:    Yes it was an exception. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Did Exco, in fact, take that decision that 
SA Express should be appointed, was that decision made? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair, I later got a copy of an 
extract from the Exco resolutions which said Exco agreed with the 
recommendation of the department. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Yes we now know that…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Ms Buthelezi, just remind me where – on 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 45 of 224 
 
what page is that memo that you talk about? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   The memo, it’s Annexure KP1, it starts 
from page 12 up to page 21.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Under which divider? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Number 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this the memo that went to Exco and 
recommended that SA Express be appointed? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair this is the memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And it was signed by the Head of Department of the 
Department of Community Safety and Transport and the MEC for that 
10 
department, Mr - is it Garage Molapisi? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   It’s Gaoage Wageng Molapisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Oh Gaoage okay thank you I’m sorry about that.  
So – and did Exco approve the recommendation, did they accept the 
recommendation? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair there was an extract 
from the Exco…(intervention). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Chair, if I may be of assistance, if I 
could refer you, there are papers that we added to your bundle on page 
381 it’s right at the end – towards the end of the bundle, there’s and 
20 
extract of Exco minutes dated 3 December 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
you 
say 
yes, 
Exco 
did 
approve 
the 
recommendation – oh have you reached page 381? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair, the extract that I was 
referring to has at the bottom there – there’s a heading that says, 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 46 of 224 
 
“resolved that”, it says, 
 
“Exco agreed that the department should proceed with the 
 
chosen service provider and sign the contract (SA Express) 
 
and also that the submissions should serve again on December 
 
2014 with a proper analysis of presentation and options for 
 
considerations by Exco – for consideration by Exco”. 
CHAIRPERSON:    This is strange, Exco, according to this extract you 
say it’s an extract from the minutes of the North West Exco meeting of 
3 December 2014, under resolved that, a) says,  
 
 
“Exco agreed that the department should proceed with the 
10 
 
chosen service provider and sign the contract (SA Express)”. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And then b) says, 
 
“The submission should serve again on 15 December 2014 with 
 
a 
proper 
analysis 
of 
presentations 
and 
options 
for 
 
consideration by Exco”, 
 
Do you see what I see as strange there or is that – do you see 
that there is something strange with that? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON: You don’t see anything strange – do you see anything 
20 
strange in those two sentences of what they resolved?      
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   They – ja they resolved on the 
appointment, so. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Well the resolution on the appointment is one thing 
but I understand b) to be that although they had already resolved that 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 47 of 224 
 
the department should proceed with the chosen service provider and 
sign the contract, they were still going to receive an analysis of the 
presentation afterwards. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Is that your understanding as well? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes that’s how I understand it 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      That seems strange to me I would have thought 
that they would have wanted – assuming that they are the ones who 
must make the decision and assuming that the processes have been 
10 
followed or that there is justification for not following processes, I 
would have expected that they would first say, before we can make a 
decision whether the department should go ahead and sign an 
agreement with SA Express, we want to see an analysis of the 
presentations and then we’ll make our decision after that, but these 
minutes say the department must go ahead and sign the contract with 
SA Express and then the analysis or the presentations must come later, 
I find that strange, do you also find that strange or is there something 
I’m missing? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair I hear what you’re 
20 
saying Chair it would have been better or it would have made more 
sense if they received the presentation before deciding. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well maybe you’re putting it lighter, how do you 
start by making a decision and then afterwards say bring me the 
information that I need to make a decision that I’ve already made, this 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 48 of 224 
 
is more stranger to me because I’ve heard the past few days and 
maybe last week a few of instances where decisions are made without 
the necessary information, at least on the information – on the 
evidence that has been given by certain witnesses and I don’t know 
other witnesses might come and say it’s not true, we did have all of 
that information, but on the evidence given by certain witnesses, 
certain bodies just make decisions to have contracts concluded with 
certain service providers without enough information, and then they say 
the information will come later, so that’s – I just see what may appear 
to be a pattern here, ja okay please continue. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      Thank you Chair.  Ms Phatudi in your 
affidavit at paragraph 14 you do make a comment that the appointment 
of SA Express was not in line with the provisions of Section 217 of the 
Constitution, when did you make this realisation? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Chair this refers to the fact that 
this bid or this project was not advertised, so I know for a fact that it 
was not advertised because immediately after – or what followed after 
the meeting at Sun City was that Exco memo which I’ve already spoken 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you would have known if the procurement 
20 
processes were followed? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I would have known Chair because 
as the CFO I’m also Chairperson of the Bid Adjudication Committee so I 
would have known because the specifications would have been 
presented to the Bid Adjudication Committee and all those (indistinct) 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 49 of 224 
 
processes would have…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes and you had advised that processes should be 
followed but your advice was not accepted by the HOD of your 
department. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes I did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes are there any circumstances which existed 
which justified not following procurement processes as far as you are 
concerned? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I don’t know of any Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      You don’t know of any as far as you are concerned 
10 
there was no justification for not following processes? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   There might have been Chair but 
I’m not aware of them…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:      Ja I’m saying according to – as far as you know. 
MS 
KUTLWANO 
INGRID 
PHATUDI: 
 
 
As 
far 
as 
I 
know 
Chair…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you understand the normal exceptions to be 
where those processes would not be followed, your own understanding?    
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Chair prescripts do allow for 
deviations but it would be in exceptional specific cases, for example, in 
20 
emergency appointments or in urgent – or where there’s sole service 
providers but then an approval would have been sought before 
concluding …(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes well I guess even with a deviation if you ask 
for it, you apply for it and it’s granted it is a process itself. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 50 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   It is a process in itself Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     You can’t just not do anything and say that it’s 
justification you’ve go to follow   deviation process.  
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:      So is there any – are there any circumstances as 
far as you know where a department can simply not follow any process, 
either a deviation process or the normal procurement processes? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      You don’t know of any such? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and you have been CFO in the department since 
2013?   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      2013, during your time you have never had such a 
situation have you, where you come across a situation where it is said 
that there is justification not even to apply for deviation? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   No Chair I have never come 
across that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you don’t follow normal procurement processes 
you’re obliged to apply for deviation. 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:      You can’t not follow those processes and not apply 
for deviation. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 51 of 224

eventually SA Express was appointed and there is an agreement that is

MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:      No that’s fine. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:     Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:      Now Ms Phatudi this agreement, well it starts at 
page 23 is – ja it starts at page 23, when did you become aware of the 
agreement for the first time, after it had been signed? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Chair I became aware of the 
agreement 
after 
it 
had 
been 
a 
signed 
when 
there 
was 
a 
claim…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:      And that would have been 2015?

10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but how do you know that Mr van Wyk

CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have any personal knowledge as to who 
represented the department first at negotiation meetings before the 
conclusion of this agreement, do you have any knowledge of who 
represented the – your department in negotiations that resulted in this 
agreement? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   It was the HOD, the head of 
department. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The HOD? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and how do you know that? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Because he signed the agreement 
eventually and legal services also confirmed that he’s the one who 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 54 of 224 
 
gave 
instructions 
for 
them 
to 
draft 
the 
service 
level 
agreement…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you never attended any meetings, if there 
were meetings? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   For the drafting of the – no there 
were no – I was not part of…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say you’re aware that this agreement was 
drafted by your legal department? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then it was presented to SA Express or you 
10 
don’t know, you just knew when it was signed? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   I don’t know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but it was drafted by the legal department? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:    Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:    Yes, you say you became aware of this 
agreement when a claim was submitted, who had submitted this claim? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   The – maybe I must talk Chair to 
the process of…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes that’s fine, do so. 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes the end user which is the 
programme or the programme manager for a particular project or 
programme would receive an invoice and then prepare a requisition for 
payment and approve – the Chief Director would approve or the 
Director in this instance it was approved by the Chief Director and then 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 55 of 224 
 
sent to the head of department for the final approval.  So when the 
claim has been approved the SLA would be attached and also there 
would be checklists and just for each and every stage of the process to 
confirm compliance to certain things or areas.  So that process 
happened and the payment came to finance for verification for 
compliance check and then I noticed that it was actually two invoices 
that were presented, the one for SA Express and the other one was for 
the management company. 
CHAIRPERSON:      What was the management company’s name? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   It was Koreneka. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes so there were two invoices. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And what were the amounts if you are able to say, 
even if it’s not the exact amount? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Koreneka was around 20million. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   And the SA Express was around 
51million 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay and these two invoices came at the same 
time – more or less at the same time? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Ja more or less at the same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright.   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   And then I raised – I refused to 
process the management company invoice Chair raising concerns – 
raising an issue that on clause 6.1 of the agreement which is on 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 56 of 224 
 
page…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:      Clause 6.1? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   6.1 which is on page 31, the claus 
says, 
 
“The department shall pay to SA Express annually in advance 
 
the amounts stipulated in Annexure A which amount is subject 
 
to review at the end of each year by agreement between the 
 
parties”, 
 
So this does not talk about a management company, it talks 
about SA Express. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   That is why I said, I cannot 
…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    You said, I can’t pay – what is the basis for us 
paying Koreneka?   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Koreneka. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.    
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   And also it was not only this 
clause, Chair, there’s another clause 15.1. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:      It’s on page 44. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:      It’s Kwaraneng? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Koreneka, K-O-R-E-N-K-A. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Ja I saw it earlier I seem to get it wrong we’ve 
been dealing with it the past two or three days, okay alright, maybe it’s 
this break from yesterday 11 o’clock to now, yes. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 57 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:     And the other clause you referred to is 
that clause 15.1 on page 44?  
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:   Yes Chair which says, 
 
“SA Express shall, in consultation with the department appoint 
 
a management company responsible for managing certain 
 
facilities at Pilansberg and Mafikeng Airport”, 
 
So I raised an issue I said, I need to know how this was 
complied with, meaning how was the management company appointed, 
who represented the department, how was this consultation – how did it 
happen and obviously that did not happen, because there was no proof 
10 
that the department was involved in the appointment of a management 
company.  So on that basis, I said, I am not going to pay the 
management company. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:    Yes and then what happened from 
there…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:      I’m sorry I think it’s time we should take the lunch 
break, we are going to take the lunch break it’s about 29 minutes to two 
now, we will resume at half past two, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s proceed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Phatudi, you were testifying about the 
two invoices that you received, one from Koreneka and one from SAX 
and the fact that you refused to pay the invoice that was from Koreneka 
raised on section 6.1 and 15.1 of the service level agreement that you 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 58 of 224 
 
had with them at the time. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Would you please take us through to what 
happened thereafter? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Thank you Chair.  What happened 
thereafter Chair is that I as indicated raised those issues on specific 
clauses that have already been mentioned and then subsequent to that 
Chair I later received a revised SLA where those two specific areas 
were amended. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The same section 6.1 and 6.4? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is that the SLA that is attached under tab 
four ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I think I missed something.  Did you say 
where certain clauses were amended? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair, the clauses that were amended 
is clause 6.1  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  As well as clause 15.1 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it the clauses to which you referred us earlier? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were amended later. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay and when in relation to your refusal to 
approve payment for Korenenka?  Was it after before? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 59 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  It was amended before payment was 
processed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But after you had expressed your refusal. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair, after I had raised concern and 
refusal to process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, tell us about that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  The amended clauses 6.1 appears on 
page 77 under tab three Chair.  Would you please read it out? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The clause reads thus Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Buthelezi, please wait for me. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I will do so, I’m sorry.  Page 77. 
CHAIRPERSON:  77? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, I’m there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Please proceed. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Okay the amended clause now reads:  The 
Department shall pay SA Express the subsidy and the management 
company the operational cost for both airports annually in advance the 
amount stipulated in annexure A. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the amended clause 15.1 appears 
20 
on page 89.  Would you please go there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let’s see annexure A first before we go there.  I 
want to see annexure A that is referred to in 6.1, in the amended 6.1. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that going to take time? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 60 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Annexure A appears on page 104 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  104? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It’s the same annexure A that was referred 
to yesterday by Mr Phiri. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, nothing changed? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Nothing changed on those figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me go there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The only thing that changed was that it was 
10 
now allowing the Department to make a direct payment to the 
management company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to see it before we move to the other 
clause.  Okay, then let’s go to the other clause. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  The clause 15.1 is on page 89 Ms 
Phatudi.  Please read out to the Chair what did it say after the 
amendment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  81 you said? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  89. 
CHAIRPERSON:  89, okay.  Yes. 
20 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Chair, 15.1 reads as follows:  The 
Department mandates SA Express to appoint a management company 
responsible for managing the operations at Pilanesberg and Mafikeng 
airports. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So now the Department was no longer 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 61 of 224 
 
involved or to be consulted when the management companies were to 
be appointed? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is very concerning.  You receive payment or you 
receive an invoice 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  for you to pay you said about 20 million rand to 
Korenenka. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And everyone before you had said everything is okay 
10 
and ticked on compliance every stage? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When it comes to you, you pick up that there’s a 
problem? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at least part of the problem is that it’s supposed 
to be paid person to an agreement that says nothing about the 
Department paying Koreneka anything. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You refused to pay. 
20 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the agreement is then amended. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now before amendment the agreement was saying the 
appointment of a management company must be made jointly between 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 62 of 224 
 
the Department and SA Express. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that clause is amended to say to give the power 
only to SA Express to make the appointment alone. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the management company? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then in regard to paying Koreneka the 
amendment says the Department can pay operational, make payments 
regarding operational cost to both SA Express and Koreneka. 
10 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The management company, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what I find strange is that that’s why I wanted to 
have a look at the annexure A.  It doesn’t say what portion of the 
operational cost should go to which company does it?  Now if the 
operational cost were to be paid to one company and it says those cost 
are in annexure A, that’s fine.  But now it says the operational cost 
must be paid to the two companies but it doesn’t say maybe 50 50 or 
what how it must be divided or does it? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  It’s already divided Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is it? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  On the same annexure A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The second or the bottom part of the 
annexure, there’s a heading that says management company subsidy.  
And then ... (intervenes) 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 63 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 104 by the way the annexure? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair, it’s 104. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  There’s a bottom part of the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  There’s a heading that says management 
company subsidy and then it splits Pilanesberg and Mafikeng for both 
road subsidy and operational cost. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where does it say how much should go to SA 
Express, how much should go to the management company?   
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The management company is the bottom 
part of the table and then at the top there it says concession airline 
subsidy, that is the SA Express and it’s also split between Pilanesberg 
and Mafikeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before is understand that this annexure A is how 
it looked even before amendment, is that? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and all of that money was to be paid to SA 
20 
Express, isn’t it?  Before amendment? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes before amendment because on the SLA 
there was no mention of paying ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  The management company. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The management company. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 64 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so all of that money was meant to go to? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  SA Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SA Express before amendment. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And then they now amended the agreement to say the 
monies reflected in annexure A should be paid to SA Express and the 
management company. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you take it that what it means is that 
what comes under management company in that annexure should be 
10 
paid to the management company and what is above that should go to 
SA Express. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it doesn’t say that itself. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  It says airline subsidy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The top part says airline subsidy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that say it must be paid to the airline.  You think 
20 
so? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair, I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How was it going to be paid before amendment? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The annexure didn’t change, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that is the problem isn’t it? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 65 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, Ms Phatudi ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Isn’t that the problem that before the amendment you 
have an annexure of various operational cost. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some relate to the airline subsidy, some relate to the 
operational cost maybe of the management company.  But before the 
amendment the agreement contemplated that all those payments should 
go to SA Express if I understand correctly, I may be missing something.  
Is that not your understanding?  Before the amendment, who was going 
to be paid these amounts in annexure A by the Department or you can’t 
10 
remember?  
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Chair my ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or am I confusing you? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me allow Ms Buthelezi to proceed.  Maybe 
I will understand something as we go along.  Let’s continue. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Ms Phatudi, if you look at page 104, 
there are various amounts that are listed for each year up to year five, 
they are divided into five columns.  Can you see that? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes ma’am. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  On the first line on year one there is 
23 million I think 800 and something thousand that should be paid as 
airline subsidy.  Is that money that should go to SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the 11 million ... (intervenes) 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 66 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what basis are you saying that miss, are you 
putting that question to her Ms Buthelezi? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Let me clarify, sorry Chair.  And if you look 
under the same column ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I’ll tell you what we’ll do to make progress. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just leave that part as it is. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the basis that probably whoever was to pay would 
look at management company subsidy and say well, it seem to make 
10 
sense that is what should go to them. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is above should go to the airline even if it’s 
not clear from the ... (intervenes) 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  From annexure A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not stated in the agreement which part will go to 
which entity.  So let’s proceed.  I think what is important is that one, 
there was a change that the Department should no longer be involved 
in the appointment of the management company. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And two that the operational cost could be paid to- 
had to be paid both in the end in what amounts is not really of 
significance. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what’s important is the context in which the 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 67 of 224 
 
amendment was made. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And Ms Phatudi, if I look at paragraph 
20 of your statement is that these two invoices that you referred us to, 
you received them in December 2015? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Its common cause that the initial 
agreement was signed in March 2015 and in terms of the contract you 
were expected to make pre-payment.  Do you agree with that? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair, yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  On paragraph 18 of your statement you say 
that the Department received an invoice of 50 million.  At the time the 
Department did not have a budget to pay SA Express invoice.  Mr 
Mahlakoleng wrote a letter to the acting Director General at Premier 
office on the 16 t h of March 2015 requesting the payment of- I believe 
that 51 million should be 50 million now. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Of 50 million to be paid out.  And you 
attached the invoice that we handed out earlier that was paid following 
20 
that invoice.  If I look at that date ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let her give evidence. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay, sorry Chair.  Yes, if I look at the 
dates that you listed on that paragraph, it’s the 16 t h of March 2015 the 
agreement is signed on the 31 s t. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 68 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s do it this way.  When you received the 
invoice where was the budget for the payment of that amount? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Chair, the invoice was received in March 
2015 which was concluding the financial year 2014/15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  At that stage the Department did not have a 
budget for this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  So we couldn’t process the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what happened then after the invoice? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  What happened thereafter the HOD 
prepared a letter to ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  The HOD prepared a letter. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  To the Office of the Premier requesting the 
Office of the Premier to pay on behalf of Community Safety. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Buthelezi, you want to direct us to that 
letter? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, is it the letter that is on page 65 under 
20 
tab three, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you confirm that, Ms Phatudi? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, then from there what happened? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 69 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  From there what happened the invoice was 
submitted to the Office of the Premier and it was paid on the ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry.  So the letter that you say Mr Mahlakoleng 
Head of your Department sent to the Office of the Premier is simply a 
covering letter touching the invoices.  Tell us how it reads that letter. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The letter is addressed to the acting 
Director General Office of the Premier (inaudible):  Dear Prof Mokgoro 
attached please SA Express documents for your urgent attention and 
processing of payment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then what happened after that letter had 
been sent? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  After the letter was submitted to the Office 
of the Premier and then we have proof of payment.  According to the 
proof of payment the cheque date or the actual payment date was the 
26 t h March 2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, and is that the date that appears on 
the second page of this proof of payment? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It’s the page that I marked as 66A. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It’s the page marked 66A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 70 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what was the amount that was paid 
from the Office of the Premier? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  The amount is 50 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I don’t have a page marked 66A.  I’ve got 
66 only and then 67. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair, there is ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the new one you handed out? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, it’s a document I handed I handed out 
earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you haven’t arranged for it to be put in here.  
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I apologize. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And what informed you that this 
payment was made from the Office of the Premier? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  If you look at the first page, there are 
headings there.  The heading ... (intervenes) 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Supplier code, Supplier name. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Ja, supplier code, supplier name, invoice 
number. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.    
20 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Invoice line, create date, authorisation 
date, where it says DEPT its short for Department. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.    
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  And underneath there it says 01.  That is 
the vote number for the Office of the Premier. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 71 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  01 is the vote number for the Office of the 
Premier. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Ms Phatudi, what I want to understand 
is that on the 16 t h of March when this letter was written to the Office of 
the Premier it was before this agreement with SA Express was 
concluded.  How do you explain that? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Chair, I do not know how the invoice came 
before the contract was concluded. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you know if the Office of the Premier 
10 
had ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remind yourself the date of the agreement and 
the date of the invoice. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The agreement appears from page 23 Chair, 
it is signed on page 57, the date on page 57 it’s 31 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The date of the letter requesting payment 
from the Office of the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s start with the date of the invoice, do we have 
that? 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  No, we don’t have the invoice itself.  We 
have the letter requesting payment from the Office of the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And that letter is dated 16 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 72 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And we then- that letter appears under tab 
three on page 65. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one we’ve just talked about, yeah. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The one that we’ve just looked at, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then we have the proof of payment 
which Ms Phatudi says 01 indicates that that payment came from 
Premier office.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It’s a payment of 50 million rand.  It’s the 
10 
amount on page 2, 50 million rand that you referring to? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair, the amount is 50 million rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the amount that was reflected on the invoice.  
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was the invoice from SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And if you look at the page that 
follows the amount Chair, there is payee number then under surname 
and initial there is SA Express.  And looking at ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry.  I’m trying to look.  Are you looking at 66A 
20 
or 65? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  66B now, there is SA Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now is 66B the old 66? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I don’t think I’ve got 66B. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 73 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The new 66 it has 66 A and B, it should 
have three pages Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, now I see. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, under surname. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  There is ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is surname, SA Express.  Surname SA Express, 
payee number say triple or is it 0003647. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Chair, if you go back to 66A there is a 
date that appears, it’s on the third line from the top or the second line 
that is written in bold ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 26 March 2015. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes, the date of the 26 March 2015.  My 
question to Ms Phatudi is that they’re agreement was only concluded on 
the 31 s t.  Why was SA Express paid before the conclusion of this of the 
agreement? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Chair, I do not have the answer for that.  I 
don’t know why was it paid before the time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Were you involved in any manner in 
processing this payment? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  No, the payment was processed in another 
department. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 74 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it processed in the Premier Office? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, would you know what it is that they would have 
had before them before they processed the payment in the Premier 
Office apart from the letter from your MEC- was it you HOD? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your HOD?  Ja, apart from the letter and the invoices 
do you know what else they might have had before them? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  No, I do not know Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because according to that letter, is it only the 
invoices that your Head of Department sent to Professor Mokgoro in 
terms of what he said in the letter?  Did he refer to invoices only as 
what he was annexing? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  I’m not sure, Chair.  I’m not sure what 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s go there, I think its page? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  65. 
CHAIRPERSON:  65. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  65. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Attached please find- oh attached please SA Express 
documents for your urgent attention and processing of payment.  So he 
says what he was attaching was SA Express documents. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know what documents he attached, your 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 75 of 224 
 
Head of Department? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  I’m not sure Chair what was attached, I 
didn’t see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What are the chances that the Office of the 
Premier could have been finished documents that your department did 
not have.  In other words, what are the chances that SA Express may 
have sent documents to the Premier Office which explained what this 
50 million rand invoice all about but you might not have been aware?  
Are there what are the chances that that might have happened?  You 
don’t know? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  I don’t know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I mean 50 million rand is not a small 
amount. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would have thought that before that anybody 
approved that such an amount be paid in a government department, 
they would want to know that it is an amount that is due and that it 
would be proper to pay it.  And that would have required checking a 
various documents, I would imagine. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you’d expect as well? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just like because you picked up that you shouldn’t 
pay Koreneka because you went and looked for establishing what the 
basis would be to pay them. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 76 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you looked at the agreement and you realised 
that the agreement did not make any provision for paying Koreneka. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I would have thought that somebody else, 
somebody in the Premier Office would also have wanted to would have 
called for various documents before they did but you say you don’t 
know whether they did or they didn’t. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  And you do you agree that at 
the time before the signing of this agreement your department did not 
have any obligation to pay SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Before the signing of the contract? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Let’s move on to the payment to 
Koreneka that was to be made in 2016, you deal with it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the witness must say more than just that.  Why 
do you say in the absence of an agreement of the agreement that was 
20 
signed late in the absence of that agreement there would have been 
basis for your department to pay SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Chair, the SLA according to me is a 
document that contracts which will confirm or direct that certain 
financial obligations between the two parties should happen.  So in the 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 77 of 224 
 
absence of such a document then it means there is nothing that binds, 
that is binding for a payment to be made.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So as a basis for paying any service provider would 
there have to be a written agreement all the time or most of the time? 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  All the time there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the time there must be a written document that 
shows what was agreed, should be done. 
MS KUTLWANO PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And as far as you know before the payment of 
that amount no document existed which showed any agreement 
10 
between your department and SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I would – I would say yes Chair 
because the signed agreement was signed on 30 March. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  31 March. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  31 March. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  And the letter is dated the 16 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please make sure that whilst the witness is 
giving evidence nobody can just walk to her and five her documents.  
20 
Okay, alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  On paragraph 36 of your 
statement – it is on page 8. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  36? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  You - you deal with the invoice that 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 78 of 224 
 
you received from Koreneka on 7 December 2015? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Would you please take us through 
what happened upon receipt of this – of this invoice? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI: 
 
On 
7 December 2015 
when 
I 
received the – when the – ja - when the invoice for Koreneka was 
submitted. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI: 
 
The 
SLA 
had 
already 
been 
amended. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  SLA being Service Level Agreement? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Service – yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the agreement we have been talking about? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Can we go back a little bit?  Would the position 
be that since this R50 million was paid through the department of – the 
Office of the Premier … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have no further dealings or questions to 
raise because it was no longer through your department? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes sir.  It was just this specific 
one because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I am talking about that one. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 79 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes, yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So in other words you – you would – you would 
not – it would not be your responsibility to pursue the matter to say but 
how did that amount get paid when there is no agreement … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is another department … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which would have its own CFO … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Processes yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Its own processes? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Tell us what happened upon 
receiving this invoice on 7 December 2015. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Chair upon receiving of this invoice 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You may already have this in your plan 
but it will be important that we establish who in the Office of the 
Premier authorised the payment … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will do so Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did they have in front of them … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To justify in making that decision.  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI: 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
Yes 
please 
proceed 
Ms Phatudi. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 80 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  On 7 December an 
invoice for Koreneka was received for an amount of 20.6 million.  The 
Program Manager that is the Chief Director responsible for Transport 
Operations in the department prepared a payment control form – 
payment requisition form … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  For – to request payment for this 
invoice and that was approved by the Head of Department but at the 
time because it was a new financial year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It was 2015/2016 financial year.  
The department had a - a budget for that and the SLA was signed.  So 
the - the payment was processed based on those documents. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And that amount was paid? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then in 2016 you received another 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that – I am sorry.  So Koreneka’s invoice had 
arrived in March together with the one for SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  The – yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But because of the fact that you had refused to pay.  
It was not paid until after the amendment to the agreement? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it was paid in December 2015? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 81 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Now when that one was paid did it come 
back to you?  The process for its payment did it come back to you?  Did 
somebody come and say okay now here is an amended agreement you 
can now pay.  You have no – you have no grounds to refuse. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  There was a revised 
SLA attached and I felt I did not have any further grounds to refuse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So you were then compelled to make that 
payment in December 2015? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is that the invoice that is attached under 
Tab 5? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  On page 1-13? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask her whether she was compelled?  What 
was your question to her? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I am asking if she – was she then 
compelled or maybe I should rephrase Chair.  You then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  She said she had no grounds to refuse. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You were not compelled – were you?  You paid. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I paid Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not compelled?  You look you – you are not 
sure whether to say you were compelled or not compelled.  I am – she 
asked you whether you were compelled to pay and you said yes … 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 82 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that – that surprised me because I did not expect 
you to say you were compelled.  So I am now wanting to find out 
whether you meant to say you were compelled or you did not think that 
answer through? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Chair, I – I paid on the basis of the 
fact that the SLA was there and the program and the HOD had 
approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you compelled then to pay or not? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  (No audible reply). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You paid of your own volition because you saw 
nothing wrong with the invoice now.  Is it not? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No I just want to know what the position is.  I 
am – I am not putting you in a corner.  I just want to know because if 
you say you are – you were compelled then we need to know who 
compelled you and why and so on but if you say no I was not compelled 
I was satisfied that this was now a payment that could be made and I 
made it. 
Then we must know you were not compelled.  That is why I 
20 
am asking you.  You understand? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So the – the last position is that you – 
you were not compelled?  You paid because you saw nothing wrong 
with it? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 83 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and on paragraph 37 you deal with the 
invoice that you received from Koreneka in 2016.  Just tell us what 
happened following receiving this invoice in 2015? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  2016 – I am sorry. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Okay.  Chair the next invoice that 
was received from Koreneka amounting to 15.8 million was received as 
indicated and … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What paragraph of the statement 
Ms Buthelezi? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is paragraph 37 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3-7? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  Before – the invoice 
was not paid because the department received – was served with a 
letter from the attorneys representing Ms J C Phiri. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who was this J C Phiri? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Ms J C Phiri according to the letter 
received was a partner or – ja – a partner to – in Koreneka. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what happened to this invoice?  Was it 
paid? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  This invoice was not paid.  It was 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 84 of 224 
 
referred to – the department was instructed to withhold payment until 
the matter had been resolved between the parties.  So to date it has 
not been paid. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The letter – what was it informing the 
department? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean to date.  You mean up to today it still … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has not been paid? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair even … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  To date yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Is it the letter that is appearing under 
Tab 6 on page 1-14 – 1-15? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  That is the letter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is it the letter that was informing you of the 
pending legal litigation between the two parties? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  That is the letter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay, thank you and on page 30 – on 
paragraph 38 - the same page – you deal with Valoteck payment.  Who 
was Valoteck? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Chair on – sometime in June I 
received an email – an invoice by email from David Kalisilira which was 
an – an invoice for Valoteck.  I at that stage did not know who Valoteck 
was.  So I then forwarded that invoice by email to the Program 
Transport Regulations.  By program I mean the end user … 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 85 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  And I specifically asked them who 
was Valoteck was and whether we have a new appointed company.  I 
later got a response by email on the same day … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  From Mr (indistinct) who was the 
Airport Manager at the time … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what did it inform you? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  He informed me that he spoke to 
Mr Brian van Wyk on that day and he says he – he said in the email 
10 
that he raised those concerns.  Mr van Wyk advised that indeed there is 
a new management company … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  And paperwork to that effect will be 
presented to the department and he said before the end of business on 
that day.  I then later – I do not – I do not recall after how long whether 
it was two days or how many days after that I got a letter – a copy of a 
letter from the Office of the HOD. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is it the letter that appears under Tab 7 – 
page 129? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The invoice that you are talking about now is it one 
you mentioned in paragraph 38 from Valoteck - Valoteck? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  15 850 … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair that (intervenes). 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 86 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the amendment that you told us about? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair that is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That amount seems to be the same as the amount in 
paragraph 37 that you said has not been paid up to now? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was just – was that just a coincidence?  It is exactly 
the same. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It is the equal amount.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they sent – well the one invoice for 15 850 million 
10 
came from Koreneka and another one for the same amount came from 
Valoteck? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Maybe if I may.  If you may clarify what was 
the Koreneka invoice meant for?  For what period was it meant for? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The Koreneka invoice was for the 
2016/2017 financial year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  For how long?  Was it for the whole year – 
for …? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  For the year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And Koreneka was servicing which airport? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the agreement involving Koreneka not one for 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 87 of 224 
 
both or was there – were there separate agreements?  I cannot 
remember now. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It is separate agreements Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh separate agreements? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Koreneka was to be involved in both airports – 
Pilanesberg and Mafikeng? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I do not remember for which 
airport. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Considering the evidence of Mr Phiri 
Koreneka was servicing both Mafikeng and Pilanesberg when this 
project started.  Let us go to the letter that you received from 
Mr van Wyk.  It appears on page 129 of the bundle under Tab 7. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that you said that the invoice relating to 
Koreneka for 15 850 million was for the 2015/2016 financial year.  Is 
that right or was it just for 2016?  Was it countered according to 
financial year or just the calendar year? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It – it is supposed to be counted 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 88 of 224 
 
for financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Financial year. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say it was for 2015/2016 financial year for 
Koreneka? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  2016 … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  2016/2017. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  2016/2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016/2017? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the one for Valoteck was it for the same financial 
year or not? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It was for the same financial year 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would it have been for the same services – do 
you know? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I will need to confirm but I – I will 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will need to confirm? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Ja.

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I think it would be for different 
airports.  I need … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I need to confirm.

CHAIRPERSON:  Same services in different airports? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Different airports yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  If you can go to a letter on page 129 
is that the letter that you are referring – you were referring to? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  The letter that I was 
referring to was the letter that confirmed to the department that – or 
that notified the department that Valoteck Facilities Management was 
appointed for – ja – for Mafikeng International Airport. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the invoice that you – you were 
referring to is it the invoice that is on page 128?  Just go backwards 
one page. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  (Intervenes). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  There is an invoice from Valoteck for 
R15 850 million. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And this amount – 15 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The invoice is the one immediately after 
the letter? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Before. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Just before the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  On page 1-2-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 90 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  This amount of 15 850 was it for the 
whole year or does it cover part of the year?  Do you know? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The – the amount of 15 … 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  15 850. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It is for the entire – it is supposed 
to be for the entire financial year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  If then Valoteck submitted this invoice 
in June 2016 you had already gotten an invoice from Koreneka for the 
same amount.  What informed – or maybe I should first ask – was this 
10 
invoice paid? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The one for …? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The one for Valoteck. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes the one for Valoteck was paid. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  What then informed your decision to 
pay this invoice because you already received another invoice from 
Koreneka that was still pending? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI: 
 
Chair 
the 
– 
the 
program 
responsible for the function confirmed that the Valoteck payment was 
for Mafikeng Airport and there was – I do not have the letter in the file 
20 
here but there was communication to say Koreneka was now 
responsible for – for Pilanesberg.  So this payment was for Mafikeng 
Airport and the claim for Koreneka then would be for Pilanesberg. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  So the 15 850 charged by Koreneka 
is for Pilanesberg and this was for Mafikeng? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 91 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that the letter from SA Express which is dated 
June 2016 without giving the actual date says to the Head of your 
department that they were notifying the department of the appointment 
of Valoteck Facilities Management as the handling company for 
Mafikeng International Airport and then it says: 
“SA Express has sent through the signed contract to 
the department.” 
One, do we know when – I see there is a stamped – date 
10 
stamp there in terms of payment but I cannot read its – its – one cannot 
see the date.  At this stage – at the stage of the payment of this 
amount of R15 850 million to Valoteck was there already a – a contract 
between Valoteck and the department? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Chair the department did not have 
a contract with the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Valoteck. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Managing companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it had given that power to SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes.  They were appointed by SA 
20 
Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time of payment had – was there – had the 
department being notified officially that there was a new company that 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 92 of 224 
 
SA Express had appointed? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  It is the letter that we 
have just talked about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when – when payment was made this letter had 
already arrived? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So – so we – we can take it that that letter 
although not dated was received prior to … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to 7 July 2016 which seems to be when payment 
10 
was made.  Is that right? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and on paragraph 39 you were 
dealing with that – that was appointing – informing you of the 
appointment of Valoteck? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Let us go to paragraph 40. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Phatudi.  On paragraph 40 you deal with 
20 
MAMCO.  Please tell us who was MAMCO? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  My apologies Chair.  I am looking 
for the letter - they do not assist me - to respond to the question who is 
MAMCO.  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  If I may assist.  Look at page 1-35. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 93 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  1-35 yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Under Tab 9. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is a letter from SA Express directed to 
Mr Chuma. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair the department later 
received a letter dated 29 March 2017 where – where it – from SA 
Express.  Informing the HOD that SA Express has appointed a company 
- Mafikeng Airport Management Company MAMCO –as the company that 
will be doing ground handling services at Mafikeng Airport. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who – who – from who this letter was 
from? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  At SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The letter was from SA Express 
and it was signed but it signed by the Chief Executive Officer 
Inati Ntshanga. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay and on paragraph 41 you deal with 
the payment of 15 8 million that was made to PAMCO. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  And then PAMCO is a management 
20 
company which was appointed around – yes – around the same time.  
Maybe there was two months or a month apart … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  From the MAMCO appointment. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Let us first deal with the payment that 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 94 of 224 
 
was made to MAMCO for R15.8 million at KP10.  For which year was 
this payment made for?  The payment pack appears under Tab 10 on 
page 137. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Payment pack. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The – the amount paid for MAMCO 
was for the 2017/2018 financial year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And it was for which airport? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  It was Mafikeng Airport. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  Then on the next paragraph you deal 
10 
with PAMCO – the company that you said was appointed around the 
same time.  Who – how were you informed of the appointment of this 
company? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The – the Chief Executive Officer – 
Mr Inati Ntshanga – wrote a letter to the HOD for the Department of 
Community, Safety and Transport.  At the time it was Acting Buti Chuma 
and informing him that SA Express has appointed a management 
company effective from 16 April 2017. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is that the letter that appears under Tab 11 
on page 149? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair that is the one. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And for which airport was this company 
appointed for … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  According to that letter? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 95 of 224 
 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  According to this letter it was for 
Pilanesberg Airport. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and it appears that you received an 
invoice for this company as well and the payment pack is attached as 
KP12. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And when was this invoice received? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The invoice was – the invoice was 
dated 22 May. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the payment – when it was 
10 
released?  It is on the same paragraph 43 Ms Phatudi. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Sorry Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The date is on paragraph 43.  The date 
when you received the payment. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Oh it was 28 June – the release – 
the release date of the payment. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the letter on page 149 states that 
this - this company was appointed for Pilanesberg. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But if you go to page 161 on that payment 
20 
pack for MAMCO the contract attached – for PAMCO sorry – it says – 
on page 161 if you look under the third line there – there is a line there 
that says – that deals with location. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It says for location North West Province 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 96 of 224 
 
Airport Operations and then is says Mafikeng. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Ja.  Chair, I – I do not know 
whether this is a mistake or what but what I know is that PAMCO is 
servicing Pilanesberg Airport. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So that Mafikeng contract was supposed to 
Pilanesberg not Mafikeng? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes ma’am – yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So PAMCO was servicing … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Pilanesberg. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Pilanesberg? 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is now as a matter of fact? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and those are all companies or 
management companies that you paid for the duration of this contract.  
Is it? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Earlier on in your evidence you 
20 
testified that when I asked you who was negotiating the Service Level 
Agreement for SA Express your answer … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  (Intervenes). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Was – it was Mr van Wyk. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Oh.  Chair that was a mistake.  I 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 97 of 224 
 
though the question was who was the – the contact or who was 
representing SA Express in meetings not necessarily on the SLA.  As a 
point of correction the SAL was signed on behalf of the SA Express by 
the CEO. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Inati … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ntshanga. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Mr Ntshanga. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Which meetings did Mr van Wyk represent 
10 
SA Express? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Firstly at the Sun City Meeting – he 
is the one who was making a presentation on behalf of SA Express. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Ms Phatudi considering the figures 
that we agreed to and that were paid to various management companies 
and the evidence of Mr Phiri – you were here at the hearing yesterday.  
That these figures were inflated or they were higher than the – the 
gazetted figures for – for similar services.  What is your – your view or 
your opinion on the – on that issue? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Chair as indicated when I was 
20 
talking to the advice on were going out on tender that as a department 
at the time we did not have – we had not had any contract - aviation 
contract before.  So this was the first contract and we did not know 
what is on the market, what were the going rates and the presentation 
that was made by Mr Phiri yesterday it was for the first time that I 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 98 of 224 
 
heard about the rates that are on the market. 
So yes as compared to what he was presenting these 
amounts are huge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And you – are you saying that as the 
department you were not aware of the amounts that ought to be 
charged for such services? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I was not aware Chair of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the so called gazetted rates? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Background noise). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Please tell us about what led to the 
grounding of SA Express flights in Mafikeng and Pilanesberg. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The grounding of the SA Express 
on 24 May my understanding was that it – it was grounded due to 
non-compliance to regulations.  However I do not have more 
information on that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And the – the – as the department was it 
aware that there were certain regulations that had to be complied with 
before this project was initiated? 
20 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  The – the – ja – the airport 
management and the Transport Regulations Chief Directorate would 
have known of the regulations for policies or directives that regulate 
aviation. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Phatudi you received a notice in terms 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 99 of 224 
 
of Rule 3.3 informing you that you were implicated – in fact you were 
here at the hearing – by the evidence of Mr Ngwenya in that 
Mr Ngwenya testified that on the meeting that he had with Ms Tlatsana 
who would be one of our witnesses he was – he listened to voice 
recordings. 
In those recordings it was mentioned that you were one of the 
people who was to be paid or who got financial benefit from Mr van Wyk 
(background noise).  I am asking from what was paid by the department 
to you. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Yes Chair.  I confirm that I was 
10 
served with a Rule 3.3 Notice as you indicated.  I also had an 
opportunity to listen to the recordings wherein I understood the content 
– the content of the recording to be saying or alleging that - whoever 
was talking on that recording – alleging that they need to pay the CFO 
amongst other people that he mentioned.  I need to – to categorically 
state that I never had any one on one meetings with any of the people 
mentioned in that allegation that is in Mr …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the recorded conversation? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI: 
 
In 
– 
both 
in 
the 
recorded 
conversation and in the affidavit of Mr … 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr van Wyk? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  No, no the affidavit. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Ngwenya? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Ja, of Mr Ngwenya because what I 
was given was the affidavit of Mr Ngwenya and it – it stated … 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 100 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Ja.  It stated that it was a 
conversation between Ms Tlatsana and Mr van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I know Ms Tlatsana because we 
come from Mafikeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  She is a businesswoman in 
Mafikeng.  I know her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Mr van Wyk I only saw him for the 
first time when the department was contracting or was engaging with 
SA Express for this contract.  I need to confirm Chair that I never 
received any money.  I was never offered any money.  I never asked 
anybody to ask for money on my behalf from any – from these people or 
any of the service providers that served the department. 
So this – this allegation is not true.  I have never received.  I 
was never promised.  I never asked for money from anybody, yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Ms Phatudi seeing that this irregular 
contract was being concluded by your department at the time why you 
20 
did not report to anyone what was going on at your department? 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Chair I did not know. I would not 
know who to report to because as I mentioned the departments that 
were involved – Treasury was there, Office of the Premier was there.  
So I really had no – I would not know who to report to, yes Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 101 of 224 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI: 
 Chair 
Ms Phatudi 
has 
prepared and 
affidavit.  It has been added to the bundle in response to the Rule 3.3.  
It – it is appearing from page 378 of the bundle up to 380, thank you.  
Chair that will be all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does – the affidavit - what does the affidavit say?  
Does it say what she has just said? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  It is saying what she has just said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  She is denying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are – are the investigators looking into the matter … 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To see – because if there is an allegation that she 
was to be paid that should be looked into because if somebody was 
falsely alleging that she was part of an arrangement in terms of which 
she was to be paid monies that were unlawful. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should be looked into and if she did indeed 
receive money or was party to such an arrangement that should also be 
looked into. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we now have a situation where one witness or 
rather where there is some allegation.  She has come and taken the 
witness stand and under oath said she never received anything.  She 
never asked anybody to pay her anything.  So what it means is that that 
should be looked and investigated and ultimately so that – so that 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 102 of 224 
 
ultimately a pronouncement can be made whether she did or she did 
not and if she did not then the person who made that allegation falsely 
needs to be – to deal with that, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It will be looked into Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair that will be all … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Questions that I have for this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Phatudi for coming to share 
evidence and what – what you know and so on about these 
10 
transactions.  You may be asked to come back.  The investigators will 
look into this allegation … 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am sure you will come back if you are asked to 
come back. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  I will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair I have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Gotten confirmation that the information 
20 
relating to the payment of R15 million has already been requested … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  At the Office of the Premier North West. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The request was made on 24 May this year. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 103 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We have not received any response as at 
yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  That is – that is important.  We need 
to know how it got to be paid.  Okay, thank you.  You are excused 
Ms Phatudi. 
MS KUTLWANO INGRID PHATUDI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair the next witness will be Ms Tlatsana 
who will be led by Ms Hofmeyr.  We request a five minute break to 
prepare for the next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will – let us make it 10 because we were 
going to take a break anyway.  Let us make it 10 minutes.  So we will 
resume let us say 10 to four.  It is going to be about 12 minutes or so.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Thank you, Chair our next witness is Ms 
Tlatsana, may I request that she be sworn in and then we can 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 104 of 224 
 
commence with her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, please swear her in or administer the 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:  My name is Babadi Tlasana. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    None. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Please solemnly swear that all the evidence that you 
give here will be the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.  If so 
please raise your right hand and say so help me God. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    So help me God.  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair.  Ms Tlatsana just to 
orientate you with what’s in front of you at the witness table, you will 
have two files open in front of you, those are the files that comprise 
your evidence and then there are two further documents available to 
20 
you, they are files containing the evidence of two other witnesses which 
I’ll make reference to at various points and ask you just to take out and 
have in front of you. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Chair, in terms of the bundles Ms Tlatsana’s 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 105 of 224 
 
evidence is contained in what we propose to be marked Exhibit DD8 (A) 
and (B), it’s in two parts. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The lever arch file containing Ms Tlatsana’s 
affidavit/statement will be marked Exhibit DD8 (A) and the other lever 
arch file which has got annexures – certain annexures – are there two 
statements for her? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   There are indeed Chair.     
CHAIRPERSON:    The other lever arch file containing a statement by 
Ms Tlatsana, that I dated the 6 t h of May 2019 and annexures will be 
marked DD8 (B). 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But- oh I think there may have been something 
incorrect in what I said, because the one marked DD8 (A) doesn’t look 
like it has a statement as such but it seems to have an answering 
affidavit.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       It does. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes so the lever arch file that I said should be 
marked DD8 (A) contains an answering affidavit deposed to by Ms 
Tlatsana on behalf of Koreneka Trading and Projects CC in proceedings 
in the High Court in North West under case number M178/2018 that is 
20 
the lever arch file that will be marked DD8 (A). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you Chair and just to clarify Ms 
Tlatsana, those two resources that we have in the bundle for your 
evidence today, are first of all an affidavit that you depose to in the 
High Court proceedings that the Chair has just referred to, can you 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 106 of 224 
 
confirm that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And then the second affidavit you’ll find in 
the (B) volume, the other file in front of you and just to confirm that, 
that is a statement as the Chair has indicated – well at least an 
affidavit that you deposed to on the 6 t h of May 2019, can you confirm 
that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you, Chair we are working with those 
two sources for Ms Tlatsana’s evidence today because we had not been 
10 
favoured with a completed statement in relation to  the matters that are 
going to form the subject matter of her evidence because of that we 
decided at a point last week to simply use these two resources which 
we had available to us previously and the intention today is to use the 
as the basis for the evidence but then ask her further questions that we 
have engaged previously with Ms Tlatsana on but which had not been 
reduced to an affidavit or statement in time for her evidence, so with 
your leave that’s the way we’ll approach it. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, no that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you Chair.  Ms Tlatsana I’d like to 
20 
start off then…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we going to use them sequentially?   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    We will.    
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so we start with A? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       We start with A indeed and almost 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 107 of 224 
 
exclusively A there are one or two reasons why we’ll dip into B but we’ll 
predominantly be in A and then Chair and Ms Tlatsana just one or two 
other technical aspects in advance of the evidence, there will be a 
portion of the evidence this afternoon where we will listen to recordings 
and I’ll ask the assistance of the Commission’s representatives to help 
us with that.  There will also be, on two occasions one document from 
the bundle that will be projected onto the screens, it’s the important 
document, Chair, you’ll recall from Mr Ngwenya’s evidence which is 
alleged to have been the hand written notes that were made by Mr van 
Wyk in his meeting with Ms Tlatsana at the Spur restaurant.  What will  
10 
be important in the course of that part of the testimony is for Ms 
Tlatsana to tell us what she understood Mr van Wyk to be 
communicating by what he wrote and so for that purpose we will ask for 
the able assistance of a  pointer on the screen to those parts but Chair 
we will hand up to you and to the witness at the time, a hard copy as 
well of that document and the only other thing that we will be projecting 
is a flow of funds diagram that has been prepared by the Commission, 
not by Ms Tlatsana but she has been shown it in advance of the 
evidence and we will ask her to talk through those aspects of it in 
respect of which she has personal knowledge but it was our sense to 
20 
aid the receipt of this evidence and particularly an overarching sense 
of where money came from, where it went to and where it ended up, it 
would be useful to represent that graphically and so that will also be 
handed in at the appropriate point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 108 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana if we may then commence at 
Exhibit DD8 (A) which is the big file in front of you and if you’ll turn to 
page 9 of that document and you’ll be working with the pagination at 
the top right-hand corner, which is sometimes different to the 
pagination in the internal page.  So you’ll see where it says BT009 are 
you on that page?  If you look up at the top right.      
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Are you at BT009? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       So that’s the consistent pagination in the 
files, so when I say page 9 you’ll just look for BT009 and following, is 
that alright. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Okay 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So we start at that part of your 
affidavit in the High Court proceedings with you setting out the 
background to your engagements with the North West, your idea about 
servicing the airports and rejuvenating the tourism in the industry as I 
understand your affidavit, please could you tell us about that 
20 
background, where did the idea come from, what did it involve and who 
did you speak to about it?            
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Good afternoon Ms Tlatsana.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes it all started – the company started in 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 109 of 224 
 
2007 as it’s stated here with regard to this contract that Koreneka 
ended up into, it all started in 2014 when there were canvasses of the 
elections, ANC was canvassing that there’s going to be changes of 
lives, business opportunities and stuff like that…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is ahead of the 2014 general election?          
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay.        
MS BABADI TLASANA:   And my village where I come from, I come 
from – my parents are coming from Localeng Village, Localeng Village 
is a village where the airport is and that’s where…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one of the two airports?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Mafikeng Airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:         Okay.     
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes and as a businesswoman I find that to be 
an opportunity for Mafikeng Airport and I heard that Pilansberg is not 
doing anything and Mafikeng, we are seeing it everyday is getting 
dilapidated what is it that we can do and then it came now when the 
Premier was elected as the Premier of the North West Mahumapelo and 
then when he comes, immediately when he enters the office he spoke 
about “saamwerk, saamtrek”.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He spoke about? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  “Saamwerk, saamtrek”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh “saamwerk, saamtrek”.   
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay.          
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 110 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   And repositioning, rebranding, renewing and 
that means…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you can just explain what you understood, 
“saamwerk, saamtrek, to mean for the benefit for those…(intervention).           
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes “saamwerk, saamtrek”, come let’s work 
together let’s pull this whole thing together.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it’s like let’s pull together, let’s work together it’s 
Afrikaans for it.           
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes I’m not that good with Afrikaans. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I used to be very good when I was at secondary 
10 
school but I’m really bad now but I can understand “saamtrek, 
saamwerk”.    
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes and then here comes repositioning, 
renewing, rebranding and our city is going down every day and we are 
there as citizens and what…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the Premier talking?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, no…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    That’s what was going on in your mind?          
MS BABADI TLASANA:  That’s what was going in my mind and what is 
it that we can do to assist and alleviate just to take our city to a better 
20 
level and then…(intervention).    
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe raise your voice a little bit, maybe bring the 
mic a little closer as well so that everybody can hear you.           
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Hello, is it better?  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think bring – just raise your voice it should be fine.            
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 111 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Okay, alright, yes and rebranding and then 
yes here are the airports what is it that we can do and then I came with 
this mind, I was in love with SAA, South African Airways, and then I 
approached SAA, South African Airways and South African Airways 
made mention that no, no they are not doing the local flights for small 
airports 
especially 
for 
small 
airports 
mainly 
concern 
on 
the 
international and big airports going out of the country and I called the 
switchboard, that’s where I got the information because I was referred 
– I don’t remember well but I ended up talking with people there and 
then I was referred to try Mango, try Fly SA, try SA Express (indistinct) 
10 
South African and then okay fine, let me try SA Express because I once 
saw the flights of Mango they were always small  and , you know, 
people would complain about them, which were the flights that were 
local and then here is SA Express.  Okay fine and then I got the number 
for SA Express and then I called SA Express to find out what is it that – 
to bring my idea on the table and then I called SA Express and then I 
was put to General Manager for commercial and – communication and 
commercial in SA Express…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Just to make sure I understand the earlier part of 
your evidence is the position that you got this idea of being involved in 
20 
getting a resumption of flights to Mafikeng during the election 
campaigns of the ANC or is the position that you got this idea after 
hearing the Premier after he became Premier in 2014, speaking?        
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, no okay, no sir, the idea has always been 
there but now we didn’t know who to talk to, who to approach especially 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 112 of 224 
 
with this kind of business. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes okay, no that’s fine, continue…(intervention).        
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Now when the energetic Premier comes in of 
“saamwerk, saamtrek” reposition, this made a lot of sense, you know to 
approach and try and find out if maybe, this thing where can we go with 
and I ended up at SA Express and then I was referred to the General 
Manager for communication and – ja Mr van Wyk, communication and 
…(intervention).  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Commercial I think it is. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Commercial yes and commercial, thank you 
10 
very much Kate and commercial…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Maybe because you are mentioning Mr van Wyk for 
the same time do you want to specify his name as well? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Mr (indistinct) van Wyk – Brian van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Brian van Wyk.    
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Mr Brian van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:     His other name is Tebogo.         
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes his other name is Tebogo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.           
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Chair we did read that into the record the 
20 
other day so we should have the spelling for it.     
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay continue.  
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Okay and I managed to get him and I saw the 
idea that here are the airports and what we – I was thinking of – 
because the interest with these airports is to bring flights inside 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 113 of 224 
 
Mafikeng and Pilansberg, we used to travel before then – there used to 
be another airline, I think it was – I don’t know if it was Fly what, what 
and then the next thing it just disappeared that airline and then by then 
it used to work very well because we use to use it, my people – my 
people used to use it to go – I used to take people halfway to the 
airport and now it kept quiet and what is it that we can do and then Mr 
van Wyk said, this is a brilliant idea, bring a proposal forward and then 
I went back to go and try get the proposal to send it forward to him.  I 
remember I approached two/three people, those gentlemen were 
specialists in drafting the proposals even though I didn’t win about it 
10 
but I drafted mine with the idea because the idea was just for the 
airline – for the flights to come in to eliminate the travelling of us 
because before during (indistinct) we would fly to Sun City we would fly 
to Joburg, it would be easy, so that was just the idea of approaching SA 
Express.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Ms Tlatsana can I just get clear, what was 
your proposal for the work that Koreneka would do in relation to these 
flights that you wanted to bring into the north West?       
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Thank you very much, the idea for that to 
bring into the North West was just to do the marketing and the flight of 
20 
the passengers to be able to get them tickets if they need tickets 
because now I know that people would be buying tickets from Pick ‘n 
Pay and stuff like that, that was just to do the administration of the 
flights, flights to come in and go out.  I didn’t even have an – didn’t 
know about this thing of ground handling to me the ground handling 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 114 of 224 
 
name was not there, to me the name was just let the airline be in 
operation let us just be getting the flights into the province. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr has just mentioned Koreneka, that was 
your Close Corporation, is that correct.           
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long had you had the Close Corporation when 
you approached SA Express? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  From 2007.    
CHAIRPERSON:  From 2007?            
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you the sole member of the Close Corporation 
when you approached SA Express? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Had  you been the sole member of the corporation 
since inception?          
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay right, thank you, you may proceed.        
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Tlatsana so you – as I have your evidence 
you put together a proposal that Mr van Wyk had asked you to prepare 
is that correct?     
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And what did the proposal detail?    
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The proposal was for the flights to come in the 
airport and to do the administration of the passengers and the hostess 
– the people that would be helping – not necessarily the hostess, I 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 115 of 224 
 
don’t know how to call the name but these officers…(intervention).    
CHAIRPERSON:    You – is the position that what you were proposing 
to SA Express was that your Close Corporation would take care of 
whatever needed to be done in order to process passengers when they 
arrive at the airport building up to when they board the plane.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you just wanted that there should be aeroplanes 
that would come in take people out, bring people back, you were going 
to – your company, your Close Corporation would take care of whatever 
needs to be done to process the passengers.          
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Just that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That’s what you had in mind.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What it was called you didn’t know.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No I didn’t know what it was called. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja but you knew that’s what you wanted to do.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Just to do the administration yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just before Ms Hofmeyr proceeds from there, 
before you approached SA Express, is there any work that Koreneka 
had been doing or had done since it’s inception, is there any business 
20 
in which it had been involved or in which it was involved at that time?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, Koreneka before we were – I was 
assisting one company to deliver their meat and the vegetables in the 
hospitals in the province. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and did it have staff?          
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 116 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  You mean Koreneka? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Employees, Koreneka, at the time you approached 
SA Express did it have employees already.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, no, no I think we were just three people 
because it was just the driver and he person who was loading the meat 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so at the time you approached SA Express you 
were – your Close Corporation was still involved in the business of 
delivering meat to hospitals.           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, no not by then. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay it had finished doing that?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes it had finished doing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it busy with any particular business at that 
time?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It was not?      
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long before you approached SA Express had it 
finished doing that business?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Oh my God, I don’t know, I will end up 
20 
speculating really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can’t remember, about a year before about two 
years before, about three years before?            
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I don’t know I think it could be two years, 
three years. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 117 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     It could be two years, three years?       
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was that the only business in which it had been 
involved between it’s inception and your approach to SA Express?          
MS 
BABADI 
TLASANA: 
 
Yes 
that 
was 
just 
the 
only 
business…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and that was for how long if you are able to 
remember it being involved of that business of delivering meat to 
hospitals.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair it’s not good to…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:       A year, two years, three years, four 
years…(intervention).       
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, no I think it’s less than a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Less than a year?          
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, that’s the only thing it had done?            
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and it had involved about two employees plus 
yourself?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes because it was just to deliver meat. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    No that’s fine, thank you, please proceed Ms 
Hofmeyr.          
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       Thank you Chair indeed, Ms Tlatsana can I 
just clarify in relation to – the Chair’s question focused on Koreneka 
itself and what that Close Corporation was doing prior to 2014, but can 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 118 of 224 
 
I ask, in addition, you yourself, had you been – whether in your 
personal capacity or through other businesses involved in government 
tendering prior to 2014.       
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And what was that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   It was construction I would – before I would 
be doing catering – some small catering but mainly it was construction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And was that through Koreneka, the Close 
Corporation?      
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, no. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So how did you do that business?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It’s another company.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And its name?          
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Kenk Suppliers and Distributors.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So you were familiar…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the name again, I’m sorry, what was the 
name of the other company? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Kenk Suppliers and Distributors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   K-E…(intervention)           
MS BABADI TLASANA:    N-k.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    K-e-n-k?          
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:     Kenk Suppliers.         
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And Distributors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say it was involved in construction? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 119 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mentioned something about catering as well.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes I would, you know if…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you did whatever came.           
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Whatever come our way we will just be doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright, please proceed Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana I would just then like to probe a 
little bit further your understanding of government tender processes, 
were you familiar with them by 2014?            
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair I was familiar with tender 
10 
processes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So in your experience, what did they involve 
were there bids were there processes of adjudication, how did it work?            
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair, all I know is a tender would be put 
in the newspaper and we will be invited for briefing and after briefing 
we buy documents, we complete them, we submit them on the due date 
and then from there it will be the responsibility of the department with 
their selection with the tender processes and then if you could be 
blessed you can be called that you have been successful – your 
company has been successful. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I like the reference if you could be blessed.            
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Chair it may come up again in the evidence.          
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you know in today’s language that could mean 
lots of things, so I guess, what you mean is, if you were lucky.   
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes, yes Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 120 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    That’s what you mean.          
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Ms Tlatsana so, as I have your evidence 
up to this point, you put together that proposal what then happened?           
MS BABADI TLASANA:   And then we emailed it through to Mr van Wyk 
because he gave me his email address…(intervention).   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I’m sorry I thought you were still continuing with 
that – with her experience.  So you – previously before you got 
involved with SA Express you had been involved in tenders.            
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you’ve explained exactly what happens as far as 
you understand and then at a certain stage one of he bidders would be 
appointed and that would be announced.           
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright and that had happened with your other 
company Kenk Suppliers?            
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you.  Okay Ms Hofmeyr had 
asked you what happened with SA Express then, in terms of getting the 
20 
business.         
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the proposal was sent through, as I have 
your testimony, you sent it on an email and I think you were about to 
tell us about what email you were told to send it to.            
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes, if I’m not wrong, Mr van Wyk gave me 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 121 of 224 
 
the number for me to contact him on and he gave me his email address 
but it was a Gmail address that he gave me and when I asked him, why 
is he giving me the Gmail address, he said to me that it’s more 
convenient because most of the time he’s never in the offices – in the 
office and as well he’s always out of the country, so if I use the Gmail it 
will be proper for me and him because he’ll be able to access that 
Gmail address, whatever communication that I would be sending 
through to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to go back a little bit, you told me about your 
meeting 
with 
Mr 
van 
Wyk, 
your 
first 
meeting, 
is 
that 
right 
10 
when…(intervention).      
MS BABADI TLASANA:   On the phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh was it on the phone?    
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not a physical meeting?      
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, so when you spoke to him for the first time 
it was not in a meeting?     
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was over the phone.      
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that when he told you about sending a proposal?    
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay alright, thank you.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Ms Tlatsana as I have your testimony you 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 122 of 224 
 
then send it through to that email address, if you turn to the page – 
over the page to 10 of your High Court affidavit and you go to 
paragraph 4.4, I’d like you – you deal in 4.4 and 4.5 with certain further 
steps you took in relation to the Premier in the North West as well as 
the Chairman of the North West Transport Investment Board, can you 
tell us about those steps you took as well. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair – you’re talking about 4.4 right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair, and then after that there was a 
business meeting which the Premier called shortly after he was in the 
10 
office.  The Premier called the meeting for all the business people for 
us to go and meet with him at Cookes Lake to come and give him all 
our grievances because there were lots of complaints of businesses not 
going well, people are not getting paid and stuff like that.  And I went I 
attended that meeting.  I remember I came late.  I attended that 
meeting and there was a ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this after you had sent the proposal to Mr van 
Wyk or before? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, after I’ve sent it to Mr van Wyk, yes 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And the Premier was giving everybody an 
opportunity to express ourselves with what with the experiences of us 
making business with government and after the meeting and now 
everybody was going in front just to go and congratulate him, give him 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 123 of 224 
 
a hand and stuff.  And I was among those people to go and give him a 
hand but now and I called him to tell him that me my business that I’m 
interested in doing is the flights in the province and then he said it’s a 
brilliant idea.  She pointed one woman there, that women is a Police 
officer according to the way I know her in Mafikeng.  Mafikeng is a very 
small place.  So now he said I should get his numbers from that lady 
and I got his number from that lady and then he said I should contact 
him so that we can discuss further this idea.  And unfortunately I’ve 
never gotten to have access to the Premier, I tried that call I couldn’t 
go through.  I even went to the office Mpikwa ANC office to try and see 
10 
if I can be squeezed just to continue with this idea of ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you approached the lady that he said you should 
get his number from. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that lady gave you his number. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it the landline a cell phone? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, it was a cell phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and you ... (intervenes) 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  079 so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You called that cell phone number 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you didn’t get hold of the Premier? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, there was never any answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you approached the ANC office? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 124 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, to see if maybe I can make an 
appointment to see him to no avail.  And there at ANC Mpikwa office 
regional office I met with Pastor- that gentleman’s name they always 
call him Moruti Moruti Moruti.  So apparently that Moruti was his PA and 
that he has to ask me why do I want to see the Premier and I told him 
that no I want to see the Premier with regard to this because I told him 
about this idea of the airport and they discouraged me to tell me that 
no unfortunately that idea it has it has always- it’s already in the 
pipeline.  There’s someone from Kwazulu Natal, I don’t know he spoke 
some Zulu name that is going to be appointed for the airports.  And I 
10 
feel so that I said let me leave this man, let me go to the administrative 
office to the Premier office in government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The government office. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  Because the idea was just to tell the 
Head of the House what are we intending to do because he invited us.  
And then even when I arrived there his PA she was always saying that 
no, the Premier is not available, not available.  I’ve never had any 
contact any further communication with the Premier since then.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana, you did at 4.5 on that page 10 you 
talk about an approach you made to the Chairman of the Northwest 
20 
Transport Investment Board.  Can you first of all tell us who that person 
is? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Ja.  Then it was Mr Themba Gwabeni who was 
appointed as the Chairman of the Northwest Transport Investment 
Board. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 125 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to get that name again, Mr Themba 
Gwabeni. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Themba Gwabeni, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  G-W-A-B-E-N-I 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And what did you discuss with him? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And then I sold the idea to him as well.  That 
Mr Gwabeni, this is the idea this is what I want to do.  I remember I met 
him nearer the Parliament area because he was saying that they’re 
about to enter for a session but he was just there at the carwash.  
10 
Come and meet me because he was saying that he can't, I said please 
please let le me just meet with you.  And then I went to him and I sell 
the very same idea to him and then he said brilliant, this is a very 
wonderful idea.  I’m going into the legislation now now soon and I’m 
going to meet with the MEC Molapisi.  I’m going to sell this idea to him 
so that he can present it in parliament.  And then I said, okay fine no, 
thank you very much because now at least there’s direction.  And then I 
said okay fine because I’ve been communicating, I’ve been asking Mr 
van Wyk how far is my proposal, he’s just mute he’s not saying 
anything.  And I was to guard because every time when you bring a 
20 
proposal some other people would be silly stealing your idea.  And now 
I said to Mr Gwabeni, Mr Gwabeni you know what, since you say you 
are going to sell it to MEC Molapisi, thank you very much.  I’m going to 
inform Mr van Wyk of what you said.  Now you people of your high level 
of understanding this this things, I’m going to give Mr van Wyk your 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 126 of 224 
 
number so that at least your people should communicate and assist me 
on this to be successful. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana, if you go over the page to page 11 
you then at the top of that page paragraph 4.6.  Tell us about when Mr 
van Wyk did come back to you?  What did he say when he came back to 
you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  Mr van Wyk later Chair, he called to say 
that I’m being provincially granted- what is the word that he used?  
Provincially selected, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Selected. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Thank you.  Koreneka has been not myself, my 
apologies.  Chair please bear with me, I’m just a business women at 
the background.  I don’t know the legal language.  Please at times 
when I say ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Don’t worry, just tell as you understand and what’s 
more important is just what you had in mind and what you understood.  
The rest we will try and fit in. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes thank you very much Chair.  And then he 
said to me that I’m provincially selected to as a preferred bidder and 
the reasons being I’m from the Northwest Province, I’m a women, I’m- 
20 
he mentioned four reasons why am I being selected as a preferred 
bidder.  Because ja and then I said, oh thank you very much.  I was just 
so excited and feeling great that well my prayers have been answered. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana, can I ask, this mention of a 
preferred bidder, did that raise a query with you?  Because as I 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 127 of 224 
 
understand your testimony thus far you hadn’t participated in any 
tender process had you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Before then Chair, because with this in 
between this process Mr van Wyk will not be coming to me and now I’ll 
be agitated.  Now what is going on with my proposal?  Have now they 
decided now to give it to somebody- no I remember I ask him, Mr van 
Wyk why are you, it’s like you are quiet or maybe are you taking this 
thing for tender or what?  And then he said, no no we are parastatal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Parastatal. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It’s the express.  We are parastatal and we 
are doing things differently.  It’s not like the way they are going to be.  
That was before being told as a preferred bidder.  I’m trying to answer 
you because you trying to get if there was a tender. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I’m getting ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let me just in terms of timeframes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t remember or do you around when in terms 
of months it was when you approached Mr van Wyk for the first time?  It 
20 
was 2014, isn’t it?  Or was it 2015? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  No no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 128 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, it’s 2014 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014, ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Ja, it’s 2014 because I think ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  well, the elections would have been in the first  
MS BABADI TLASANA:  May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Half of the year. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you remember more or less when it was when 
you made the first approach to Mr van Wyk?  If you can’t remember it’s 
fine, I just wanted to have some timeframe in mine.  You can’t 
10 
remember? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Eish Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Don’t worry, it’s okay.  But from ... (intervenes) 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Ja but it was early 20 to 2014.(?) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Early not late in the year? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not late, ja? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No sir because after him is then now when the 
Premier was been appointed and then the Premier enter with Saam 
Werk Saam Trek and then the Premier called the business meeting so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you met him it was before the Premier got 
elected? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  On the phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh when you spoke to him on the phone it was before 
the Premier was elected?  It was before you had that meeting where the 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 129 of 224 
 
Premier addressed business people?  It was before that. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, it was before the Premier was appointed 
in the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay because when he addressed the business 
people that is the Premier, he obviously had been elected by them. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, the Premier just addressed us I think it 
was after two week after he was in the office or amongst somewhere 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Just be accepted. (inaudible crosstalk)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when Mr van Wyk told you that your proposal, 
your company was provincially selected.  That would have been about 
how long after the meeting at which the Premier addressed business 
people?  Or how long after you had sent in your proposal?  Just to give 
us some timeframe. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, even though it won’t be exact but I 
think it will fall with the flow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no it doesn’t have to be exact. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  And then after the Premier when I 
attempted to communicate with the Premier, I didn’t hear anything I 
20 
didn’t get him.  And then Mr Gwabeni went and speak to MEC Molapisi 
and then they kept quiet, I don’t know I think because elections I think 
they were May, June, July , August, somewhere there somewhere May, 
June, July, August, September, somewhere there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, that’s fine.  Okay, thank you. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 130 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  My apologies I can’t be precise with the date. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana, just so I have your testimony 
correct.  At some point in that period you had a conversation with Mr 
van Wyk in which you raised the question of tendering whether there 
was a process. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understand your evidence he gave you 
an answer that said: Well, SA Express was a parastatal. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did that mean to you?  Why wouldn’t 
10 
a parastatal be involved in tendering? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair that was my first time to be dealing with 
something that they called parastatal.  I know that they’re parastatal 
but that was my first approach.  I know how government operates with 
doing its tenders and stuff but now this one was new and when he said 
it’s parastatal and we do thing differently, I believed him.  Why do I 
believe him?  With the nature of the office he’s holding, there is 
nowhere that he can be in SA Express General Manager.  By the way 
General Manager, you are next to Board and then you start like I 
believed him, everything that he was saying. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you’re next to? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Next to this seat ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Board. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And the Board, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 131 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, that’s my presumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought I heard you say something else.  Okay 
alright. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana, so at page 11 if you can just 
return to page 11. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mm-hmm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At 4.7  you detail in that paragraph what else 
Mr van Wyk told you on that call when he had said you were 
provincially selected.  What else did he tell you then needed to 
10 
happen? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, and Mr van Wyk mentioned that there are 
things that have to be addressed.  I have to appoint some other people 
into the company.  And I tried to indicate to him that you know my 
companies I’m always alone on them, not that I’m selfish or what to 
avoid the misunderstanding among people.  And by then during the 
elections I remember well that there was this saying that you know 
people should share.  You cannot just be given a whole cow instead of 
sharing and giving others the feet and the thigh and the leg and stuff 
like that.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they say you mustn’t eat alone? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can’t want to have the whole cow to yourself. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, it’s selfishness Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 132 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana, is that what Mr van Wyk conveyed 
to you for why you needed more people in your close corporation? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair, he never spoke about the cow, I’m just 
making ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it was (inaudible laughter)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No no, you don’t know any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I understood you to be saying during the 
election campaign. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was talk that people must work together. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can’t just have a whole cow to yourself. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was said in the context of elections. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, in terms of promoting businesses and doing 
business with government. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, hence it was easy it was more 
20 
convenient yes but it make sense you know because he was saying that 
this project was going to be big. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so when he said to you you needed other people, 
you understood that in the context of what you heard during the 
election campaign?  Is that what you saying? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 133 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no, you’re not saying that.  Okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair, I’m not saying that.  What I’m saying 
Chair is he said there are things that I have to meet to before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm, requirements. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes, requirements that I have to meet.  First 
requirement is to have people in my company so as to share this cow.  
Let me make him like he’s all of us. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I understand it’s just that when I thought 
you understood what he was saying when he said you’ll need other 
people.  I said, did you understanding it in this in the context? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what you had been told during the election 
campaign, don’t want the cow for yourself only share with other people. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said no, so I thought- so but I think we 
understand each other.  So there was thought of a cow even when Mr 
van Wyk told you about getting other people but not that the idea of a 
20 
cow came from him? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you thought about that idea? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm, okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 134 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   And the other thing he said because I had a 
bookkeeper by then for my companies.  And then he said, no no who is 
the person.  I said, no no she’s just a bookkeeper.  He says, no no you 
need somebody who- you need to have someone who’s more qualified 
and who’s familiar with the SARS related issues so that he can be able 
to be of assistance to you.  Because this person be able to help you 
with the salaries, with the taxes, with the pay as you earn of the staff 
and stuff like that.  And then I told him that, no no I don’t have that 
person but I think my bookkeeper would be of assistance.  He says, no 
no we’ve got someone who’s very unique whom we always use at SA 
10 
Express.  And now because all these information was coming through 
him, I was just saying oh thank you so much, at least they are definitely 
going to help me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were happy that you were not going to have to 
look for such a person? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, at least. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Was this in a meeting when he was saying this 
to you or still on the phone? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No no, it was a meeting because he came 
here- every time he will be coming to the Department of Transport. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Northwest. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  In Northwest and we will be meeting because I 
remember that day he was having some documents with him that was 
saying.  I’m from the office of the HOD and this thing has to be 
attended very urgent because now you need to be appointed, you need 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 135 of 224 
 
to start in May and now you get those people on board.  It was I think it 
was March somewhere there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I’ll leave to you Ms Hofmeyr in terms of making 
sure we know when was the first meeting and so on and so on. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where we are?  Indeed.   
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We’ve moved in time to 2016 now, is that 
correct?  Because this meeting that you’re referring to is to your 
recollection did I have you testimony to be March 2016? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No no. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When is the meeting? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  15, 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  15? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You’re still in 2015 when he talks to you about 
the need to appoint an accountant. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the need for two more members. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No no, it was not in March.  Was it not in 
November December, it was the end of the year 2014. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we can just get the time right because your 
testimony has just been about a meeting about when he come from the 
HODs office in the Northwest saying that it was quite urgent to 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 136 of 224 
 
conclude your appointment. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That only happens later in March 2016, right? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No no Chair, no.  2016- not 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies, 2015. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Not 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe let’s do it this way, let’s try this.  You 
had a telephone conversation with Mr van Wyk. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subsequent to which you sent to him your proposal. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As at that time when you sent your proposal to him, 
you had not met him yet had you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  When did you meet him for the first 
time?  Now I’m not talking about the actual date, but maybe a month 
and a year.  Maybe if you can’t remember the month you can just 
indicate meet somewhere in the middle of the year, the beginning or 
late.  Let’s start with the year.  Was it in 2014, 2015? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It was 2014. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was in 2014. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you met him for the first time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where was this where you met him for the first 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 137 of 224 
 
time?  Can you remember?  Was it in his office? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  What is the question Chair, because I’m trying 
to get the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:    When did you meet Mr van Wyk for the first time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay no for the first time it was in I think it 
was in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It was the year in 2014?  It was the end of 2014 
maybe or you can’t remember?  We don’t have to remember the exact 
date or month but it was in 2014? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, it was in 2014 because with bringing 
10 
people into the company it was through a telephone. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes and then after the telephone now and then 
I had to process these people to be inside the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  Okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And again he said that this people need to be 
brought in- I’m trying to recall the sequence of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay maybe let’s leave it for now.  Ms Hofmeyr 
might be able to help you to remember. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Thank you, okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Or I just want us to have an idea. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    In terms of the important things.  When did they 
happen and what was said?  And some of the interactions there might 
not be anything important but in others it might be important to know 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 138 of 224 
 
this was said on this occasion and whether it was a telephone 
communication or a meeting.  Thank you, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair.  Ms Tlatsana, may I make 
this suggestion, your affidavit does not in the High Court gives these 
dates to events of the type that the Chair has requested.  But it does 
seem to progress in sequence and then every now and then we get a 
date.  So for example if you just turn over the page from page 11 to 
page 12, you’ll see the next date we get in the affidavit is at paragraph 
4.12 which says during April 2015. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can we take it then and please be as clear 
as you can on this and if you can’t remember you must say.  But can we 
take it that what you’ve described in the affidavit then we at least know 
is happening before April 2015, if you are talking about it before that 
paragraph?  Is that a fair way to read your affidavit? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  Chair, let me go back a little bit.  I had 
to- was it 2014?  Before 2015, yes.  2014 when I had to bring this three 
people into the company.  Three meaning the accountant and this one 
into my CK. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You say that was 2014? 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Ja, it was 2014 towards the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Because I remember we had to go to open a 
bank account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsane, could we break that down a bit 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 139 of 224 
 
because the details of the people is quite important. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I have your evidence to be towards the end 
of 2014. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have a telephone conversation with Mr van 
Wyk, is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At which he tells you you need to bring more 
people into your cc, is that correct? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What do you say in response to that when he 
says you need more people in your cc?  What do you say? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes because the reason were this project is 
going to be very huge and I have to bring this people into the company 
so that there can be number one, he was saying so that they can be of 
assistance to the company.  And now my concern was now if now they 
are going to be of assistance it means that now we are going to be 30 
30 
CHAIRPERSON:    You are going to share the profits? 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, ja this whole thing even though yes 
because I needed more for him to be more explicit with it.  And then he 
said, no no don’t you worry about it’s not all about sharing, it’s all 
about the requirements of people in the cc because it’s not fair for you 
to be appointed alone for this big project you need to have some people 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 140 of 224 
 
in the company.  Because these people they are working and they 
cannot be part of sharing or something, they will just get some small 
dividends out of this whole thing on (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, the question from Ms Hofmeyr was, what did you 
say to Mr van Wyk in response with things like this? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, in bringing them I agreed.  Yes, I agreed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understood from your affidavit that you 
mentioned something about your sister.  Do you recall that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  I ended up agreeing because initially 
before we he was saying I should bring people, I said yes I’ve got my 
10 
sister that I would need her to be part of this my company.  And  
then he said, no no you can’t bring her in because it’s going to be 
nepotism.  So it’s best if you bring new fresh people from outside. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who were the people that he proposed? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And then he proposed Ms Phiri and Mr Victor 
Thabeng.  Ms Catherine Phiri and Mr Thabeng. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who were they? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  At a later stage I didn’t know this people, the 
only person that I knew was Mr Thabeng because of media.  He was 
working for SABC.  It was just I knew him and knew him that he’s just a 
20 
someone from Mafikeng but Ms Phiri I never knew Ms Phiri from before.  
And then he gave me the contact numbers to go and collect their copies 
of Ids so that I can submit them to whoever would be doing the bringing 
them into the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you want to give the names of the two persons 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 141 of 224 
 
you have mentioned? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, it’s Ms Phiri and Mr Thabeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, the name the first name or did he mention the? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay, Ms Phiri her first name is Catherine 
Phiri. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes.  
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And then Mr Thabeng ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I’m sorry, Ms Tlatsana she has a middle name 
does she not? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja, or middle name. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Catherine? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Cathering Joyce Phiri. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay, Catherine Joyce Phiri. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You must just have the full name because there 
different references that people give to the names over times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, full names.  
MS BABADI TLASANA:  okay.  Ja, Catherine Joyce Phiri. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the other person? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The other person is Victor Thabeng, I forgot 
the other name. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, thank you.  Chair, just for the record that 
reference to what Ms Tlatsana said in response about her willingness to 
bring in her sister, you’ll actually find in the second affidavit.  So just 
for record purposes it’s at exhibit DD8B at page 438.  So you then Ms 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 142 of 224 
 
Tlatsana, as I have your evidence you agreed to add the two people as- 
your affidavit used the word shareholder but in brackets.  They were to 
become members of the cc, is that right with you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Come again with the question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  She’s asking whether the two persons that Mr van 
Wyk said according to you should be added to your close corporation. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were going to be members of the close corporation. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she mentions you affidavit uses the word 
10 
shareholders. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ja, but you understand because you were a sole 
member of the cc before you know exactly what that meant. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your understanding was that he wanted them to be 
members of your close corporation together with you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana, who was proposes for the 
20 
position of accountant? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The accountant was proposed by Mr van Wyk. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who was that to be? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  He was Mr David Kalisilira. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 143 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry.  The first two persons, was there an 
indication as to what they’re role was going to be in the close 
corporation or was it simply that they should be members of the close 
corporation? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  They’re role was to come and assist in the 
smooth running of ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the business that you were going to get or that you 
are getting? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana, if you stay on page 11 but go 
to the bottom at paragraph 4.9 as I read that paragraph you explained 
how Mr Victor Thabeng was suggested to be one of the members.  Can 
you tell us about that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, and then there was a meeting with- Mr 
Gwabeni told me that he had a meeting with Mr van Wyk. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just remind us who was Mr Gwabeni? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr Gwabeni was the Chairman of Northwest 
Transport Investment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The person who you mentioned previously in 
20 
your testimony? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was Chairman of the Board of that of the 
Transport Northwest Transport Investment Company. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 144 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And you were telling us about that 
meeting. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes and then he said he met with Mr van Wyk 
and they’ve agreed that Mr Victor Thabeng would be another suitable 
person to be in the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know how he came to talk to – that is 
Mr van Wyk - how he came to be talking to Mr Gwabeni about this – you 
– you did not know how he … 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Came to be talking to him about it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I do not Chair because me I am staying in 
Mafikeng … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And Mr van Wyk is in Johannesburg … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And the Chairman I do not know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where he …? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Where were they meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  All I know is I gave – I gave Mr van Wyk 
Mr Gwabeni’s telephone numbers.  So that they can be communicating 
to assist to hear because Mr Gwabeni was saying that he is going to 
give this proposal to Mr Molapisi. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 145 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  No, now I – I think I forgot something you had 
explained. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr van Wyk got in touch with Mr Gwabeni … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you had spoken to Mr Gwabeni … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The two should be – they should contact each other? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No now I understand; but with regard to the 
people who Mr van Wyk was saying should be added to your company – 
to your close corporation did you – did he explain how he knew them 
and how he got to come to the decision that they are the people he 
would propose should be involved in your company? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair what happened was – let me make – 
give you the picture of what happened?  Mr van Wyk I think he came on 
– on Thursday.  It was on Thursday when he was saying that this thing 
has to be done quick, quick, quick.  This people we have to put them in 
20 
– in the company because – because you are being a preferred bidder 
and you have to let make this quick.  I – I never even had a chance to 
think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Or to do it because I brought my sister and my 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 146 of 224 
 
sister was nepotism and now I was blocked who else now could I think 
of bringing into the company.  Hence he said no, no okay I will assist.  
There are people who he will bring. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It was just in a squeezed time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Too quick, ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But can I take it then that your evidence is that 
he did not offer an explanation for why those particular people should 
10 
be the people to join your close corporation?  Did he say why he was 
choosing Ms Phiri and Mr Thabeng? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  For them to be – it is part of the requirement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No Ms Tlatsana I understand he said it is a 
requirement that they be added, right. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That people were added but then he was 
specific 
as 
I 
understand 
your 
evidence. 
 
He 
said 
Ms Catherine Joyce Phiri must be added and Mr Victor Thabeng and 
what I am probing is did he tell you why those two specific people must 
20 
be the ones in the company. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you ask him why? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No I did not ask him why because there was – 
I did not ask him why.  No Chair I did not ask him. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 147 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You – as I understand your affidavit you later 
found out about a certain relationship between Mr van Wyk and one or 
more of them.  What – what is that relationship? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Ja.  I – I later realised that now Ms Phiri is – 
is the mother to Brian’s life partner. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is his life partner’s name? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry.  Mr Brian van Wyk? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What is Mr Brian van Wyk’s life partner’s 
10 
name? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  His life partner is Sipho Levy Phiri. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana how did you establish that 
information? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Of – of them? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the link – the link between Ms Phiri being 
the mother of Mr Sipho Phiri who was the life partner of Mr van Wyk. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  This – this information Chair it came – 
because every day will have its own thing to unfold – things unfold - 
more information.  I realised – what happened for me can realise that.  
20 
Can we go back to that one at a later stage so that I can refresh my 
mind on how – how … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How you established it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 148 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will make a note.  Alright then if we go over to 
page 12 of your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – but just to make sure one understands.  
You say Ms Phiri … 
MS BABADI SYBILTLATSANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the mother of a child or had a child with – with or 
was the mother of … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr Brian van Wyk’s life partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So he was the mother of … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mother–in-law. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr van Wyk’s – hm? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It is Mr van Wyk’s mother-in-law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I will – I will come back to that 
question about when you learnt that information; but we are in about 
page 12 paragraph 4.11 of your affidavit and as I understand it.  You 
did then take steps to have those two people – Mr Thabeng and 
Ms Phiri – added as members of your close corporation.  Is that 
correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana just so I am clear on the 
evidence you said he was indicated some urgency in getting that done.  
Is that right? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And let us just go back to Mr Kalisilira because 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 149 of 224 
 
he was the other person that he said needed to be appointed but as an 
accountant.  Did you then take steps to engage Mr Kalisilira? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  We – I – I met Mr Kalisilira – it seems 
that I do not remember the – the dates and the times but there was a 
meeting that was arranged there to – to meet Mr Kalisilira and be 
introduced to him that he would be the - the accountant – the auditor 
for the company and he is the one who would be doing our books 
because he is more conversant with the tax related issues since he – 
he used to work for – for SARS and he is familiar with the requirements 
of SA Express in doing the invoices and stuff like that, yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana just to orientate ourselves in time.  
That meeting that you had with Mr Kalisilira is that before or after you 
signed the contract between SA Express and Koreneka? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No it was before. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We will come to the contract.  I 
just wanted to get a position in time on that.  If you go over the page to 
page 13 of your affidavit.  You talk there about a new account that 
needed to be opened.  Tell us what happened around that. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair.  Koreneka Events Managers had a 
– had an account with Absa Bank and then Mr van Wyk advised us that 
20 
we go and open an account in FNB. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was that necessary? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I do not know.  There was no reason. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you agree then? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair to put you in the picture.  The General 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 150 of 224 
 
Manager of SA Express – Mr Brian van Wyk – is coming here to – from 
the beginning – to assist Koreneka to run smooth and with all the 
requirements he – he has taken me through with this process.  These 
are the expectations of SA Express and some of the things I would not 
ask or query.  I was believing Mr van Wyk with my life that a person of 
his calibre is going out of his way to assist Koreneka to be successful. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you thought that he was really assisting you 
and Koreneka to get the business and to be able to deliver properly? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  By then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, by – at that time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as a result of that you would not ask him some 
questions because you thought whatever he was saying or doing he 
was helping you …  
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your close corporation? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we move to paragraph 4.15 on page 
13 - 1-3 – you record there that you opened the FNB account in 
January 2015.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 151 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then the affidavit moves at paragraphs 14 
– sorry - 4.16 and 17 to the events in April 2015.  Can you tell us what 
first happens in that month? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  In April 2015 that was the time when 
Mr van Wyk was coming from the Department of Transport and he was – 
he was coming there and then he said should – should we meet so that 
I can sign the contract for Koreneka that I – that Koreneka entered into 
with SA Express. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you meet with him to do that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And where did you meet? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  In my office in the industrial site. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did he bring with him for you to sign? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  He – he brought some documents.  It 
was piles of papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A pack of documents? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you read them before you signed them? 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  With the trust that I had for him because he 
just came with the documents and then he told me that these are the 
contracts that you have to sign for – for you being awarded the – the 
project and I just signed.  He was telling me that I must initial every 
page and showed me where to sign at the back as well.  I did not go 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 152 of 224 
 
through them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana it is quite important for us to know 
whether you understood that you were signing or concluded one or two 
agreements and – and I want to just direct you to where my question 
arises from because at page 13 paragraph 4.17 … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You there say on 15 April 2015: 
“I attended to the signing of the contracts …” 
Plural. 
10 
“…with 
Mr van Wyk 
and 
then 
according 
to 
Mr van Wyk the contracts would be forwarded to the 
department of Community, Safety and Transport 
Management in the North West Province for their 
information and future use and that I would receive 
a copy thereof at a later stage.” 
If you then just jump down to 4.18 you say there: 
“I attach the ground handling agreements that I 
signed.” 
And you say they are attached as Annexures A1 and A2.  We 
20 
will go to them in a moment but I want to explain to you what my 
difficulty is.  I – I certainly can identify your signature on A1.  Let us go 
there.  A1 you will find at page 92 – 9-2 of the file in front of you.  That 
will be under the first tab … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 153 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that agreement is an agreement – who – 
who are the parties? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It is an agreement between SA Express and 
Koreneka Trading and Projects. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair that is the agreement we have been 
referring to as the Koreneka Agreement.  Ms Tlatsana I am going to 
refer to it similarly today.  We are going to call that the Koreneka 
Agreement, okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you go to page 1-0-9 on that agreement.  Can 
10 
you identify your signature on that page? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair.  There is my signature. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Under – on top of the line for Koreneka Trading 
and Projects trading as Koreneka Facilities management.  Is that 
correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when you signed it were the signatures 
above it on the page or not? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It was – by then it was the one on top. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had it already been signed before you signed 
20 
it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you identify any of – either of those 
signatures? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The one that I am talking about Chair? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 154 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The one that I am talking about? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you see on that page where it says witness 
one.  Can you see that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – do you know that signature? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose signature is it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It is for Mr Tebogo Brian van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there is another signature above where it says 
10 
South Africa Express Airways.  Do you see that signature? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I only had to know this signature … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Afterwards 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Two weeks back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  That it – it belongs to Mr Dave … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh whose signature is it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr Dave Allenby. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But at the time you signed this – this contract you did 
not know the signature? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No I did not know the signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did you ask at the time who signed here? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No.  Yes, he was saying that it is the CEO. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 155 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we go to the second agreement that 
you refer to which in your affidavit was referenced as A2.  You find that 
at page 1-2-1 and that agreement if you go through it right to its end at 
page 1-5-5 you will see that there is a part for signature there for the 
Head of Department of the Department of Community, Safety and 
Transport Management North West Province.  Do you see that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is – Chair in this version of the 
agreement which is the one that was presented in Ms Tlatsana’s High 
Court affidavit the – the following page is actually omitted but we have 
seen that in the evidence of Ms Phatudi this morning.  The next page is 
where SA Express countersigns it.  We can find that reference in a 
moment but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The point for importance now is Ms Tlatsana I 
do not see in this agreement any evidence that you signed this 
agreement.  Is that correct? 
20 
MS BABADI SYBIL TLATSAA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when you said in your affidavit you signed 
the contracts A1 and A2 that was incorrect? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The contracts I signed Chair because it was 
bundles – it was bundles of … 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 156 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether you signed one contract or you 
signed two contracts or you signed three contracts?  You were given a 
bundle of documents? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - and you signed? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes and I signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now to your knowledge did you sign one contract or 
more? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Why I said bundles Chair because Mr van Wyk 
says – said the other contract is going to go to the Department of 
10 
Transport.  The other one is going to go to SA Express and then the 
other one it – it will be with him that – that contract will be belonging to 
Koreneka Trading and Projects after all the signatures are being 
attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but try and cast your mind back to … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you signed … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On that occasion.  Do you know as a matter of fact 
whether you signed one contact which had an original version and 
copies – you signed copies of the same contract or you signed one 
contract only or you signed two contracts or three contracts with – with 
copies?  Do you know what the position is? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 157 of 224 
 
Did you check whether you were signing one contract or you 
were signing two contracts or you were signing a contract plus copies 
of the same contract? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair to be honest I do not remember.  I was 
just initialling and signing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  To be honest, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I do not (intervene). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not ask for a copy to – copies of whatever 
10 
you signed to remain with you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Because now the signatures were not 
complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were not complete, yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  So – yes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And I had to wait … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  For the one that I signed to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understand it you actually only got 
copies of the contract much later on in 2015.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Beginning of 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we are now in April 2015, right.  As I have it 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 158 of 224 
 
at page 13 it is on 15 April that you signed the documents that 
Mr van Wyk brought to you.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I also understand your testimony to be you had 
not taken time to read those contracts before signing them.  Is that 
correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what happens thereafter?  When do you 
commence work under the contract? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe before that.  You had been involved 
in businesses for some time.  Is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had had Koreneka for about seven years.  Is that 
right? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As in 2015? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had been involved in the business of delivering 
meat to hospitals … 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Through Koreneka … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had had another company or entity which you 
used in the construction industry is that correct? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 159 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you did appreciate – did you not – the 
importance of reading documents before you signed them? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair with my experience and – let me correct 
you – let me correct something here.  Koreneka was – had 
subcontracted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes in terms of which – which business? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  When we were delivering meat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a subcontractor? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes it was a subcontract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja for – who was the contractor?  Do you remember? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Oh my God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not worry if you do not remember.  Okay that is 
fine. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I do not remember because it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Quite back; and with the – with the – with 
doing the construction work we – we send out a bid.  We put all our 
20 
information there.  The only thing that we will be signing with the – with 
the – with the department – with construction is the JBB.  I think it is – 
it is four to five pages.  JBB is just – JBCC – it is just a small 
document. 
That is the one that we always sign to – after we have been 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 160 of 224 
 
awarded the work and then it would be attached into the tender 
document where the prices and everything are there, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the point you seek to make with reference to 
that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  So – no – Chair was saying and then I just 
signed without reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, no what – what I – what I meant was you were 
not new … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In doing business. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  So now I am asking you the question 
whether you understood the importance of reading documents before 
you signed them.  Was that you something you understood as a 
business person as somebody who was not new in business or you did 
not understand?  I just want to understand whether you understood the 
importance of reading documents and understanding them before 
signing them. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair with regard to the 
situation of Koreneka when – when we were signing the contract I was 
20 
told that we need to sign this contract because they have to go – 
because it was late.  It was at about four and Mr van Wyk had to run to 
– to come back to – to Johannesburg. 
It was late in the afternoon and then he asked me to – to sign 
and yes it was important for me to have read the document but now 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 161 of 224 
 
because of time and he will say that just sign these things and then you 
are going to get the document after you have signed.  I was asking him 
can I not have this document so that I can go through it. 
He said no, no it is not necessary.  Just be signing this thing 
- these documents because I am going to Johannesburg and I am 
avoiding to arrive late.  Driving in the night is not safe and then that 
document is going to come back to you after all the signatures are 
being attached and then you can have – you can go through that 
document on your own.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he – when he said that did you appreciate that 
10 
reading it after you have signed might not help if it was a document 
that you should not have signed? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair with the trust that I – I put on 
Mr van Wyk.  He – he was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not think there was any danger (intervenes)? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I – I never – I never thought Chair because of 
the journey that – that has been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The – the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Honest journey of I am here to assist you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  So that this thing can go well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what gave you some comfort that everything 
would be fine? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 162 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; but you knew the dangers of signing without 
reading? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just that you - you trusted him? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I trusted – I trusted Mr van Wyk Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you follow up after the 15 t h for a copy? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Immediately after the 15 t h it was – it was in a 
very short space of time because now the contract is being signed and 
now people have to go on training and then we have incept on 1 May.  
So it never rang a bell that I should demand for the contract by then 
because the on – on job … 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Mr van Wyk 
seemed 
to 
be 
delivering? 
 
Did 
Mr van Wyk seem to be delivering on his promises in terms of now you 
– your company – your close corporation was starting to train people 
for the business that it was going to be involved in? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes because there has to be a selection of … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  People who would be working.  So it was – it 
was in a very short space of time because now we were to look into 
other things for the smooth running of the project. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana without a copy of the contract how 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 163 of 224 
 
did you know what services you were going to be providing? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  That is a very good one.  I – according 
to the contract Mr van Wyk told me that was entailed in the contract is 
ground handling.  Ground handling is to get the – the staff who will be 
bringing in the bags for people from the flight in and out and the 
marshals that will be directing the – the flight. 
It was all the duties that are – okay I will not say all the 
duties.  Yes that what - he said that that is what is going to – to happen 
because those were the staff who were needed to go and do the job 
and then again he said there is an agreement – there is an agreement 
10 
that is entered into with the Department of Transport that the staff – the 
staff who has been there that was belonging to the Department of 
Public Works that were doing the cleaning and the gardening Koreneka 
will have to absorb that staff and they will be doing the cleaning and 
the gardening and everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it not worry you that you had approached SA 
Express wanting to sell an idea of – your idea of some business to do 
with them but as I understand your evidence now but now there were a 
lot of things that were happening and meetings that were happening 
where you were not involved and there was just somebody coming and 
20 
saying to you now this is what is happening. 
This is what is happening but you were not yourself involved 
in discussing with those people what was to happen. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair by then – by then it – it never came into 
my mind because the whole thing was let us just take – take the work 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 164 of 224 
 
and let us just go ahead with the work.  Now later is then now – when 
now all these things happens and then I begin to ask myself but why 
did I let this – how did this happen. 
You end up – I ended up asking myself but why did I allow 
this.  Even though – even though yes I was – I was persuading him to 
give me the contract because I need to know there are lots of work that 
we are doing and then are they in the contract.  He was saying yes you 
are being appointed now. 
Just be doing the work and that is why again I ended up 
approach the airport manager – the airport manager.  Mr van Wyk is 
10 
always not around.  When I tried to contact him he is not in.  He is 
never in anywhere.  Can you just give me the copies so that I can be 
acquaint with that we are doing?  Is it exactly what is in the contract? 
Mr van Wyk – Mr Malgadi confirmed that yes this is the agreement – 
this – these things are in the agreement Ms Tlatsana.  Koreneka has to 
do all those duties and to be doing the – the gardening in the airport, to 
be doing the cleaning in the airport but in any way for now I don’t have 
anything he only made me a copy of the Service Level Agreement the 
first page and the last page of the Service Level Agreement whilst I 
was waiting for him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also he had told you that this was going to be a 
big project or business. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m concerned that you signed lots of documents 
without reading them, you could have been handing over your company 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 165 of 224 
 
to him, your close corporation.   
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean Mr van Wyk I don’t know what he will come, 
what he will say when he comes here, but he might say he gave you the 
time to read, you knew exactly what you were signing.  He might say 
you are not new in business, you knew what you were signing, he might 
say you understand English perfectly.  He might say he would have had 
no reason not to give you a chance to read the documents if you 
wanted to read them, what would you say if he comes and says all of 
those things? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Chair Mr van Wyk came late to the – to my 
office, because I waited for him the whole day, he came late and he 
asked me to sign the document and he said these signatures are not 
complete, you have to complete the rest of the signatures but you to, to 
confirm to you that yes you are being appointed, sign these things 
because I have to go, it’s getting late, I have to go back to Jo’burg, and 
it is not safe for me to be driving in the evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he tell you why he couldn’t leave the documents 
with you and you would send them to him in due course after you’ve 
read them. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes he said he has to come to Jo’burg and 
complete the signatures because we are only left with the 12 days by 
then to start the business, to start with the flights at Pilanesberg, and 
then because Pilanesberg we started it in the 1 s t of May and then 
Mafikeng we started 1 s t of September. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 166 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Tlatsana just a follow up to that, I can 
understand if the start date is the 1 s t of May you have to get moving 
quickly, but why  is that not a reason for either leaving a copy of a 
contract with you or making sure that you’ve got enough time to read it 
and sign it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Like I just said Chair it would seem that the 
signatures are not complete, because it was only Mr LNB and my 
signature in the contract and then he said he’s driving down to Jo’burg, 
after he has gotten all the signatures he will surely bring back my 
contract, the contract for Koreneka back to Koreneka at some stage 
10 
and now when I was busy asking him of the contract he was always not 
– never anywhere.  For me it’s at the meeting that he has left it, it’s 
still with the Legal Department, it’s in my office, I will bring it, it was 
just so many stories about the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I must just say it just concerns me that you 
have an entity that you have put together and you sign documents that 
you haven’t read with somebody, how long had you known him by then 
when you signed, Mr van Wyk, how long had you known him? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   It’s not long Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What, a month, three months, six months? 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Seven months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About seven months. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I’m just responding, I’m not quite ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you been to his office? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, I’ve never been to his office. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 167 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Did you know where  he lived? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    No, I knew at a later stage when now there 
was a document that – which document – because that other day he 
said I should come and meet him in Jo’burg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I’m talking about at the time you signed these 
documents without reading them, did you know where he lived at that 
time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I don’t remember, I don’t know if it was 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You can’t remember whether you knew where he lived 
10 
at that time. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you subsequently get to know where he lived? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did you know any background about him at the 
time you signed these documents that he gave you without reading 
them? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    No Chair, Chair I trusted the General 
Manager for S A Express. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you didn’t know where he lived, you didn’t know 
20 
his background, and you didn’t know why he would be so keen to assist 
you and your company except that you just thought he must be helping, 
he must be committed to helping you I guess, is that right? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes Chair, I was just – he was there 
assisting and the belief, the trust, trusting this so much. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 168 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You didn’t think it prudent to talk to somebody else 
and get advice how to handle this so that you didn’t depend on him only 
in doing things about getting the business that you were getting. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The other thing it’s just Chair I don’t want to – 
because I told the Chairman ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Gobeni? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Mr Gobeni and the Premier knew that there 
is – I had this idea, I don’t think, I never thought that maybe he could 
mess-up in between because these are prominent people, if something 
that is in the office of Premier, the office I am talking the Province of 
10 
the Premier, no one can jeopardise that and ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the Premier had never returned your calls 
and you tried many times.        
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes, I’m saying this in a sense that that trust 
that I had with him ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was based on that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes I was just relaxed that you know he’s 
definitely not, because immediately after I signed this and then there 
was no this election of people and everything was just now moving fast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, no that’s fine, I just wanted to try and 
20 
understand that part of signing documents without the chance to read 
them and understand them, but yes, you trusted Mr van Wyk, that’s the 
– that is what drove you to sign without reading. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 169 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Tlatsana I would like to follow up just on 
one question in relation to the extent of that trust, because as I 
understood your testimony a moment ago you indicated, and you will 
correct me if I’m wrong, if my understanding is incorrect, you said one 
of the reasons you were given for why you had to rush and weren’t able 
to read it before you signed was because you needed to take it back to 
Johannesburg for other signatures, did I understand you correctly? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     You see Ms Tlatsana the difficulty I have with 
that, and I must put it to you so that you can answer it, is the only 
10 
contact that involved Koreneka is the contract we’re calling the 
Koreneka agreement, correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:       And we looked at the signature page a 
moment ago, it’s at page 109 of the bundle in front of you, and you told 
us that the signatures were already there for South African Express at 
the time that you signed.  Now if that’s so why didn’t you question him 
and say but the signature is already here, what do you have to take it 
back to Johannesburg for? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   It was only Mr – it was only the CEO’s 
20 
signature, his was not there and there were no witnesses. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes, but the relevant signature for legal 
purposes is the signature of the CEO, did he give you a different 
understanding?   
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes, the signature of the CEO was there yes 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 170 of 224 
 
and I attached mine and then he had to wait and get the witnesses 
because he was saying that he will get the witnesses from S A Express 
there because in the office there was no one there, I was just alone in 
the office, because it was late, everybody has gone home. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     He never got other signatures did he, you 
can see on that page? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    No I saw this after seven months. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     So was he specific to saying witnesses 
needed to sign? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Was he? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did he specifically say witnesses needed to 
sign? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     What would they be witnesses if they weren’t 
with you when you signed? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Especially he was talking about witnesses for 
S A Express, because me I just signed and I was alone in the office 
because it was already late. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Tlatsana if we can then, I did have another 
follow-up question, just in relation to what you understood, so we were 
20 
going through what – despite you not having a contract you understood 
you would be doing, right, and I understand your testimony to be you 
would be doing ground handling which was moving people in and out 
and there was certain cleaning and gardening services you would need 
to take over, is that correct?  
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 171 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Was that communicated to you on that 15 t h of 
April when you signed? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No, not on the – the gardening not on the 15 t h 
of April when I signed.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     So on the 15 t h you were just told about 
ground handling, is that right? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   I was just told about signing the contract.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But what were you signing to do then?    
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes, to do, yes so the called ground handling 
10 
at the airport and there was going to be other jobs that I will be doing 
which that document that information that is entailed will be given to 
us, I think he was talking referring to this, the SLA agreement which I 
never got it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And how were you going to be paid?     
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I didn’t know the format, the amount that we 
were going to be paid, all I know is this project was going to be huge, 
and with me in my head the payment was going to be for the work that 
we were to be doing of the ground handling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying you were signing an agreement 
20 
with S A Express to do work, that is your close corporation, to perform 
work and you didn’t know what you would charge for the work.  In other 
words did you know what the agreement was as to how you would be 
paid as – how your company, your close corporation would be paid for 
this ground handling work, and at what rate it would charge? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 172 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Chair I didn’t know how much the company 
was going to be paid for the work that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You didn’t even ask him, Mr van Wyk, leaving aside 
the question of what may have been written in the contract, did you not 
ask him to say okay now you have brought an agreement you want me 
to sign, now you mean I’m binding my company, I’m binding my close 
corporation to say it will do this work but I don’t know what it will be 
paid and how, at what rate it will be paid and how I am supposed to 
charge, did you then ask him how am I going to charge, what is the rate 
that we are agreeing upon? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Okay, the explanation that I remember was 
the staff that would be doing the work and an extra 10% for the work 
that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry just repeat that, the staff that will be doing 
...(intervention)   
MS BABADI TLASANA:   All the staff that were to be doing the work of 
the ground handling, Koreneka is going to pay them and plus the 10% 
added on top for the administration purposes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you talk about what Koreneka would be 
the workers, its workers, or the workers who would do the work I want 
20 
to find out whether you say, you are saying you signed a contract that 
Mr van Wyk gave you, which was saying your close corporation would 
do the ground handling work without knowing how you would be paid, 
how your close corporation will be paid and would charge for that work. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Chair my apologies for this, let me just go a 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 173 of 224 
 
little bit backward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you want to go back a little bit. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    With regard to the charging I – it was that 
the people that are going to be doing the work in the office, I’m sorry if 
maybe I’m not understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, I’m just listening, I want to understand 
you see when one reads your statement, or at least when I read it, one 
gets the impression that you may have been taken advantage of, okay, 
but I am enquiring so that I understand whether that is the position 
indeed or whether it is not the position, okay. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, I think I mentioned this earlier on 
that you know when you – when you get a contract because things 
would be sleeping, when you get a contract I was just so excited for 
yes thank you, we’ve got this work and then I signed the contract, and 
inside the contract I knew that because there were staff that was going 
to be appointed to be doing the practical job on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no we will come to that, my question is did you 
sign a contract that your company, your close corporation would do the 
ground handling work, would employ people and do the ground handling 
work without knowing what your company would be paid by S A 
20 
Express. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair because Mr van Wyk said the 
layout of the payment for the work that I am going to do is going to be 
sent at a later stage, so that I would know how much would I be paid 
and I didn’t – me I never even expected the other amounts, I was 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 174 of 224 
 
knowing that maybe it could be just to run and to be taking care of. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
what 
did 
you 
think 
would 
happen 
if 
...(intervention)  
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Come again Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you think would happen if when the what 
you call layout came later on and it reflected that the money that your 
company would be paid was so low that you would not be able to pay 
the staff that would do the work. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I don’t know how to answer that one Chair 
but yes it’s an honest question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if I decide that I want the owners of this 
building to give me a contract to clean this hall every morning before I 
can see an agreement with them I need to have an idea how many 
workers I am going to need to do this work and have an idea how much 
I am going to need to pay them and have an idea how much profit I will 
also have, and have an idea what other expenses I will need to incur so 
that then when I negotiate with the owner of this building to say they 
must give me a cleaning contract for to clean here every morning then I 
can say to them I won’t agree to a contract if what you will pay my 
company is less than this amount per hour, per day or whatever.  Do 
20 
you understand that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I do understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because if I don’t do that I just sign I might find that 
I need ten workers to work here, but the money that they give me is not 
even enough to pay five workers and then I don’t get anything myself.   
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 175 of 224 
 
You understand that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So now I am trying to understand how you could sign 
and agree sign a contract to provide work without even knowing how 
much you would charge for the work that you were going to do.  What if 
S A Express was going to give you a small amount of money that would 
not enable you to pay workers and you would not make profit yourself 
so you end up just working and you gain nothing.  I would have thought 
that as a business person that would be uppermost in your mind, you 
would say no I don’t want to work nothing, I must make a profit that’s 
10 
why I’ve got a business, that’s why I have a company to run a business, 
I am here for a business, I must be able to pay my staff, I must be able 
after I have paid my staff and all my expenses have money to myself.   
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Okay yes Chair I think that one now I am 
getting a little bit there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand now? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Ja, I’m betting a little bit light because no 
one would work for free. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair in the beginning Mr van Wyk when 
20 
he was saying that I should bring these two people into the company he 
was saying that this project is going to be big and big in a sense that it 
could be millions and whatever, even though he didn’t specify how 
much – to me he didn’t specify how much but if now he says big in and 
millions and again when I look at the number of staff that will be doing 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 176 of 224 
 
the ground handling as well as the taking of language I think there were 
five or seven per airport, seven for Pilanesberg, seven for that, there 
was going to be enough money for ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You thought that whatever happens he was talking big 
amounts. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Millions, therefore you would still have some money, 
after paying the staff.   
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes there would still be money at least Rand 
for phone and for fuel and stuff, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and you trusted that what he had told you was in 
the documents that you signed? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes that was what was in my mind because I 
mistakenly I signed the documents, not mistakenly yes I signed the 
documents, it was late and he was saying that the document is going to 
come back to me, I was thinking if the document is going to become we 
start the work and after that, after he left the following week, because I 
think it was on Thursday/Friday, the following week now it was the staff 
to be put into, to be arranged the uniforms and all this, everything was 
just moving very fast Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Tlatsana we then need to go to when your 
work commenced at the airports, when was that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    The work commenced on the 1 s t May 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And was in respect of both airports?     
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 177 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     So which airport was that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Pilanesberg started on the 1 s t of May. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And when did Mafikeng start?   
MS BABADI TLASANA:   It started 1 s t September. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Of the same year, of 2015? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    2015  yes ma’am, yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And now can I just understand in that whole 
period up until early 2016 you never had a copy of the contract? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   No I never had a copy of the contract Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did you first ask for one?       
MS BABADI TLASANA:   I’ve always been asking for a copy of the 
contract, but there will always be excuses.  I’ve always wanted it, but 
... 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you started on the dates that you have given 
...(intervention)  
MS BABADI TLASANA: Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you already signed the contract or had you 
already signed this batch of documents that Mr van Wyk gave you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   So just for the chronology I have it that you 
signed on the 15 t h of April, is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You started at Pilanesberg on the 1 s t of May, 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 178 of 224 
 
is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     And you started at Mafeking on the 1 s t of 
September. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Before commencing both of those bits of work 
had you asked for the contract? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   I’ve always been asking for the contract 
Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Is there a record of that in writing? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No I would pick up the call, when are you 
coming, or when are we receiving the contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Okay I would then like us to go to page 15 of 
your affidavit, 15, because I want to now start talking about the 
payments and the money, what came into your account and what went 
out of your account, and Chair and Ms Tlatsana what I propose we do is 
we track it through your affidavit and then we will take a look at the 
diagrams just so that we can get a sense of how it all plays out, with 
your leave Chair we will proceed on that basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, that’s fine, I didn’t mention to you but I think 
20 
we will take a break at six. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Let’s start with the first payment that 
Koreneka received Ms Tlatsana, you will see that at page 15, and it’s 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 179 of 224 
 
paragraph 4.27, right.  You record there in your affidavit on 6 May 2015 
an amount of R8.5million was received by the first respondent, just for 
reference purposes Chair that is Koreneka in the litigation, from S A 
Express: 
“As set out above is a part payment in respect of ground 
handling services to be executed by the first respondent which 
is Koreneka.” 
That part payment Ms Tlatsana I suggest to you is a product of what 
you later understood to be the agreement, because as at the 6 t h of May 
you don’t have a contract yet do you? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   I never had a contract. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     But were you aware that R8.5million came 
into the bank account of Koreneka? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:     Okay who was going to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr, bearing in mind that you had 
not been able, you had not read the contract when you signed it.  
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you know whether there was to be any money – 
did you know when payment would be done to Koreneka and what would 
20 
need to happen before payment was done, did you know any of those 
things from being told by Mr van Wyk maybe? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    No Chair I didn’t know that there was going 
to be this flow of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you, what was your understanding of what, of 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 180 of 224 
 
when you would be paid and what may have needed to be done in order 
for you to be paid? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   My understanding and my experience is to be 
paid after the work is done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the work had been done? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would put in an invoice that was your 
understanding? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did you enquire about how you would put in 
this invoices and what the process would be? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I didn’t enquire Chair because the 
accountant was already appointed doing all these invoices. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Did you check with him that he was invoicing? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   I didn’t check with him because they were 
telling that we will have monthly meetings and then when you come for 
monthly meetings all these will in files and then I will be able to see 
what has happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When did the accountant start working?  
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    He started working the 1 s t of May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:    1 s t of May 2015.  
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And was he working full time for your close 
corporation or was he having his own offices and he was taking care of 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 181 of 224 
 
the business without being an employee of the company, do you know? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  He was working from his office in Jo’burg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, so he was based in Jo’burg? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And had you met him by the time of this payment of 
R8.5million? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I met him before, not with the time of 
R8million, because they were the ones doing the invoices, I have never 
done any invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but had you met him, did you know him face to 
10 
face?    
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By this time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, had you met – how many times had you met 
him, more or less?  
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Twice? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and Ms Phiri had also started being a member 
20 
of the – being registered by this time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Thabeng had he also been registered 
...(intervention)  
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 182 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a member of the close corporation? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Just flowing from the Chair’s question before 
we get to the payments were you in contact with Mr Phiri and Mr 
Thabeng to set up meetings about the management of the close 
corporation? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did you ever contact them about that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    Mr van Wyk indicated that it is not necessary 
10 
for them it would be best if it’s me and Mr Calisillera with his 
assistance to come and see if things were going well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did your close corporation have an office from where 
it operated? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where was the office?    
MS BABADI TLASANA:  In the NWDC Industrial site in Mafeking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you were based where the documents of the 
office were kept?   
MS BABADI TLASANA:   The documents of the – most of the 
20 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the company. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  ...documents of the office were kept with the 
Airport Manager, with me it was just some information and reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but I’m now referring to the period before you 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 183 of 224 
 
got into a contract with S A Express, is that – is the office the place 
where you used to keep company documents? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and then when you had this contract with S A 
Express did that change? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not change. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    No it did not change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And Ms Tlatsana when Mr van Wyk said to you 
10 
that Ms Phiri and Mr Thabeng didn’t need to play a role in the close 
corporation and its running did you raise with him then why he said to 
you that they would be useful for the smooth running of the business? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And then he later explained Chair that it would 
be improper for them because they’ve got the work that they are doing, 
and by then I didn’t just take it into consideration because I know that 
where Mr Thabeng is, I met with him in his office, and Ms Phiri I met 
her at her house and now because that was the information that Mr van 
Wyk was giving I just thought okay it’s fine I will do the work. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Chair I see we’re at six o’clock. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let’s take ten minutes, is ten minutes fine?  We 
will take a ten minutes break, Ms Tlatsana if its fine with you we would 
like to proceed at least until, maybe until seven, is that fine with you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:    I have asked for a lift, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so, maybe during the tea break you can 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 184 of 224 
 
talk to whoever and let’s see whether that would be fine. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take a ten minute adjournment.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS     
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Tlatsan, is 7 o’clock fine with you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Ms Hofmeyr, we spoke about working 
into the evening. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I did have in mind that I could go up to 19h00 but 
I didn’t exclude the possibility of going beyond that if need be.  If it 
was necessary but I think that probably we should stop at 19h00. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, I think that would be appropriate.  I also 
know that a number of the persons who are attending for the to watch 
the evidence particularly legal representatives also of Ms Phatudi who 
20 
was implicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Many of them have indicated to me over the 
break that they actually have to travel back to Mafikeng tonight.  So I 
think in that context 7 o’clock is probably the outer limit for many of 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 185 of 224 
 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that’s fine even though I don’t guarantee 
that in the future we won’t go beyond 19h00. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There’s no- no we certainly wouldn’t hold you 
to it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for today we for this evening we’ll stop at 19h00.  
Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that we probably haven’t made as much 
progress as you were hoping for. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so I guess we will talk just before 19h00 about 
what the way forward. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair.  Ms Tlatsana, we were page 
15 of your affidavit and were starting to deal with payments and money 
and what came in and what went out.  And we were at paragraph 4.27 
where you record in the affidavit that on the 6 t h of May an amount 8.5 
million came into the Koreneka bank account, correct? 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just ask at this point, who had control of 
the Koreneka bank account?  Who was able to authorise payments out 
of the account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It was Mr David Kalisilira, Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 186 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now him alone or him with you or what was the 
arrangement? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  He was doing the invoices Chair and he was 
paying the salaries.  And I was checking on the statement through the 
phone for every transaction.  If there will be something the agreement 
was if there would be something beyond that at least if I would be told 
that this is going to happen at least if I could have information about 
that and an invoice that’s how we were working, yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana, just to be a little bit more precise 
maybe on my part.  What I’m wanting to understand is who could 
10 
transact from the FNB account that you opened for the company?  Who 
could put in the password to make the payment go out? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It’s Mr David Kalisilira, Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And could he do that without you also being 
involved in authorising the payment? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Like I say Chair, the agreement was for every 
transaction if they let me know I would know that R 200 has to go for 
payment for this and for payment for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe if we can start a little earlier.  For purposes of 
opening this FNB account. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you go to an FNB branch to open the account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 187 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alone or with somebody? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  With the two partners. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Phiri and. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr Thabeng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you signed some documents for purpose of 
opening the account at FNB? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they also sign? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you- were you all three signatures to the account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood the position- or let me ask this, 
was there a cheque account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, it was a cheque account sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order to make out a cheque, was one signature of 
any one of the three of you sufficient or did it have to be two people or 
three people to sign it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, it had- we have to be two Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Any two of you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, any two of us Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the position not that your signature had always 
to be there then it could either be one of the other two but yours had to 
be there, was that not the case? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 188 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  In the documents, yes Chair it was either one 
of us but now the payments we were not using the cheque. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It was an EFT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that’ fine I’ll come there.  So but in terms of what 
was signed, your understanding was that if the two of them signed 
alone and you are not there, there cheques would be good enough?  It 
could be paid? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and if you signed with any one of the two of them 
10 
that cheques would be fine? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say that you were using EFT to transact. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I think Ms Hofmeyr can take it from there but 
you can explain what you want to explain. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, the account is a cheque account 
but we didn’t have the cheque book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Yes no you didn’t have a cheque book but 
it was a cheque account. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for purposes of transacting on the account, two 
signatures were necessary if it was something to be signed. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, there was never anything to be signed 
Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 189 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was never anything to be signed? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So everything was EFT? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in that case you just needed to know the pin 
number and then you could transact? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you give those pin details to Mr 
Kalisilira? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just to go back to my earlier question, did 
that mean that he could make an EFT payment?  I’m talking now not in 
terms of what agreement you might have had with him but the 
mechanics of it.  Could he go onto the bank account of Koreneka? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And could he using the pin or the password 
himself make payments out of the account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was he the only other person you gave 
20 
those bank details to? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, it was only him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does that also mean it wasn’t given to Ms Phiri 
or Mr Thabeng? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, because they were never.  No, they were 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 190 of 224 
 
never in the office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just to be clear, you could go on to the 
account, could you and make payments?   
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, I couldn’t go into the account and make 
payments.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why not? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why not? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It was the responsibility of Mr Kalisilira.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So even if you wanted to, you could not.  You were 
not allowed? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair because according to Mr van Wyk 
because he was in that day, all these monies that are coming in is for 
the purpose of salaries otherwise the rest is going to be for the 
purchase of the fire truck and the cameras in the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you keep your ABSA bank account of the close 
corporation? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this was an additional account, you didn’t close 
the ABSA account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, I didn’t close it because when we were 
20 
opening- we were there to adjust to bring members it has some funds in 
it and I have not closed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So but what you are saying is you understood 
the arrangement that you entered into to entail that you were not 
allowed to or into the account and make any payments? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 191 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just to probe once more the difference 
between what your agreement was and what you could actually do 
independent of the agreement, I just want to get clarity on that.  I 
understand your testimony to be the agreement was Mr Kalisiliria would 
do all of the payments, correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But as a matter of fact could you yourself go 
onto the account on the internet and make an EFT payment? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why not? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The responsibility it’s all with Mr Kalisiliria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The responsibility it’s with Mr Kalisiliria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, we understand that.  Ms Hofmeyr said she 
understands what the arrangement was. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But what she’s asking is, suppose that you 
decided that you know what let me check whether there is still money in 
this account.  Could or you say you decided this is my company, I want 
20 
to pay my workers myself, I want to take some money and pays my 
workers myself or if you decided to do whatever even though the money 
might have been for the payment of workers.  If you decided look I need 
some money, there is still two weeks before I have to pay the workers.  
Let me take this money and use it for the business and then I will get 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 192 of 224 
 
another money and put it back.  Is there anything that would have 
prevented you from actually doing that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair, nothing would have prevented me from 
doing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You knew all the information you needed to 
know to do that. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you knew exactly what to do? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you considered yourself- you just respected the 
10 
arrangement that was made? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr, does that help? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair, I’m indebted to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we go back to page 15 paragraph 4.27 so 
you’ve started work- sorry just to orientate ourselves chronologically.  
Work commences on the 1 s t of May 2015, correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And on the 6 t h of May an amount of 8.5 million 
20 
comes into the account of Koreneka, correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you notified of that amount coming into 
the account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  At first I was not notified, Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 193 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So how did you establish that that had come 
into the account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I realised in my phone when it was ringing that 
there’s money that just entered into the account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you did receive a notification when it comes 
in? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was on your phone? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is it an SMS or some such notification? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, the notification and SMS.  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay because then if we go to the next 
paragraph 4.28 you there start to talk about the first amounts that go 
out of the account.  As I have there you say, on 7 May I was notified of 
a payment of 2 million rand by way of SMS notification via my phone 
from FNB that it had been transferred from and I’m reading in for first 
respond in Koreneka’s account, is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you know what that payment was for? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The response that I was told by Mr van Wyk 
20 
that there is going to be money that is going to go out that are going to 
do the repairs in the airports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What repairs? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I didn’t know what was broken in the airports, 
Chair.  But he said they they are going to do the airports because 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 194 of 224 
 
they’ve long been standing without being used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What has been standing without being used? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The buildings, the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, and now there were supposed to be some 
repairs that are going to be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you understand part of the job that had been 
given or your close corporation had been given as including doing 
repairs to the building? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  My knowledge is a contractor, building 
10 
contractor.  Repair would in my knowledge would mean if the wall is 
broken, you’ll fix.  If the light is not working, you will fix.  If the door is 
not working, you will fix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you talking 2 million here. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you- was your understanding that the contract 
or the agreement that your close corporation had with SA Express 
included that you must repair the walls in the building? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair, I didn’t know even though Mr 
Bakhaki(?) told me that yes, it’s part of the work that I will be doing, 
20 
the airport manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is somebody other than Mr van Wyk who told you 
that? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 195 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the name of the airport manager? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr Bakhaki. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He’s the one who told you that part of your 
responsibilities is to repair the building. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this on the occasion or around the time that 
there was this money that went out of your companies account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, because I would ask and then I’ll 
be told relax your mind we are repairing we are fixing the airports. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you ever ask to see where the repairs was 
supposed to be done on the walls of the airport? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I wouldn’t, by then Chair I didn’t even go to 
the airports to go and see those repairs because Mr Brian would tell me 
that Babadi if everything ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s Mr van Wyk. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It’s Mr van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just want to make sure that the transcript doesn’t 
reflect that it’s somebody else.  Mr Brian is somebody else, it’s Mr van 
Wyk. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Everything is going well, people are there, 
people are working, people are doing the work.  Just relax everything is 
going accordingly. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 196 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you would not go to inspect the damage on the 
walls of the airport building that were to be repaired or the roof or 
whatever was damaged that needed to be repaired? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair, because I would want to do the- 
remember I would want to do the work now he would say, no no you are 
a big man now.  Young people, small people are the ones who have to 
do this construction work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s what Mr van Wyk said to you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Said you don’t need to bother about this other things 
10 
other people working for you would need would take care of them? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how many workers did Koreneka employee as at 
this time around the 6 7 8 t h May, how many workers were employed by 
Koreneka? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I’m not quite sure of the number but I think if 
you can look into the bank statements we can see how many people 
were paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but give me an estimate.  About 10, about 20, 
about 100? 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, less maybe 20 25 people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe 20 25. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to what airport? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, with regard to Pilanesberg airport. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 197 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pilanesberg, ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and they were all people who were working on 
to process the passenger were checking in and so on? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, there was that were doing the ground-
handling, they were about seven.  And then the other number is of the 
cleaners and the gardeners. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And were you surprised that such a big 
10 
account had gone into your account 8 million rand on the 6 t h- 8.5 
million rand on the 6 t h of May in circumstances where you had not even 
finished a month doing this work.  Your company had not even finished 
a month doing this work? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, I asked Chair and Mr van Wyk explained 
that is the pre-payment of the work that needs to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understood that that pre-payment would take 
would cover what period?  One month, two months, three months or did 
20 
you know how much that was supposed to cover? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The pre-payment, the whole amount was to be 
allocated for a period of a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, so now this is a portion of the money that 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 198 of 224 
 
is being paid out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the amount that the whole amount that you 
understood to was meant to be paid to your company as at this time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, according to the contract that Koreneka 
entered into because there’s version Mr van Wyk said.  The first year 
was to be 50 51. something million, the second year 31 31.  Those were 
the amounts that were there but I didn’t have a document hence Mr 
Bakhaki ended up giving me the layout of the monies to be paid for 
during that work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was that information that you knew as at May 
10 
2015, ja 2015.  The information of how you work your company was 
your close corporation was going to be paid?  Is that what you knew at 
that time or is it what you know now but that you didn’t know at that 
time? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, I knew at that time because now I was told 
that no no, this 8.5 this is the first part payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Of the whole amount for both airports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, because we started first with Pilanesberg 
20 
and then Mafikeng at a later stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then as I have it at the bottom of page 15 
paragraph 4.28 you have a 2 million go out notification.  Did you 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 199 of 224 
 
contact Mr van Wyk shortly after that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair, because he in the spirit of helping 
me he was saying that day, you all need to know the money that is 
coming in and the money that is going in so that I should be informing 
him with all these transactions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you turn over the page to page 16 your 
... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry ne, I’m sorry Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to tie up something that relates to a question I 
10 
asked much earlier. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The arrangement that you had with Mr van Wyk and 
the accountant, would it be correct to say it would have allowed or it 
could have allowed the accountant to transfer all the money your close 
corporations account out and transfer it somewhere and you would only 
know after the event, after that had happened? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Then no, that I know because for every 
transaction I would for every transaction I would know and any money 
that is above 5 million, I would know the bank would confirm if I’ve got 
20 
an idea about then I will tell them I didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So but if it was less than 5 million would the position 
be that he could the arrangement you had with him and with Mr van 
Wyk could have allowed him to transfer a few millions not more than 5 
million out of your account and you would only know after the transfer 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 200 of 224 
 
has happened? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The arrangement was for every transaction I 
would know Chair.  If there was going to be any transaction, I would 
know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the arrangement that he had to speak to you 
before taking out any money transferring any money and amount?  Or 
was there a limit to say if it’s an amount that is not more than X, then 
he didn’t need to talk to you beforehand but if it was going to be above 
a certain amount, he needed to speak to you first? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The person who was talking to me with regard 
10 
to the transactions was Mr van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but even with him was the arrangement that the 
accountant could transfer money out without first talking to you if it was 
not above a certain amount. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  That time I have never experienced that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your discussion did not include that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Every transaction that goes out, I would know.  
They would inform me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I want you to distinguish between getting 
knowledge by way of an SMS notification from the bank. 
20 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is after the transfer had happened as I 
understand the position and a position where he would speak to you 
first and say I need to transfer such and such an amount for this 
purpose.  I want you to distinguish between the two.  You understand? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 201 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between when was he required to speak to you first 
before transferring money out of the account or did he not have to 
speak to you first? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  He would inform he would definitely need to 
inform me that this kind of money is going out but the most person that 
was talking was Mr van Wyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but did the arrangement made with him and Mr 
van Wyk. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, was to talk to me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of that arrangement was he always required 
to speak to you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or irrespective or how much the amount was? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  But if he chose, if he were to decide 
not to speak to you, there’s nothing that would have prevented him from 
transferring any amount as long as it was not above 5 million? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, I’m indebted and I would like to just go 
back to page 15 because I do think there in the impression that’s creatd 
in paragraph 4.28 is probably not consistent Ms Tlatsana with the 
evidence you’ve given because if you read paragraph 4.28 on page 15 
you’ll see it says there the first payment of 8.5 million was made on 6 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 202 of 224 
 
May 2015.  On 7 May 2015, I was notified of a payment of 2 million by 
way of SMS notification via my phone from FNB that had been 
transferred from the Koreneka account.  With respect, if I read that it’s 
suggesting to me that you only find out after the payment has been 
effected.  But I understand from your evidence now and I’d like your 
comment if I misunderstanding it.  You said no, you’d need to be 
contacted by Mr van Wyk before the payment and can I take it then that 
you were contacted before this 2 million rand went out on the 7 t h of May 
and you were told by him what it was for? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Maybe I misunderstood the English, Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sure. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  My apologies with my little grammar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It’s fine. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  My apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, feel free. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair, the agreement was for every 
transaction I should know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Beforehand? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Beforehand? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the transaction is effected? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  For every transaction I have to know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, beforehand. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 203 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And now according to the statements yes, it’s 
correct this payment was made and then I was informed at a later stage 
that it was for the repairs of the airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So when the transfer happened you had not- 
nobody had spoken to you about it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there was a second payment on the 
well, a series of further payments on the 7 t h of May.  If you go to page 
10 
16 and you pick it up at paragraph 4.31 you’ll see there that there were 
transfers of payments as I have it that go out on that same day, is that 
correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you can tell us what those amounts 
were? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  According to my statement to the statement of 
Koreneka that I went through, I found out that these transactions were 
paid to PJ Papites(?) in 600 000, 700 000, 320 000, 320 000. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just as a correction there, I think its 660 000, 
20 
is that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Oh yes, 660 000.  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When did you establish to whom it was paid? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Notification Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SMS notification from the bank? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 204 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who was Mr Papites? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I don’t know Mr Papites, Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you enquire from Mr van Wyk? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, I enquire from him and then he said Mr 
Papites is the one who’s going to do the repairs at the airport, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just try and remember now because this is important.  
Did he speak to you on the basis that this person was being paid before 
doing the repairs?  In other words, did he speak on the basis that he 
10 
was still going to do the repairs, not that he had done them?  If you are 
able to remember what he said. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Because I - I have – because I was not and I 
have not been at Pilanesberg Airport … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And then he said this Mr Peters there is going 
to be money that is going to be paid to Mr Peters … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Who is doing the repairs at Pilanesberg 
Airport. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So he – he was like he was already doing 
them or so? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  He was doing his work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 205 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well you just said you had not – you had not 
been to Pilanesberg.  I just want to check.  You mean whether you 
mean you had not been there to check repairs or whatever or you mean 
you had not been there at all? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, no to check the – the work that was being 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  No that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you ever go and check if the repairs had 
been done? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did – did you go to the airport at all? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair – no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At no point? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No - for 2015 no.  I have never been to – to 
Pilanesberg Airport. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you did not feel it necessary to go and 
check that was being told to you about what was being done there was 
accurate? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr van Wyk was telling me to – to relax and 
then they are doing the work and because of this my trust I believed 
20 
him that there could not be – there could be no cheating or any 
misinterpretation (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why – why did you have to - why did you have to 
listen to him so much?  It is your company.  A lot of money went into 
your account – your company’s account – your close corporation’s 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 206 of 224 
 
account.  One day – same day – a lot of money is taken out and it is – 
it is going to somebody that you do not know.  You have been told 
about repairs. 
You have not seen these repairs.  You have not seen what is 
damaged and somebody is going to be paid a lot of money and from 
what you are told that person has not even finished the repairs.  Maybe 
he is still busy with them but he has already been paid a lot of money.  
All of this – did not all of this suggest to you no, no, no.  Let me go and 
see exactly what is happening. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair in 2015 when all this things were – were 
10 
going on like you seeing here the transaction was made on the 6 t h and 
then again the other one on the 7 t h.  When all these things were going 
on Chair it was very fast and – and in my – in my mind Chair where I 
was sitting was – you know – I could understand that the airports were 
being there for a very long time and yes maybe they doing these jobs 
quick, quick so that because the flights are already on.  They have 
already started. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why do you not want to go and see?  Your 
company – you are the person who came up with the idea that North 
West must have aeroplanes coming in.  There must be flights to North 
20 
West.  Now flights have started.  You have done something quite big for 
the province, the Premiers, the MECs, business people are now able to 
fly out of Pilanesberg, Mafikeng Airport come back. 
You have made such a big impact.  Now you do not even want 
to go and see where this work is being done and you get a lot of 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 207 of 224 
 
money.  You only have about 20 – did you say about 20 employees? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You only have about 20 employees.  You have not 
even finished working for a month.  Suddenly there is R8 million coming 
into your account.  You have not prepared any invoice for this money 
and same day R2 million is taken out.  It is taken out and paid to 
somebody that you do not know. 
You ask and you are told the person is doing repairs.  You do 
not want to go and check these repairs.  What is wrong with this 
building that requires so much money that is paid out so quickly?  Is 
10 
that not strange? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair Mr van Wyk was telling me that Babadi 
you need to sit back and relax. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is your company. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr van Wyk is not even part of the company. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  The other reason that he was giving was by 
the way Babadi you should always remember if you are busy moving 
making rounds at the airports you should remember that this work 
initially it was – they wanted – there were other big companies that 
20 
were contesting with you. 
You just got this because of – you are a woman because by 
then women were considered to do the work and you are – just sit back 
and then we will be doing all this work for you.  I was – I was 
inquisitive Chair but now because he was saying that sit back and 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 208 of 224 
 
relax.  I would believe him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No that is fine but I – I do want you to 
understand why I ask you these questions … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the Commission is looking to issues of 
corruption … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your statement suggests that certain people did 
wrong things and – and you did not know or you and you suggest you 
may have been taken advantage of, okay. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is important that I should understand what 
happened.  So – so that is why I ask you these questions so that I can 
understand. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana four days later another R2 million 
– as I have it from your affidavit – goes out.  Let us go to that.  It is 
20 
now at page 17 and it is at the top of that page at paragraph 4.34.  
Where did that payment go? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes.  It was a – according to the statement it 
was movement and finance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What inquiries did you make about that? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 209 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I made inquiries about movement and finance 
and then – yes – Mr van Wyk said – what did he say?  He just said – 
Chair I forgot what he said by then to me.  To be honest I forget what 
he said about this movement and finance. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is – it is just by now it is five days since the 
8.5 million has come into the account and as I have the calculation six 
million had now left the account.  Did that cause you concern? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair because the information that I got was 
to fix the airports and – and an airport is not like a house – my own 
house that I could say I will take some small money and go and repair 
10 
it.  An airport is a big building and out of the history that we know of 
erstwhile Bophuthatswana and now new South Africa it means that 
these buildings have been standing for a very, very, very long time that 
it would quantify that these millions definitely they will be doing the 
repairs. 
With my – with my experience of construction it – it would be 
possible yes that yes these hall – I can repair this hall for seven million 
for example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As at this time namely around 8 May/14 May 
thereabout about how long before these dates had you last been at 
20 
Pilanesberg Airport - Pilanesberg? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I – I begin to be in Pilanesberg Chair when 
now I took over the – the business. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 210 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  When I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You began to? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  That is when I began to – to go to 
Pilanesberg.  It was beginning 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, early in 2016? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  When you were there had you taken the time 
to look at the building?  Did you see much need for repairs and so on? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I did not see any – anything – anything that 
10 
was to be repaired there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Or being repaired … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Because there was another area that was old 
and the old things were being dumped – dumped there because I 
remember when I was having an idea of these airports have got 
cafeterias, shops … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Where they were selling teas and what.  The 
20 
one in Pilanesberg was – was so old that it needed to be refurbished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  To be roofed inside and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  To be repaired to be put … 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 211 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  In a good … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Condition and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It was a disappointment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And the money was gone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana – sorry – can I just pick up on that 
10 
because as I understood the Chair’s question it was when prior to 
May 2015 had you been at Pilanesberg Airport and your answer was 
that you went in early 2016. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So – but that is after.  So I am trying to 
understand when earlier than May 2015 were you at Pilanesberg 
Airport? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I have never been to Pilanesberg Airport 
because Mr van Wyk was saying that everything is going smooth.  They 
are doing the work.  They are fixing.  You are a – you are a CEO of the 
20 
company.  Just sit back and relax.  We will – we will give you the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was – he was saying you are the big boss now.  
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 212 of 224 
 
Do not worry about these things. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got people to do this for you. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair.  I was White man. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no.  I know a lot of people know isiZulu.  Do you 
know what I am saying?  You do understand? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I said?  What I said? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  (isiZulu). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am – Ms Hofmeyr maybe I can just mention 
something about this thing of (isiZulu).  You know – there - there was a 
case in the (indistinct) Court.  I think it is reported now and a company 
– somebody in the company complained or I think workers were singing 
a song which involved saying (isiZulu) … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so they were dismissed partly I think for that and 
so but because the company thought that was racist – you know – to 
call somebody (isiZulu).  So when there was argument so the argument 
20 
from the union side was no it is not.  So I put a question – I made a 
remark that I know that among Black people it is – you will easily find 
somebody saying this one is (isiZulu). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which means this is my employer … 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 213 of 224 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When the term is used in that context – you know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not – and they can say it in respect of a Black 
… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Employer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Say (isiZulu) it is my (isiZulu).  It is my White person.  
So – so that is why I am now saying … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When she – when she says I can understand … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What she is talking about.  Yes, okay thank you. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So just to be clear you – you had 
not been to Pilanesberg Airport before May 2015.  So you did not have 
first-hand knowledge that the buildings were in a state of disrepair.  Is 
that correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at 11 May - we were at the top of page 17 
and we were at paragraph 4.34 - you will recall I said that was five 
20 
days after the first amount came into the account.  You have now been 
depleted by another two million which totals six million out of the 
account. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you go down to paragraph 4.36 on that page 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 214 of 224 
 
you reference a further amount that goes out.  What was that amount? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It is 500 000 Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who does it go to? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It went Els (indistinct). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what explanation were you given for that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr van Wyk says it is a consulting fee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A consulting fee.  Just in relation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In respect of what?  Consulting who for what?  Did 
you ask about that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes I did ask and then he said that one is for 
10 
consulting – consulting fee (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not ask for more information? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No.  No I did not ask for more information 
because I just asked what about this one and then he said no it is for 
consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – did you understand then what consulting 
means? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  In my lay understanding consulting is when 
20 
you come and do certain work … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  For – for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  For the company. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 215 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and R500 000 is not a small amount for 
consulting.  Is it? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you did not ask for more clarification?  What 
for and so on and who – who is that and so on? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hun-uh. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  If I – if I may. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Add on that I could not ask my – Mr van Wyk – 
Mr van Wyk so many questions because now he was getting irritable 
because every little thing I ask … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Everything I was asking and now I was asking 
too much questions and now all these monies were a concern for them 
to be going out at this pace and if I ask and then I will just be – this is 
consulting.  You know - there was no more – I was now like a servant to 
my company. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And yet he kept on wanting you to believe you were 
the big boss? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, but I – I was a servant because now 
anything that comes into his head he will just tell me and I have to take 
it and to maintain calmness and for the person who is helping me – who 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 216 of 224 
 
is helping me not to be angry and I just have to say yes sir, yes sir, yes 
sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now as at the middle of May … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lot of money had come into the account of the close 
corporation and a lot of money was going out. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there any money that – I mean – lots of people 
were getting paid.  Maybe not lots but two or three people were getting 
paid a lot of money – lot of monies. 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were – were you getting anything yourself as the big 
boss and as the owner of the company as at that time?  Was there any 
cent had come to you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair because he put an amount of – he 
put 450 000 and before the – I think they put 50 000.  No, no they put 
450 000 before and then later they – they put 50 000 to make it 
500 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  500 000. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Into your personal account? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Into my – my – I wanted it to go to my 
personal account.  No but they transferred it into my other business 
account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Absa Bank account – the Absa Bank account? 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 217 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Ja, of – of the other company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, not of – of this company? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are the one who said they must put it into the 
account of that other company? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Mr Kalisilira asked – asked me for – for the 
name of – for the account number of my other company so that they can 
put that money as a token into – that my business account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say as a token? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  As a – part of a … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a part payment? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes as a shareholder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was money that you were getting as a dividend? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you – do you know why he wanted to pay it 
into the account of the other company and not into your personal 
account?  You do not know why or do you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Chair, he – he just said give me your other 
20 
business account number … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And then I said I am not around.  I am – I am 
not in the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 218 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  But in any way I will see what I will do and 
then.  What – what is it for?  He says no, no I need to transfer you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Some money into it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  And then because I was driving I quickly 
looked into it and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Just give it to – to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and then R450 000 initially was paid and then 
10 
later another R50 000? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  R50 000 was – 450 was paid and then 50 … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After that to make it R500 000? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and was that roundabout mid – mid-May 2015? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I cannot remember Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was it – would it have been after these other 
people who we have talked about had been paid these amounts – 
Els (indistinct) and (intervenes)? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I should think so Chair.  I should think so, 
CHAIRPERSON:  You think so, okay. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 219 of 224 
 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I do not – I do not remember.  This is an old … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  No that is alright.  So at least you had 
been given about 500 – you were given about R500 000 at … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it was around that time or after you are not 
sure but … 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Tlatsana can I just get a few more facts 
there.  The other company was that the Kenk Company you referred to 
10 
earlier? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just give that full name again if you may? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  It is Kenk Suppliers and Distributors. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Suppliers and Distributors.  Did it worry you at 
all that there was no business relationship between Koreneka and Kenk 
at that stage to justify the payment? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No it – it did not worry me because it is – it is 
one of my – one of my accounts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it not an – if you see it on a bank account it 
20 
does not accurately reflect the nature of the payment.  Do you accept 
that? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes according to the statement yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes because as I understand your evidence the 
nature of the payment is it is a payment to you as a member of the CC.  
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 220 of 224 
 
Correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is you in your personal capacity who is a 
member of the CC. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So for the bank transaction to properly reflect 
the nature of that payment it should have been a payment into your 
personal account.  Correct? 
10 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you did not query why they were asking for 
a business account of another entity that was not a member of the CC? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  No Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I – I appreciate that you are not certain 
about the timing but was it early on in the beginning of this 
arrangement? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  I do not remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We would be able to find it in your bank 
20 
accounts – bank statements I assume? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Ms Tlatsana just for the record this 
accounting of precisely what was paid to you or entities associated with 
you as well as the remaining amount that is not covered by your 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 221 of 224 
 
affidavit is something that we have asked as a Commission for you to 
provide to us. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I take it that you will endeavour to do so 
after this evidence? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We then – oh, I see we have 
passed the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have – I have just noticed too. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The deadline Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you have in mind we should do to complete 
Ms Tlatsana’s evidence? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there is the possibility of returning 
tomorrow.  We are sitting from 9 o’ clock.  We do have another witness 
scheduled tomorrow.  My estimation is that her evidence should take 
about two hours.  So depending on the arrangements for the day we 
could seek to continue Ms Tlatsana first and then move into that 
evidence. 
That seems quite obvious otherwise we would have to break 
her evidence and I think that would be undesirable. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I – I would prefer not to break her evidence if 
possible but I – I do not know from tomorrow onwards if we continue 
tomorrow with her evidence but I do know that we have taken much 
longer to do what we have been able to do today … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 222 of 224 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – I do not feel that – I feel it was justified. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:   
CHAIRPERSON:  I feel that we needed to understand certain things 
properly.  So it maybe that when we - if we continue tomorrow or 
whatever day it would be faster … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it may well be that we would still take quite some 
time.  I do not know.  The relevance of that is that if we continue 
tomorrow it maybe that we end up maybe not being able to do two 
10 
witnesses … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am wondering what the situation is with the - 
with the next witness in terms of flexibility.  If we were to continue with 
Ms Tlatsana tomorrow and – but we cannot go – go up to the next 
witness whether we can try and have that other witness on Monday 
morning before the next witness. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, may I make this proposal?  It seems to 
me it may make sense to convene at 9 o’ clock to have the other 
witness here because she has been summoned to attend and then we 
20 
can start Ms Tlatsana and at the first break I assume we will have a 
good sense of the timing and then if it is clear that we wil not get to the 
second witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We can possibly excuse her then for a return 
21 JUNE 2019 – DAY 117 
 
Page 223 of 224 
 
on Monday morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I – I would not want to lose the opportunity to 
have her here though … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because if Ms Tlatsana’s evidence goes go a 
bit quicker … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then there is a prospect that we could get to 
her. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that – that is fine and Ms Tlatsana is able 
to come back tomorrow? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and 9 o’ clock is fine with you? 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Then I think we must adjourn now and then we 
will start at nine tomorrow.  So please come back tomorrow at 9 o’ 
clock. 
MS BABADI TLASANA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will then adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
