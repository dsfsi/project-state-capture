PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 24 FEBRUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Soni.  Good morning 
everybody. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Are we ready? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Chairperson, you will recall that 
among the witnesses who were going to be called today 
was Mr Auswell Mashaba and I made that point again 
yesterday relating to the fact that a summons had been 
served on him to appear today. 
10 
 
I must record that Mr Mashaba is not here and 
subsequent 
to 
the 
exchanges 
we 
had, 
you 
and 
I 
Chairperson yesterday, his attorney has sent a letter to the 
Commission saying that Mr Mashaba will not be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because of that, are you going to 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, I will give you a bundle 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...are you going to read it into the 
record? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you going to read it into the record? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I will give you...  I want to deal 
with something Mr Chairperson, that it is not simple that he 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 4 of 269 
 
is not coming but the circumstances though, we prepared a 
small bundle to indicate to you all the relevant exchanges 
relating to his non-appearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But perhaps I should answer your 
question.  I will give you a copy of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But it will be... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
...together 
with 
other 
10 
correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   May I have leave to hand it up Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, you will see in the 
bundle, there are a number of documents there.  It is the 
document right at the – it is the last document in that 
bundle and it is a letter from Mr Cameron dated today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I should read it into the record. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Just so that we... we... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The record that he is not going to be 
here. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 5 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It says: 
“We address this communication to you on the 
instructions of our client [and the client being 
Mr Mashaba as appears above] with specific 
reference 
to 
the 
document 
and 
more 
specifically 
to 
the 
contents 
of 
your 
communication 
dated 
the 
16 t h  of February 2021...” 
 
And then in the last paragraph: 
10 
“In closing, we confirm and record that our 
client will not be appearing at the Commission 
today and more particularly for our reason that 
our client does not accept that the document 
constitutes 
a 
lawful 
and 
legally 
binding 
summons...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I am not sure 
that...  I am looking at the last letter in the bundle.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Are you still in the first 
paragraph or you have ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, I have moved to the last 
paragraph to get... 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 6 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, I am sorry.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just wanted to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then I want to go through the 
correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine.  Just... I think, 
complete your reading.  I will just have to... 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So in the first paragraph he says: 
“We address this communication to you on the 
instructions 
of 
our 
client 
with 
specific 
reference 
to 
the 
document 
and 
more 
specifically 
to 
the 
contents 
of 
your 
communication 
dated 
the 
16 t h  of February 2021...” 
 
Now Chairperson, I may just say as the prelude 
to the letter, the writer describes the document as the 
20 
document purporting to be the summons that was served 
on Mr Mashaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So they... he is signing...  I do not 
recognise that. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 7 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then he says: 
“As regards to the contents of paragraph 3 of 
your communication: 
1. The recordal contained therein only came to 
the writer ’s attention on the receipt of that 
communication, that he is saying not within the 
writer ’s knowledge, then our communication 
date, it is 15 February 2021 was transmitted to 
you. 
10 
2. And we request that you furnish ourselves 
with a transcribed record of what took place at 
that hearing, as we hold instructions from our 
client 
to 
seek 
an 
opinion 
from 
senior 
counsel...” 
 
And 
then 
the 
third 
paragraph 
then 
is 
Chairperson: 
“In closing, we confirm and record that our 
client will not be appearing at the Commission 
today, and more particularly, for our reason 
20 
that our 
client does not accept that the 
document constitutes a lawful and legally 
binding summons...” 
 
Ja, requested to acknowledge thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 8 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And it is signed by Mr Cameron, the 
attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, the Commission dealt 
with this similar situation last week Chairperson, on 
Monday last week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Where a witness was summonsed to 
appear and did not appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And as a result of that, the 
Commission has taken certain action to ensure that the 
disrespect displayed and the unlawful conduct is not gone 
unpunished. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now Mr Chairperson, what I want to 
say is.  This letter that I just read does not appear in a 
vacuum. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   There is – there are seas of 
20 
exchanges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now I only want to deal with the 
relevant ones and they are contained in the bundle of 
documents I sent to you. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 9 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You will see Chairperson that what is 
crucial in that set of documents is the summons which the 
– Mr Cameron calls a document that purports to be a 
summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So that is – and when he received – 
soon 
after 
he 
received 
that, 
we 
got 
a 
letter 
from 
Mr Cameron 
saying 
that 
they 
do 
not 
recognise 
that 
document as a summons. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   They will not appear.  We, the very 
next day – and that Chairperson happened on Monday last 
week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   When Mr Cameron wrote to us.  On 
Tuesday we wrote back to say that you will be aware that a 
similar issue arose at the Commissions hearing yesterday 
and we are saying to you it is not open to your client to 
simply ignore the summons.  If he wants to challenge the 
20 
validity of the summons he must do so in court but until it 
is set aside it retains its validity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And it is then Chairperson that you 
and I had that exchange yesterday relating to what was 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 10 of 269 
 
ging to happen today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the last letter I have just read is 
a response to our previous letter of the 17 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the exchange yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now Chairperson, the approach of 
the Legal Team to this is that Mr Mashaba’s conduct cannot 
go unanswered. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He cannot defy a summons.  He is 
obviously entitled to challenge it... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what we would like to do 
Chairperson is to go through the documents through with 
you because of course if there is sufficient calls, then in 
terms of the – of Section 6 of the Commissions Act, he 
would be entitled not to come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But the question is whether it is that 
and should you be satisfied based on the information that 
you have that there is not a sufficient cause before you to 
then introduce legal steps against Mr Mashaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 11 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, I say that also having 
regard to the point you made last week Monday when this 
situation first arose before the Commission where there 
was a defiance of an appearance of a summons to appear. 
 
And the point you made Chairperson is that that 
is going to lead to more such defiance’s, and that is 
exactly what this is.  And it is for that reason that we 
submit that the matter must be dealt with formally now and 
steps taken as you as the Chairperson would... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So this may well be the start 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That might be. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...of 
more 
people 
who 
will 
defy 
summonses issued by the Commission. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And refuse to appear before the 
Commission 
which 
obviously 
undermines 
in 
a 
very 
significant way the work of the Commission when people 
who have knowledge of certain transactions and events 
that are relevant to the investigation of the Commission 
20 
refuse to appear when they have been served with 
summonses and this may defeat the objectives of the 
Commission.   
 
And I note that in the letter Mr Mashaba’s 
attorney does not put up any factual or legal grounds for 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 12 of 269 
 
his client’s view that the summons that was served on his 
client is not a summons or is not valid.   
 
That is what also Mr Zuma’s attorneys did in 
their letter to say he was not going to appear last week.  
They said the summons was irregular without saying even 
grounds on which they were saying the summons was 
irregular.   
 
So these – this witness is basically doing the 
same thing.  And we may well see more.  I hope not.  Yes, 
okay alright. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, then may I go through 
the documents as they appear before you?  You will see 
the first document Chairperson is the proof of service of 
the document on Mr Mashaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the summons? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of the summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   On Mr Mashaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it was a summons? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not just a document? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was an important process, legal 
process.  It was a summons and it was labelled as such? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 13 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And of course, the service is not an 
issue because the very fact that they are challenging it 
means they received it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I just say that we took all steps 
to ensure that there were no procedural grounds on which 
that could be challenged. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then Chairperson, the next 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, the Commission has 
issued, from what I remember, many summonses over the 
past three years, both summonses for witnesses or people 
to appear as well as summonses for the production of 
documents. 
 
I do not know if I saw the affidavits are close to 
or about one thousand.  I am not sure.  Or whether it was 
close to above hundred.  I am not sure.  But whether it was 
hundred or around hundred or one thousand, it is still a 
20 
high number. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And mostly people have accepted the 
summonses and complied with them. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 14 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Most of the time. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So the summons Chairperson reads: 
“Summons to appear as a witness...” 
 
And it records – and this is the – I just point out 
Chairperson that in terms of the Commissions Act, the 
format of the summons must be in terms as determined by 
yourself Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And this is the – this is the manner in 
which the summonses have been issued.  We kept with the 
secretariat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And it alerts Mr Mashaba to the fact 
that the summons is issued in terms of Section 3.2 of the 
Commissions Act to be read with the Proclamation 3 of the 
– published on the 25 t h of January 2018, Government 
Notice 105 published on the 9 t h of February 2018 as the 
Rules of the Commission. 
20 
 
And Chairperson, the terms of the summons read 
as follows: 
“The 
sheriff 
or 
his 
deputy 
inform 
Mr Mashaba...” 
 
And the address is there ...[intervenes]  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 15 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us include his name. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that – because it is as if the 
summons just put the surname without the name. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
“Inform 
Mr 
Auswell 
Mashaba... 
[and 
his 
address being AM House 20, Bavaria Avenue 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, or maybe you might not need to 
repeat the address. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, the address, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  But it is there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then: 
“He is to be informed that he is hereby 
summoned to: 
a) Appear before the Commission personally at 
20 
the 
Civic 
Centre, 
158 
Civic 
Boulevard, 
Braamfontein, Johannesburg at 10:00 a.m. on 
the 24 t h of February 2021... [That is today.] 
...for the purposes of giving evidence before 
the Commission and then be questioned about 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 16 of 269 
 
matters arising from the relevant parts of the 
affidavits and/or the reports in the annexure 
hereto...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Chairperson, I just point out that 
that annexure refers to the affidavit of Mr Molefe dated the 
25 t h of August 2016.  The second document listed in 
Annexure 
A 
is 
Mr 
Mashaba’s 
affidavit 
dated 
the 
30 t h of November 2020 in response to Mr Molefe’s affidavit 
in which...  Sorry.  In which he or his legal representative 
10 
furnished to the Commission. 
 
Now Chairperson, I should just add that that is 
the affidavit that was submitted pursuant to the 10.6 
Directive that was issued for him to respond to certain 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he has previously complied with a 
10.6 Directive issued to him? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For him to file a certain affidavit? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He filed – he complied? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But now he is not complying with the 
summons? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 17 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the third document is the report 
of the administration of the estate of Swifambo Rail 
Leasing and Liquidation and Rail Pro Holdings (Pty) Ltd in 
Liquidation dated the 18 t h of February, which was provided 
to you on the 4 t h of December 2020. 
 
I should just add Chairperson that the affidavit in 
which he responded, he responded to both these matters 
Chairperson. 
 
Then Chairperson, the – if I could go back to the 
10 
terms of the summons.  It is said there in bold: 
“Your failure to comply with the requirements 
set out in paragraph A without sufficient cause 
constitute 
an 
offence 
under 
6.1 
of 
the 
Commissions Act of 1947 as amended...” 
 
And it is dated the 9 t h of February and it is 
signed by the Secretary of the Commission, Professor 
Mosala.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine.  Will you just 
arrange for everybody to say:  “will constitutes” and 
20 
offence and “not constitutes”? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then the secretary should make 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 18 of 269 
 
sure. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So that is the terms of the summons 
that was served on him Chair.  Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did they tell him – they tell him he is 
required to appear before the Commission? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They tell him the venue, the address 
where he must appear.  They tell him what he must give 
10 
evidence about and what he will be questioned about.  It 
says are matters arising from the affidavit listed in 
Annexure A or documents listed in Annexure A.  It tells him 
the date when to appear and it tells him the time.  And it is 
issued by the Secretary of the Commission. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is right, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is signed by the Secretary of the 
Commission. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it is clear from his heading that the 
20 
summons is from the Commission. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has got the logo of the Commission. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Logo of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the face of the – on the first page. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 19 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So Chairperson, on the face of it, 
nothing appears to be untoward or irregular about this 
summons that was served. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now Chairperson, you will recall that 
the summons was served on him on the 9 t h – on the 10 t h as 
recorded in the furthest document produced by the hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And so, obviously...  Where is the 
sheriff’s return? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is the first page Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is the first one. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  In any event, it is clear from his 
attorney’s letter that they received the summons. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that they say they do not regard 
20 
it as a summons. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  And they are not challenging 
the issue of service. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja, ja.  And we do not know what 
it is that it makes them think it is not a summons. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 20 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Uhm...  Yes? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So one day after the service of the 
summons on him, I should also add Chairperson just for 
completeness sake.  The summons was also emailed to the 
attorney who has been representing Mr Mashaba.  It was 
emailed to the attorney and for safety sake there was 
services as well.   
 
Then Chairperson, on the 15 t h of February, five 
days after the summons was served on Mr Mashaba, 
10 
Mr Cameron on his letterhead – this is Mr Mashaba’s 
attorney – writes to Ms Vangate(?), who is the – a member 
of the Legal Team dealing with this matter and who has 
dealt with Mr Cameron before. 
 
He says...  Oh, sorry.  He gives her as a 
reference but he addresses the letter to the Secretary of 
the Commission but I do not know why he says:  Dear 
Ms Vangate.   
 
He then says: 
“Our 
client, 
Mr 
Auswell 
Mashaba, 
the 
20 
document purporting to be a summons for the 
purposes of procuring our client’s attendance 
before 
the 
Commission 
of 
inquiry 
into 
allegations of state capture, corruption and 
fraud in the Public Sector including organs of 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 21 of 269 
 
state 
(The 
Inquiry) 
on 
the 
24 t h  of February 2021 
(The 
Document), 
we 
address this communication to you on the 
instructions 
of 
our 
client 
with 
specific 
reference to the document...” 
 
Which clearly is a reference to the summons.  It 
says: 
“Our client has instructed ourselves to record 
that: 
1. He 
does 
not 
recognise 
and 
accept 
the 
10 
lawfulness and/or the legal validity of the 
document. 
2. Arising from that recordal referred to herein 
above, our client will not be attending the 
inquiry.” 
 
And then there is: 
“You are requested to acknowledge receipt 
hereof.  Yours faithfully, Attorney Cameron.” 
 
That 
letter 
is 
dated 
the 
15 t h 
of 
February 
Chairperson.  On the 16 t h of February, the Secretary of the 
20 
Commission wrote to Mr Cameron in the following terms on 
the Commission’s letterhead to Mr Cameron, his address 
and it was sent by email.   
 
It says: 
“Dear Mr Cameron.  The Judicial Commission 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 22 of 269 
 
of the Inquiry re the Judicial Commission of 
Inquiry

Capture, 
Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector 
including Organs of State (The Commission) re 
your letter of 15  February 2021 in respect of 
the summons served on your client, Mr Auswell 
Mashaba: 
1. We note the contents of your letter under 
reply which was sent to the Commission at 
04:40 yesterday...” 
10 
 
Now the relevance of the time Chairperson is 
reflected in paragraph 2, which reads: 
“This is just about the time the Commission’s 
hearing of yesterday was being finalised...” 
 
And the – just for context Chairperson.  The 
hearing 
is 
the 
hearing 
concerning 
Mr 
Zuma’s 
non-
appearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Last Monday, last week ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Last week, Monday, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ha. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
“The Commission’s Legal Team dealing with 
state capture at PRASA has requested me to 
bring 
to 
your 
attention 
and 
that 
of 
Mr Mashaba, which I hereby do, that among 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 23 of 269 
 
the matters that emerges unequivocal at that 
hearing are the following: 
3.1. 
A witness on whom a summons to 
appear, the Commission has been served, is 
required to comply with the terms of the 
summons unless he or she had it set aside by 
a competent court prior to the time he or she 
had been summoned to appear. 
3.2. 
Unless the summons has been set 
aside, it is not open for a witness who is of the 
10 
view that a summons is not lawful or legally 
valid to not to comply with what the summons 
requires him or her to do. 
3.3. 
a witness who does not comply with 
the terms of the summons without sufficient 
cause 
is, 
in 
terms 
of 
Section 
5 
of 
the 
Commissions Act of 1947 in terms of which act 
a summons was issued, guilty of an offence 
and 
on 
conviction 
may 
be 
liable 
to 
imprisonment of up to six-months. 
20 
4.  
In the light of the aforegoing, the 
stance of the Commission’s Legal Team on 
PRASA is that Mr Mashaba is required to 
appear 
before 
the 
Commission 
on 
the 
24 t h of February 2021 
and 
comply 
with 
the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 24 of 269 
 
other terms of the summons.  Neither your 
letter 
nor 
its 
contents 
which 
seemingly 
deliberately 
broadly 
records 
only 
Mr Mashaba’s allegation that the summons is 
not lawfully and legally valid without setting 
aside the basis of that allegation, constitutes 
sufficient cause for him not to appear. 
5.  
I also record that a copy of your 
letter, 
this 
response 
and 
further 
correspondence, if any, will be made available 
10 
to the Chairperson of the Commission...” 
 
Now it is in terms of that Chairperson that we 
wanted it to be known that these are the matters that will 
be placed before you today for a determination for what is 
to be done.   
 
And 
Chairperson, 
that 
letter 
was 
sent 
to 
Mr Cameron on the 16 t h of February 2021 and it emphasise 
two points Chairperson.  It says to Mr Cameron:  We are 
telling you and your client.   
 
Now we heard nothing from Mr Cameron until 
20 
yesterday evening when Ms Vangate got a call from him 
and then this morning we got this letter.  This is the letter I 
have read but just for completeness sake Chair because it 
is a response to our letter of the 17 t h – sorry, the 16 t h. 
“We address this communication to you on the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 25 of 269 
 
instructions of our client with specific reference to 
the document and more specifically to the contents 
of your communication dated the 16 February 
2021.” 
It says: 
“As regards to the contents of paragraph 3 of your 
communication, the recordals contained therein only 
came to the writer ’s attention on receipt of that 
communication, that the same was not within the 
writer ’s knowledge when our communication dated 
10 
the 15 February was transmitted to you.” 
Now I do not know what the relevance of that is because – 
and I am saying that, Chairperson, because whatever was 
discussed at the Commission, the law remains the same, 
the law is he must comply with the summons.  Mr Cameron 
did not have to be told by the Commission, it was just that 
the Commission was putting him and his client on terms 
that we are telling you that this is what Mr Mashaba is 
required to do and so that professed ignorance does not 
take the matter any further.  2: 
20 
“We request that you furnish ourselves with a 
transcribed record of what took place at that 
hearing as we hold instructions for our client to 
seek an opinion from senior counsel.” 
And then says in closing: 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 26 of 269 
 
“We confirm and record our client will not be 
appearing 
at the Commission today and more 
particularly for the reason that our client does not 
accept that the document constitutes a lawful and 
legally binding summons.” 
Now in response to that last paragraph, Chairperson, I 
make the point that in our letter we say but you just baldly 
state and it appears to be deliberately so that the 
summons is not legally binding and it is not lawful.  It is an 
indication – tell us what is wrong so that when this matter 
10 
is debated this morning we can determine whether there is 
any cogency in what your client is saying?  Of course that 
is as bald as the initial allegation and as bald as what Mr 
Zuma’s attorney said to you, Chairperson. 
 
Now they then say we request acknowledgement of 
receipt hereof.  And, Chairperson, the question that arises, 
is what should the Commission do?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, this conduct by anybody, the 
conduct 
of 
defying 
summons 
to 
appear 
before 
the 
Commission, without having gone to court to have it set 
20 
aside if somebody thinks the summons irregular or not 
valid but simply to defy it and not appear before the 
Commission is totally unacceptable and everything should 
be done by the Commission and the law enforcement 
agencies and everybody concerned to put a stop to it 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 27 of 269 
 
because if it spreads it will be the beginning of chaos in 
our legal system.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what it would mean. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it spreads, soon it will be happening in 
the magistrate’s courts in various parts of our country, it 
will be happening in the various high courts throughout the 
country because it would seem that sections in our society 
will be believing that it is acceptable conduct to simply 
10 
defy summons. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Let us not forget, Chairperson, the 
Labour Courts where these rights of vulnerable… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Among the most vulnerable in our 
society where an employer just defies summons to appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, employers in the Labour Court 
will defy when they are required to appear there, it will just 
– it is just going to mean chaos.  The secretary of the 
Commission is instructed to lay a criminal complaint 
20 
against Mr Auswell Mashaba for his failure to appear 
before the Commission today in accordance with the terms 
of the summons that had been served on him to appear 
before the Commission at ten o’clock this morning and the 
legal team is requested to assist the secretary in preparing 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 28 of 269 
 
the necessary affidavit or statement to be lodged at the 
relevant police station and that needs to be done urgently 
because this type of conduct cannot be allowed to go on 
without the legal process being put in motion to deal with it 
for too long.  So that is what should happen.  Ja. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
As 
you 
please, 
Chairperson.  
Chairperson, it is a pity and I say that because on the 
objective facts, and that is the extent to which the 
Commission’s investigations are being hampered by Mr 
Mashaba’s non-appearance.  Chairperson, on the evidence 
10 
on his own version as set out in the affidavit he has 
submitted, Mr Mashaba does not dispute that he was in 
charge of Swifambo when it was awarded the contract.   
 
Chairperson, you will also recall that Mr Molefe 
gave evidence about a meeting between Mr Mashaba and 
himself where Mr Mashaba said he knew that the Hawks 
were investigating him and that he wanted, in a sense, to 
come clean.  He then said that he had been approached by 
Mr Mabunda, the front for the company that would be 
awarded the contract. 
20 
 
In his response – and that was Mr Molefe’s replying 
affidavit in the Swifambo High Court application, we have 
dealt – we have referred to many times which judgment of 
the High Court setting aside the award as being corrupt 
was endorsed by the Supreme Court of Appeal and the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 29 of 269 
 
Constitutional Court, having looking at the application for 
leave to appeal, refused right leave to appeal. 
 
So what we have, Chairperson, is concerns by the 
highest courts in the land about a R3,5 billion contract.  
Now among the allegations made about Mr Mashaba, 
Chairperson, is that he was aware that – well, he did not 
have the requisite skills and so on, he became a front for a 
Spanish company which was then awarded the contract. 
 
The amount that has been paid in respect of that 
contract, Chairperson, for 70 locomotives, is more than 
10 
R2,6 billion.  In return, our country has received 13 
locomotives.  I say all of this, Chairperson, as a precursor 
to our next witness who investigated this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also, it is important to say it so that 
the public understands that the witness who has defied the 
summons had been called about this very important 
transaction relating to Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes and that is the point, that at the 
end of the day there is no dispute even from him that he 
was involved.  He did not even file, as Mr Molefe said, he 
20 
did not even file the answering affidavit in the High Court.  
He only filed an affidavit in response to the replying 
affidavit of Mr Molefe.  Now all of that, Chairperson, is 
commented upon both by the High Court and the Supreme 
Court of Appeal.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 30 of 269 
 
 
In other words, he would have thrown a great deal 
of light on what happened.  With an allegation being made 
that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second, Mr Soni, I just realised that 
my phone was not off and in this way I am reminding 
everybody to put their phones off.  Yes? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So what we have, Chairperson, is 
somebody who could throw light to the public as to how It 
came about that a contract worth eventually R3,5 billion, 
although 2,78 billion has been paid, how is it that that 
10 
could happen?  He would have been able to throw light 
and, Chairperson, the long suffering public has a right to 
know how its hard-earned rands are being wasted away in 
contracts of this nature.  Where did that money go?  There 
are allegations that are made that - he in fact says so in 
his 10[6], Chairperson, I will refer you to, he in a document 
attached to his 10[6] says that I was asked – I was forced 
to pay money to people who said they were collecting 
money for the ANC and I agreed to pay R18 million.  He 
says so.  But he says I do not know if the ANC received it.  
20 
The person to whom I gave the money says he did not give 
it to the ANC.  But that is not the point, the point is he 
says that I paid that. 
 
Now if that is not corruption is on his part, whoever 
else may be involved, one wants to know what is.  And 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 31 of 269 
 
especially with a contract, as the next witness will show, is 
so fraught with difficulty and when one looks at how the 
money was distributed through Mr Mashaba’s company, 
one shudders to think how all of this could have gone on 
from 2017 when this report was sent to the Hawks and 
today there is not a single person that has been arrested.  
And so Mr Mashaba’s presence, Chairperson, would have 
allayed some of those [indistinct – dropping voice]   
Now I know he says in previous correspondence 
and he says in his [indistinct] 14.49 affidavit that the 
10 
liquidator has laid charges against me and the liquidator 
indeed has and I do not want to implicate him.   
But the Constitutional Court in the Zuma matter 
made it very clear that the right against self-incrimination 
is a right that must be exercised in relation to specific 
questions, it is not a blanket right which entitles a person 
to say – not only not to come but to say I am not going to 
answer any questions.  It responded to what Mr Zuma’s 
legal representative had said to you, Chairperson, so that 
we will put Mr Zuma in court – I mean, in the witness box 
20 
and he will not say anything and the Constitutional Court 
said you cannot.   
That is why Mr Mashaba’s presence today would 
have assisted so much in one’s understanding of what went 
on in the Swifambo contract.  But I want to say something 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 32 of 269 
 
more, Chairperson, one of the reasons we have the person 
who conducted the forensic investigation for PRASA and 
who submitted a 112 page report to the Hawks who initially 
told him that they are going to look at this and they will 
probably ask him to do a report on Siyangena as well but 
after 
he 
submitted 
his 
report 
he 
never 
came 
back, 
Chairperson. 
Now why that is relevant, Chairperson knows, this 
is a forensic report that does two things.  It looks at all the 
issues that were raised in the court papers, that is the 
10 
advantage one has, and it looks at when you look at the 
investigator did, was what he calls a first level review 
which is looking at the flow of money from PRASA to 
Swifambo and from Swifambo to different people and what 
he shows you are all the links – and when you put the 
whole picture together, it all makes sense because you ask 
yourself when the evidence is being led but why was this 
company paid this amount and having regard to the 
allegations, it all makes sense and the picture emerges 
from the report, but at least Mr Mashaba would have been 
20 
able – would have been given an opportunity to explain 
whether the picture we think that emerges is a correct 
picture and that is what the Commission is about.  
Chairperson, again I am still dealing with Mr 
Mashaba.  You might remember that the Constitutional 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 33 of 269 
 
Court when it required Mr Zuma to appear, and he did not 
appear last Monday, made this point that commissions 
serve different purposes but one of the purposes of this 
Commission is to allay public concerns about a matter that 
has worried the public for the last ten years, the extent to 
which our state entities and government departments have 
been 
corrupted 
and 
effectively, 
in 
certain 
instances, 
cabinet. 
Now the public – what Mr Mashaba is doing, is 
denying the public its right to know what happened in this 
10 
matter which on all versions he is involved in.  Whether 
good or bad is irrelevant but he has to come and explain to 
the public and explain to you, Chairperson, who has to 
make a report to the Commission, that is the brief you have 
been given by the President. 
So the nonappearance of Mr Mashaba is a very 
serious inroad into the Commission’s attempt to fulfil its 
mandate to let the public know and that is an added reason 
and an aggravating factor that when we are assisting the 
Secretary of the Commission, we will be putting in the 
20 
request that the Secretary makes to the law enforcement 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Chairperson, then I am in a 
position to call my first witness for the day, Chairperson. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 34 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was going to be your second.  Your 
first witness now that Mr Mashaba is not here or was he 
…[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Mashaba was going to be the first 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then we were going to call.  
Sorry, yes – no, sorry – yes, who was going to be the 
second witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, you do not need any setup, 
10 
you are ready, so I do not need to adjourn. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Perhaps if you just gave us five 
minutes because Mr Suskin… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Or should we just take 
this time for the tea adjournment? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It may be most convenient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so that when we come back then 
…[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And go with… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will take the tea adjournment 
20 
now instead of quarter past eleven and we will come back 
at quarter past.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Soni.   
ADV VAS SONI SC: As you please.  Chairperson, before 
we call Mr Sacks, may I just place on record I have been 
told 
that 
2861 
processes 
have 
been 
issued 
by 
the

CHAIRPERSON:  Summonses?  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Summonses, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that is a very high number.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And it is for appearance and for 
documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And for documents? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  May we call our next witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please administer the oath or 
affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
20 
MR SACKS:  [indistinct] 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to take the 
prescribed oath? 
MR SACKS:  [indistinct] 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 36 of 269 
 
conscience? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, please speak up so that it can be 
recorded.  Start afresh please? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.  
MR SACKS:  Ryan Marc Sacks. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR SACKS:  No, I do not.  
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
10 
MR SACKS:  Yes, I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say 
so help me God. 
MR SACKS:  So help me God.  
RYAN MARC SACKS: (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be seated.   
MR SACKS:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Sacks, keep your mask off 
because it muffles the recording.  
MR SACKS:  Thank you, Counsel. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sure.  Mr Sacks, what is your 
profession? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 37 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  I am a chartered accountant, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And in terms of the nature of the work 
you do?   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I specialise in forensic auditing 
investigations, in supporting civil and law enforcement 
investigations.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You have before you your curriculum 
vitae, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, we unfortunately did not 
10 
include this in the bundle we gave you.  Just for reference 
purposes 
can 
I 
hand 
it 
up 
and 
we 
can 
put 
it 
as 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  At the end of mister, I just want him to 
confirm.  I do not think I need to go into it in detail, it is 
just for recording purposes Chair, and we could include it 
Chairperson at the end of the report itself, rather than the 
annexures 
and 
or 
perhaps 
the 
end 
of 
the 
affidavit 
Chairperson, that may be a better place to include it, which 
20 
would then make it 726.1 and 2.  Bundle L, page 726.1 and 
2.  Mr Sacks, do you confirm ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will arrange for it to be numbered 
properly? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I will, yes.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 38 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say it is or it is not an annexure 
to the affidavit? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I thought we would just include it, it is 
not at the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a standalone document.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so it will need to be an exhibit, is 
that right? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Is 
the 
report 
an 
annexure 
to 
the 
10 
affidavit? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It is.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if the report is an annexure to 
the affidavit, then and this letter is a standalone document, 
then it should not be between the affidavit and the reports. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It should rather be after the report. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  Then can 
we make it 954.1 and point 2.  The report itself is 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It goes up to 954? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And the document at 955 is not part of 
the report? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 39 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So we will change what we 
wrote earlier on and it will be 954.1 and 954.2. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright at the right time then we 
will need to admit this as an exhibit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Mr Sacks, do you confirm the 
correctness of what is contained therein? 
MR SACKS:  Yes, I do Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And how many years of experience do 
you have in forensic investigation? 
10 
MR SACKS:  I have 15 years’ experience Mr Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now, one of the matters that you are 
investigating is the VBS investigations.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And in regard to PRASA, what 
investigations were you involved with? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Soni and Mr Sacks, did you 
forget that we admit his affidavit Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no I was just sorry, but perhaps I 
20 
should do that.  I was going to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you can go to the report, yes.  
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
Mr 
Sacks, 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
investigation you did for PRASA, what was it in relation to? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, initially I was appointed by 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 40 of 269 
 
Werksmans 
Attorneys 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
investigation 
occurring at PRASA.  Thereafter I was appointed by the 
DPCI, the Hawks as the forensic accountant to investigate 
this Swifambo investigation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And you then prepared an affidavit 
and report based on those investigations? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now there is an affidavit which 
appears in Bundle L from page 720 to 726.  Is that your 
affidavit? 
10 
MR SACKS:  Please bear with me Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You look at the black numbers at the left 
hand corner for page numbers.  
MR SACKS:  Yes, I have got it Chairperson.  Yes, I confirm 
this is my affidavit Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right.  Now in relation to this 
affidavit, there is a signature on page 725.  Whose 
signature is that? 
MR SACKS:  That is my signature Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Do you confirm that is what is, sorry 
is this your affidavit? 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson, this is my affidavit.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You confirm what is contained in this 
affidavit is true and correct? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 41 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson, it is true and correct.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now attached to this affidavit as one 
of the annexures, and you will see that that appears at 
paragraph 11 of your affidavit, you say you prepared a 
report and that report is Annexures RS3.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now is it correct that RS3 appears 
from page 843 and that is just the report itself, to 954. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are the page numbers? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh, sorry Chairperson.  It is 843. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Up to 954.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it is the same as what starts at 
page 727? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I was going to, I in fact asked that 
that be removed from your file.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Because it is exactly the same 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then we removed, I was asked for the 
first one to be removed, because it is not marked Annexure 
RS3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But it is exactly the same document.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 42 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I do not know why it was produced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the report the last document on the, in 
the bundle or there are other documents? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  There are, so the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexures to the report? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Annexures to the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So if we, if you removed the last one if 
there are two and then marked this one, the first one is it 
S3 or whatever? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  RS3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, will that not help with the pagination 
in the sense that if you remove the one that starts, the first 
one you might have a gap in terms of the pagination? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, this is the difficulty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
In 
your, 
in 
everybody’s 
file 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  RS3 starts at 843 so I was, I initially 
20 
marked the first one.  It is just when I saw that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The annexure is marked RS3 and it is 
referred to in the affidavit, it does not matter, but for my 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 43 of 269 
 
purposes 
now 
Chairperson 
it 
is 
going 
to 
be 
more 
convenient to take out the first one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, well we can do that.  Then 
what should be done is a page should be inserted there, 
which 
you 
will 
make 
a 
note 
to 
say 
there 
was 
a 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  A duplication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A report that was a duplication. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And it has been removed.  It was from 
10 
page whatever to whatever, so that whoever reads then 
understands the pagination. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, I had given that instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I am sorry about that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine.  Okay.  Alright.  
Have we reached a stage where you asked me to admit the 
affidavit?   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Well, let me just ask him if he 
confirms the correctness of the report Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So RS3 is your report, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:  Yes, it is Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Do you confirm what is contained in 
the report is true and correct?   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 44 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson, I confirm that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, then I ask leave to admit 
Mr Ryan’s affidavit as Exhibit SS24 together with the 
annexures to the affidavit, but in particular RS3 which is 
the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Ryan Mark Sacks 
starting 
at 
page 
720, 
is 
admitted 
together 
with 
its 
annexures and will be marked as Exhibit SS24.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  Now Mr 
10 
Sacks, you said you had been initially commissioned or 
engaged by Werksmans to do the investigation into this 
Swifambo matter.  I know the Werksmans matter was 
[indistinct], but in regard to that, the investigation into 
Swifambo, you then said that the Hawks had asked you to 
do the investigation.  Is that correct? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  I was officially 
mandated by the Hawks in late December 2015 to perform 
this Swifambo investigation.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, just remember to adjust or bring the 
mike closer Mr Soni ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Speak up a bit.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I am raising that because you 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 45 of 269 
 
have asked me to place on record that you did not want to 
give evidence before the Hawks had been informed that 
you would be giving evidence on this matter, is that not 
so?   
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And I just want to place on record that 
the Hawks have been told that Mr Sacks would be giving 
evidence on this matter and they are aware of the report as 
well as the nature of his evidence, Chairperson and it is 
just that we did not want to create a problem on this issue, 
10 
because you will realise the sensitivity of, you might 
remember Mr Molefe had to go to court to get the Hawks to 
investigate, but there are developments that perhaps Mr 
Sacks will deal with in the course of his evidence 
Chairperson.  Now let us just deal with your affidavit first 
of all.  You say in paragraph 4 that you were forced to 
appear here by virtue of a summons that was served on 
you, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And why was, why did you want that 
20 
procedure to be followed?   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, the report that I produced is 
very confidential in nature.  I was prepared for the Hawks, 
accordingly I required the summons or to allow myself to 
attend these proceedings to divulge the contents of my 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 46 of 269 
 
findings.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then at paragraph 6 you set out how 
you became involved in the investigations and you say that 
you had initially been engaged by Werksmans to do the 
wider PRASA investigation.  Is that correct?   
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  We were 
engaged to perform the forensic auditing aspect of the 
investigation that Werksmans Attorneys were appointed for 
by PRASA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now just so that there is no confusion 
10 
about names, at that time you were called a different 
entity.  What were you called at that time? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, at that time my company was 
called Hawk Forensics SA Pty Ltd and as a result of global 
branding changes by Crow International, we are now called 
Crow Forensics SA Pty Ltd.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But it is the same ...[intervenes] 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, the same company. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then in paragraph 7 you make the 
point that you were then appointed by the Hawks to do the 
20 
investigation.  Just ask you, to do that you had to sign 
certain confidentiality agreements and they appear as RS1 
and RS2.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that is the reason why you 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 47 of 269 
 
wanted a summons and why you asked the Commission to 
inform the Hawks about your appearance? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Now let us deal with the, your 
initial dealings with the Hawks.  Just tell the Chairperson 
what was indicated would happen after this report.  You 
deal with it in paragraph 8. 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I was appointed to perform this 
Swifambo forensic accounting investigation.  It was also 
anticipated at the time that I would be appointed by the 
10 
Hawks to perform a forensic accounting investigation into 
Siyangena 
Technologies, 
and 
that 
appointment 
never 
transpired.  Then or subsequent to the time I was dealing 
with this Swifambo matter. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now at that time, who in the Hawks 
was heading the team looking at these matters? 
MR SACKS:  When I was appointed, General Mosipi was 
the, my understanding was the head who confirmed my 
appointment with Swifambo.  Later a General Khana 
replaced General Mosipi and during his tenure as far as I 
20 
am aware during that time I was not appointed to do the 
Siyangena Technologies forensic investigation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Can I just have some time frames, 
when were you appointed by the Hawks?  If you look at 
paragraph 7 you give the date.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 48 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  28 December 2015 I was appointed by the 
Hawks Chairperson, to do the Swifambo investigation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sounds [indistinct] and I just say that 
in passing, it looked like they wanted to get on with it, 
between Christmas and New Year. 
MR SACKS:  That is my understanding too Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, and then when did, you say 
General Khana took over.  About when was that? 
MR SACKS:  I am not sure Chairperson of the actual dates 
he took over, but I was present at a meeting on or around 
10 
April 2016 Chairperson, where I attended the premises, the 
headquarters of the Hawks where amongst many other 
investigation team members, General Khana headed the 
meeting and one of the items, topics of discussion was the 
appointment of Crow or Howard Forensics at the time, 
Crow Forensics now, to do the Siyangena Technologies 
forensic investigation as over and above Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now that is 16 months after your 
initial appointment. 
MR SACKS:  It was, ja ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  April 2017. 
MR SACKS:  April 2016.  It was, that is ... Chairperson, 
that date is not included in my affidavit regarding that 
meeting but again I was appointed December 2015 for 
Swifambo.  The meeting I referred to occurred in April 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 49 of 269 
 
2016, give or take four months, four months later.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Now you then say that you 
were asked to make a presentation at a meeting with the 
Hawks.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  To jump in time, 
so December 2015 I was appointed to do Swifambo.  April 
2016 is the said meeting I referred to with General Khana.  
In March 2017 to the best of my recollection I had a 
meeting with the Hawks at their, one of their offices in 
Pretoria to discuss the Swifambo investigation.  At that 
10 
point, it was communicated to me that a report would be 
required.  If I may divulge Counsel, in April 2017 I received 
an email from the Hawks to ask for a meeting to discuss 
my findings to date as the Hawks, I was advised that the 
Hawks were meeting with the NPA.  The prosecution, the 
team responsible for Swifambo, and they wanted to obtain 
my findings for that meeting with the NPA.  That was 11 
April 2017 if I stand to be corrected.  On the 19 t h of April 
2017, so now it is a few days later, I indeed met with the 
Hawks, 
with 
the 
Brigadier 
Makanyane 
and 
Colonel 
20 
Magabosha.  If I recall those were the members of the 
Hawks team, in which I handed over my report which forms 
part of my affidavit and that report is dated, or is dated 20 
April 2017.  I recall I had to make one change which I 
emailed through to the Hawks and Chairperson, that was 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 50 of 269 
 
the last communication I had with the Hawks on this 
matter.  
CHAIRPERSON: 2017? 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they have not been in touch with you 
in any way? 
MR SACKS:  Subsequent to the issue of my report, I have 
not received any note of communication from the Hawks 
regarding this specific report I gave to them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now just so that there is no dispute 
about it, the report that you gave to the Hawks on the 20 t h 
of April, is the same report that appears at RS, as 
Annexure RS3 to your affidavit? 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson, that is correct.  This is the 
latest and most recent version of my report, dated 20 April 
2017.  It has not been updated or amended subsequent to 
this date.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in paragraph 10 of your 
affidavit, you refer to a draft preliminary report.   
20 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not this one or is it this one? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, the reason why I refer to this 
draft preliminary is because we were in the midst of a very 
comprehensive investigation which I am sure Counsel will 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 51 of 269 
 
lead me into the contents of that investigation, and the 
report, I advised the Hawks at that time that the findings 
are preliminary, as is the nature of the investigation.  I was 
still 
awaiting 
further 
information 
to 
complete 
my 
investigation and the findings contained in this report, 
were very crucial because it confirmed the flow of funds 
from PRASA to Swifambo and how Swifambo utilised that 
money.  The, the next anticipated round of investigation 
was to assess and investigate the recipient of that money 
and 
what 
they 
did, 
how 
they 
utilised 
that 
money, 
10 
essentially PRASA’s money.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Just again to confirm, the report that 
appears at RS3 is that same report.  It is just that you still 
call it a draft preliminary report, because you have not 
taken it to the second level which we will get to in a 
moment. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is the position that despite the report 
being labelled as a draft preliminary report in terms of this 
paragraph 10, I have not looked at it again to see whether 
20 
those words appear on it.  Is the position that as far as you 
are concerned, the report represents your final findings or 
not really? 
MR SACKS:  No, it doesn’t present my final findings.  
There were, there was additional matters to investigate and 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 52 of 269 
 
confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SACKS:  As my report alludes to certain transactions 
that I required further information for.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SACKS:  Certain allegations and suspicions that we 
had that I required the assistance of the Hawks to provide 
me with further information to confirm the flow of funds.  
So to summarise, this is still very much a preliminary 
report.  Why it was draft report, is because I had not 
10 
received any comments and I was, from the Hawks, and I 
am still awaiting further information which I clarified clearly 
in my report what was required to complete a final first 
level report, which I noted in this report was the first level.  
Without getting into technicalities, first level in my mind 
was flow of funds from PRASA to Swifambo, Swifambo to 
who Swifambo paid.  Second, the second level required 
was those parties who received money from Swifambo, how 
they distributed the money or what they did with the money 
because the suspicions or allegations at the time was that 
20 
the money was not for commercial or there is no business 
rational for the disbursements of funds from Swifambo to 
these entities or individuals and then from what, how those 
entities and individuals utilised that money, and Counsel 
and I will deal with that as it is dealt with in my report 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 53 of 269 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is the position that the reason why 
the report is not final, is the reason that because there was 
some further work to be done in regard to certain aspects 
that you were suspicious of your investigation, but there 
are some findings that do not need any further work to be 
done, but others still need further work or is the position 
that the entire report is still work in progress? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, you are correct in your first 
point.  Certain findings are final and certain findings are 
10 
still subject to further investigation.  Hence it is still, it was 
still a draft report.  I have just required specifically just a 
bit more information for my first round of investigation in 
order to call it final, but you are correct.  Some findings 
were 
final, 
some 
findings 
were 
subject 
to 
further 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please.  I will just elaborate on 
this Chairperson, because I understand ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The difficulty.  I perhaps should have 
canvassed it a little more.  Mr Sacks, the when you were 
appointed by the Hawks in December 2015, PRASA had 
already filed its application in the High Court, is that 
correct? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 54 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  That ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I think they filed it in November 2015.  
MR SACKS:  I, Chairperson if you just indulge with me 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Ja.  
MR SACKS:  I will get those dates in my report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson, Counsel is 
correct regarding the civil application. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now but between that time, December 
10 
2015 and the time you sent this report to the Hawks, were 
the Hawks assisting you with the investigations you were 
doing?  When I say assisting, providing assistance that you 
wanted like 205’s to banks.  Section 205 applications to 
banks and so on.   
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, the Hawks were assisting in 
terms of providing bank statements we required in terms of 
Section 205 subpoenas.  Which was the foundation of my 
report in April 2017, and I required further information.  By 
its very nature, the flow of funds analysis across in array 
20 
of 
bank 
accounts 
is 
quite 
detailed 
work 
acquiring 
information, so this report was I guess at a juncture where 
we had enough information to conclude on certain findings 
as Chairperson you so referred to, however I required more 
information to confirm certain other findings, so the answer 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 55 of 269 
 
to counsel’s questions between 2015 and April 2017 I had 
received assistance from the Police, the Colonel who was 
assisting me in providing this information.  
Subsequent to the issue of my report I did not 
receive any further information which I requested, and 
which I required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you gave the Hawks your draft 
preliminary report, they knew that it was not a final report 
in terms of it as a whole, they knew that you still needed to 
do some further work in regard to some features of the 
10 
investigation, and you gave them this draft report on the 
19 t h of April 2017, according to them up to now they have 
never come back to you to ask you to complete the parts of 
the investigation that you wanted to complete.  Is that 
right?  
MR SACKS:   That is absolutely correct Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And in a few weeks’ time it will be four 
years since you gave them, because next week, it is March 
then after that it is April.   So in a few weeks’ time, it will 
be four years since you gave the Hawks your report, and 
20 
they have never come back to enable you to complete the 
investigation.  
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And they have never said to you if there 
is any problem.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 56 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:   I have not heard one word regarding any 
problems, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you would not be aware if, for 
whatever reason, they decided that somebody else must 
complete the investigation.  I do not know if it would make 
sense but you have never heard of anything like that? 
MR SACKS:   No Chairperson, I have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright, and was there at any 
stage where they might have been unhappy with how you 
were going about the investigation or anything? 
10 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I am not aware of anything to 
that effect.  
CHAIRPERSON:   They never raised any issues? 
MR SACKS:   Nothing was communicated to me at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   When you met them in April 2017.  
What impression did you get - what sorry, did you present 
your report on the 19 t h of April? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And what impression did you get 
20 
when after you presented your report? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, in my view, my key take away 
from that meeting was it was a general lack of interest into 
what I was explaining in the meeting specifically, I 
specifically recall in my report contains one exhibits, which 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 57 of 269 
 
summarise in totality, the flow of funds.   
I tried to summarise it as best as possible into one 
page that could catch the attention of a reader of this 
report, and on presentation of this one pager, where it was 
very clear as to who was receiving money from Swifambo.  
My take away from the meeting was that there was no real 
interest in what I was telling the recipients, participants 
and recipients of my report in that meeting 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was the leader of the Hawks team 
and whom you presented the report? 
10 
MR SACKS:   If you indulge, indulge me, I just want to 
get…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it General Khana? 
MR SACKS:   No, General Khana was not present in that 
meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   I recall; it was a Brigadier Mackanyana.  
There were a few members of the Hawks team, the 
Brigadier Mackanyana, there was a Colonel Magaboshe, I 
recall maybe one or two lower level policemen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at that time, the person to whom you 
were supposed to report was it General Khana or was it 
somebody else?  
MR SACKS:   It was Brigadier Mackanyana who – I was 
never, 
as 
I 
recall 
I 
was 
never 
officially 
introduced 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 58 of 269 
 
personally to say this is the person, your point person, but 
through 
the 
correspondence 
I 
ascertained 
it 
was 
a 
Brigadier Mackanyana who is responsible for the Swifambo 
investigation 
and 
for 
overseeing 
the 
Swifambo 
investigation?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, in paragraph 8, you talk about a 
General 
Moseepi 
where 
you 
say 
that 
you 
got 
the 
impression in your meetings with him or meeting with him 
that your next brief would be the Siyangena matter.  
10 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   When was the last time you meet 
General Moseepi? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I – to be correct counsel I have 
never met General Moseepi, I do understand that it was 
under his instruction the investigation would occur. 
In 2015, I was appointed through correspondence 
by the DPC under the head of General Moseepi to do 
Swifambo between that dates and April 2016, General 
Khana had replaced General Moseepi.  So I personally was 
20 
not involved in those higher level delegations of the 
investigations, 
I 
dealt 
with 
the 
Hawks 
Policeman 
responsible for the investigations, and besides that one 
meeting, which are referred to in April 2016, where General 
Khana presided over that meeting, that was my only 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 59 of 269 
 
interaction with the - what I would call the authorities of 
the Hawks.  
However, in order to maintain impartial, I did not 
get involved in those discussions about who is going to 
appoint or how the investigation is going to be run, I am an 
independent expert.  I get appointed by the Hawks to do 
my work, and I prepare an independent expert report which 
I had done in this case and presented to the Hawks on 
April 2017. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, when you were asked to 
10 
present 
to 
the 
Hawks 
in April 
2017, 
what 
did 
you 
understand the purpose of that presentation? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I was communicated by Colonel 
Magaboshe to say they require my preliminary findings, as 
the Hawks were meeting with the NPA on around that time. 
Accordingly, they required more preliminary findings as 
part of their discussions with the NPA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you have then indicated to the 
Chairperson that you did not find much enthusiasm in 
regard to your presentation.  
20 
MR SACKS:   That was my take away Chairperson from 
engagements at that time. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, in your report – sorry before we 
deal 
with 
the 
report 
itself, 
we 
talked 
about 
bank 
statements. In order for you as a private investigator, to 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 60 of 269 
 
secure bank statements of State entities or individuals, 
what process would have to be followed? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I am not party to the process of 
obtaining those bank statements.  It is a subpoena 
process, which the Police themselves have to serve, 
Section 205 subpoenas on financial institutions obtaining 
those required bank statements. 
In the ordinary course of the forensic investigation, 
I 
would 
identify 
specific 
transactions 
requiring 
investigation. I would advise the Police to say this is a 
10 
transaction or bank accounts I require and the Police 
themselves would prepare such subpoenas and obtain them 
and provide the subpoenaed bank statements to my offices 
directly. 
And I keep a record of those bank statements 
because for chain of evidence those bank statements will 
form part of my ultimate deliverable and evidence in a 
criminal proceedings.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   All the bank statements that you refer 
to and you annexed to your affidavit were obtained for you 
20 
by the Police? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In your report, and we will go through 
it in a little while.  You mentioned the following that there 
are certain bank statements, oh well certain bank accounts 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 61 of 269 
 
you had looked at is, were the main bank accounts of 
Swifambo Leasing and Swifambo Holdings.  But there were 
certain bank accounts, for example, I think you mentioned 
a Bidvest account that were apparently in the name of 
these entities, which you still required.  
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson, as a result of 
still requiring a bank statements, hence my report was 
preliminary until I received these bank accounts.   I could 
not conclude all transactions, as we will see my report 
contains hundreds of transactions, some which I could 
10 
conclude on, and some which required further information 
to conclude on.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, just to be clear as to what you 
have and what you did not have, you had all the 
statements that you required from the main bank accounts 
of Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Leasing, would that be 
that be correct, the main bank accounts?  
MR SACKS:   Chairperson that is correct.  The main bank 
accounts for Swifambo Holdings, Swifambo Leasings form 
the basis for the majority of the investigation, and the bank 
20 
accounts in this case, this Bidvest bank account was 
confirmatory of a payments where I knew where it had gone 
to I just for chain of evidence, I just needed that bank 
account to confirm, but I was able to conclude, in 
conclusion significant inflows and outflows of the Swifambo 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 62 of 269 
 
Holdings and Swifambo Leasing bank accounts, as I had 
that information.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, those these the bank 
statements in respect of those accounts that you did not 
have, did you ask the Police to issue Section 205’s in 
respect of them? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, it was as best as well, it was a 
fluid process due to the vast amount of bank statements or 
bank accounts we require.   We had received quite a few 
however, 
there 
was 
some 
that 
was 
still 
outstanding 
10 
subpoenas that had been issued that had not been 
collected from the financial institutions by the Police, as 
well as further subpoenas required.   
In the time that allowed, that I was allowed to 
perform my investigation.  I guess it would be best 
considered as one half or one third of the investigation that 
we performed due to the high value of rands, billions of 
billions or R1.82.6billion, there as one could imagine there 
is a lot of bank accounts underpinning the flow of funds.   
Hence there was certainly going to be further bank 
20 
accounts to be requested, which that process was not 
completed.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you make that clear in your 
report that in order to finalise, certainly the level one 
investigation 
you 
would 
require 
those 
statements 
in 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 63 of 269 
 
respect of those bank accounts. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that never came after - you were 
never asked whether you still required after you had 
submitted your report?  
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, you say the Hawks were to 
meet the NPA, in regard to the criminal investigation you 
were engaged by the Hawks.  You are doing the VBS 
investigation.  Do you have any communications directly 
10 
with the NPA, would they come to you and ask your opinion 
on things? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson the best way to put it is 
whenever I prepare a report, in this case for VBS a sworn 
statement I most certainly engaged with the NPA to finalise 
and settle these statements and there is a continuous 
engagement on a regular basis with the NPA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Did the NPA ever contact you with 
regard to your preliminary report on Swifambo? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I was - I do not recall ever 
20 
being contacted directly by the NPA certainly not to the 
extent that I would expect to have consulted with the 
prosecuting authorities in such an arena in such as the 
Swifambo report. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But were there any communications 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 64 of 269 
 
between yourself and the NPA? 
MR SACKS:   Not that I recall Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you say in paragraphs the - 
paragraph 13 that the report was still being finalised but 
you had completed your analysis in regard to the payment 
received and made in respect of about R2.6billion. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now just - we do not need to go into 
exact figures.  How much did PRASA pay in respect of the 
Swifambo contract?  You can just give us a ballpark figure.  
10 
MR SACKS:   R2.6billion, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And to whom did it make those 
payments? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson PRASA made those payments to 
Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Leasing. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We going to deal – your report deals 
with those, are they a related company? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, Swifambo Holdings is the 
holding company for Swifambo Leasing. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And who are the main persons 
20 
involved with Swifambo Holdings and Swifambo Leasing? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, to my understanding, Mr 
Auswell Mashaba was the main person running Swifambo 
Holdings, Swifambo Rail Leasing.  There were additional 
directors 
per 
CIPC 
of 
those 
entities, 
but 
from 
the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 65 of 269 
 
information that was available to me, it appeared that Mr 
Mashaba was the person running the companies. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   If the Hawks came back to you now 
to say look please finalise the report, is there still a lot of 
work to be done, I am just talking about the first level? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson for the first level parts, no not 
much work would be done.  Again, the first level part would 
be confirming the flow of funds, the payments or utilisation 
of money out of the Swifambo bank accounts to those 
recipients, that does not require a lot of work, that was 
10 
clear in my report. 
What would require a bit more substantive work, 
Chairperson was those recipients of the money from 
Swifambo what they did with it and where that money went, 
it is a process of obtaining further bank statements to 
confirm those flow of funds. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, we know that annexure RS3 is 
your report, which is the third annexure to your affidavit.  
Then there are further annexures RS4.1 to RS4.4, what are 
those just in brief?  
20 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson those are the Swifambo Rail 
leasing and Swifambo Rail Holding bank statements.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Those are the ones that you used for 
your level one analysis? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 66 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni, I know that when we took the 
tea break I said the purpose was so that when we started 
with Mr Sacks we would go right through but there is a 
need for us to take a short adjournment. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  
 
Let 
us 
just 
take 
a 
ten 
minutes’ 
adjournment. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us proceed.  Just remember 
Mr Soni that you are competing with the aircon noise. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So try and speak up. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I need to, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I have been told that the aircon, you 
either switch it off or it is just like this.  And I am told that 
sometimes on your side it is much hotter it seems than this 
side.  I do not know why.  So sometimes I do not feel that it 
20 
is so hot but I hear that it is hot on that side of the room.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   So let us see what we can do. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 67 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Sacks, we were talking about RS-
41 to RS - of RS-4.1 to RS-4.4.  Those are the supporting 
documents that you received from the bank. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson.  Amongst a few other bank 
accounts, these were the main Swifambo Rail Leasing and 
Rail Holdings bank statements. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  And then in Annexure RS-5 
you set out the list of documents that you had. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you say in paragraphs 18 and 19 
10 
that that document is contained in about 20 arch level files 
and you have... 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, having regards to the 
contents of the report, they are not going to serve any 
purpose before this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Let us then go to your report 
Mr Sacks.  And I just want to say because it may be helpful 
that you in your index set out the headings under which the 
20 
report has been drafted. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Now we do not need to deal 
with 1 because you have indicated that this is especially 
for the Hawks and it has a measure of confidentiality about 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 68 of 269 
 
it. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  And then you set out the 
background to the investigation and there are matches that 
constitute or there are several matches that constitute the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well...  I am sorry. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Soni.  I do note Mr Sacks 
the – your report, RS-3 is not marked draft or preliminary 
10 
or have I missed that?  Oh, there it is, draft preliminary 
report.  I saw in – you know, much – the first line it says 
Report 4 without saying preliminary or draft. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I see later on down the page you 
have got draft preliminary report. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you make the point on that same 
page Mr Sacks that this report is for discussion purposes 
20 
only and that, I take it, it arises from the fact that you have 
been asked to appear with the Hawks on the 19 t h for the 
purposes of discussing the report. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But there was no discussion thereon. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 69 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  At that meeting, I take it that you 
would take those who were presenting, who attended the 
meeting, through the report, at least in terms of the main 
features.  Is that right? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you indicated what is set out in 
the report, namely that you have looked at the fund or the 
flow of funds from PRASA to the two Swifambo entities and 
10 
then from the Swifambo entities who are the individuals or 
entities. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you made it clear that it was 
based on the bank statements that they had procured for 
you.   
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you are saying that this was - 
the report came about as a result of the appointment of 
Swifambo to – or the award of a tender to Swifambo by 
20 
PRASA. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  And then you refer to a 
Hillbrow 
case 
number 
and 
you 
indicate 
that 
the 
complainant was Mr Mamabolo. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 70 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now just for context sake.  Is the 
Mr Mamabolo who accompanied Mr Molefe to this meeting 
with Mr Mashaba in July 2015? 
MR SACKS:   That is my understanding Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And did you have the affidavits he 
had – or the statements he had made in support of this 
criminal complaint? 
MR SACKS:   I had access to those affidavits Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you relied on them as well? 
10 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson where relevant. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  And then you had the Auditor-
General’s report of the 31 s t of March, dealing with fruitless 
and wasteful expenditure. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In relation to this Swifambo matter? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson.  I must add that the 
Auditor-General’s report and Mr Mamabolo’s affidavit it is 
all cursory background information.  The focus of my 
investigation was purely on the bank records of Swifambo 
20 
and where relevant if those other pieces of information 
could augment my findings, I would use it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What though you do in your report 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 71 of 269 
 
and just correct me if I am wrong, why all of this is 
important.  You try and correlate the various complaints 
that were made with the flow of funds to and from 
Swifambo. 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  So Chairperson, the best way to 
explain it is.  The Swifambo contract is obviously it is of 
high value.  It is quite a story from the moment it was 
accepted to ultimate a signature and then flow of funds. 
 
I was – I took it upon myself in preparing this 
report which would not form an affidavit in criminal 
10 
proceedings.  This is a report of findings for the Hawks.   
 
I thought it would be beneficial to the Hawks to 
actually summarise all the civil pleadings because it puts 
out and it explains clearly how the whole tender came 
about, who the parties were to the tender, what the 
irregularities were to the tender. 
 
So that when the police could read the flow of 
funds they could get context and it would make sense.  If I 
just prepared a report of flow of funds without the story 
that led up to the money going from PRASA to Swifambo, it 
20 
would not have been as beneficial or as useful to the 
police.   
 
And I thought – obviously due to the volume of 
civil 
papers 
underpinning 
the 
application 
to 
set 
the 
contract aside, I included all the applicable findings in 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 72 of 269 
 
those affidavits, Mr Molefe and Mr Massaro’s affidavit in 
this report.   
 
And my findings were the flow of funds, the 
money.  That was my detailed findings.  That is what I was 
providing an expert opinion on.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But what it does is, anybody reading 
the report is going to say:  Well, this money went to 
company X.  And if you look at the allegations are made, 
you say it probably went because of that allegation. 
MR SACKS:   It connects the dot Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Then we have already dealt 
with how you came to be appointed and so on.  So we can 
leave that.  And then – that is paragraph 3, the rest of 
paragraphs 2 and 3. 
 
Now in paragraph 4, you introduce or you say 
that that is an introduction to the investigation.  Could you 
briefly summarise what the purpose of this investigation 
was and what were you trying to achieve with this? 
 
I know you have said part of this but just in 
relation to that question. 
20 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, my mandate was to perform a 
flow of funds analysis of the Swifambo bank accounts.  
Swifambo as collectively dispense from the Rail Holdings 
and Swifambo Rail Leasing.   
 
My objective was to analyse how the money from 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 73 of 269 
 
PRASA flow to Swifambo and what that money was used 
for.  How it was utilised.  So that my mandate – just to do – 
my objective was to give an opinion on those findings, on 
the R 2.6 billion specifically. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And to look whether there were 
unusual payments or the timing was unusual.  Would that 
be correct? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then in paragraph 5, you deal with 
the scope and methodology.  So we were talking about the 
10 
bank accounts that you looked at put to you the details of 
which you got through the Hawks via to Section 205 
subpoenas issued to the financial institution.  Now you 
looked at mainly two bank accounts.  Can you tell the 
Chairperson which those were? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the two main bank accounts 
was a Swifambo Rail Leasing, Standard Bank account 
number 022682570 and the Swifambo Holdings, Standard 
Bank account number 202538117. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And why did you choose those two 
20 
accounts? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I choice those two accounts 
because those were the two bank accounts into which 
PRASA 
made 
payments 
for 
the 
Swifambo 
contract.  
Specifically, the contract states that the payment should be 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 74 of 269 
 
made to Swifambo Rail Leasing.   
 
However, payments were also made to Swifambo 
Rail Holdings specifically the first payments which was an 
irregularity in terms of what the contract stated between 
PRASA and Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that is why you analysed both 
because to see where the payments were made in terms of 
the contract. 
MR SACKS:   ...the utilisation, I was also performing 
analysis in terms of how the contract, from a cash loan 
10 
point of view was being performed.  I did not note that from 
the outset the funds between the two companies were 
being comingled.  So for the purposes of this report, I 
clearly stated, I see that is the one and the same entity 
because there was – you cannot define the cash flow 
activity one come direct separately.   
 
Swifambo Rail Holdings, Swifambo Leasing, the 
money is seen as one and PRASA paid into both those 
accounts even though again they were only supposed to 
pay into the Rail Leasing’s Standard Bank account. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that is because of the term of 
the contract? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Now at paragraph – and we 
will come to that.  I mean, I think you do deal with it in 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 75 of 269 
 
more detail.  In paragraph 5.2 you make the point that this 
is a first level analysis. 
 
And I know you dealt with it a little earlier.  Can 
you explain to the Chairperson what you were try to 
achieve with a first level analysis and then what you were 
trying to achieve with a second level analysis. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, again.  The first level, as I 
explain in my report, is simply confirming flow of funds 
from PRASA to Swifambo and who Swifambo paid.  How 
they utilised that money.  Then I drew a line. 
10 
 
And then I said the second level analysis is 
those recipients of money from Swifambo, how did they 
utilise their money.  As – again, the flow of funds analysis 
was the very nature when you are dealing with lot of bank 
accounts it requires a lot of supporting information. 
 
At this time when I prepared the reports, we 
were still again in the midst of completing first level 
analysis... the money which was mostly completed subject 
to one or two provisos which I put in the report. 
 
But then it was anticipated and explained clearly 
20 
that I needed to the second level analysis in order to 
conclude my investigation and provide an ultimate opinion 
as I was mandated to do which again I was not – I was not 
– I never completed. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now with the first level analysis, you 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 76 of 269 
 
can just conduct that by looking at the bank accounts, 
where the money came from.  So you compare the source 
of the money to the account in which it was received.  
Would that be correct? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now what would the second level – in 
order to conduct a proper second level analysis, what more 
would you need? 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
PRASA 
pays 
Swifambo 
R 2.6 billion.  I see the money coming into Swifambo’s 
10 
bank accounts.  I see entity A had been – as a recipient of 
R 30 million from Swifambo.   
 
I – the first, through subpoena, I get entity A’s 
bank statements.  I can confirm then that Swifambo pays 
money to that account.  What entity A did with the money?   
 
Considering 
how 
all 
the 
allegations 
and 
suspicions what the money was used for who, for example, 
meetings between Mr Molefe and Mr Mashaba and other 
investigations. 
 
Remember, this is a – Chairperson, this is a – an 
20 
all encompassing investigation.  I am just providing the 
flow of funds but there are also allegations and suspicions 
as to what the money is used for.   
 
And I take that information and I marry it up to 
the flow of funds to see, yes, there is an allegation that 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 77 of 269 
 
this person received money, gratuitous payments.  The 
bank statements have now shown that that person received 
this gratuitous payments where there is no commercial 
basis and so forth. 
 
So the first level is to say:  Well, here is the 
payment from Swifambo into entity A’s bank accounts.  I 
had entity’s A bank account.  I confirmed the receipt.  Now 
what did entity A do with that money?  Where did that 
money go?  That is the second level analysis and that is 
where I required more information to perform that... 
10 
 
So we can say, ultimately, at least at the end of 
the day, at least this is where PRASA’s money gone based 
on all the allegations and the suspicions. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now I take it one of the questions in 
his case that you were looking at is.  Where the person 
who received the money from the Swifambo entities directly 
or indirectly.  Where the person who received the money or 
did the persons perform some service which added value 
for the money they received? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, to summarise.  As it is set out 
20 
in the civil papers, it was established and judged by the 
Supreme Court, to my understanding, I was not part of that 
process, that Swifambo – the contract was irregular and it 
was set aside and Swifambo was a fronting company. 
 
In a nutshell the majority, the bulk majority of 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 78 of 269 
 
the funds would be going to a third party, foreign company 
who was manufacturing the locomotives. 
 
And my analysis shows that Swifambo...  Well, it 
has been established that Swifambo had no business 
operations.  It had no cause or validation for the amounts 
that it had expended over and above the money that flowed 
to Vossloh or – Vossloh being the foreign manufacturer of 
the locomotives and sometimes to South African Revenue 
Services. 
 
I state – it states in those papers that there is no 
10 
commercial rationale for all these payments.  At the time 
that I – well, information I was based on, you are looking 
at a three, four hundred million rands over and above the 
payments that went to Vossloh and to SARS. 
 
And there is – as I say, there is no commercial 
basis from what I could see, my independent opinion and 
supported through this whole process, why Swifambo would 
be making those payments.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then at paragraph 5.7.1, you make 
the point about the accounting records of Swifambo. 
20 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson.  So my investigation was - 
focussed solely on the bank statements.  When you are 
performing a forensic investigation you would hope to 
receive additional supporting information that could help 
you unravel the cause or business reason for a payment. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 79 of 269 
 
 
And each and every company would have a book 
of records and supporting information.  So for example, 
there would be a general ledger or a balance sheet and 
income 
statement 
or 
invoices 
that 
could 
help 
me 
understand or help an investigator understand or could 
point the investigator to say:  Well, what could this 
payment be for? 
 
Not saying that the accounting records would be 
accurate.  Generally in an investigation where there is 
suspicion of fraud or corruption or theft, those documents 
10 
could be manipulated. 
 
However, all I had was the bank statements but 
as I state in my report, the bank statements were revealing 
enough.  The bank statements say – says all. 
 
I do not believe that there would be supporting 
information.  I just made that point just to qualify that all I 
had was bank statements.  It is... 
 
And I do understand that subsequent in the 
liquidation 
of 
Swifambo, 
the 
liquidator 
supported 
my 
conclusions or the findings that I had and the liquidator 
20 
would 
have 
access 
to 
financial 
records. 
 
And 
the 
liquidator ’s report substantively supported my findings at 
this time.  However, the liquidator ’s report was not part of 
this criminal investigation process. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  I mean, in fact, it has only been 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 80 of 269 
 
drawn up in February 2020. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, if I was allowed to complete the 
investigation, I would have obtained this information and 
drawn these conclusions.  I had, again, in my independent 
expert view, the flow of funds supports all the allegations 
made. 
 
And as counsel and I go through, we will see the 
quantum’s of money flowing out and who the recipients of 
that money is, PRASA’s money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you need in order to complete 
10 
your investigation? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, amongst other things, I need 
more bank accounts.  There is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the position that all that the Hawks 
needed to do is to come back to you and say continue.  We 
give you the authority to continue.  And to the extent that 
you may need them to play a supportive role in your 
investigation by doing the paperwork that may need to be 
done in order to obtain bank - information on bank 
accounts of recipients.  Is that all that you would need 
20 
from them? 
MR SACKS:   That is probably the main pieces of 
information I would need.  Obviously, there would be – in 
all investigations be some other information that would 
arise out of – the investigation is not explored. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 81 of 269 
 
 
You 
are 
correct 
Chairperson 
that 
the 
bank 
accounts is what I really needed.  If I can continue on the 
same trajectory that I was busy with and the toing and 
froing with the...  The colonel... 
 
I was busy working with a very competent 
colonel at the time who obviously was not involved at high 
decision making in the Hawks but he certainly was a very 
helpful resource. 
 
And we were working closely together and I said:  
Colonel, I need this bank account.  He will go and get that 
10 
bank account for me.  That stopped.  So, yes, you are 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So basically, you would need the 
authorisation – you would have needed their authorisation 
that you must continue and then to the extent that legally 
you might need them to do certain things for you because 
you could not do them.  Then they would just do that. 
 
But if you could complete the investigation 
without them, but legally, you would still complete it, is it 
not? 
20 
MR SACKS:   Yes, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a way of completing it without 
them? 
MR SACKS:   I cannot complete the investigations without 
them.  So I need the authority to go and get subpoenas for 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 82 of 269 
 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is if you do it for them. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, if I do it for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not do it for them, you do not 
need their permission. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you have got the report. 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  Yes, that is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have done the investigation.  You 
have got the report. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They are not giving you the go-ahead. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is in the public interest that you 
should complete the investigation.   
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if there is another body that can 
legally say we are interested in you completing this.  I am 
20 
not sure it should be a problem. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson.  Obviously ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know if they...  I have just 
sitting with the report for four years.  They can have any 
grounds to come and say:  No, no.  Please, do not do it for 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 83 of 269 
 
somebody else.  We are interested in it. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But I am just asking from the point 
of view of your willingness. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That provided everything was done 
legally ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you would have no problem. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson that is correct.  I did not 
10 
stop the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  [laughs] 
MR SACKS:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, yesterday we – there was a – or 
was it the day before, there was a debate about whether a 
certain sentence in a letter meant that the ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...he wanted to stop the investigations.  
[laughs]  Okay alright.  Continue Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chair.  Now in your – 
20 
in paragraph 7, you indicate the information that is still 
outstanding. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you confirm that that is all that is 
outstanding, as the Chairperson said, if you were to 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 84 of 269 
 
complete your report. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your estimate of how much time 
you would need if you were to be asked legally to do 
whatever was outstanding? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I will not lie.  It is not a – it is 
quite a difficult question because I do not control the 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  I, you know, it is a process of 
10 
information flow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   Requesting further information analysing that 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   There is also either – as I say, in this 
investigation 
I 
was 
assisted 
by 
other 
investigators 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   ...who helped me ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   With certain aspects. 
MR SACKS:   ...with certain aspects of the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SACKS:   The key part of such a wide or vast flow of 
funds analysis is forensic ...[intervenes]  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 85 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SACKS:   ...hearty assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SACKS:   In terms of putting all the bank records into 
some kind of electronic format... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SACKS:   ...to make that investigation quick and 
efficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   It is costly also. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SACKS:   When you are looking at – well, with 20 lever 
arch files already of bank accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SACKS:   To try and flow – to marry the flow of funds 
amongst the bank accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   And some bank accounts Chairperson could 
have thousands of transactions.  Some would only have 
two transactions and you have to make a call.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SACKS:   There are a hundred transactions.  I need 
the bank to tell me which bank account it went to.  And just 
say, for example Chairperson, it went to an individual 
company.  We have to establish through police work or 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 86 of 269 
 
intelligence work who that individual is, what company is 
that, what is the rationale. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SACKS:   By very nature, this type of investigation is 
concealment of funds.  The information is not readily 
available.  And as soon as you go and ask an individual 
entity:  What do you use this money for?   
 
And not putting up their hand up and say:  Oh, 
sorry.  I do not have any basis for this.  You know, so there 
is a large – it is a team, it is a working team of which I am 
10 
one aspect.  However, I am the person who is doing the 
flow of funds analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SACKS:   I was the appointed person for the money.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is difficult to say? 
MR SACKS:   No, so I would say hypothetically, it took one 
year to get to this point amongst all the reasons of 
meetings and correspondence and getting information, 
maybe one more year to complete the second flow 
analysis. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SACKS:   It is hard – it is difficult to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, may I just point out and 
it relates to the question you have asked.  We have 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 87 of 269 
 
consulted with the liquidator who is going to be our next 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And for various reasons, they have 
had to do a forensic analysis.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So it may be that the question – and 
what is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...whatever is on your mind 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Might be answered. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, and one can take the matter 
further on that basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That some of the work has since 
been – well, some work has since been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Of a forensic nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I did not pursue that too much with 
him but I know that there is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  No, that is alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Ja. 
MR SACKS:   Counsel, if I may?  I just one point I should 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 88 of 269 
 
add at this point is that crucial to any investigation is a 
case plan of which a forensic audit forms one aspect of 
that plan.  I was not aware of that case plan.   
 
I, in a meeting leading up to my report, there was a 
meeting just before I sent my report.  There were still 
discussions of what is the case plan.  All this information 
in my report, not all of it is going to find its way into the 
statement, into criminal evidence.  The NPA might say no, 
we do not want you to pursue that payment, we do not want 
you to pursue this payment.  So that aspect still has to be 
10 
done, that case plan.  I cannot say well, I have finished my 
report it is now time to go arrest people.  There is a lot of 
teamwork involved even just to get to that point which in 
another investigation I am doing very similar, I see how 
that works.  Yes, we need to finish the work for this 
investigation to complete and, as counsel says, there is 
more information, which I never had the time because of 
the liquidation which would escalate completing the flow of 
funds, then we move on to the charges, who is going to get 
charged, how are they going to get charged, what is the 
20 
evidence, affidavits, supporting and so forth, so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You have had a look at the 
liquidator ’s report.  I am not talking about the forensic 
report.  We are going to come to that because what I 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 89 of 269 
 
understand you to say is that what you have found is to a 
large extent reinforced by what is contained in the 
liquidator ’s report. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But we will deal with that to see 
where 
there 
is 
a 
synergy 
between 
your 
so-called 
preliminary report and their final report to shareholders of 
February last. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, now you make the point in 
10 
paragraph 8 that your analysis does not constitute an audit 
for the purposes of international standards on auditing.  I 
take it that is a disclaimer of sorts. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson, it is just a pure disclaimer. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Then let us look at paragraph 9 where 
you deal with the background to the appointment of 
Swifambo. 
 
Many 
of 
these 
details 
or 
much 
of 
this 
information has been presented to the Commission mainly 
by Mr Molefe when he gave evidence and he gave quite 
extensive evidence.  I would just like you to indicate what 
20 
in regard to the background the Chairperson should keep 
in mind? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I guess what is most important 
to this tender and as I have set out in – how it is explained 
in the civil application is how at all times the – the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 90 of 269 
 
Swifambo contract was always intended to go – or the 
locomotive tender was always intended to go to Swifambo 
and how it was set up inter alia along the request for 
proposals, the bidding, the companies who participated, 
the valuation, the adjudication, it all points to Swifambo 
receiving this contract and what is also important is that 
Swifambo was not  - they never – there were glaring 
irregularities in terms of Swifambo being that company in 
terms of not having properly registered for tax purposes, 
not having the relative experience in rail and the fact that 
10 
they were going to outsource the manufacture completely 
to another foreign company which at the – until – what is 
important is that until Swifambo actually signed the 
contract with PRASA there was no contractual relationship 
with 
their 
partner 
or 
subcontractor 
and 
that 
whole 
relationship was not properly detailed or transparent in this 
whole process.  So bearing in mind how Swifambo got it 
and the pricing of the contract ultimately it is a – PRASA 
was pay – when it signed a rand denominator contract, in 
actual fact it was a Euro contract, all of that is just – it was 
20 
irregular from the beginning part right until end of signing 
the contract and ultimately to the flow of funds and you 
receive money.  So I guess, to counsel’s point, I hope I 
have clarified that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I just wanted to raise one point that in 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 91 of 269 
 
paragraph 11.6 of your report – you see, in paragraph 9 
you deal with the background to the appointment of 
Swifambo, I just want – and that is why I though, you know, 
point out that the date of the contract is important or the 
date of the issue of the tender, which being December 
2011, because maybe we should first look at paragraph 
11.6 to 11.11 because those are matters – what, 11.6, 7 
and 8 because those are matters that come before the 
issue of the tender. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Will you deal with those – and I know 
it is before the tender. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Can you set out the important events 
that preceded the issue of the tender? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, as I read from my report, 
PRASA published the request for expressions of interest 
which is RFEI on 24 and 26 July 2009 that …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that you are reading from 
paragraph 11 …[intervenes] 
20 
MR SACKS:   11.6, sorry.  Paragraph 11.7, May 2011, the 
first involvement of Vossloh who ultimately was the partner 
or subcontractor to Swifambo inspected PRASA’s fleet.  
June 2011, in paragraph 11.8, a Mr Daniel Mthimkhulu, who 
was the former PRASA chief engineer authorised the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 92 of 269 
 
supply of air conditioning systems from Vossloh and then 
that led up – those are the events leading up to the RFP 
being published on 27 and 28 November 2011.   
What was important in paragraph 11.10, that the 
RFP was collected by someone from a company called the 
S Group as it was denoted on the register and not from a 
representative of Swifambo and this, in paragraph 11.11, 
Swifambo responded to the tender as Mafori Finance 
Vryheid, trading as Swifambo Leasing on 27 February 
2012.  The subparagraph to that is Swifambo Holdings 
10 
acquired Mafori Finance Vryheid on 7 February 2012, so 
the company that responded to the tender was essentially 
a brand new company, it had only been around for the 
purposes of, I guess, responding to this tender was 20 
days old. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now the S Group.  We have heard 
evidence on a different matter relating to a payment being 
made to the Siyaya Group.  Is this the same group you are 
talking about? 
MR SACKS:   My understanding, Chairperson, is there is a 
20 
collection of companies under the nomenclature S Group 
including Siyaya and as my report will go into, I identify 
specific Siyaya entities that were beneficiary of funds from 
Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And who was the person behind the S 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 93 of 269 
 
Group and the Siyaya Group? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, my investigation, as my report 
sets out, is the actual signatories of bank accounts and 
directors of companies that received money from Swifambo 
was an individual by the name of Makhensa Mabunda. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  On behalf of the S Group? 
MR SACKS:   On behalf of S Group or linked companies. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right, then you make the point that 
the tender was issued on the 2 December 2011 – sorry, the 
RFP was published on that day and there were six people 
10 
who responded one of them being Swifambo.  Now in 
paragraph 9.4 you list the shareholders of Swifambo.  Who 
were they? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the shareholders at the time of 
Swifambo 
was 
Mr Auswell 
Mashaba, 
Identity 
Capital 
Partners (Pty) Ltd, Thintamakhosi Empowerment Trust and 
Hadassah Mining House (Pty) Ltd. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay, we can then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe that might be the convenient 
time, Mr Soni? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the lunch adjournment, we 
will return at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 94 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us continue.  Now Mr Sacks, we 
are dealing with the shareholders of Swifambo on page 855 
and you had identified them and then thereafter on page 
857, paragraph 9.11 you set out the directors of Swifambo 
Leasing.  Who were they? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, the directors per CICP were 
Auswell Mashaba, Cynthia Michelle Parish, Jacqueline 
Nowandle Mboweni and Makshoni Daniel Mashele. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to Ms Parish, what was 
the information that you had? 
10 
MR SACKS:  The information per the investigation was that 
Ms Parish was a United States citizen.  She was recorded 
as the chief legal counsel of an entity named Musa Capital 
and that Musa Capital was a beneficiary of funds from 
Swifambo, significant funds.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that, you identify the amounts in 
your report. 
MR SACKS:  Yes, I do Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Now at paragraph 10 you deal 
with the payments that Swifambo received from PRASA and 
20 
you deal with this later again, but there are two, if you look 
at table 1, two of the eight payments were made to 
Swifambo Rail Holdings and the others were made to 
Swifambo Rail Leasing.  What is the significance just in 
terms of the contractual issues? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 95 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, the contract between Swifambo 
and PRASA clearly stated that the payments were to be 
made into a Standard Bank account held in the name of 
Swifambo Rail Leasing, and my report details that two of 
the payments made by PRASA to Swifambo being the first 
payment and a payment later on, were paid into Swifambo 
Rail Holdings bank account, which was not in accordance 
with the contract.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in paragraph 10.3 you say that 
the first payment of four hundred and sixty thousand, 
10 
R460 526 306-00 was made to Swifambo Leasing, is that 
correct? 
MR SACKS:  That payment was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, to Swifambo Holdings. 
MR SACKS:  Yes, that was paid to Swifambo Holdings.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And the significance is the first 
payment is made to a non-contractual entity. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But you also make another point 
about the timing between the conclusion of the contract 
20 
and the first payment.  How many days elapsed between 
the signing of the contract and the first payment? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, the contracts between PRASA 
and Swifambo was signed on 25 Marc 2013.  The first 
payment from PRASA to Swifambo in the amount of 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 96 of 269 
 
R460 526 216-00 was paid from PRASA to Swifambo on 5 
April 2013, 11 days after the contract was signed.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And the amount was 460 million? 
MR SACKS:  Yes, and Chairperson it was paid prior to the 
performance of the condition president which required a 
performance 
bond 
to 
be 
provided 
by 
Swifambo 
Rail 
Leasing, which was not in place at the time the payment 
was made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  460 million of course Mr Soni being a 
nearest figure rounding. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Oh, I beg your pardon.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The actual amount is more than that.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is so.  Now later in your report 
you deal with who were the beneficiaries of that first batch 
of payment, I mean that first payment.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now can I ask you was Vossloh - who 
was the person providing the locomotives, a beneficiary of 
20 
any of that payment from ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson, they were.  As my report 
explains Vossloh was paid 116 days after Swifambo 
received the money, in an amount of 290 million rand.  Of 
the 460 million, 290 was paid to Vossloh.  Prior to Vossloh 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 97 of 269 
 
receiving 290 million rand, approximately 150 million rand 
was expanded to other individuals or entities. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And the payment to Vossloh was made 
119 days after the contract.  After receipt of the money? 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
116 
days 
Chairperson. 
 
Three 
days 
difference.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Now one of the factors, sorry 
and then you point out that in paragraph 10.4 but we are 
going to deal with each of those payments in a little while, 
but you point out that six of the payments were made to 
10 
Leasing and two to Holding. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  What was the total amount to 
Holding? 
MR SACKS:  The total amount paid to Holdings, I have not 
calculated it on the report, approximately 900 million rand.  
904 million rand. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And this is a non-contracting party. 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You are now where about, 
20 
still at ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, 10.4 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  10.4 on page 859. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 98 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I thought we should move into the 
meat because a lot of it is background and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine, that is fine.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in paragraph 11.1 to 11.5, you 
deal with matters that constitute what you say are unusual 
features about the contract or the award and the contract.  
Would that be correct? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Could you briefly summarise for the 
Chairperson what those features were? 
10 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I assume counsel is referring to 
the non-compliance? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
MR SACKS:  By Swifambo with regards to the tender and I 
deal with this specifically in paragraph 11.12.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, before we get there.  
MR SACKS:  Sorry. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Just in relation to the complaints that 
Mr Molefe had made. 
MR SACKS:  Excuse me counsel.  Chairperson, as I 
20 
explained earlier for the benefit of the police, I included 
the summary of the civil applications, and commentaries 
that were included in those applications that were relevant 
to portraying the picture of Swifambo for the police and I 
utilised the founding and replying affidavits by Mr Popo 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 99 of 269 
 
Molefe and the responding affidavit proposed by Falice 
Mosaro who was, he claimed he was a group chief 
executive officer of Swifambo.  In summary Popo Molefe in 
his affidavits, he contends that Swifambo had no previous 
involvement in the rail industry, prior to the award of the 
contract and was not in a position to perform the contract.  
Swifambo was set up for the sole purpose of obtaining the 
tender and had a fronting relationship with Vossloh.  
Swifambo had no business or commercial operations, other 
than to be the middle man to earn the commission in a 
10 
locomotive tender.  In fact there was no evidence that 
Swifambo actually performed any work, other than to be a 
contracting party.  Swifambo did not incur any cost of 
manufacture or any related cost relating to the completion 
of locomotives and essentially they added no value to the 
performance 
of 
the 
contract, 
which 
Mosaro 
did 
not 
explicitly deny in his responding affidavit.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now you have pointed out to me, that 
when this matter went to the Supreme Court of Appeal, the 
Supreme Court of Appeal very succinctly described what 
20 
Swifambo’s position was.  How did you describe it?  The 
passage that you have ...[intervenes] 
MR SACKS:  Can you be more specific? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  You had, remember you showed me a 
passage. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 100 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  Yes, yes excuse me.  I stated in my report 
that Swifambo obtained a three and a half billion rand 
tender for the supply of locomotives when it had no offices 
or infrastructure, no experience in the rail industry and no 
contracts to obtain and supply the locomotives at the time 
it got awarded the tender.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And that cult was adopted by the 
Supreme Court of Appeal? 
MR SACKS:  I cannot confirm that, sorry Chairperson.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now in regard to ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Soni, you may ... it would be 
interesting to see what the difference is between the role 
played by Swifambo in this transaction and the role played 
in the asbestos project by the joint venture between Mr 
Sodi and Mr Mbambane. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You will recall because you know the 
matter. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That there Mr Sodie Mr Mbambane’s joint 
20 
venture, I forget what the name of the joint venture was, 
obtained a contract from the housing department of the 
province about 250 million rand in order to remove the 
asbestos ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 101 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the houses in the Free State, but they 
themselves did not do any work.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  They got other people to do the work, 
paid them some money and kept the bulk of the money 
themselves.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But they themselves did not do any work. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be interesting.  
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Yes, the notion of fronting 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And benefitting from fronting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it may well be that Mr Sodie and Mr 
Mbambane’s entity was not funding as such, but what may 
be common between that venture and Swifambo, is you get 
a contract.  You do not actually do the work. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you get the money. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Money, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You get paid.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, and then you pay where there is 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 102 of 269 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you pay whoever, ja.  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please, and the analogy is 
most appropriate.  Now we have dealt, oh sorry.  I was 
going to say that in paragraph 11.5.7 you make the point 
that the person who filed the answering affidavit in the 
Swifambo High Court matter was a Mr Mosaro.  He is from 
Italy as I understand it? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I cannot confirm where Mr 
Mosaro actually comes from. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I understand though he is not from 
South Africa.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, what paragraph did you say? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, 11.5.7 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay ja.  Mosaro.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, now Chairperson, may I just 
make this point but I do not want to take too much of time.  
What the Supreme Court of Appeal, what the high court 
[indistinct], it said these are the allegations Mr Molefe 
made in his founding affidavit and that is what the witness 
20 
has more or less summarised.  Then it looked at the 
answering affidavit and the answering affidavit was to this 
effect.  All the complaints that PRASA makes are PRASA 
related irregularities.  We do not know about them.  
Thinking that because they are PRASA related activities, it 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 103 of 269 
 
could retain the benefits from irregularities, not knowing 
that our law has caught up with such persons.  So the point 
I am trying to make Chairperson is both the High Court and 
the Supreme Court of Appeal say that these allegations 
have not been denied and they adopt these allegations as 
part of the irregular process and procedures that were 
adopted in awarding the tender to Swifambo.  So I am not 
going to spend much time on this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Except to say that at various parts 
10 
when Mr Sacks has testified, I will indicate that that is 
contained in this paragraph of the SCA judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no because those are already 
findings of the Supreme Court of, High Court or and we can 
go and read them from there, but for purposes of the 
record and the fabric ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You can say these are the findings that 
were made that are relevant. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we move on. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
Absolutely. 
 
As 
you 
please 
Chairperson.  Now in paragraph 10 point, 11.6 to 11.11 we 
have been through already just before lunch hour.  Those 
were the matters that arose even prior to the issue of the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 104 of 269 
 
RFP. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And I just want you to keep that in 
mind, because you make a point later on that it looks like 
the whole bid was, I mean the whole process was tailored 
to suit Swifambo. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Then you go at paragraph 
11.12 onwards, to look at their non-compliance with the 
requirements of the RFP.  What are the main areas of non-
10 
compliance? 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
Chairperson, 
particular 
statutory 
non-
compliance was there is no tax clearance certificate 
submitted 
for 
Vossloh 
as 
required 
for 
joint 
venture 
partners. 
 
There 
was 
no 
tax 
clearance 
certificate 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, each time will you just give me 
a minute.  That Chairperson, is adopted by the SCA in 
paragraph 10, that exact finding or that finding is made by 
the, it accepts it and says that is what happens.  Sorry, 
20 
just go ahead.  
MR SACKS:  “The tax clearance certificate submitted by 
Swifambo did not contain a VAT number.” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That too at paragraph 10 Chair.  
MR SACKS:  “The bid did not comply with the local content 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 105 of 269 
 
requirements as the locomotives were to be 
designed and manufactured in Spain.” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is at paragraph 11 of the SCA 
judgment Chair.  
MR SACKS:  “The bid did not contain evidence to support 
Swifambo’s claims that it and its shareholders 
had previous experience in the rail industry, 
and 
in 
terms 
of 
which 
the 
final 
further 
[indistinct] pursuant to the RFP was required 
to.” 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is at 11 and 12 of the SCA 
judgment Chairperson. 
MR SACKS:  “At the time that the bid was submitted, 
Vossloh was not a co-bidder as the founder 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, is that complete?  It looks like the 
sentence is not complete.  
MR SACKS:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is: 
“1, 2, 3, 4 there that was required to be 
20 
technically and financially qualified to provide the 
solution sought by PRASA,” 
and then: 
“11.12.4.2 have sufficient experience in similar 
projects.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 106 of 269 
 
11.12.4.3 have the commitment and resources 
to provide the services required in the project, 
and  
11.12.4.4 
be 
able 
to 
carry 
out 
all 
the 
obligations of the contract.” 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson, sorry I jumped to the next 
paragraph.  My mistake.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so whoever reads the transcript 
wonders, there is a gap.  You know, the sentence that is 
incomplete and then there is a next sentence.  
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just wanted just to complete that.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And those are essential requirements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Because that is the purpose to say 
can you, we are going to pay you, can you do the job? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So yes Mr Sacks, I may have pushed 
you along a bit, but carry on. 
MR SACKS:  The Chairperson corrected me.  The next 
20 
paragraph: 
“At the time the bid was submitted Vossloh 
Espanya SA was not a co-bidder as defined in 
the RFP and Swifambo had not concluded a 
subcontract with Vossloh.  The bid indicated 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 107 of 269 
 
that 
Swifambo 
would 
rely 
solely 
on 
the 
experience 
and 
technical 
capabilities 
of 
Vossloh Espanya SA to fulfil its obligations.  
There 
was 
no 
legal 
relationship 
between 
Swifambo and Vossloh Espanya and therefore 
no indication that Swifambo could perform.” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is reflected in paragraph 12 of 
the SCA judgment.  
MR SACKS:  “Furthermore the bid indicated that Swifambo 
intended to enter into a joint venture with 
10 
Vossloh Southern Africa.  There is a reference 
to Vossloh Southern Africa Holdings Pty Ltd 
which was incorporated as a shelf company, 
Main Street 951 Pty Ltd by 29 November 2011.  
On 17 May 2012 the company’s name changed 
to Vossloh Southern African Holdings Pty Ltd.” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Can I just go back to the date of 
incorporation of Vossloh Southern Africa.  You see it is the 
290 t h of November 2011?  You see that?   
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is paragraph 11.12. 
MR SACKS:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I want you to go back to paragraph 
9.1 on page 855 and compare the date when people were 
invited to bid for proposals.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 108 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, as stated in paragraph 9.1 
PRASA issued a request for proposals on 2 December 
2011. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, on the 29 t h it provided bid 
proposals. 
MR SACKS:  On the 29 t h, excuse me.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, 27 November. 
MR SACKS:  The 27 t h November 2011 and PRASA invited 
bid proposals and on the 2 n d of December 2011 PRASA 
issued a request for proposal and going back to paragraph 
10 
11.12.6, 
Vossloh 
Southern 
African 
Holdings 
was 
incorporated on 29 November 2011.  So smack bang in the 
middle.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Two days after the bid ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:  Ja.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The invitation for bids.  
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson.  Counsel, shall I 
carry on?   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, yes sir.   
MR SACKS:  Paragraph 11.12.7 Chairperson: 
20 
“The RP required the joint venture to be in 
place by the time the bid was submitted.  
Being 
27 
February 
2012 
by 
Swifambo.  
Accordingly there was non-compliance of the 
RFP.  In any event, Swifambo never entered 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 109 of 269 
 
into a joint venture with Vossloh Southern 
Africa. 
 
It 
entered 
into 
a 
subcontracting 
arrangement with the Spanish entity, Vossloh 
Espanya.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now just pause there for a moment.  
From a legal point of view, what was the risk to PRASA as 
a result of this [indistinct]? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I am an accountant, I am not a 
lawyer.  However ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I was about to ask you that.  
10 
MR SACKS:  I will however, I will ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe he should just ask you what was 
the risk, and leave out legal. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe based on your experience as an 
accountant you might be able to answer that general 
question rather than the legal aspects.  
MR SACKS:  There is no right of recourse for PRASA 
simply put.  They were putting themselves at tremendous 
business risk.  You have a contracting with a different 
20 
party, or for Swifambo contracting with a different party 
and I actually to my knowledge that is how it played out 
due to PRASA contracting with Swifambo and Swifambo 
contracting with a foreign entity. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Has it been a joint venture, both of 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 110 of 269 
 
them would have owed a duty to PRASA? 
MR SACKS:  Yes, yes Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, and then you deal with 
Swifambo’s financial standing next. 
MR SACKS:  Yes Chairperson: 
 
“Swifambo’s 
financial 
standing 
was 
unsatisfactory in that Swifambo’s auditors, Van 
Wyk Auditors, confirmed that Mafori Finance 
trading as Swifambo Rail was a new company 
and 
had 
not 
traded 
before. 
 
Swifambo’s 
10 
bankers, 
Standard 
Bank 
confirmed 
that 
Mafori’s 
bank 
account 
had 
recently 
been 
opened and indicated that Swifambo had no 
financial history which the bank would use to 
evaluate his financial viability.” 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Can I just stop you there for a 
moment.  How difficult would it be to check what the 
financial standing is as you have reflected in 11.12.  In 
other words, how would PRASA protect itself against this 
sort of risk? 
20 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I guess the answer is PRASA 
could not protect itself from that kind of risk.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But would it not ask for financial 
statements as part of their protection? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I am not preview to what the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 111 of 269 
 
information the PRASA bid committees would have asked 
for.  However, it is evident that this was a company that 
had no operating history.  Obviously it goes without saying 
that PRASA was exposing itself to substantial risk.  What 
information they should have called for or ought to have 
called for, I can only say in the general business term that 
this is kind of information they should have assessed at 
the time.  I cannot confirm what they did or did not do 
within PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I think Mr Soni was asking more 
10 
at a general level. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  To say you cannot enter into a contract 
with an entity that you have not checked, just basic 
checks.  Has it done this type of job before.  
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it sustainable.  Is it going to be there 
in two weeks’ time.  Is it going to be there, who are the 
people who are behind it.  What is its financial standing 
and you enter into a contract to give it billions of rands.  
20 
How can you do that? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean going back to the Free State Mr 
Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 112 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Estina you have the similar situation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where the Department of Agriculture paid 
into Estina about I think at a certain time 30 million rand 
and the evidence revealed that I think the day before, or 
just before the 30 million rand went into Estina’s account, 
Estina’s balance in the account was if I am not mistaken 
about R16-00.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No checking. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing. 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I did perform that analysis as to 
what was in, to your point what how will the bank accounts 
look like at the time obviously PRASA would not be preview 
to that level of information, but most certainly as you 
stated 
correctly, 
a 
due 
diligence 
should 
have 
been 
performed comprehensive for the point in my contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly, because I cannot just meet you 
today and I sign an agreement with you tomorrow and then 
20 
I take millions of my money and give them to you on the 
basis that you will do X, Y, Z but I do not even know 
whether you have done that before, what is your financial 
standing.  If you are talking about big amounts.  Are you 
able to do the job?  You know, what will I do if you 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 113 of 269 
 
disappear into thin air?  I cannot do that with my money, so 
why would I do that with tax payer ’s money? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And especially Chairperson, if I may 
make this point?  When you know that the company which 
is going to be the supplier is an overseas company over 
which you have absolutely no control. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Or no power. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, sorry. 
MR SACKS:  The next point being Swifambo, Chairperson: 
“Swifambo and Vossloh concluded the contract 
on 4 t h of July 2013 which was 16 months after 
the bid was submitted and after the contract 
was signed between PRASA and Swifambo on 
25 March 2013.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So had PRASA done what you called 
due diligence, even a basic due diligence, it would have 
realised at the time it awarded the bid and at the time it 
20 
signed 
the 
contract, 
there 
was 
no 
contract 
between 
Vossloh and Swifambo. 
MR SACKS:  Accordingly Chairperson, there was no 
guarantee that Swifambo could even perform.  They had 
not signed the contracts, even the RFP called for a joint 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 114 of 269 
 
venture, a subcontracting agreement completely different 
had not even been signed yet.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes no, no you are quite right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if the two judgments, the 
High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal, do reflect the 
identities of the people who made this decision in PRASA, 
whether they were the bid adjudication committee or 
whoever they were? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  He might not know, but ...[intervenes] 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  He does in his ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  When you look at something like this 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You will immediately want to know who 
made this decision without doing this basic checking. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am just saying I cannot remember 
whether the judgments do reflect ...[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I do not think they identify the 
20 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the people who made that 
decision should be identified.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We should know who they are.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 115 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Who they are, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you know, you talk about PRASA 
having made this decision to enter into a contract with 
Swifambo, a company that had no history, that basically 
had nothing other than that it was going to be the middle 
man as it were, and lots of money were, was involved.  I 
want to know which officials in the entity made this 
decision? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   These decisions indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the public need to know who they 
are. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if we keep on just saying PRASA, 
PRASA, PRASA you know it is ... (intervenes). 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the point he makes with this - it 
is a matter that perhaps should be considered in the 
20 
submissions, we make to you or the recommendations you 
represent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
Because 
unless 
there 
is 
accountability 
in 
the 
form 
of 
some 
consequence 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 116 of 269 
 
management 
which 
is 
a 
word 
– 
a 
phrase 
that 
is 
consistently used.  Minister Peters kept referring to 
consequence managing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know you see something like this.  The 
first thing is who made this decision?  Who did not do his 
or her job?  Was it incompetence?  Was it negligence or 
was he or she part of a certain agenda?  It is very critical 
because the person or persons who made this decision – 
these decisions may be – maybe they are still at PRASA.  
Maybe they are in another SOB. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Indeed yes doing the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whenever these projects – these 
transactions 
are 
discussed 
their 
names 
are 
never 
mentioned.  It is just PRASA, PRASA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   PRASA yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But importantly ... (indistinct).  Yes 
Mr Sacks. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson the last point in this – set out in 
the report was the point which I recall it again.  Point I 
20 
made was Swifambo obtained the R3,5-billion tender for 
the supply of locomotives.  Who had no offices or 
infrastructure, no experience and no contracts obtained 
and supply the locomotives.  As established the contract 
for supply was only signed with ... (indistinct) after the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 117 of 269 
 
fact. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is prettily stating what 
happened.  I mean it is basically as that. 
MR SACKS:   Yes Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I mean you could – you could 
really be in the hallway ... (indistinct) and then get a 
contract like this. 
MR SACKS:   Yes chairperson I suppose so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now is the position that despite you’re 
looking at some of the documentation and affidavits 
10 
relating to this you could not come across who the officials 
were who made this decision as well or ... (intervenes). 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson the affidavits actually dealt with 
specific PRASA individuals – key individuals involved at 
various junctures in the tender being awarded.  I cannot 
confirm if that was every single person involved.  But in 
the course of the broader investigation in which we were 
performing forensic audits – the Werksmans investigation it 
was investigated at length who the individuals were. 
 
The names mentioned in this contract are key 
20 
senior individuals pertaining to Swifambo.  But these 
individuals were management for PRASA.  So I guess all 
procurement – this falls under procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I think Mr Soni we need to get to 
who made the decisions.  And if there are – if there are 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 118 of 269 
 
contracts that were signed, who signed those contracts on 
behalf of PRASA.  So and to the extent that we deal with 
Siyangena(?) in regard to other matters.  It is important 
that if there are contracts that have been concluded 
irregularly or corruptly it be made quite clear who the 
people are who made the necessary decisions. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In fairness Mr Chairperson, Mr Sacks 
does identify the person who signed this contract and he 
identifies some of the individuals who ought to have 
ensured that proper mechanisms were put in place at the 
10 
start.  He does deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But in ... (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:   There might be different people who had 
different roles to play.  But ultimately somebody makes the 
decisions. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether it is one person or a committee 
but there is a decision maker and that is the final person 
who needs to check whether he or she has been provided 
20 
with all the information that needs to be in place before 
making the decisions? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But we will do that analysis looking 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 119 of 269 
 
at 
the 
contracts 
themselves 
because 
they 
were 
... 
(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course the sudden witnesses who 
have testified before the commission from PRASA may 
know who had the power to make those decisions at that 
time. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Such as Ms Ngoye. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Dingiswayo. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Dingiswayo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They might know that these are the 
people who would have made these decisions. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the question of obvious 
somebody must have signed the contract.  So who signed 
that kind of thing?  Because before you sign a contract you 
want to satisfy yourself that proper decisions have been 
made and you are signing with the a party that is credible. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now in paragraph 11.13 you deal with 
the meeting between Mr Molefe, Mr Mamobolo and Mr 
Mashabe together with a fourth person.  That is according 
to Mr Molefe’s affidavit.  Evidence on that has been led Mr 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 120 of 269 
 
Sacks, I am just pointing it out. 
But just because all of these persons, especially Mr 
Mashaba again refers to Mr Mabunda.  Would you briefly 
summarise what Mr Molefe said in his affidavit in the 
replying – or in the replying affidavit in the Swifambo 
application to the High Court. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson Mr Molefe in his replying 
affidavit 
explained 
his 
meeting 
with 
Mr 
Mashaba, 
Mamobola and the other person was Mashila Mklala, he is 
a member of board and actually ... (indistinct) committee 
10 
chairperson.  This meeting was on 31 s t August 2015 which 
Mashaba explained how he is approached by Makhensa 
Mabunda to participate in this tender to supply PRASA with 
locomotives.  And Mashaba also dealt with his interactions 
with Maria Gomez and how Gomez wanted money for the 
movement.  Counsel do you want me to read or ... 
(intervenes). 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, no, no you can just summarise. 
MR SACKS:   Oh so, so essentially this meeting was about 
Mashaba explaining to Mr Molefe and the other participants 
20 
how he was – got involved in the tender and how money 
had to be paid by PRASA to Swifambo and thereafter to 
support the movement.  And the meeting talks about 
specific cash flows especially to a company. 
 
How Swifambo would pay money to a company 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 121 of 269 
 
called 
AM 
Consulting 
Engineers 
which 
is 
Mashaba’s 
company and how AMC Consulting Engineers would pay an 
entity called Simulex which was Gomez’s company.  And 
the meeting was to discuss some of the values of amounts 
to be paid. 
 
But ultimately the information provided by Mashaba 
about the payments is corroborated by the flow of funds 
analysis that we performed from Swifambo to AMCE – AM 
Consulting Engineers and the second level flow of funds 
analysis which was going to be performed which confirm 
10 
flow of funds to a company called Simulex. 
 
Which I understand that the liquidator actually 
confirmed the flow of funds.  That information was not 
available to me at the time I prepared my report.  That ... 
(indistinct) that meeting was about. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson may I interrupt at this 
point?  I thought we need not deal to long with this point 
and the reason is.  These are the allegations that Mr 
Molefe made.  You will recall that we also filed in the 
affidavit to – as an annexure to the affidavit of Mr Molefe, 
20 
Mr Mashaba’s reply in Swifambo. 
 
Now very interestingly Mr Mashaba then in his 
CM13 that he filed last year – CM100, I beg your pardon – 
expands on this issue.  Now again just so that there can be 
some 
certainty 
when 
you 
are 
doing 
your 
report 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 122 of 269 
 
chairperson.  You need not go into this is what Mr Molefe 
said. 
 
You can go straight to what Mr Mashaba said - in 
his two affidavits.  Well the CM100 is part of an affidavit – 
well notes to it.  And what he said in his replying affidavit.  
I am going to that a little later if that suits you chairperson.  
Because that actually ties in with the flow of funds and it 
fits in with exactly how the money was dispersed. 
 
But I thought I just ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am not down playing this but again 
you will be saved the task of deciding ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Let Mr Molefe - Mashabe speak for 
himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is in order. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the document chairperson is 
quite revealing.  Exactly what he says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You are aware of those documents 
20 
now.  You did not have it when you did your report but it 
has now been made available. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I am aware of these documents 
that counsel proposed to me now. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay so I am going to – I want to 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 123 of 269 
 
refer to it at a particular time.  Are you okay with that ... 
(intervenes). 
MR SACKS:   I am okay with that chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright now you have dealt with – up 
to now the complaints that Mr Molefe made in his affidavit 
or the observations he made about the points that had 
been done irregularly.  The next issue you raise is the ... 
(indistinct) in the tender process itself.  And you deal with 
that at paragraph 11.14 to 11.50. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay now let’s start off with the 
irregularities in the tender process.  What were the 
irregularities according to Mr Molefe in his affidavit? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson Mr Molefe stated that evaluation 
process improper.  His supporting documentation could not 
be found.  Need assessments was not performed for the 
locomotives.  Approval from the Minister of Transport was 
not obtained as it ought to have been.  There was no 
indications 
that 
National 
Treasury 
received 
a 
written 
submission as it ought to have. 
20 
 
There was no proper budgeting for the provision for 
the purchase of the locomotives.  Daniel Mtimkulu was 
instrumental 
to 
procuring 
from 
and 
contracting 
with 
Swifambo in his role as the executive manager engineering 
services PRASA Rail, forged his qualifications.  In a 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 124 of 269 
 
disciplinary hearing Mtimkulu was found guilty of grouse 
dishonesty, fraud and bringing the name of PRASA into 
disrepute. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry if you can just stop there.  
Because again when we go into these allegations that were 
made, ... (indistinct) said that Swifambo’s answer is, we do 
not know about that.  That is PRASA’s – you cannot hold it 
against us.  Of course because it was a self review that 
contention was found to be without merit. 
 
And as you will see that they then say that 
10 
Swifambo was not an innocent party in all.  (Indistinct) at 
11.22. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson the technical specifications of 
the 
locomotives 
were 
designed 
to 
match 
the 
exact 
specifications 
of 
the 
Vossloh 
locomotives 
to 
ensure 
Swifambo was awarded more points during the technical 
evaluation.  Swifambo was the only bidder who met the 
70% threshold for technical evaluation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So sorry could you stop there for a 
moment.  Who determined what these specifications were 
20 
for these locomotives? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I am not privy to that level of 
information.  I would imagine the people involved are the 
senior 
people 
in 
procurement 
and 
engineering 
would 
determine those technical specifications. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 125 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well the Supreme Court of Appeal 
found it was Mtimkulu who – as the head ... (intervenes). 
MR SACKS:   The head of engineering as I say yes.  But 
the 
PRASA 
SCM 
– 
SCM 
standing 
for 
supply 
chain 
management, 
compliance 
check. 
 
The 
PRASA 
SCM 
compliance 
check 
overlooked 
that 
a 
tax 
clearance 
certificate was not submitted for ... (indistinct). 
 
Swifambo’s bid did not contain evidence to support 
it claims that its shareholders had previous experience in 
the 
rail 
industry. 
 
No 
documents 
were 
provided 
in 
10 
Swifambo’s bid to confirm that they have entered into joint 
venture ... (indistinct) Southern Africa. 
 
This was essential considering the bid indicated 
that Swifambo would not rely on experience and technical 
capability of ... (indistinct) to fulfil its obligations.  The 
PRASA BEC ... (intervenes). 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry before ... (indistinct).  How 
difficult is it to determine whether these criteria as 
required by the RFP have been ... (indistinct). 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson it is not difficult to establish if a 
20 
company has a tax clearance certificate.  It is not – as ... 
(indistinct) 
due 
diligence 
about 
the 
capability 
of 
a 
company.  It is not difficult to do unless no one wants to 
actually look. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I want to put this to you.  If say there 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 126 of 269 
 
was just no tax clearance certificate it would be – we can 
say somebody overlooked something, then there is no 
evidence to support the claim of previous experience.  
There is no documents to show that there was a joint 
venture. 
 
Collectively what does that suggest to you about 
the persons who allowed Swifambo to pass to the next 
phase of the bidding process? 
MR SACKS:   In my opinion it points to retention.  
Essentially chairperson to ignore the glaring efficiencies 
10 
that the company was tendering for ulterior motives as you 
suggested earlier.  But that is my opinion. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright then – sorry you were at 
11.24. 
MR SACKS:   11.24, the PRASA BEC which is the bid 
evaluation committee did indeed raise serious concerns 
about the compliance of Swifambo’s bid.  These concerns 
were dismissed by the erstwhile chief procurement officer, 
Chris Mbata, advised the BEC to focus on the technical 
evaluation only as SEM had checked the compliance 
20 
aspect. 
 
During the course of the bid process prior to 
evaluation the tender documents were in the possession of 
Brenda 
Malongete, 
an 
independent 
consultant 
at 
her 
private home.  This factor is considered to be extremely 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 127 of 269 
 
irregular. 
 
In 
terms 
of 
the 
procurement 
policy 
the 
preparation of a technical scoring sheet was the task of the 
CFSC, not the BEC as was performed in this instance. 
 
Some of the members of the BEC suspected that in 
the application of the scoring sheet to Swifambo that the 
specification 
had 
been 
tailored 
to 
fit 
Vossloh’s 
Locomotives.  The suspicions in this regard coupled with a 
concern over the compliance of Swifambo’s bid caused 
them to suspect that the tender had been rigged. 
 
The tailoring of the specification meant that the 
10 
award of the tender was weighted in favour of Swifambo’s 
bid before the scoring process commenced.  The scoring 
demonstrates the advantage Swifambo had over the other 
bidders.  Although Swifambo derived the systems from the 
tailoring of the specification and its favour, for Swifambo to 
achieve 
the 
compliance 
threshold 
of 
70% 
further 
manipulation of the scoring was required which was evident 
upon review. 
 
Including large gaps in the manuscript scoring 
sheet, additional lines and electronic combined scoring 
20 
sheet but not an individual scoring sheet.  The electronic 
combined 
scoring 
sheet 
was 
last 
amended 
by 
Ntombeziningi 
Shezi, 
SCM 
PRASA 
... 
(indistinct) 
chairperson of the BEC.  In summary there were actual 
documentation required – the tick boxes were manipulated. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 128 of 269 
 
 
Members of the BEC were placed by individuals who 
were not part of the BEC and rounding of numbers in 
favour of Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry you said you were in the 
process – the BEC itself was restructured. 
MR SACKS:   That ... (indistinct) alleged by my affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson may I just make one 
point?  You might remember Mr Sacks said that the tender 
documents were in the presence of Brenda Malongete.  
When Ms Ngoye gave her versions – cannot remember ... 
10 
(indistinct).  But on the first occasion or the second 
occasion but I suspect it was the first occasion. 
 
Will not remember – you indicated that there was a 
... (indistinct) legal entity that Mr Montana created.  There 
was ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I kind of remember but I cannot ... 
(intervenes). 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes I am just saying that she is the 
person who was mentioned at that time as having been an 
external legal advisor ... (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh 
yes 
was 
it 
Ms 
Govender 
... 
(intervenes). 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So she was the internal person.  Ms 
Govender was the internal person.  Ms Malongete was the 
external person. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 129 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh there was an external and internal 
one. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one I was thinking about is the one 
who was internal and who went to Ms Ngoye, went to take 
files. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is the one who said I am an 
officer of the court. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But ... (indistinct) Malongete’s names 
comes up again and in circumstances you will appreciate – 
I do not want you ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes Mr Sacks.  Sorry I just wanted to 
give 
context 
because 
the 
persons 
involved 
their 
fingerprints appear at different places. 
MR SACKS:   Yes chairperson.  So ja apart from the 
specifications being tailored and calculations manipulated 
20 
to suit the Swifambo bid the methodology adopted in 
scoring process is irrational. 
 
Another glaring irregularity that undermines the 
technical evaluation is that Swifambo offered the Euro 
3000 model, diesel locomotive in the bid and that was the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 130 of 269 
 
locomotive evaluated.  PRASA acquired the Euro 4000 
diesel locomotives that were not evaluated. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Just stop there.  In its bid a 
particular locomotive with certain specifications is set out. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is for Swifambo’s bid, is that 
correct? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But when the contract is – or when 
the tender is awarded, the tender is awarded on the basis 
10 
that it will supply a different – a completely different 
locomotive – a different specification. 
MR SACKS:   Yes that is correct chairperson.  It was 
actually referred to as a ... (indistinct) 4000 and as I would 
like to say, Swifambo offered a locomotive that drives on 
one side of the road.  But since PRASA ... (indistinct) a 
locomotive that drives on the other side of the road. 
 
This essentially ... (indistinct) in that context.  And 
those locomotives transpired were not suitable for the 
railway as I understand it. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The point here made that it is – it 
undermines the technical evaluation.  Does it not go 
beyond that?  I mean are you not supposed to say you 
have been awarded the points for this locomotive.  You 
must supply those locomotives because that is the basis on 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 131 of 269 
 
which you beat the other competitors. 
 
Although the process may have been unfair but 
nevertheless that is the basis of which you ... (indistinct). 
MR SACKS:   I would agree with that assessment 
chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So the bid evaluation committee and 
nobody evaluated the Euro 4000 which is what Swifambo 
supplied. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson.  Carry on.  The 
BEC 
recommended 
that 
Swifambo 
be 
appointed 
as 
10 
approved bidder.  There were various irregularities and 
areas of concern identified pertaining to the functions of 
the CTPC, the BAC – bid adjudication committee and FCIP 
with regards to approving the bid of Swifambo.  The BAC 
recommended the appointment of Swifambo to be based on 
outright purchase option. 
The decision to purchase when the ... (indistinct) is 
irregular and irrational and cannot be explained, an entire 
process until that point had been directed ... (indistinct). 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry can we just stop there?  The 
20 
RFP provided for companies to offer leases to PRASA or to 
lease locomotives to PRASA. 
MR SACKS:   It is my understanding chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But when the award is made the 
award is made on the basis that those locomotives would 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 132 of 269 
 
be purchased. 
MR SACKS:   That is my understanding chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Did anybody else offer to your 
knowledge 
locomotives 
for 
sale 
as 
it 
were 
as 
did 
Swifambo? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson to my knowledge the other 
bidders all bid for a leasing option, not for an outright 
purchase option. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Because that is what the RFT asked 
for ? 
10 
MR SACKS:   Yes chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright then you say the person who 
appears to have prompted the switch ... (indistinct) a 
leasing to sale was a Mr Brian Alexander. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Do you know how that came about? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I do not know how it came about 
as it stated in the affidavit the capacity which Alexander 
performance analysis is unclear.  It falls outside the 
structures 
contemplating 
the 
procurement 
policy. 
 
It 
20 
appears to directly influence the decisions to change the 
scope of the tender from lease to outright purchase.  This 
is highly irregular considering that it is inconsistent with 
the RFP and the procurement process. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now just to come back to the fact of 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 133 of 269 
 
the change from the contract with lease to the contract of 
lease to a contract of sale.  Swifambo as I understand it 
and that is the conclusion you draw or Mr Molefe draws, 
was formed especially to bid for this tender. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It adopts the name Swifambo leasing. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   A company ... (indistinct) to lease 
then is required to sell. 
MR SACKS:   Does not correlate chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay then you were talking about the 
board itself. 
MR SACKS:   Yes chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just in fairness to the board that 
was established or the board that was constituting in – at 
the end of July 2014.  That is the Popo Molefe board.  Is 
not the board that looked at this tender? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And who was the chairperson of that 
board? 
20 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson the chairman at that time was 
Sifiso Norbert Buthelezi. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So you say then next on the 24 t h July 
... (intervenes). 
MR SACKS:   2012 chairperson. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 134 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh sorry 2012 yes.  Now you 
mentioned Mr Buthelezi and you mention Mr Montana as 
the two people that were present together with the other 
board members ... (indistinct). 
MR SACKS:   Which I have stated in the affidavit yes 
chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Mr Montana was the CEO – the 
group CEO and Mr Buthelezi was the chairman of the 
board. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then what was the board’s decision? 
MR SACKS:   After considering incorrect information about 
the Swifambo bid, the board approved Swifambo as – in 
terms of the tender.  The decision was irrational, arbitrary 
and in breach of the board’s obligations as explained in 
Molefe’s finding affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes now in regard to yourself – what 
you did when the flow of funds analysis, you also looked at 
people who played a role in the bidding process.  What 
role did you find perhaps unusual? 
20 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson when we were doing the 
analysis of the bank accounts of Swifambo we identified 
the beneficiaries or recipients of funds from Swifambo and 
based on the descriptions contained within the bank 
statements or how it flowed to other bank accounts if any 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 135 of 269 
 
individual entity name came up in that analysis that was 
previously identified within the broader investigation we 
could link – we could link names to money.   I think what 
Counsel is alluding to is Swifambo as will be shown in the 
flow of funds analysis paid money to an entity called 
Sibenza Forwarding and Shipping Pty Limited and statutory 
records show that Siphizo Buthelezi was the former – who 
was the former Chairperson of PRASA was a previous 
director 
of 
Sibenza, 
in 
other 
words, 
just 
by 
pure 
investigative links a recipient of funds, being Sibenza, was 
10 
linked to a former Chairperson of PRASA, being Buthelezi. 
 
My report does go on to say that this aspect needs 
to be further investigated, I did not draw any conclusions 
as to that, it’s purely just stating, here’s an entity who 
received money, here is an individual who’s linked to that 
entity and to the police we need to investigate, or this 
needs to be investigated further and that would form part 
of the next level of investigation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   How much did Sibenza receive? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, Sibenza received R99million 
20 
from Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just want to ask, and this is the 
broader picture, originally the intention was whether to buy 
or lease, it was going to be 80 locomotives, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:   88 Locomotives. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 136 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, 88. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Eventually, because of the fluctuation 
in the value of the rand that figure was reduced to 70, is 
that correct? 
MR SACKS:   That’s my understanding. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But after the High Court had set 
aside the award only a small number of locomotives, were, 
in fact supplied. 
MR SACKS:   I think it is common cause, Chairperson, that 
10 
only 13 locomotives were ever supplied prior to the 
suspension of the contract by PRASA under Popo Molefe’s 
Board as which precipitated the investigation.  I do not 
have any knowledge, after; of how many other locomotives 
were due to come but 13 is the number of locomotives that 
arrived in South Africa. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, the R99million that was spent 
then must have been a forwarding of 13 locomotives. 
MR SACKS:   There could be a commercial basis, subject 
to confirmation, I agree with counsel that this money paid 
20 
to Sibenza could have been for the customs and forwarding 
related cost to bring the locomotives in. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But, if it was, the amount in respect 
of each locomotive was then about R7.5million. 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
 
I 
agree 
with 
counsel’s 
calculations, 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 137 of 269 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s quite an interesting figure. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   R99million, that’s it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Indistinct 3.53] take locomotives 
from here to there and… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but as you say, it may well be that 
there is a commercial reason but we just – you just didn’t 
get to that point in your investigation or is that something 
that you’re going to deal with later? 
10 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I just – if you indulge me I just 
wrote what I said with regarding to these payments, I said 
that …[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Where do you say that? 
MR SACKS:   Sorry, Chairperson, paragraph 14.10.8 it’s 
quite a few pages further on when I’m dealing with the flow 
of funds to Sibenza because I deal with those actual 
payments, when you’re ready I can just…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you could – now that we have 
raised it, maybe you can just quickly deal with it. 
20 
MR SACKS:   Yes, so as I’ll be – as Counsel will know, my 
report deals with the specific flow of funds and when it 
came to Sibenza I quantified…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said its paragraph? 
MR SACKS:   14.10.8.

CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just get there, 14.10.8. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, it’s Bundle L942. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I’ve got it. 
MR SACKS:   So, Chairperson, just for the benefit of this 
context 
of 
conversation 
I’ll 
just 
read 
my 
concluding 
paragraph in my report, I said, 
“Accordingly, considering the above, [above being 
the 
payments, 
the 
flow 
of 
funds 
and 
the 
relationships] and also taking into account the 
critical relationship between the former Chairperson 
10 
of 
PRASA, 
namely 
Buthelezi, 
his 
undisclosed 
relationship 
to 
Sibenza 
meaning 
that 
the 
investigation showed that he didn’t disclose his 
relationship to Sibenza to PRASA, and the context 
of the R3.5billion tender between PRASA and 
Swifambo, 
this 
aspect 
should 
be 
investigated 
further”, 
 
 
That’s purely – simply what I said that I couldn’t 
draw a conclusion as counsel inferred but highlight in bold, 
has to be looked at further and as counsel said there could 
20 
be a commercial basis, too early to draw a conclusion at 
the time I did my report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I’d like you to indicate who paid for 
the forwarding and what did the contract provide, you deal 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 139 of 269 
 
with that in paragraph 11.36.5. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the contract between PRASA 
and Swifambo stated that the cost of forwarding was for 
the cost of PRASA and not Swifambo, this is expanded on 
in the detailed findings but there was no information to me 
at the time that indicated that PRASA had paid for it. There 
were these payments to Sibenza which could indicate that 
Swifambo paid for it which I would imagine that, Swifambo 
had right of recourse to PRASA to pay that money.  I guess 
using counsel’s rough but seemingly accurate calculation, 
10 
R7million per locomotive times 70 locomotives will be a 
substantial 
sum 
for 
PRASA 
to 
have 
brought 
these 
locomotives in.  Again, I can’t comment further over and 
above that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, I just make this point 
and either Mr Sacks or the liquidator will deal with it.  In 
the note to the CM100 Mr Mashaba says that Swifambo 
wrongly paid this amount on behalf of PRASA and it wants 
PRASA to pay Swifambo back and asked the liquidator to 
claim the money back from PRASA, but of course the irony 
20 
is this, just given what we’ve heard there is Mr Buthelezi, 
Chairman of the Board, aware of, according to Mr Molefe, 
aware of certain irregular…[indistinct – dropping voice]  
the contract is awarded to Swifambo, Swifambo is not 
required to pay the R99million that it did pay.  Mr Mashaba 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 140 of 269 
 
is – and that’s the point I was making with Mr Sacks, he is 
Swifambo.  How did that money get paid to Sibenza? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He should know, he should – he was the 
Chairman or Managing Director, I think, somewhere in his 
affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He says, he’s the Managing Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does – described himself as having 
the Managing Director and he would have been confronted 
with his questions, among others if he had come here. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But more importantly, had the bill 
gone to PRASA, PRASA may have scrutinised them to see 
if what – the amount that was claimed by Sibenza and in 
fairness 
Mr 
Mashaba 
does 
reduce 
the 
invoices 
that 
Sibenza sent but the question is not whether there were 
invoices, the question is, not being contractually obliged to 
pay, why would Swifambo pay R99million? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It, certainly raises serious questions. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It does, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But we will deal with that note as it 
appears in the CM100 Chair when we’re dealing with 
…[indistinct – dropping voice].   
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 141 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we jumped because we wanted to 
look at this aspect isn’t it, didn’t I interrupt your sequence? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry, sorry yes, I’m sorry yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we jumped from a much earlier page 
just to look at this last page. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Because we were talking about 
Sibenza, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I think we can go back to where 
we were. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Sacks? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson, regarding to Sibenza on 
paragraph 11.36.3, Mamabolo alleges in his affidavit that, 
“Buthelezi, while Chairman of the PRASA Board, 
failed to disclose his interest in Makana Investment 
Corporation which has a 15% shareholding, it is a 
company allegedly providing services to PRASA on 
the rolling stock.  It’s now been confirmed it has a 
55% shareholding in Sibenza a preferred forwarding 
and 
clearing 
service 
provider 
to 
PRASA. 
 
In 
20 
addition, 
per 
investigations 
at 
PRASA, 
into 
disclosure of interests Buthelezi did not disclose his 
interests in Sibenza”, 
 
And the next point I’ve already stated about the 
cost of forwarding. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 142 of 269 
 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
But 
just 
getting 
back 
to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry just give me the page in terms 
of pagination, you know these paragraphs that you have in 
the report they are confusing because it’s 11.6 something. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I’m at page Bundle L872 at the 
bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   872? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright – okay we can continue. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, but can I just take Mr Sacks 
back, Chairperson.  You say that Mr Buthelezi has a 15% 
shareholding in Cadis a company which provides advisory 
services to PRASA or provided.  Did he have that 
shareholding at the time Cadis was providing advisory 
services? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I do not have knowledge of 
that, this is an allegation made by Mamabolo in his 
affidavit.  This – just to re-emphasise, this information is 
included in the report to alert the police to areas that they 
20 
need to consider, I’m not stating that this is fact, this is an 
allegation.  Certain issues have been dealt with in the SCA 
as counsel has agreed to but when you look at the flow of 
funds and you see R99million payment to a company called 
Sibenza without this context, on first reading, the police 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 143 of 269 
 
might not ascertain who Sibenza is.  This allows the police 
that knowledge gap and areas – or in my mind that they 
could go back and look to say, okay these are avenues for 
investigation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you – one of the points you 
made when you went much further in your affidavit relating 
to Sibenza you said that needs to be investigated further, I 
take it the same would apply to these links or alleged links 
with Cadis? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And you say that Mamabolo alleges 
that Mr Buthelezi did not disclose his interest in Cadis or 
in Sibenza? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, at 11.37 you allege or you make 
the point that Mr Molefe alleges that these matters were 
brought to Mr 
Montana’s attention before the Board 
approved the Swifambo bid.  I take it that’s – if you look at 
11.3.6, that’s before the 24 t h of July 2012? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And he alleges that, Mr Montana 
didn’t raise these matters at the Board meeting. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And the inference that he draws from 
that, is that Mr Montana was determined to proceed with 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 144 of 269 
 
the process that would result in the appointment of 
Swifambo? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now, these are all the red flags, and I 
mean some of them are quite high, flags that were probably 
burning themselves but forget that, you then say that there 
were other indications that all were not right and they were 
ignored, will you tell the Chairperson what those were?  
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, individual names by the name 
of Bridgette Gaza raised serious concerns about Swifambo 
10 
in an email on 6 November 2012 to both, Buthelezi and 
Montana and in another email to Mbatha on 20 November 
2012.  Despite these concerns Montana allowed the 
negotiations to proceed in a contract between PRASA and 
Swifambo was concluded thereafter, it was March 2013. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So, as of the date Ms Gaza raised   
these concerns the award had already been made? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But the point you are making is, that 
the process could have been stopped because there is an 
20 
award but there still needs to be a contract. 
MR SACKS:   The contract had not been signed yet, it only 
was signed a few months later. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then the point you make at 11.39 
about the total contextual approach you’ve adopted, could 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 145 of 269 
 
you just place that on record please, Mr Sacks? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, so the point I make, Chairperson, is 
that the irregular tender process and the appointment of 
Swifambo as the preferred supplier of the locomotives must 
be read in conjunction with, and context of the flow of 
funds.  In other words, the tender process was the manner 
in which the implicated individuals were able to enter 
PRASA into a business relationship with Swifambo and 
from which they illicitly benefited from the contract. So 
again, 
Chairperson, 
this 
is 
the 
reason 
why 
all 
this 
10 
information was included.  So, when you look at the flow of 
funds it makes sense. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But I just want to ask you this, even 
without the flow of funds if one looks at the matters that 
are raised in your report albeit that, to a large extent it’s 
what Mr Molefe had alleged but as I’d pointed out it was 
subsequently accepted by the SCA Masterplan.  Based 
even on that, there would be criminal investigations that 
should be…[indistinct dropping voice] for example the 
Chairperson of a SOE not declaring an interest? 
20 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson, I think – this 
report is not, again it wasn’t an affidavit this was a – I 
guess a factual findings, I was mandated to go and perform 
an analysis and give my views as to whether police should 
further criminal investigations and, I mean, to get to the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 146 of 269 
 
gist of it, the evidence produced in context of what the 
SCA had agreed with Mr Molefe, there was every indication 
that further investigation should have taken place. I’m not 
– I’m certainly not, in this case, a person to judge – you 
know Judge or Juror over here, I’m just saying these are 
the facts, this is what’s being said, here’s the money flow. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And your report is for the police at 
their request? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Please tell us what we should look 
10 
for in our further investigations, you’ve done these, now 
we’re not even looking at the flow of funds we’re just 
looking at the entire process, something seems amiss, that 
is what you’re already saying. 
MR SACKS:   That was the point I included at this point, so 
yes, I agree with counsel.  Something is amiss or the flow 
of funds correlates to the timeline of events. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then you deal, in the next 
section with the – up to now you’ve dealt with the 
irregularities prior to – or the unusual happenings prior to 
20 
even the RFP being issued then the process that the – the 
SCM process, then the adjudication process. Now you deal 
with the irregularities in the contract itself. Could you 
outline what those read please sir? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson, first point is that the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 147 of 269 
 
contract between Swifambo and PRASA was concluded on 
25 
March 
2013, 
the 
contract 
was 
signed 
by 
Montana…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, that was on behalf of PRASA? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, sorry on behalf of PRASA. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Who signed on behalf of Mashaba – I 
mean Swifambo? 
MR SACKS:   I do not – Chairperson I do not have the 
contract in front of me and I don’t want to make any 
assumptions but I would imagine if Mashaba claims to be 
10 
the Managing Director he would have signed it but that’s 
just subject to sight of the contract, we can clear that up. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, somewhere I know that it is said 
that Mashaba had signed the contract, I don’t know if it’s 
one of the judgments anyway we’re interested in PRASA 
now. 
MR SACKS:   So, yes the contract was signed by Montana 
on behalf of PRASA…[intervenes]. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just want to go back now.  You had 
said that prior to the meeting of the 24 t h – this is in 11.37, 
20 
Mr Montana had been aware of some of the irregularities 
then on the 6 t h of November Ms Gaza brought certain other 
matters to his attention and then – now you are saying, on 
the 25 t h of March 2013, he signs this contract. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 148 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What was the value of the contract 
that was signed? 
MR SACKS:   The value in rand terms was R3.5 billion, 
Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   This is the contract that was actually 
signed? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, now you are given the 
irregularities in the contract, what were the irregularities? 
MR SACKS:   Carrying on from 11.42 Chairperson, 
10 
“The contract materially deviated from the terms of 
the RFP, the RFP required the lease of locomotives, 
the 
main 
contract 
provided 
for 
purchase 
of 
locomotives. The contract inexplicitly stated the 
RFP invited proposals for three options and one of 
them was the outright sale of locomotives to 
PRASA, this statement is incorrect.  The competing 
bidders were not afforded an opportunity to bid on 
an outright sale as one of the options, this change 
of procurement strategy is fundamentally flawed 
20 
and unlawful. The award of the tender to Swifambo 
and the conclusion of the contract, without the 
contractual involvement of Vossloh constitutes the 
material irregularity.  Swifambo had no technical 
capacity and Vossloh had no contractual obligation 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 149 of 269 
 
to design, manufacture and deliver the locomotives 
in terms of a contract, the risk to PRASA was 
palpable.  The conclusion of the contract without 
the submission of the unconditional performance 
bonds as required by Swifambo within the time 
period prescribed in the RFP was irregular. In terms 
of the contract, the first 20 locomotives to be 
delivered were the Euro 4000 locomotives.  The 
Euro 4000 was designed for the European rail 
network, not South Africa.  The Euro 4000 does not 
10 
comply with the specifications as set out in the 
RFP, chief of which the Euro 4000 has an overall 
vehicle gauge height of 4140mm.  The RFP clearly 
shows that the maximum vehicle gauge height 
requirement is 3965mm.  It will not be possible for 
Vossloh to reduce this height.  The consequence of 
the material deviation from the locomotive gauge 
specification 
is 
that 
PRASA 
is 
saddled 
with 
locomotives that are not fit for purpose and unsafe 
to operate on the South African rail network”.  
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   Can I carry on? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   Okay, sorry Chairperson, carry on, 
“On 11 April 2014 Mthimkhulu sent a memorandum 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 150 of 269 
 
to Montana in which he requested a variation to the 
contract to include certain systems.  According to 
Mthimkhulu the variation was required because the 
systems that came with the locomotives per the 
Swifambo proposal to PRASA were rudimentary and 
therefore needed to be upgraded to ensure that the 
locomotives were fitted and assembled with the 
latest technology.  The additional cost to PRASA 
was R335million.  The request was…[intervenes]”. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, it is dealt with in a page or two 
10 
but just to put you in context, you’ll recall that Mr 
Dingiswayo gave evidence.  One of the matters that he 
said led to his dismissal, and you must remember he 
travelled for half an hour and the meeting lasted ten 
minutes, he said that, he was asked to okay this contract – 
sorry, I make a mistake.  This was the first edition to the 
contract, the next one is what he was asked to okay and is 
what led to his dismissal and Mr Nguyi’s dismissal. Sorry 
but I am wrong in saying that it is this contract, it is the 
next contract. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SACKS:   So, Chairperson, this R335million was over 
and above the R3.5billion which would,  
“Ceded the contract value by quite a significant 
amount and the suggestion that the proposal was 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 151 of 269 
 
that the locomotives 
– what 
was required as 
rudimentary 
is 
nonsensical 
as 
the 
locomotives 
offered to PRASA by Swifambo were state of the art 
and the systems mentioned in the memorandum was 
standard feature. So, the affidavits contend that it’s 
– a beggar ’s belief that now we have to change the 
locomotives 
when 
what 
we 
are 
buying 
for 
R3.5billion should be state of the art and now we 
have to change them.  The contract value is 
R3.5billion, there was a draft third addendum which 
10 
counsel just referred to which was prepared by 
Molengetti [?] and had been negotiated by Montana.  
The proposed third addendum to the contract would 
have resulted in a contract price increasing from 
R3.5billion to R5billion”.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, just to put it in context, you’ve 
got 
the 
R3.5billion 
contract 
that 
is 
signed 
in 
July 
then…[intervenes]. 
MR SACKS:   March. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, sorry March then Mthimkhulu 
20 
adds nearly 9% to the price, at the – another three 
…[indistinct] thirty five million.  That brings it to nearly 
R4million, R4billion? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then, if this had gone through it 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 152 of 269 
 
would have been another billion rand. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now what happened to that 
recommendation or that proposal? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson the draft third addendum was 
presented to PRASA’s legal department where it came to 
the attention of Fani Dingiswayo, the General Manager of 
Group Legal Services for PRASA. Mthimkhulu asked the 
legal department to consider and approve the terms of the 
third addendum.  PRASA’s legal department raised a 
10 
number of concerns with the third addendum and refused to 
be drawn into the approval process.  The concerns 
included the absence of Ministerial and Board approval for 
the amendment which increased the price of a contract 
previously approved by the Board.  As a result, Dingiswayo 
and his superior, Martha Ngoye, the Chief Executive Risk 
Legal and Compliance for PRASA were unlawfully and 
summarily 
dismissed 
by 
Montana. 
 
Montana 
accused 
Dingiswayo of using his position as the General Manager of 
PRASA’s Group Legal Services to the detriment of PRASA.  
20 
Ngoye was dismissed for questioning and objecting to 
Montana’s decision to summarily dismiss Dingiswayo and 
then in summary, the third addendum was not approved by 
the Board and it remains unsigned. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Again, when we talk about the Board 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 153 of 269 
 
now, we heard evidence that Mr Dingiswayo and Ms Ngoye 
were dismissed while Mr Molefe’s Board was in place 
because he then asked Mr Montana to re-instate them, 
which Mr Montana did but he then, summarily suspended. 
So I’m just saying, this refusal was by Mr Montana – I 
mean Mr Molefe’s Board, not Mr Buthelezi’s Board. 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then you deal with the 
technical deficiencies and this is a matter that was highly 
publicised, well I certainly saw the interviews relating to it 
10 
but can you just indicate what the concerns were about the 
technical specifications that these locomotives had. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson - excuse me, Counsel, would 
you like me to read or shall I just summarise? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   If you could just summarise. 
MR SACKS:   Ja.  Chairperson, I guess that ultimately 
everyone – the narrative is like the train that were being 
too – that were too high which, as was explained, with 
regards to the gauge height that talks about - my 
understanding, I am not an engineer, but my understanding 
20 
and part of being the investigation, understood that that 
was the key problem but I also understood, there were 
multiple other technical aspects that were wrong.   
 
I did not deal specifically with them, suffice to 
say that besides the trains being too high and a few other 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 154 of 269 
 
technical issues, the trains did not meet the requirements. 
 
And just one point, that from the documentation, 
it appears...  I am sorry.  I am on paragraph 11.5.1.4 at the 
top of page 878.  Just to jump ahead, as counsel has 
asked me to, to summarise. 
 
From the documentation it appears that the 
agreement to a specification of 4 140 millimetres, well-
knowing that the vehicles structure gage was 3 966 
millimetres was crucially dependent and clueless and 
dishonest conduct.   
10 
 
So Chairperson, again, it is like I cannot talk to 
the technical deficiencies.  My understanding was, there 
were many technical deficiencies but the one that I think 
that we all know about is that the trains were too high. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That Chairperson is also the finding 
of the Supreme Court and the High Court and the Supreme 
Court of Appeal.  You might recall they were quite critical 
about Mr Montana and... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay so there is an argument about 
20 
hybrid and diesel locomotives.  Is it an issue that takes the 
matter further?  This is ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   I have just repeated what – about what 
Molefe’s replying affidavit says Chairperson.  I do not 
really have much knowledge on that.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 155 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Now you then deal with the 
contract between Swifambo and Vossloh.  I take it, one of 
the reasons you deal with this is, is that in Swifambo’s 
answering affidavit, it is – it did not depose the setting 
aside of the contract.  It deposed the just and equitable 
remedy that PRASA that was asking, namely the contract 
be set aside and that it pay back the money. 
 
And what Mr Massaro does in his affidavit is 
this.  If you do that, we will be running at a total loss and 
will in fact become bankrupt.  Is that more or less as you – 
10 
how you understood ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...the reasons that this issue was 
raised? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, Chairperson that is how I understand 
Massaro’s contentions in his affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  But will you just tell us.  
Looking at the figures – and you can read the necessary 
figures – what was Swifambo or what was PRASA paying 
Swifambo 
and 
what 
was 
Swifambo 
paying 
Vossloh 
20 
according to the two contracts? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, the contract between Swifambo 
and Vossloh get to the crux of – essentially what I was 
looking for in the flow of funds analysis. 
 
PRASA was not – remember we are busy with 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 156 of 269 
 
investigating PRASA.  We are not privy to what the 
contractual 
relationship 
was 
between 
Swifambo 
and 
Vossloh.  We were not aware as to what price Swifambo 
was procuring the trains.  We just knew what PRASA had 
paid Swifambo. 
 
Obviously, as the investigation of Swifambo the 
police unravelled what Swifambo did with the money.  A 
crucial part of this whole investigation was:  How much did 
Swifambo pay Vossloh?  How much was their price?  The 
price of the contract between PRASA and Swifambo stated 
10 
a price per locomotive.   
 
It said the contract is R 2.5 billion but the price 
per locomotive was stated and I am...  Please excuse if I 
lose you and counsel when I start talking Euros and Rands, 
but the price they were going to pay was...  Let me just...  
Bear with me for one second.   
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
Five 
point 
three, 
I 
think 
...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   Three point eight two, two...  3.8 million 
Euros.  That is on paragraph 11.5.3.1.  The purchase price 
20 
per locomotive agreed to between PRASA and Swifambo 
was three point three million, eight hundred and twenty-two 
thousand nine hundred Euros for a total contract value of 
two and hundred and sixty-seven million six hundred and 
three thousand Euros for 70 locomotives. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 157 of 269 
 
 
Chairperson, 
one 
of 
the 
most, 
I 
guess, 
misleading aspects of the contract is, the contract says 
two-and-a-half billion but PRASA is actually paying in 
Euros.  It was a Euro contract even though we talk about a 
Rand contract. 
 
They essentially – that is the price that PRASA 
was paying.  It was paying two hundred and sixty-seven 
million Euros subject to currency fluctuations.   
 
Massaro in his affidavit finally revealed the 
contractual relationship between Swifambo and Vossloh 
10 
and that contract shows that Swifambo was procuring the 
locomotives for three million six hundred and fifty-seven 
thousand fifty-two Euros.   
 
That is as I have detailed on paragraph 11.5.3 
just above, for a total contract value of two hundred and 
fifty-five million nine hundred and ninety-three thousand 
six hundred and forty Euros. 
 
So 
for 
approximate, 
for 
rough 
purposes, 
Swifambo was making a mark-up of two hundred thousand 
Euros, give or take, per locomotive and that was it.  
20 
 
So they would – and as I say in paragraph 
11.5.4: 
“Accordingly, based on the contract PRASA, 
Swifambo would earn a margin of hundred and 
sixty-five thousand eight hundred and forty-
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 158 of 269 
 
eight Euros per locomotive were eleven million 
six hundred and nine thousand two hundred 
and sixty Euros in total”.   
 
This is on paragraph 11.5.4.  That is how I – how 
the contract set out the money in PRASA is what – 
Swifambo is paying this for the locomotives and then they 
are going to receive that from PRASA.   
 
So in total, if you convert to Rand – and it gets 
very confusing with the exchange rate because the Rand 
was weakening tremendously on and around the time of 
10 
this contract, but the contract sets out a Rand/Euro 
currency foreign exchange rate of R 10,18. 
 
Using 
that 
as 
an 
indicator 
that 
PRASA 
– 
Swifambo was going to make R 118 million on this contract 
as I explained on the 11.5.5.  I – the contract talks about 
deviations and the foreign exchange.  I think the key 
takeaway is that PRASA was exposed to tremendous 
foreign exchange risk because the Rand was weakening. 
 
But 
purely, 
the 
contract 
PRASA 
between 
Swifambo 
and 
Vossloh 
explains 
that 
Vossloh 
was 
– 
20 
Swifambo is paying 3.6 million Euros charging PRASA 
3.8 million 
Euros. 
 
They 
are 
going 
to 
make 
about 
R 118 million/R 120 million for their work.   Well, I am not 
sure what the work was but that is what they will make.   
 
And that is a very, very important point that 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 159 of 269 
 
needs to be read in context with the flow of funds because 
of 
the 
money 
that 
flows 
from 
PRASA 
to 
Swifambo, 
Swifambo to Vossloh and how much Swifambo actually 
made.  What was the margin or the profit or however you 
want to call it, the cash that sets Swifambo...  And we will 
get to that.   
 
But that whole section as – and counsel, I hope I 
have explained it clearly enough. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   That is really the gist of it.  Finally we saw 
10 
what Swifambo was making out of this contract and what 
they would pay for the locomotives.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Just one further point I want to make 
is.  The fluctuation in the Rand/Euro rate is what led to the 
reduction from 88 to 70 locomotives.  Is that... 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, that is my understanding.  The 
3.5 billion was 70 times the prevailing exchange rate.  
However, the – funny enough, the contract is never 
updated.  It still had the old exchange rate. 
 
So on reading of the contract it actually made no 
20 
sense.  It was still pinned at R 10,18 and without going 
into too much detail.  The exchange rate was already at 
R 13,00, give or take, when the contract was signed even 
though the contract said the exchange rate is R 10,18 
and... 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 160 of 269 
 
 
But for a very small portion of it, PRASA was 
exposed to that foreign exchange rate and I think as time 
went on and if the contract was not suspended and it was – 
the contract – PRASA performed, they would have paid 
significantly more than – or even R 5 billion if that was 
approved because of the weakening Rand because the 
contract was a Euro contract, it was never Rand.  They 
were not paying Rand.  They were taking on the exposure 
of the foreign – the Euro. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And I gather that from what you said 
10 
and just correct me if I am wrong.  What was important is 
R 3.5 billion to get how many locomotives?  How many 
locomotives can be bought from R 3.5 billion, is what we 
will take.  So if it eventually became 50 it did not matter.  
That was the issue. 
MR SACKS:   Ja, I...  Counsel...  Chairperson, there is 
some merit in that argument.  I do not know what would 
have transpired because of how this contract was being 
managed based on what I could see in the representations 
and doing the investigative work. 
20 
 
At some point, if we had to go down the line and 
say if it was not for the stop, what would have happened to 
that R 3.5 billion would have spent but maybe only 30 
locomotives were being delivered and Swifambo... 
 
This is all just assumptions.  Possible to say:  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 161 of 269 
 
Where is our money?  But the fund – the well would have 
run dry.  And then PRASA would have gone back, I guess, 
to Treasury and say:  We need more money for that. 
 
But again, we must not lose sight of the fact of 
the flow of funds, what the money that Swifambo received 
was actually used for at the time the contract – and that is 
what the key focus of my report would be. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  So the point we need to 
highlight at this point is, that in terms of the contract, the 
two contracts between PRASA and Swifambo on the one 
10 
hand and then Swifambo and Vossloh on the other hand.  
That Vossloh, if all went according to those contracts, the 
amount that Swifambo would make is just a little more than 
R 118 million.   
MR SACKS:   That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   And it is a very important number that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now then in urging the court not to 
set aside the contract and to require the parties to go back 
to their original positions, Mr Massaro argues that they 
20 
would effectively being making a loss and that is a matter 
you deal with in the affidavit but it does not affect the 
validity of the contract or the criminal conduct.  You are 
just looking at the argument.  Would that be correct? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 162 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that is the reason Chairperson.  I 
am not going to deal with that issue at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then let us look at the document that 
or the table that appears at page 881.  Oh, sorry that is in 
relation to what Mr Massaro said.  Is that correct? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So we need not even worry about 
that either.  Chairperson, up to page 890 deals with that 
issue.  It is not something we are interested in because in 
10 
any case a decision has been made on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It should be set aside.  Now let us 
look at, really, what the nub of things are and I know it is 
late in the day, but the flow of funds.  Starting at page 891 
Mr Sacks. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, so this essentially where my 
findings start.  Up until this point is, as counsel has 
explained, these are that the affidavits deal with and now 
build the picture for the police now to say:  Let us look at 
20 
what happened with the money. 
 
So I started out by first analysing the bank 
accounts that I had that is shown in Table 3.  I have 
mentioned the two Swifambo key accounts, Swifambo Rail 
Holdings and Swifambo Rail Releasing.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 163 of 269 
 
 
Swifambo had two other bank accounts which in 
terms of flow of funds analysis in court and to perform a 
complete analysis but those other two accounts were not 
significant into the ultimate flow of funds out of Swifambo. 
 
But when you do a forensic audit report, it is 
important that we have to be complete so that no question 
can be raised but what about that other bank account.  I 
have included it.  It is dealt with.  And my findings and my 
conclusions are drawn from a collective pool of Swifambo 
money, again, including Swifambo Rail Holdings which was 
10 
not a party to the contract with PRASA.   
 
So the – I guess for – well I will just - the 
relevant points about these bank accounts which I do not 
want to jump around but just for your benefit Chairperson. 
 
I deal really with introducing each account which 
– and I am on page 892, paragraph 12.3.  I talk about the 
Swifambo Rail Holdings accounts and I explained that this 
account was utilised interchangeable with Swifambo Rail 
Leasing main operating accounts. 
 
PRASA made two payments to this account, the 
20 
period of which I had the bank receipts, the bank 
statements from the police when the first transaction in 
this account was on 1 January 2011.  I deal with the first 
receipts from PRASA in April 2013, and just some of the 
information that I received.  I received the opening 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 164 of 269 
 
documents.  The opening documents are important because 
it tells you who the signatories are on the bank accounts. 
 
I do – going onto the next page, page 174, I do 
the same with ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Page 893. 
MR SACKS:   Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Page 893.  There is a 
different reference at the top right corner. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   It is page 893, paragraph 12.4.  I talk about 
the Swifambo Rail Leasing accounts and how the first 
10 
transaction was on 9 January 2014.  And the next Rail 
Leasing accounts which is the Money Market account and 
that is – the first transaction was 9 January 2014 as well. 
 
So this is just – I am setting – Chairperson to 
summarise without going into too much detail, I am setting 
the scene to what these bank accounts are and these are 
the accounts I am going to analyse. 
 
And that the police can understand say, okay, 
these are the accounts.  Now let us go see what has 
happened with them.  And that takes to the section of pre-
20 
activity which is a very important aspect of the report. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  Before you go there can I just 
ask you something that is intriguing me?  Perhaps I should 
have asked you outside the evidence aspect.  At Table 3, 
which is at page 891, you say the total inflows into the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 165 of 269 
 
Swifambo bank accounts was R 4.979 billion.  How is that 
– it is something I have not been able to... 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  Sorry, this is what we call a nuance of 
flow of funds analysis.  The amount that counsel correctly 
points out, includes transfers between Swifambo accounts.  
So when I take all the bank accounts and I add up all the 
credits and all the debits or the inflows and outflows, it 
includes transfers to and from. 
 
So the R 4.9 billion includes transfers from to 
say Swifambo Rail Leasing to Swifambo Rail Holdings or 
10 
from current account to call account.  That has to be 
ignored because it is not a third party flow of in and a third 
party flow out.   
 
And I stipulate what the inter account transfers 
are and I...  Sorry, just bear with me, please counsel. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay. 
MR SACKS:   Counsel, this would be a good opportunity 
just 
to 
introduce 
this 
diagram 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
20 
MR SACKS:   Because it much clearer over here.  So to 
this point, I just want to make sure we understand the 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, may I ask.  Mr Sacks 
has drawn up a poorly representation of what appears at 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 166 of 269 
 
page 901 and 905. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am just going to hand that up 
because it may be a convenient point for Mr Sacks to 
indicate to you the inflows and the outflows. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And it does not say anything except 
represent pictorially.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And in different colours. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Money coming and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is helpful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might help. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  I do not know where you want 
to include it Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, for now, I am happy to have it on 
20 
the side. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then later on it can be placed in the 
right place in the file. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 167 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry.  Yes, go ahead. 
MR SACKS:   So Chairperson, I have prepared these 
pictorial flow of funds purely for this Commission.  Due to 
the volume and the big numbers it is just easier to see it in 
diagram format.  So the first page talks about ...[indistinct]  
points counsel ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SACKS:   ...total flows ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one is the first page?   
MR SACKS:   The one that says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   These two are not numbered? 
MR SACKS:   ...that says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What?  Are you looking at these ones 
or...? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SACKS:   It says Swifambo Flow of Funds Summary, at 
20 
the top.  It says Cash Inflows ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that would be the first page? 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shall we mark it 1, like page 1? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, we can Chairperson. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 168 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the two pages? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So...  Well, Mr Sacks I am allergic to 
any document that is not paginated, that does not have 
page numbers. 
MR SACKS:   Fair enough Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So.  Okay alright.  Yes.  So you say let 
us start with that page? 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR SACKS:   I simply want to refer to this document 
because the bottom of this page and the bottom left corner 
talks about the total receipts into the Swifambo bank 
accounts and it is R 2.7 billion, R 2.710 659 196,00.  And 
you can see on the bottom left corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Are you at the bottom corner? 
MR SACKS:   Bottom left corner.  Just total receipts 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Look at this side ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   Bottom... It is the other page.  Sorry.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, page 2? 
MR SACKS:   Ja, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must look somewhere here? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 169 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:   Ja, bottom left corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SACKS:   The total says, total receipts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  Sorry for that confusion Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the – at the bottom left of page 2 of 
the two documents, it reads total receipts into Swifambo 
bank accounts, R 2.7 billion. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a round figure. 
10 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay? 
MR SACKS:   And then, on the other side of the same 
page, it says total payments of R 2.5 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the opposite ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...corner of the same page. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is on the right hand side, yes. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says total payments from Swifambo 
20 
bank accounts.  Obviously, that must mean going out. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Payments going out. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   R 2.5 billion. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 170 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a round figure. 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So less than a million would have 
remained with Swifambo? 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   There was a balance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, a balance. 
MR SACKS:   There was a balance, bank accounts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   In that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So definitely most of the amount 
went out? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SACKS:   And the reason why I point to this document 
now is because it ignores these inter-account transfers.  
This is purely money coming in from third party sources.  
Obviously, in the main from PRASA coming in, R 2.6 billion 
20 
and then who received the money going out.  And it ignores 
inter-company transfers, inter-account transfers because 
that is misleading to assessing utilisation of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it be an accurate statement to 
say for all intense and purposes the amount received from 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 171 of 269 
 
– into Swifambo bank accounts was from PRASA? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson.  And that is a 
very important information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  And then – and Swifambo 
paid out to other entities or recipients? 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Most of that money? 
MR SACKS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be an accurate statement? 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  And that is what my report deals with, 
10 
who these recipients are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Let us...  Is it a convenient time to 
deal with the details of this? 
MR SACKS:   I think ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Or do you want to do something first? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, it might be valuable at this 
point just to talk about ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Paragraph 13? 
MR SACKS:   Paragraph 13. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   The activity. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is page 896 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we could...  I see it is about one 
minute to four, four o’clock.  Maybe we could take the... 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 172 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Some adjournment. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have an estimate of how long we 
might still be? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, unfortunately, is going 
to be beyond five o’clock Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I know you have a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine but just to give me 
10 
an idea.  How much beyond do you think?  Half-past five?  
Maybe more than that? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It will be more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
There 
are 
many 
aspects 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...that the Commission ought to be 
interested in ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...from this.  When I asked the 
liquidator ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...because the - both of them are 
giving evidence on similar things. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 173 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The liquidator preferred that 
Mr Sacks being a Forensic Investigator ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...deals with even matters that were 
sent to him by Mr Mashaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   He is not a forensic investigator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So it ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It will be longer.  But the liquidator 
will be – once Mr Sacks has set the platform ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...the liquidator would be... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It would flow very quickly about the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, what I am thinking is.  We 
have the evening session. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may well be – I think the evening 
witness, it is estimated that she would take about two 
hours if I am not mistaken. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I am thinking that if Mr Sacks is 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 174 of 269 
 
available, maybe we could go up to a certain point and 
then tomorrow morning we could continue before the 
liquidator. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the time that you think the 
liquidator will take, what is your assessment? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I do not think more than an hour and 
a half Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So Mr Sacks might be needing 
about two to three hours? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   At least Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At least? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think if that is so, I think maybe we 
should go up to five. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then I am assuming he is available 
for us tomorrow.  If he is available tomorrow then we can 
adjourn his evidence until tomorrow morning.  Then we 
start with him tomorrow morning.  So I can do the evening 
20 
witness and finish with that.  And then we continue with 
him tomorrow.  After he has finished, the liquidator can 
come. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, the liquidator... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Sacks, would that work for you?  How 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 175 of 269 
 
is your availability? 
MR SACKS:   I will make myself available Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will make yourself available.  Thank 
you 
very 
much. 
 
Okay 
let 
us 
take 
a 
ten minutes’ 
adjournment and then we continue with Mr Sacks’ evidence 
until five. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please, Chairperson.  Mr 
Sacks, we were at page 896 and you were dealing with this 
topic of the pre-activities in the Swifambo bank account.  
Before we deal with the details, why do you regard these 
pre-activities as important? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, why I believe these pre-
activities are important is because it confirms from a 
banking account point of view that Swifambo had no 
business activities prior to this leading up to the receipt of 
20 
money from PRASA.  So the allegations that it was a 
fronting entity is confirmed by its bank accounts, there was 
– as you yourself, Chairperson, you alluded to well, there 
is nothing in the bank account but R60, there was nothing 
in these account of substance, small deposits coming in 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 176 of 269 
 
from linked individuals who received money, putting money 
in to pay for rent, to pay for furnishings and so forth, but 
the key takeaway is that there was no activity in these 
accounts and the first significant activity was the first 
receipt from PRASA into Swifambo Rail Holdings bank 
account and that summarises that section of this pre-
activity. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But it reinforces a point you made 
much earlier that they had no experience in the rail 
industry. 
10 
MR SACKS:   Yes, it correlates with that, subject to, of 
course, Chairperson, if they had other bank accounts 
somewhere else but I think the investigation had already 
concluded or would have concluded that these were the 
bank accounts for Swifambo, there was no other bank 
accounts, no other activity but these accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time was bidding, by the way, did 
they say they would rely on was it Sponge(?) company? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Vossloh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Vossloh.  Did they say they would rely 
20 
on Vossloh for experience or expertise? 
MR SACKS:   I think that can be taken as a fact that they 
were relying on Vossloh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SACKS:   It was …[intervenes] 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 177 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no contract between them and 
Vossloh at that time, the contract came much later. 
MR SACKS:   Yes, yes, the contract – the actual contract 
came July 2013 when the contract between PRASA and 
Swifambo was March 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Therefore, purely on that 
ground they should not have been given the job because 
there was no contract between them and Vossloh. 
MR SACKS:   My understanding, Chairperson, that was the 
SCA confirmed that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But again, Mr Soni, one keeps on 
referring to other transactions that the Commission has 
heard because also in regard to – with regard to the 
asbestos project, the joint venture did not have – a joint 
venture of Mr Sodi and Mr Mpambani did not have the 
expertise or qualifications or experience of removing 
asbestos which was the core job function that they were 
given the contract for. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you have here Swifambo who gets 
20 
given a big job worth billions of rands but they do not have 
the expertise, they do not have any track record and they 
get given.  Swifambo, Mr Sodi – I mean Mr Sodi and Mr 
Mpambani’s venture and Mr Sodi conceded that in terms of 
legislation to remove asbestos from the roofs of the houses 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 178 of 269 
 
you need a certain qualification which they did not have. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you ask yourself the question again – 
I mean, in regard to that one I asked the question whoever 
in the department decided to give them this must have 
known that this was a requirement. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did they not check whether that 
joint venture had the qualifications and the skills to do the 
job. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Here too you ask the same question. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whoever made the decision at PRASA, 
how did they give this contract to Swifambo who had no 
experience, no track record and to the extent that they 
relied on Vossloh and said Vossloh would bring the 
expertise, that person made the decision to give Swifambo 
the job without saying where is the contract between you 
and Vossloh to the extent that that could be accepted.  
20 
But, of course, the question arises, if you do not have the 
expertise and the qualifications, why should you be given 
the job?  Why should it not be the person who has the 
qualifications and the expertise who bids for the job?  So 
these issues arise in regard – one can see some parallels. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 179 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And of course, Chairperson, if I may 
just point out, that our constitution presents one of the 
fairest mechanisms with the distribution of government 
work or state work and yet we see it time and again being 
totally ignored. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And it something for the people of the 
country that needs to stop because we are now in the 
10 
situation in 2013 we have paid this money and we still do 
not have the locomotives.  Our people still have to use 
taxis, our people still have to use buses, use old trains.  
This cannot be fair to them, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean this thing spreads all over 
because under the Transnet work stream you had entities 
such as the entity called Homix which was given money 
when they did no work of any substance, some words were 
used to say what they would do but in substance there was 
nothing, they just were paid money.  So it spreads all over. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure under Eskom similar things 
were found also. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 180 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Sacks, you were saying that these 
– the importance of the pre-activity, the prior activities on 
the bank accounts are important.  Could you just briefly 
summarise what those are?  We do not need them in detail, 
they are from 13.1 to 13.2 and then you summarise them in 
13.3. 
MR SACKS:   Yes.  Chairperson, in 13.1 I deal with the 
pre-activity in Swifambo Rail Leasing Standard Bank 
account.  This was the bank account that was noted in the 
contract that PRASA was to pay in terms of the contract 
10 
with Swifambo and I know it is that – even though the 
count was operational from 1 January 2012 there is 
evidently no transactional or operational activity in this 
account except for bank charges and insignificant receipts 
with description Musa, which could refer to Musa Capital, a 
company linked to Cynthia Parish, who was a director of 
Swifambo.  
 
The first significant transaction or activity occurred 
with the second receipt from PRASA in the amount of R64 
million on 8 December 2013.  So even though the account 
20 
was opened on 1 January 2012 which on or around the time 
that Swifambo as an entity was formed, give or take 
months here or there, there was no activity in this account 
until two years later when it received a second PRASA 
payment.  It never received the first one, as it should have, 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 181 of 269 
 
so for two years there was no activity in this bank account 
again which supports the contention that it was not a 
trading entity. 
 
The Swifambo Rail Holdings bank account, I also 
looked at that bank account and that bank account was 
opened on the 1 January 2011 and between the periods 1 
January 2011 and 5 April 2013 – so we are looking at 
roughly a two year period where 5 April 2013 was when it 
received PRASA’s first payment of R460 million.  There 
was receipts in that account totalling just over R1 million.  
10 
So over a two year period it had received R1 million and 
the receipts had a description Siyaya Rail Solutions and as 
we explored earlier, Siyaya as a group of companies, S 
Group 
is 
linked 
to 
Makhensa 
Mabunda 
and 
Vossloh 
themselves, there were receipts coming into the bank 
account with the description Vossloh SA and Vossloh Track 
had paid money into this bank account. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Sorry, can I just stop you there?  The 
contract between Vossloh and Swifambo was in July 2013, 
is that right? 
20 
MR SACKS:   That is correct. 
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
These 
amounts 
that 
Vossloh 
deposited, remember – and I am just making this point, 
that it was Swifambo who was to pay Vossloh because 
Vossloh was manufacturing the locomotives.  Were these 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 182 of 269 
 
amounts 
received 
in 
Swifambo’s 
account 
before 
the 
contract? 
MR SACKS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So effectively Vossloh was funding 
Swifambo’s existence prior to Swifambo’s receiving money 
from PRASA. 
MR 
SACKS: 
 
 
Existence 
or 
to 
use 
another 
word, 
Chairperson, to set up Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR SACKS:   And Chairperson then on the next page, the 
10 
top of your page 898 in paragraph 13.2.5 I assess how that 
money was utilised and as I stated R1 million comes in. 
essentially, R1 million goes out with the description 
Growthpoint Properties, your 17 payments and Growthpoint 
– I think it is common cause Growthpoint is one of the 
listed property companies, so it was obviously the landlord 
for this office, they received R368 000 and payments with 
the description Delacovias Interior, ostensibly for office 
furnishings, R276 000 and then two payments to M S R 
Mabunda which indicates payments to Makhensa Mabunda 
20 
for R250 000.   
So the takeaway from all of this analysis is there 
was no trade in these companies.  Swifambo Rail Leasing 
itself had no money flowing through it until PRASA paid its 
second payment in and Swifambo Rail Holdings had no 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 183 of 269 
 
activity in it but for the funding of rent and furnishings to 
set up a company which was funded for related parties – I 
use the word in conversational sense, Vossloh and Siyaya 
Rail Solutions and that leads up to where now PRASA pays 
money into the bank account of Swifambo, 460 million. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then at 13.3.2 you say something 
about what these activities confirm. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson, I state that in 13.3.2: 
“Therefore the bank accounts confirm that Swifambo 
was a company set up for the locomotive tender 
10 
with PRASA.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I see you do not say for the providing 
of locomotives. 
MR SACKS:  It was draft report, Chairperson, maybe… 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, no, no, I am just saying well-said, 
yes. 
MR SACKS:  Ja, ja.  Yes, yes, I take your point. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then at 13.3.3 the point you made 
earlier that the start-up costs were being paid by Mabunda, 
Vossloh and Musa Capital, that is Ms Parish. 
20 
MR SACKS:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Now let us get to the real 
heart of the issue, the flow of funds analysis.  Again, level 
one is inflows analysis, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 184 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.  Now is this a good time to talk 
to the pictorial representation because, as I understand it, 
what you say in paragraph 14 is in effect what is set out in 
table 4. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct, Chairperson, the report just 
deal with a bit of preamble, some forensic technicalities, 
just to qualify, you know, how the – the analysis that I did 
but it is not relevant to the findings and counsel is correct, 
when we get to 14.2 we now get to what I included, a table, 
what I call table 4 on paragraph 14.2 which summarises the 
10 
in and outflows which essentially is shown per pictorial 
diagram which we discussed prior to the adjournment or 
the break. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It may be easier, and I am just 
suggesting, 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
pictorial 
representation 
because in a way it consolidates the individual entries on 
table 4 and it puts it out nicely so we do not have to do the 
sums again. 
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Would that be a convenient way to 
20 
deal with that? 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, it just – the pictorial one, the 
pictorial diagram is a highlight of key transactions.  What 
the report actually also deals with is – Chairperson, in a 
bank statement there is descriptions showing money is 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 185 of 269 
 
coming in and money is going out and what we are aiming 
to achieve in a flow of funds analysis is to identify 
descriptions that have the same description and total them 
up and say okay, well - for example, when you see PRASA 
money coming in, it might not say PRASA, PRASA, PRASA, 
PRASA, it will say PRASA with some code or Umjanji(?) or 
PRASA Crest or something.  What we do is, we take all of 
those and say well, that is PRASA, we know that is PRASA, 
or categorise that PRASA, that is R2.6 billion. We do 
something similar with all the outflows and we look for all 
10 
the connecting transactions.  That is the first part.  
Obviously, the second part is to confirm our view on 
that that is the recipient of money.  In my experience, as 
an expert, more often than not the description actually is 
the beneficiary.  So when, for example, it says Vossloh, 
Vossloh received the money.  Where it says Mashaba, 
Mashaba received the money.  In certain instances I guess 
in an example of a forensic investigation where someone is 
trying to conceal a payment.  No one is trying to conceal 
payments 
over 
here 
because 
the 
perpetrator 
or 
the 
20 
controllers of this bank account are the people who are 
making the payments but if you can think, Chairperson, in 
a company where you have a bookkeeper.  A bookkeeper 
might put a different description to where the money 
actually went and in a criminal investigation would have to 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 186 of 269 
 
go and prove that that was a concealment and who actually 
received the money in this case, at tall times, with 
information that is available to me, these descriptions, as 
we will talk to, were actually the recipients, so – I mean,  
just there where it says AM Consulting Engineers, without 
looking at the documents, AMC Consulting Engineers which 
is a company controlled by Mashaba, AM Consulting 
Engineers did receive the money.  When it says M S R 
Mabunda, M S R Mabunda bank account did receive the 
money but with that knowledge in mind, we talk to now 
10 
what the flow of funds actually shows. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, let us look at the – as you 
said, the pictorial representation is highlights of what is 
contained in table 4, would that be correct? 
MR SACKS:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Right, let us start with the first one.  
Well, let us start with the inflows, that is R2,65 billion from 
PRASA 
to 
Swifambo, 
that 
is 
Swifambo 
Leasing 
and 
Holdings. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  And then you say there are the other 
inflows of about R60,45 million. 
MR SACKS:  That is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Are any of them of any significance, 
those inflows? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 187 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:   The inflows, Chairperson, of R60 million 
there, 
R38 
million 
alone 
has 
the 
description 
SARS 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Sacks and Mr Soni, you 
are ahead of me, I was checking something at page 901 
while you were moving on. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, I thought you were and we are 
going to come to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am sorry to take you back.  If you 
want to go back and – ja. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We were looking at the pictorial 
representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  I think it is your second page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  The one that says Swifambo flow of 
funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now I was asking Mr Sacks about the 
first amount reflected on the left hand side that went into 
20 
the Swifambo bank accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the 2.6 around about – I mean 
the round figure. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is right, yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 188 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So that is the amount from SARS – I 
am sorry, from PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  PRASA, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, I just want to make one 
point if you have not missed it, it is okay.  These amounts 
are to both Holdings and Leasing and then I was asking Mr 
Sacks about the R60,4 million reflected under that as 
further inflows into Swifambo and asking Mr Sacks is there 
any significance in any of the inflows.  That is the question 
he was answering. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, there is no significance in these 
inflows.  The largest inflow is an amount of R38 million 
which had a description SARS VAT.  So I would assume 
subject to confirmation that it was a VAT refund of sorts, 
but no, there is no other significant inflows. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Then we can go to the right 
hand side and when you  - if you want to point out which 
number where precisely it is you can do that.  But I mean, 
some of it is obvious.  When you say the first big recipient, 
20 
I am not saying amount, was Vossloh.  How many – are 
there many entries here on Vossloh?  I see two. 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson, I am sorry to – we need to look 
at the pictorial diagram and then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have it in front of me. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 189 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  Yes and then there is that table on page 901 
which is the source information and I think counsel is 
referring to that but it says Vossloh received R1.8 billion 
and that is shown on that table.  There 
were six 
transactions totalling R1.8 billion and that is how it flows  
but without losing sight or losing between the detail, 
Vossloh received R1.8 billion. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.  It was the major recipient. 
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now this is out of the R2,6 billion. 
10 
MR SACKS:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  So we are looking …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, on the two pages, page 2, I 
am looking for any money that went from Swifambo to 
Vossloh.  I do not see anything is that because there is 
nothing or I just have not looked closely enough? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  No, Chairperson, I think you have got 
the pages inverted, it is the document Swifambo Flow of 
Funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is page 2, for me. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, yes.  And you will see it is the 
first one right on the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh, I think the problem is that the 
rest of the recipients are written in black, it is written in 
…[intervenes] 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 190 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:  Yes, in red. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it is not easy to see it.  Okay, now I 
see, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Now just on that – that is the total 
amount they received.  Let us put it at R1,9 billion, 1,87.  
Swifambo received R2,65 billion. Remember I said to you 
we must make a note that Mr Massero says their profit is 
119 million. 
MR SACKS:  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But I mean this would suggest 
10 
something quite different. 
MR SACKS:  That is – Chairperson, that is point I said why 
it is so important, that R118 million profit that Swifambo 
ought to have made from this contract, the difference 
between the Euro PRASA they had paid for the – procured 
the locomotives and PRASA paid.  They charged PRASA 
for the locomotive and without getting ahead of ourselves, 
when we – as counsel is pointing to, PRASA has paid 2.6 
billion, they have paid 1.9 billion to Vossloh, you are 
leaving R700 million and that – we look at that 700 million, 
20 
it starts to reveal, reveals all as to well, where did the 
money go?  It never went to Vossloh, so where was this 
money – where was – just in the first batch of 2.6 billion, 
where was it going?  And that is what I have drawn 
conclusions 
on, 
on 
this 
one 
page 
diagram 
which 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 191 of 269 
 
summarises, my report details the actual - [indistinct] 
26.16 as you see the transactions, this one pager is good 
for information purposes but they want to know, okay, 
where did they – my report shows all the different 
payments, the dates, the descriptions, the amounts and 
that is on the remaining pages as well as saying who those 
banks – the companies that received, who the signatories 
are on those bank accounts.  If it is a company, who the 
directors are of those companies, which counsel I guess 
would get to but the overriding point, we are dealing now 
10 
with R700 million difference between what PRASA paid and 
what Vossloh received. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, you might remember I 
said that the amount of 119, in fact if I could just point out 
to you at page 879, Mr Sacks emphasises this.  When he 
was dealing paragraph 11.55 he made the point that purely 
looking at the contracts the allegation is that Swifambo 
would be making a profit of R118 million but as Mr Sacks is 
now pointing out that it is actually R700 million and not the 
profit but certainly it paid R700 million less than it received 
20 
from PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean that there should be any 
amendment of that R118 million there or not really at page 
879? 
MR SACKS:  Excuse me, 879. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 192 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, Mr Soni just drew my attention to the 
fact that at 879 you said that Swifambo would contractually 
earn a profit of 118 million. 
MR SACKS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right?  But as it turned out, it seems it 
was about 700 million? 
MR SACKS:  I think is a good point to right now, 
Chairperson, is to just to elaborate on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SACKS:  This is really an important point.  We will go 
10 
into the flow of funds.  The analysis shows that Swifambo 
spent more than it ought to have earned as a profit, so 
their profit, as we have as data, should have been on or 
around R118 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is what I should have been. 
MR SACKS:  That is what – for the two or three year 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SACKS:  That they had signed at PRASA and that is it, 
for whatever work they were going to do which has been 
20 
established by the SCA was not much, they only get R118 
million and the bulk of it being the rest of the Euro contract 
will go to Vossloh.   
The analysis shows that – now we are looking at 
R700 million and let us just talk without getting into 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 193 of 269 
 
numbers.  Swifambo paid SARS R230-odd million.   
We assume that those payments had some sort of 
legitimacy, maybe for VAT purposes.  I have not seen 
documentation, I do not know what it is, I think the 
liquidator might be able to talk more because they have the 
records.   
Then we are sitting with R460-odd million and that is really 
the number that we are looking at, R460 million.  We know 
Sibenza, for example, received R99 million.  We have 
spoken about – there could have been some commercial 
10 
rationale, so even if we take off Sibenza R99million you’re 
dealing with R330million.  That R330million is greatly 
higher than the profits that they should have made, and as 
the analysis will show a lot of that money was actually paid 
out even before Swifambo was paid their first payments.   
 
So in other words in summary Swifambo was taking 
all its profits, and more than it was entitled to, up front, by 
taking means it was paying other recipients and those 
recipients are detailed in the report, and if Counsel will 
allow me to, Mashaba, Mabunda, Mashebe, Accountant 
20 
Landgrebe, various firms of attorneys which I understand 
were conduits, whether they knew or didn’t know what the 
money was from and I what I am just saying is that 
regardless of who received the money it is a glaring 
efficiency in this whole contract of R180million profit but so 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 194 of 269 
 
much over and above that was paid and then at a point in 
time PRASA go back to the Board and say well we’re short 
of money  because we don’t have enough to pay but that 
money should have been paid at the very least to Vossloh, 
whether Vossloh was making the right trains or not, 
AFRO3000, AFRO4000, the money should have gone to 
them as Massara claims that we don’t have enough money 
to pay Swifambo, we are short  paying them but we need 
R400million, that is essentially that was in the affidavits, 
they could have paid it, but they preferred themselves, 
10 
they preferred to pay all these other people, direct linked 
people, not just the directors, Mashabas, Mabundas and so 
forth, and that is what the analysis showed and that is 
what I was saying to the police.   
 
The investigation once it had been completed we 
have confirmed all these allegations, remember these are 
just allegations and suspicions, we are looking at the 
money, but the one conclusion you can most certainly draw 
is that Swifambo spent more money than they were entitled 
to, they profited significantly more than they were entitled 
20 
to, so not only R118million.  By the time the contract was 
suspended it was already sitting at R330million over and 
above the fruitless and wasteful expenditure and I am not 
an expert on the PFMA, of spending money on locomotives 
that are not suitable, that is a separate point completely.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 195 of 269 
 
Now we are looking at for lack of a better word theft of 
money, of PRASA’s money, but I don’t want to – I am not 
the judge or jury, but that’s what I was trying to get across 
in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, does it look like in a sense 
Swifambo 
may 
have 
taken 
money 
that 
contractually 
between itself and Vossloh should have gone to Vossloh or 
does it look like Swifambo took the additional money from 
PRASA that PRASA should not have paid in terms of the 
contract?   I mean we can see what was happening here, 
10 
but you wonder if they were supposed to make R118million 
and suddenly they make R300million or whatever who has 
been robbed, you want to ask that question. 
MR SACKS:   I think we can conclusively say it was 
PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SACKS:   Because Vossloh would have not have 
produced 
those 
locomotives 
if 
they 
didn’t 
get 
paid 
everything it was entitled to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
20 
MR SACKS:  And I guess we never reached that point 
because we were stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay.   Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson.   The 
first person, I mean the first entity on the list is Vossloh 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 196 of 269 
 
and if one looks at the table at page 901 we will just – it is 
there, right.  Then the next person and entities is Mashaba 
with 102 or nearly R103million, is that correct? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now you list in table 4 all the specific 
transactions that were made to Mashaba or its entities? 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then the next main 
beneficiary was Mabunda. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And sorry ja, and he benefitted to the 
tune of R54,6million. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We will come back to any other 
benefits Mr Mabunda  has received because I think later in 
your report you say he also received R75million directly 
from Vossloh. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then there is the – it is Ms 
Mashebe? 
20 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I assume you pronounce 
Mashebe. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes but I say it is Ms, it is Miss? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I don’t, I am not sure, I have 
met this person, it Makhosini Daniel Mashebe. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 197 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh so it looks like it is Mister. 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson I am not sure. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, then Sibenzo Forwarding that 
is for the shipping costs and so on.   They were the 
recipients of Ninety Nine odd million Rand. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then there is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I see you have got the spelling for Sifiso 
wrong there, Buthelezi, it should be S-i-f-i-s-o, you have 
got Siphiso. 
10 
MR SACKS:  Chairperson you are 100% correct, in the 
body of the report it is spelt correctly, on finalisation this 
would have been picked up.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
MR SACKS:   Thank you. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then the next big recipient is Mr 
Landgrebe. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   What services, or what is his link to 
Mashaba, Mabunda and so on?   His name appears quite 
20 
often, 
you 
know 
just 
so 
that 
we 
have, 
keep 
the 
...[indistinct] in place. 
MR SACKS:   If I may Chairperson refer to my report, just 
to answer this question. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Obviously you do deal with it. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 198 of 269 
 
MR SACKS:   Yes, I would like to summarise Chairperson 
this – W K H Landgrebe it appears to be an auditing firm 
and W K H Landgrebe were the registered auditors of 
Swifambo Rail Leasing and so at this stage of the 
investigation I wasn’t 100% sure who W K H Landgrebe but 
for them being auditors, not only of Swifambo Rail Leasing 
but other entities who received money as well, which my 
report deals with, so without convoluting I am not sure 
which auditing firm receives R27million and that was 
definitely an area of further investigation. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes, and some of them were 
quite large sums, and if I remember – and you deal with it 
in your report, I think one was for about R10million in one 
...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   One individual payment, that is correct 
Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then there’s Cynthia Parish who 
receives twenty odd million Rand.  
MR SACKS:   Yes in Musa Capital Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Right and then there’s Inkhosi Sibelo 
20 
he is an attorney whose name features again later, is that 
correct? 
MR SACKS:   That’s correct Chairperson.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Then of course SARS is a beneficiary 
as well or SARS received Two hundred and thirty seven 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 199 of 269 
 
odd million. 
MR SACKS:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now those are the main recipients of 
money as set out in table 4 but before we leave that and I 
ask you and any other persons may I refer you to just after 
the SARS VAT refund of R38million there is a foundation 
which receives money.  What foundation was that? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson the description in the bank 
statement said Jacob Zuma Foundation one payment for 
R150 000. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then later on towards the end, 
about four or five entities from the end an entity called 
SANCO and what is the amount that they received? 
MR SACKS:   Chairperson there was a description in the 
bank statement called SANCO one payment for R500 000. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Are you able to confirm that it was 
received by – that that amount was received by SANCO? 
MR SACKS:   Not at the stage I did my report Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now there is just one other matter 
that you may not have information on, but there’s an 
20 
amount of R5million paid to Sterlings Living, do you see 
that, it is in fact the second last ...[intervenes]  
MR SACKS:   I see that. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, now the liquidator, and he will 
give evidence on it, but I am just telling you so you know 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 200 of 269 
 
what the overall picture looks like, the liquidator says 
Sterling Livings did renovations or built a kitchen in a 
house for Mr Mabunda for that amount.  That is what was 
revealed in a consultation held between us and the 
liquidator, but he will come and talk about it, and it is 
interestingly how they were able to locate how it happened 
and so on, but those are not small sums of money. 
MR SACKS:   I would like a kitchen for R5million 
Chairperson. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I would like a house for R5million.  
10 
But is there anything in regard to table 4 Mr Sacks that you 
would like to add to – we have dealt with some of these 
matters? 
MR SACKS:  Not at this stage Chairperson, I think what’s 
pertinent is as I have discussed the overall picture and 
then who the key beneficiaries of recipients of money was, 
which is dealt with subsequent to Table 4.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  We may want to – we may deal 
with some of these persons because in his notes to his 
latest CM100 Mr Mashaba challenges some of these 
20 
payments made by Swifambo obviously, but he challenges 
the validity of these payments.   It would have been an 
interesting issue Chairperson where a person on oath says 
that there was no value for money, I don’t know what it was 
for, but he was the CEO of the company that made those 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 201 of 269 
 
payments.   
 
Incidentally Chairperson I will just point this out, he 
challenges the payments made to Mr Mabunda in note to 
his CM100 saying that Mabunda added no value, he 
doesn’t know why Mabunda was paid, but we will deal with 
those details as he sets them out in his notes to the 
CM100. 
 
Alright and then can I just ask you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, I am just thinking Mr Soni that in 
the light of Mr Mashaba’s failure or refusal to comply with 
10 
the summons and appear before the Commission to explain 
some of the matters relating to the Swifambo contract it 
may well be that at some stage, maybe tomorrow, if the 
situation doesn’t permit tomorrow maybe sometime next 
week, it might be important that you outline here in public 
the issues that he was supposed to explain. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let the public know. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is also what Mr Pretorius did 
20 
when Mr Zuma did not appear on Monday last week, let the 
public know exactly what the issues are and the questions 
that – some of the questions that ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That we would have asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he would have had to answer, and he 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 202 of 269 
 
is running away from answering. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Absolutely, as you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Chairperson one of the problems I 
have been having, and I know we have run Mr Sacks’ 
evidence for a whole day, but it just seemed to me that the 
details contained in Mr Sacks’ affidavit or his report, ought 
to be known to the public, like for example that in respect 
of a contract or transport R5million is spent on a kitchen, it 
is so vital for the public to know and hopefully our leaders 
10 
will start saying but action must be taken now, tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no it is very important because part 
of the purpose for this Commission is for the public to 
know what was happening, who did what, and if money was 
– taxpayers’ money was taken what was it taken for. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who benefitted from it, who took the 
money and what did they do with it, if we have got that 
evidence. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And Chairperson, if I may add 
20 
because this is what I am going to conclude when I finish 
with Mr Sacks’ evidence, what law enforcement officials 
knew and the inaction for a period of four years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Nearly four years as you pointed out 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 203 of 269 
 
earlier today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually talking about that I do want the 
Hawks to tell me what is happening, I have said so before 
in relation to PRASA matters.  At a certain stage I was 
under the impression that the Commission would get an 
affidavit from somebody within the Hawks who would 
explain, but I am not aware that the Commission has 
received such an affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is important that there be an 
10 
account of what’s happened because the complaints has 
been made, the allegations have been made that some law 
enforcement agencies were weakened or some of the 
people within those law enforcement agencies aided and 
abetted state capture and aided and abetted corruption, 
and when they were supposed to take action did not take 
action. 
 
Of course it may well be that what appears to be 
inexplicable to us may be they will come and explain and 
we can understand, maybe it is issues of capacity I don’t 
20 
know but it cannot be left unexplained, so that will be very 
important. 
 
I mean the – when Mr Molefe gave evidence here, I 
don’t know whether for the first time whether it was 2020 
or 2019 he mentioned ...[intervenes]  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 204 of 269 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Early 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he mentioned already that there had 
been inaction for quite some time while his Board was still 
in office, that is why they had to bring an application to 
Court and instead of the Hawks dealing with the substance 
they took some technical point to oppose.   Now if so many 
years later still nothing has been done the Hawks owe the 
country an explanation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As to exactly what is going on and so it 
10 
is very important so I would like that be looked into but it 
has got to be explained. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if this inaction is connected 
with the weakening of law enforcement agencies or the 
aiding and abetting of those who were pursuing the agenda 
of state capture then the Commission wants to know 
exactly what happened. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why it has taken so long. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   I guess we are at five 
past five, I think we should stop and then tomorrow we can 
start at ten because it looks like there will be enough time? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 205 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can start at ten.  Thank you very 
much Mr Sacks for availing yourself also tomorrow.   
MR SACKS:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we can finish, thank you very 
much.  So I will adjourn the hearing of your evidence and 
then I will take an adjournment and then I will come back 
for 
the 
evening 
session 
which 
will 
relate 
to 
the 
Parliamentary Oversight work stream, I should be hearing 
the evidence of Ms Letsatsi-Duba in relation to that work 
stream. 
10 
 
I will adjourn for about ten minutes.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Freund.  Good 
afternoon everybody. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Good afternoon Chair. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Ms Letsatsi-Duba.   
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Good afternoon Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you very much for availing 
yourself to assist the Commission. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, there is only one witness whose 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 206 of 269 
 
evidence we would ask you to hear this afternoon, 
Ms Letsatsi-Duba.  You will recall there was a set of 
affidavits furnished by the African National Congress in 
Volume 1. 
 
And from page 77 of Volume 1 through to page 
82 of Volume 1, is a reasonable short affidavit by 
Ms Letsatsi-Duba which has already been provisionally 
admitted and I am going to ask Ms Letsatsi-Duba, in due 
course, to confirm that affidavit. 
 
And no doubt you would wish to have a sworn-in 
10 
first? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Chair.... 
CHAIRPERSON:   The registrar will administer the oath or 
affirmation, 
depending 
on 
which 
one 
you 
prefer 
Ms Letsatsi-Duba. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I will take an oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   My full names are Dipuo Betha Letsatsi-Duba. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:   No objection. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 207 of 269 
 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you are about to give, shall be the truth, the whole truth 
and nothing but the truth?  If so, please raise up your right 
hand and say, so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
DIPUO BETHA LETSATSI-DUBA:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  Mr Freund. 
EXAMINATION BY ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair.  
Ms Letsatsi-Duba, is it correct, as I have just described to 
10 
the Chair, that you deposed to an affidavit at the request of 
the African National Congress?  It runs to some 33 
paragraphs 
and 
it 
was 
signed 
by 
you 
on 
the 
9 t h of October 2020? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I take it that that is your signature 
that we see after paragraph 33? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Correct.  That is my signature. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair, I ask then to the extent 
necessary that this affidavit be admitted formally.  I am 
20 
just... It is part ZZ-1.  I just want to check the formal 
description.  It is ZZ-1.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay the affidavit of Ms Dipuo Beta 
Letsatsi-Duba which starts at page 77 is admitted...  Does 
it have annexures?  It does not have annexures, hey? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 208 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   There are not annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is admitted then and will be 
marked as Exhibit ZZ-1.7. 
AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
DIPUO 
BETA 
LETSATSI-DUBA 
IS 
ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT ZZ-1.7 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair.  May I then proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Ms Letsatsi-Duba, I am going to be 
taking you through your affidavit but some of it I think we 
do not need to spend a lot of time on.  Is it correct, as you 
10 
say in paragraph 3, that you left South Africa in 1983 and 
joined the African National Congress in exile? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then after the ANC was unbanned, 
you returned to South Africa and you became active in 
political.  In particular, you served in the government of the 
Limpopo Province as you deal with in paragraph 5.  Is that 
correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then you say, and is this correct, 
20 
that you were elected as a member of the National 
Executive 
Committee 
of 
the ANC 
after 
the 
National 
Conference in Mangaung in December 2012? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And for how long did you remain a 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 209 of 269 
 
member of the National Executive Committee? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I am still a member to date. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You are still a member to date? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you say in paragraph 7 that you 
became a member of Parliament in 2014 after the General 
Elections.  I presume that is correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And from that time, which is to say 
from May 2014, which is after the elections and when the 
10 
new 
Parliament 
was 
elected, 
from 
May 
2014 
until 
March 2017, you served as the Chairperson of the Portfolio 
Committee on Public Enterprises.  Is that correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What then happened in 2017 is that 
you were appointed as the Deputy Minister of Public 
Service and Administration and thereafter you served as 
Minister of State Security.  Is that correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is correct sir. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now we are particularly focussing for 
20 
present purposes on the period that you served as Chair of 
the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises.  And you 
say in paragraph 11 of your affidavit there were 8 members 
and 4 alternates of that committee and that the Minister 
that you had dealings with at the time was Minister Lynne 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 210 of 269 
 
Brown.  Is that correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Quite correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Then you say in paragraph 12: 
“The 
fact 
that 
the 
alternate 
members 
sometimes did not attend because they had to 
attend meetings of other portfolio committees, 
hampered the work of the committee...” 
 
Was that a serious problem of why did you think 
you should make a reference to that? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I thought I should make reference 
10 
to that because in some instances there will be serious 
issues which needs all of us to put our heads together.  So 
when other members are not in attendance, we are 
weakened as a committee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  I want to turn now 
to paragraph 13 of your affidavit.  You say: 
“I did not experience any pushback from 
Minister Brown.  However, holding Comrade 
Lynne Brown accountable was a challenge. 
She did not attend meetings of the Portfolio 
20 
Committee and instead sent her deputy...” 
 
And 
then 
you 
explain 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
that 
paragraph that what she said was that your meetings 
overlapped with Cabinet meetings and that is why she did 
not come. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 211 of 269 
 
 
Perhaps you can just expand on that and also 
explain whether or not it was not possible to arrange 
affairs in a way that your meetings did not always overlap 
with the weekly meeting of Cabinet. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   The Portfolio Committee meetings 
are set by a rules committee in Parliament and the date 
and the weeks and so on are determined by them.  So 
when 
we 
realised 
our 
meetings 
coincided 
with 
the 
Parliament, I have managed to spoke to her to say:  If you 
have no issues to present in Cabinet, it will be proper for 
10 
you for to come and attend the meeting of the Portfolio 
Committee. 
 
And I do not know if she took the advice 
properly.  Our thing is because once I was in the Executive 
I used to see other members of the Executive excusing 
themselves to attend Portfolio Committee meetings but with 
Ms Brown, she will not do that.   
 
I do not know if she had issues all the time to 
present in Cabinet or she did not want to attend the 
Portfolio Committee meetings.  I do not know. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  When you said a moment ago 
that once you were in the Executive, you made certain - 
you observed certain things.  Are you referring to the 
period when you were yourself a member of the Cabinet? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   When I was a member of Cabinet 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 212 of 269 
 
and even prior to that, before that, I used to see other 
Ministers attending the Portfolio Committees.  That is the 
reason why I was saying to her if there are no issues 
pertaining to her department, it will be of assistance to us 
if she comes to the committee. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now you say in paragraph 14 that 
Minister Brown not only failed to attend the meetings of the 
Portfolio Committee.  You say she did not attend ANC 
Study Group meetings which compelled the problem of 
making her accountable.  Could you perhaps expand on 
10 
that why you thought it is appropriate to make that point? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   In the Study Group, it is where we 
interrogate 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
the 
departments 
by 
extension to state-owned enterprises.  We – the main aim 
of the Study Group is to hear from the leadership of the 
departments to which the leadership and the administrative 
leadership, what are the issues.  So as to enable us to 
approach the matters in a proper manner when we go to 
the portfolio meetings.   
 
And when I was saying this the problem is, 
20 
because we will go to the portfolio with information which 
is known by any other person and general information and 
yet the Study Group – we can able us to be able to go 
deep into the specific issues and prepare ourselves for the 
meetings of the Portfolio Committee. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 213 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now this Commission has heard quite 
a bit of evidence to similar effect to what you have just 
said that Portfolio Committees and Study Groups, that 
typically 
members 
and 
other 
senior 
members 
of 
the 
Executive attend Study Group meetings and that precedes 
the meetings of Portfolio Committees. 
 
That was also the experience that the manner in 
which 
your 
Portfolio 
Committee 
was 
run 
for 
Public 
Enterprises 
of 
a 
system 
of 
Study 
Groups 
preceding 
Portfolio Committee meetings.  Am I understanding that 
10 
correctly? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is correct sir. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now given that the purpose of the 
Portfolio Committee is to exercise oversight over the 
Executive.  Is there not something in your view a little 
inappropriate about as it were caucusing before the 
Portfolio Committee meetings with the Minister or other 
representatives 
of 
the 
Executive 
where 
the 
political 
administrative, should not that type of oversight really 
been taking place in the Portfolio Committee itself? 
20 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Well, at first, myself I was a little 
bit comfortable with the approach.  Rightfully so as you 
indicated, it might appear like we are trying to caucus 
before the portfolio but when we arrived there in 2014, it 
has been the practise all along.  So we just followed suit. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 214 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  I suppose what I am really 
asking you is; it is clear that the practise is, as you 
described, but I am asking you whether the practise is not 
perhaps a bit inappropriate that ...[intervenes]  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   It is. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You think it is? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I think it is. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I think it is.  I will tell you why it is.  
Sometimes leadership of SOE’s will come to the Study 
10 
Group to present whatever issues and we will be having 
advantage of having the information more than any other 
members of the committee. 
 
And 
I 
remember 
at 
some 
point, 
opposition 
parties were raising issues to say:  Yes, yesterday we saw 
so and so coming to a Study Group meeting and I felt so 
uncomfortable to say, hey, this things it must be corrected 
at some point. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes.  So the point you make is, it 
gives the Study Group certain advantages over other 
20 
members of the Portfolio Committee.  Is that the point you 
are making? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, that is the point I am trying to 
make. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Now I want to put to you 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 215 of 269 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Freund.  But apart from 
that also, would you not say that it entrenches the fact that 
members of a Portfolio Committee come from different 
political parties?  I mean, that is a reality.  That we know.  
And there is nothing wrong with that.   
 
But where members of the Portfolio Committee 
who belonged to a particular party might end up having a 
certain advantage derived from attending meetings of the 
Study Group of their party before they come to the meeting 
10 
of the Portfolio Committee.   
 
Does it not promote the idea that, well, for 
example, us and the Minister who is being held – who is 
supposed to be held to account at that meeting?  We come 
from the same party.  We were in the Study Group 
yesterday together discussing the issues that are going to 
come up here.   
 
Or do you not think that might be another reason 
why there is a challenge with the practise? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, if I understand you Chair.  The 
20 
reason why I felt uncomfortable is precisely what you are 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Because the – one of the reasons 
why there was Study Group is to make sure we interrogate 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 216 of 269 
 
the key points ...  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   ...of the party in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   To get facts ourselves before we go 
to the Study Group. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   And if she wish other members who 
belong to other parties will not have the advantage of 
interacting in that manner.    
10 
 
So I think maybe at the end of the whole thing, 
the main thing is to make sure we correct what we have 
seen 
happening 
during 
our 
tenure 
in 
the 
National 
Assembly. 
 
To me personally, I do not think the Study 
Groups are necessary for the reasons I have just explained 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you.  Perhaps I should just 
place on record and make clear Ms Letsatsi-Duba, that 
20 
although when you left this committee you became the 
Deputy Minister in the Ministry, you have since resigned 
from Parliament and no longer a member of Parliament.  Is 
that correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, I have resigned. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 217 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   So an ex-MP, now looking back on 
your experience? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I think you said in a note that I 
saw in some correspondence, I think yesterday, that you 
come here wishing to participate in a constructive manner 
to try to assist in helping to improve practises for the 
future. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I understand, it is in that context 
that you as a member of the ANC, as a former Minister, as 
a former Chair of a Portfolio Committee.  You think that 
this Study Group system is problematic and it needs to be 
rethought. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And can I put to you another problem 
with the Study Group issue?  You yourself said the 
following a minute or two ago.  You said in the Study 
20 
Group, we interrogate the employees of the ruling party, 
which I think is correct.   
 
You were referring, I presume, not only for 
example the Minister or the Deputy Minister but also to 
Senior Directors, General Deputy Directors, General Senior 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 218 of 269 
 
Representatives in the SOE’s.  Would that be correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   The reason why I am saying this 
Study Group how it is being structured is problematic is 
precisely that because there in the Study Group, it is 
supposed to be members of the ruling party only but you 
more often find officials from the department coming to 
present in that Study Group. 
 
We do not know whether they are members of 
the ANC or they are not but they will be part of the Study 
Group.  So we – to really look into – the whole thing of the 
10 
Study Groups, you know, in relation to how to improve 
accountability and oversight. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now each Study Group, as I 
understand the evidence we have already heard, has its 
own Whip.  Each...   
 
So for example, you were the Chair of the 
Portfolio Committee but you would also have within your 
caucus, 
your 
ANC 
caucus 
on 
the 
Study 
Committee 
somebody who served as a Whip at that committee.  In 
fact, I think it was Mr Rantho, was it not? 
20 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes.  In fact, the Whip is the one 
who is the convenor of the Study Group. 
ADV FREUND SC:   H’m.  And my impression, but please 
correct me if I am wrong, is that it would be not at all 
unusual for the Study Group to make decisions on what 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 219 of 269 
 
approach will be adopted in the Portfolio Committee 
meetings by the members in the Study Group. 
 
In other words, by the ANC members and they, of 
course, are the people who will ultimately determine the 
decisions 
of 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
because 
they 
constitute the majority of that.   
 
Do you agree with what I have just said? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, I do agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So really, before the Portfolio 
Committee meeting starts, if you are a participant in the 
10 
Study Group and as long as you abide by the directives of 
the Whip of your Study Group, you have already decided 
what approach to adopt in your Portfolio Committee 
meeting. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That would be the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would the...  Is your understanding 
that within the members of the ANC in a particular Portfolio 
Committee who have been party to a Study Group meeting 
before the Portfolio Committee, would your understanding 
be that the general understanding among members of the 
20 
ANC is that you have to – at the meeting of the Portfolio 
Committee meeting act in accordance with the decisions 
taken in the Study Group? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what is expected and that is what 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 220 of 269 
 
members of the ANC understand to be the position? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And most of the time, would they act in 
accordance with those decisions of the Study Group? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In your experience. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Most of the time, that is what they would 
do? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would there be times when they 
deviate from those decisions in terms of how they deal with 
issues at the Portfolio Committee?  How often would that 
happen?  Obviously, I am not looking for a mathematical 
number.  Just an idea. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just an idea.  How rare or usual it is 
that some members, once they are in the meeting of the 
Portfolio Committee, decide to approach issues differently? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, there will not be such. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   They will not do that. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Letsatsi-Duba, I 
want to now take you to paragraph 15 of your affidavit.  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 221 of 269 
 
You say in there: 
“The oversight tools available to the committee 
were not sufficient. 
The committee relied mainly on annual reports 
and oversight visits to state-owned entities to 
execute 
their 
constitutional 
obligation 
of 
oversight...” 
 
So I am interested in and I would ask you please 
to elaborate what you meant when you said the oversight 
tools were not sufficient. 
10 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   The oversight tools I am referring 
to, 
you 
will 
recall 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
state-owned 
enterprises, there was a Presential(?) Review Committee 
which was formed in 2009.   
 
That 
committee 
came 
up 
with 
the 
recommendation which says there should be an overwriting 
legislation 
which 
must 
govern 
all 
the 
state-owned 
enterprises.  That is one. 
 
So when I am saying the tools, I am referring to 
this absence of overall – overwriting legislation because it 
20 
was supposed to have been done a long time ago and it 
was not there. 
 
Secondly, there is what we call a Shareholders 
Compact which is an agreement which is entered between 
the board and the state-owned enterprises.  I mean, the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 222 of 269 
 
Board of SOE’s and the department itself. 
 
At Portfolio Committees, we do not have access 
to that because they purely say they cannot give us the 
shareholders compact because inside that there is what is 
being called corporate plans of the different business 
which they say if they hand them over to us in Parliament, 
we are compromising what they call commercial sensitivity 
issues.  So the tools are weak in that sense. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Let me deal with that one by 
one.  The first you mentioned is the absence of overwriting 
10 
legislation to regulate the governance of SOE’s.  Is that – 
am I understanding you correctly? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you say ...[intervenes]  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That was the recommendation of 
the Provincial Review Committee of 2009. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you say although it was 
recommended it was never implemented and you think it 
should have been. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   It should have been. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  Secondly, you refer to the 
problem of corporate plans.  I want to take you to 
paragraph 18 of your affidavit. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes? 
ADV FREUND SC:   There you say: 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 223 of 269 
 
“One of the state-owned entities, Eskom, did 
not share its corporate plan with the Portfolio 
Committee on the grounds that according to 
the 
board, 
Eskom 
was 
governed 
by 
the 
Companies 
Act 
which 
precluded 
such 
disclosure 
and 
second, 
disclosure 
to 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
could 
end 
up 
with 
competitors...” 
 
Now I assume, because you wrote this in your 
affidavit, this is correct, as far as you are concerned? 
10 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now I have a number of queries 
arising from that. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Okay? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Firstly, did you accept at the time and 
do you accept now that the Portfolio Committee had both a 
constitutional right and obligation and also apparent of the 
rules of the National Assembly, to summons persons to 
answer questions and to require them to answer questions 
under oath? 
20 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, we have those powers. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So there would be nothing to prevent 
you and when I say you, I mean you are talking about your 
Portfolio Committee. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 224 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Nothing to prevent you from requiring 
an entity like Eskom to furnish whatever information you 
thought 
was 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
exercise 
proper 
oversight.  Would you agree with that? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I will agree with you but remember 
when we were requesting the corporate plan, all of us, 
members of the committee including opposition parties, we 
were there when we were told flat to say we cannot give 
this to the Portfolio Committee.  And then they were saying 
the Eskom is being governed by the Companies Act.  Those 
10 
are the reasons. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is what they said.  Now I am... 
with you, really, what to be the appropriate response of 
your committee when you are confronted with them, saying 
things like that.  So if I understand what you say.  Eskom, 
through its board, told your committee that it could not 
disclose 
information 
because 
it 
could 
end 
up 
with 
competitors.  Is that correct?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Perhaps you could tell because I am 
20 
not aware of this.  Which competitors does Eskom have?  I 
thought it had a statutory monopoly? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes.  It is a monopoly. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   So ...[intervenes]  
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 225 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   So the excuse gave carries no water. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   It carries no water.  The same thing 
as Denel, they refuse to say, no, it will end up with the 
competitor, forgetting that Eskom is a pure monopoly 
company. 
ADV FREUND SC:   So you and I seem to be in agreement 
that the excuse raised by Eskom and you say a similar 
excuse was raised by Denel, was an unacceptable excuse? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   It was an unacceptable excuse. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Unacceptable, not acceptable.  You 
10 
agree? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Unacceptable excuse. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Right.  Now when you are confronted 
as a Portfolio Committee with an excuse for not providing 
information that you thought was necessary, you have the 
power to compel it to be produced.  Did you not? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, we have the powers but I do 
not know if you are familiar with how the Portfolio 
Committees are run?  Time is very limited.  They come and 
present this and say we are not able to...   
20 
 
In the next meeting when we are supposed to 
follow-up on this issue, we have another entity.  By the 
time we come back to Eskom, we are almost a year – 
towards end of the year.   
 
So the – how the committees work, they also 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 226 of 269 
 
need much more of consistency in dealing with the matters 
because 
we 
have 
so 
many 
issues 
as 
members 
of 
Parliament to give attention to.   
 
So in my own thinking, I think we need to have a 
small team which will be part of the committee which will 
be able to assist with the research and also to follow-up on 
issues which were raised in the committee and we do not 
have such. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright.  And is the consequence of the 
fact that you did not have that, that really, in your own 
10 
opinion, 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
did 
not 
effectively 
exercised oversight? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   I think so.  I really think so 
because we were effective in our oversight with properly 
trained personnel, administratively and even legally and even 
technically, would be a situation where we are right now in 
relation to Eskom challenges and all other SOEs including your 
SAA. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes, because I take it, Ms Letsatsi-Dube 
that you, as a citizen, like me as a citizen, had been reading in 
20 
the newspapers for years from 2011 onwards a series of quite 
serious allegations about the manner in which the SOEs were 
being run and the series of allegations that there was improper 
influence being exercised over the leadership of those SOEs.  
Am I correct?  You were aware of those allegations. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 227 of 269 
 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   We were aware of those allegations. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And would it be correct to say that in your 
own opinion the portfolio committee on Public Enterprises 
did not effectively exercise its oversight powers with a view 
to trying to probe those allegations and trying to ensure that 
the appropriate necessary remedial measures were taken? 
MS 
LETSATSI-DUBE: 
 
 
That 
I 
fully 
agree 
with 
that 
statement.  We failed to exercise our oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me ask me ask this question.  
Well, one, I appreciate, Ms Letsatsi-Dube, the fact that 
10 
where you see that there was failure you are prepared to say 
yes, we failed in that respect because it is going to be 
difficult to find a solution if people are not prepared to look 
at how they have done the work and be able where they fell 
short to say yes, we failed.  But if people are prepared to 
look at issues with a view to accepting responsibility where 
things did not go the way they should have, it is half the job 
done because they can help in find a solution but if they are 
in denial they will not be part of trying to find a solution but I 
want to ask the question whether when one looks at the 
20 
failure whether that failure could be attributed only to 
matters such as not having enough capacity in terms of 
admin staff, researchers, maybe legal people and so on or 
whether there might not have been a sufficient commitment 
from the majority of the members of the committee to really 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 228 of 269 
 
hold their own comrades who happen to be in the executive 
to account?  Maybe partly because of what would have 
been said in study groups.  I have heard evidence that in 
some cases it would be said by some people within the 
ANC to members of committee, portfolio committees or 
some of them at least that they must remember that the 
minister that is appearing before a portfolio committee or 
that will be appearing is an ANC minister, they must not 
act like they are members of the opposition, but this is an 
ANC minister.  Therefore, in other words, they must not, 
10 
as I understand, probe too much.  In other words, they 
must be soft on the ministers because they are from the 
same party. 
 
So my question is whether on your assessment it is 
not the case that part of the problem might have been an 
insufficient commitment or willingness to really do this job 
of oversight properly and effectively because otherwise 
you might be seen as if you are behaving like an 
opposition party member or you might be seen as 
behaving like somebody who is not a disciplined cadre of 
20 
the party.  What do you say about that? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Chair, let me begin by saying when 
you join the parliament you are being brought by the ANC, 
you are being brought by the party like all other political 
parties but once you are in there, when you take an oath, 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 229 of 269 
 
you abide by the constitution of the country and you also 
indicate that you will serve the people of the Republic.  
Now the question you are saying, was it because of lack 
of commitment from other members, that is correct, 
because you will remember we are not on the same level 
as part of the consciousness, the political consciousness 
as members. 
 
Now others will go there to say much as I am here 
because I am sent here by the party but I must also do the 
right thing because I have taken an oath as an individual 
10 
that I am going to serve the Republic and abide by the 
constitution.  So in most cases you will find there is these 
imbalances in the committees, especially from our side in 
the 
ruling 
party 
where 
people 
have 
a 
different 
understanding and once you speak to that, there will be 
others who will be saying we are not – how do I put it, we 
are ill-disciplined, this is the minister of the ruling party, 
you cannot believe like you are in an opposition.  It is like 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So on your understanding those things 
20 
indeed have some influence on how particularly members 
of the ruling party or some of them would approach their 
job of oversight? 
MS 
LETSATSI-DUBE: 
 
 
And also 
hamper, 
they 
put 
obstacles for the work of the committee. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 230 of 269 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is quite – ja.  Thank you for 
those answers.  Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you, Chair.  When you say they 
would hamper and put obstacles in the way, would you like to 
elaborate on that a little? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   For instance I will give an example, 
that there were issues around the issue of the Chief Executive 
Officer of Eskom being a member of the ANC himself and when 
we are supposed to really dig deeper into the issues, there will 
be some who will be soft on those issues precisely because of 
10 
the political allegiance they hold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Chief Executive Officer you are 
talking about, is it Mr Brian Molefe or is it somebody else or 
you are just making an example? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   I am just making an example, not 
necessarily Brian Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  Alright.  Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you.  So the principle that I think 
you are trying to explain is that at least some ANC members of 
study groups and portfolio committees would feel that precisely 
20 
because the members of the executive being overseen 
including senior leadership of SOEs were themselves ANC 
party deployees, that is a reason why the portfolio committee 
and the study group should go soft, should not be seen to be 
trying to embarrass or to hold them to account.  Am I 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 231 of 269 
 
understanding you correctly? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   You are understanding me correct and 
we often will argue to say you know what, we cannot afford not 
to hold them accountable, we need to because this is our 
responsibility but as I indicated, other people – as I indicated 
to say, we are on different levels in terms of our understanding 
and our goal in parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask this?  From what you say and 
from what other witnesses connected with parliament have 
said, it appears to me that within the ruling party when it 
10 
comes to the performance of oversight functions and holding 
the executives accountable in parliament but by portfolio 
committees and like as in the National Assembly as well, 
there would be some ANC members who would believe that, 
for example, exposing corruption in a minister’s department 
by a member of the ANC in a portfolio committee asking, so 
to speak difficult questions about that and exposing that 
would not be good for the party but maybe there would be 
others who would think it is the right thing to do.  Is my 
understanding correct, that that is what you are saying, part 
20 
of what you are saying? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   That is the correct understanding, 
Chair, because if you are not exposing the weaknesses or 
the corrupt practices coming from the very same party you 
are 
directly 
destroying 
the 
very 
same 
party 
you 
are 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 232 of 269 
 
representing.  That is my understanding, that we need to 
hold them accountable so as to enable us to strengthen the 
ruling party because you keep on brushing, keep on 
brushing, keep on brushing and at the end of the day there is 
no service delivery, people start protesting, we experience 
political instability.  So my understanding was that you 
people, we must just do the right thing irrespective of who is 
the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was going to come to that because 
I think I would feel ashamed if I was a member of a political 
10 
party and somebody, a comrade or colleague in the same 
party does not want to expose corruption because he thinks 
he protects my party by covering up corruption.  How do you 
protect the image of your party by covering up, protection.  
Maybe for temporarily you might think it helps but in the end 
it will come out and is it not better, do you not enhance the 
image or your party better by being party to exposing 
corruption and showing that your party is intolerant of 
corruption rather than your party being seen as tolerant of 
corruption.  So that is the question that I always have to say 
20 
why do people want – why do people think their party 
requires the covering up of corruption in order for it to be 
strong?  Is the opposite not what they should be fighting for 
to say what strengthens our party is an image of it being 
intolerant of corruption not an image of it being soft on 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 233 of 269 
 
corruption or being even prepared to cover up corruption if 
its own members are alleged to be involved in corruption?  I 
suspect that your thinking is very much in line with my 
thinking based on what you have said before. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   It is in line with my thinking because 
I do not want to dwell much on the values and the principles 
of the organisation.  I belong to the African National 
Congress which now is something else.  We cannot go there 
because everybody who can see but being a member of 
parliament in any way is about upholding the constitution and 
10 
serving the people and if you have members within your own 
party who think other way, they do not realise they are 
bleeding the organisation by not exposing the wrongs which 
are done.  I always say you know what, these are our 
comrades, if there is anything wrong happening, it is us who 
must tell them, it is us who must assist them to do the right 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. No, thank you.  Mr Freund? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Ms Letsatsi-Dube, 
when I listen to you, I get the impression, but you must 
20 
correct me if I am wrong, that when you were in parliament in 
the period that we are talking about, there must have been 
within the ANC caucus two conflicting points of view, some 
who felt that it was appropriate to effect this oversight in 
parliament to expose and address allegations of corruption 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 234 of 269 
 
and wrongdoing and some who felt that it was the wrong 
thing to do strategically.  Am I understanding that correctly, 
there were two different points of view? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Yes, there were two different points 
in that regard, that there will be some to say we cannot hang 
the linen in front of the opposition and our argument with 
others, with the committee, will be saying it is not about 
hanging dirty linen, it is about correcting the wrong. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now you would be aware, I am sure, I 
mean, for example, from the last witness who testified, Mr 
10 
Frolick, that in the middle of 2017 Mr Frolick issued a 
number of letters to chairs of portfolio committees saying in 
your committees you should investigate allegations which he 
said were allegations that had appeared in the so-called 
Gupta Leaks and he said that that had the support of the 
Speaker and the Chief Whip who was then Mr Jackson 
Mthembu.  Are you familiar with that moment in our history? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   I am.  I am very much familiar. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now …[intervenes] 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   And we have been pushing this 
20 
behind the same – to say Chief Whip is only parliament 
which can make an impact in going deep into what we are 
seeing in the public space and all of us, like them and the 
Speaker, we were in agreement to say let us proceed with 
this. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 235 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright.  Now let me be clear that I have 
no 
criticism 
for 
those 
who 
pushed 
for 
that 
type 
of 
investigation 
of 
allegations 
and 
remedial 
action 
where 
necessary but what I would like to explore with you is why it 
took so long because that happened in June of 2017 and 
even then it was not an unmitigated success, it only 
happened in part and it continue to meet resistance.  Why 
did it take so long?  You say – I got the impression from the 
answer you gave a moment ago, that you were one of a 
group of people who were encouraging the Chief Whip to 
10 
encourage that there should be a change of stance.  So why 
did it take so long? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   It took long because you will 
remember we belong to a caucus where issues are being 
debated and agree upon.  Now on this particular issue of 
having the inquiry, there was some resistance, if I put it in 
that way, that it should not happen and most of the reasons 
which were put forward was that already the Public Protector 
is dealing with the matter but our argument was that well, it 
is fine, she is also doing – it was Thuli Madonsela then, she 
20 
is doing her job but us, as parliament, especially us from the 
ruling party, we cannot ignore such damning allegations. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Right.  Now I want to go back a little 
earlier to a time that you were still the chair of the portfolio 
committee and you refer in paragraph 26 of your affidavit to 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 236 of 269 
 
two letters that you received from  Honourable Mazzone of 
the Democratic Alliance and I hope that you have at your 
disposal those letters.  So I want to take you to her letter of 
the 14 March 2016 which, Chair, is in bundle 2 at page 192.  
Do you, Ms Letsatsi-Dube, have Ms Mazzone’s letter of the 
14 March 2016? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   I do, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page, Mr Freund, in volume 2, 
bundle 2? 
ADV FREUND SC:  Page 192. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, page 192. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now – are you with me, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am, thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Ms Letsatsi-Dube, that letter can speak 
for itself but basically it is a request from Ms Mazzone that 
the portfolio committee on Public Enterprises should conduct 
a full parliamentary inquiry into the capture of SOEs by the 
Guptas 
and 
then 
she 
proposes 
that 
the 
committee 
immediately summon the Guptas to appear before it to 
answer these allegations as per her previous letter to you.  
20 
Her evidence is that this is not the first letter, there was one 
shortly before this.  You should call former Minister of Public 
Enterprises, Barbara Hogan and Malusi Gigaba to provide 
full details of their relationship with the Gupta family, Mr 
Gigaba 
in 
particular, 
should 
summons 
the 
CEOs 
and 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 237 of 269 
 
Chairpersons of the largest SOEs to appear before it and she 
asked for a response. Now you confirm and recall receiving 
that letter, I presume? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Pardon? 
ADV FREUND SC:  You can confirm that you received that 
letter and you were aware that that was request. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   No, on this one I am not aware of 
receiving the letter.  The letter I can confirm is the one 
where she was a requesting a full parliamentary inquiry into 
the Guptas allegations. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well, if you look at the first paragraph of 
the letter of the 14 March 2016 – do you have the letter 
dated the 14 March 2016? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Yes, I do have. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And you will see in the first paragraph, 
she requests the portfolio committee on Public Enterprise 
conducts a full parliamentary inquiry. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Oh, yes, yes …[intervenes] 
ADV FREUND SC:  Into the capture of SOEs by the Guptas.  
You received this letter, you were aware of this letter. 
20 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And then if I can refer you to a later letter 
from her dated the 22 March and Chair, that is at page 200 
in volume 2.  Do you have that letter, the letter of the 22 
March? 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 238 of 269 
 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Yes, I do have. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And really it is largely repeating what has 
previously 
been 
said 
but 
with 
some 
more 
extensive 
motivation. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  You agree.  And then what happens is 
that that request was refused and we find the refusal in a 
letter by yourself at page 219 of the bundle, it is a letter by 
yourself dated the 6 April 2016.  Do you have that letter? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Yes, I do have the letter. 
10 
ADV FREUND SC:  And what you say, if I can paraphrase it, 
in that letter, you say that you have received legal advice 
that that inquiry that she is requesting that the Guptas 
should be summonsed and minister should be summonsed 
requires a house resolution and without a house resolution 
no such inquiry can take place.  Now Mr Frolick testified 
before you and he says but that is just wrong, he said you 
did not need a house resolution, you had the powers to do 
this, you could have done this if you had wanted to and in 
his opinion you should have done so.  Now what do you say 
20 
now with the benefit of hindsight? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Well, you would see towards the last 
paragraph of my letter of the 6 April, I was saying I was 
seeking a legal services on how to process the request, how to 
process the request because she mentioned the Guptas, the 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 239 of 269 
 
former ministers and so on.  Unfortunately, the parliamentary 
legal services, they brought all these other issues to say we 
need a house resolution, the Public Enterprise has no 
authority and so on and so on and remember – remember, my 
initial thought was to say this is not a small matter to deal 
with in a hurry, we need to get legal processes, not on the 
merit of the case or not but processes to say if we say we 
call the Guptas, what are the processes to be followed, 
please 
advise 
the 
committee 
as 
the 
legal 
adviser.  
Unfortunately, like I said in my earlier inputs to say we have 
10 
– we do not have capacity in terms of legal and all other 
requirements to deal with the issues in a proper manner.  So 
this answer was not [indistinct] 27.19 to me but unfortunately 
I was not able to do so because this was towards the end of 
the – what do we call it, what we call …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Financial year? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Recess in parliament from time to 
time.  By the time you come back from recess and the 
constituency work, other issues have come in place already.  
So I was in agreement with the letter but here I just wanted 
20 
the 
legal 
process 
to 
follow. 
 
Unfortunately, 
I 
was 
misunderstood by the advisers or maybe they did understand 
and then decided to answer us in this manner. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well …[intervenes] 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   That is what – and excuse me, sir… 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 240 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:  Yes. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   That is why at the end of it I was 
saying I trust that you will find the above of assistance and 
trust that it will be – it will assist parliament in dealing with 
the alleged phenomenon of state capture.  So I was 
admitting to say yes, we need to do this. So my last 
sentences prove to say we needed this but we needed 
processes to advise us. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Alright, but do I understand you correctly 
that whatever the legalities or the legal advice you received, 
10 
your personal view at the time was it was necessary to hold 
precisely an inquiry of the type that Ms Mazzone was 
requesting? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:  And the advice that you had received that 
it needed a house resolution, did you assume that that 
advice was correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Well, I assume it was correct.  Where 
I did not agree, it is on point two where it says the committee 
on Public Enterprise has no authority by law to initiate such 
20 
but on one, I did not have a problem. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Well, I am sorry, but I do not clearly 
understand what you are saying because it seems to me, if one 
just reads Rule 138 that you had the authority to conduct an 
investigation and to summons people and that you did not 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 241 of 269 
 
need anybody else’s approval to do that. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBE:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Now did you know that at the time and 
accept that at the time, or were you under impression that 
you did not have that authority? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Well I was aware we have the 
authority, that is why I am saying on two I agree but 
remember I said on the first paragraph to say I was looking 
for legal processes, but not to say you cannot do the 
inquiry.   I was asking for them to assist us to initiate that 
10 
process. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But I am saying that you understood 
that unless there was a House Resolution, it was not 
permissible 
for 
your 
inquiry, 
for 
your 
committee 
to 
commence such an inquiry. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is the impression I had at that 
time. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that is the impression you had, 
because that was the legal advice you received. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Freund let us talk about 
your understanding before you received the legal advice. 
What was your understanding before you received the legal 
advice on whether or not the Portfolio Committee could 
initiate such an inquiry or could there summon Ministers 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 242 of 269 
 
and members of the public to answer certain issues in the 
private Portfolio Committee?  
Did you believe that it had the power to do so or did 
you believe that it did not have such a power unless there 
was a resolution of the National Assembly that it could go 
ahead and do that? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Personally, I believed we had the 
powers.  I am trying to look into the section where in 
empower us, now it is Section 201 of the rules of 
Parliament, I do not know if you will be able to - but now, 
10 
we are not legal people, you go and interact with the legal 
people, they will tell you different interpretations of the 
rules and the laws, and you take advice from them.  
But personally, I knew from Section 201, that the 
committee have the powers to summon whoever even the 
members of public, who happened to commit whatever 
outside then to come and account into the Parliament.  So 
this 
was 
my 
understanding 
but 
when 
the 
Advisory 
Committee of Parliament will say, no we cannot - and 
remember, our work was not only on this, we had other 
20 
issues to deal with also and we relied on them because 
they are legal people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But after the legal advice had arrived, 
did it not occur to you to just go and check this Rule 138 
they were talking about to see whether it says what they 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 243 of 269 
 
say it says? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did, and when you looked at it, did 
you agree with their advice or understanding of it or did 
you not? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, no I did not agree with the 
legal advice.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   And remember this is something 
else. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Rule 138, ja I have not looked at it 
now but I have looked at it, I think in the past at some 
stage, but what I am thinking is that if you looked at it, and 
you did not agree with them, one would have expected that 
you would go back to them and say, you people, this rule 
that you have cited, does not say what you are saying and 
then hear what they have to say.  Did you do that? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, no their Chair I need to admit I 
did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you accept that that is what you 
20 
should have done. 
MS 
LETSATSI-DUBA: 
 
 
Here 
we 
could 
have 
acted 
differently but I admit I did not.  I did not go back to them 
to say this is how I think, quoting 201 of the section.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you accept that that is what you 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 244 of 269 
 
should have done? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That is what I should have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. Okay, alright Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  Now. Ms 
Letsatsi-Duba when Ms Mazzone received your letter, 
setting out your reasons for refusal, which were based on 
the legal advice that you told her you had received, she 
responded and she responded in a letter of the 12 t h of April 
2016 and Chair that is at page 221 of bundle 2.  Ms 
Letsatsi-Duba do you have that letter of the 12 t h of April 
10 
2016? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   The 12 t h of April? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, I do not have, I have the 14 t h 
of March 2015. 
ADV FREUND SC:   This is this is the annexure NM38.  It 
is one of the documents that was sent to you today. What I 
- if you struggle to find it, I will read it to you, and you may 
recall it.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Okay. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   But if you can find it, it would be 
easier. It is the letter of the 12 t h of April 2016, Annexure 
MN38 and the top left, it will have POO2221, it means at 
page 221 of bundle 2. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I do not find it. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 245 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, I see you have a lot of paper 
there and let me see if we can deal with it by me reading 
parts of it and see if you remember it. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Okay. 
ADV FREUND SC:   What Ms Mazzone says in the letter is 
she says: 
“Your letter dated the 6 t h of April 2016 refers.” 
She says: 
“I have read the contents thereof, and would like to 
respectively 
disagree 
with 
you 
regarding 
your 
10 
interpretation of Rule 138.” 
And then she says and I am paraphrasing that Rule 138 
gives the committee the power to summon any person to 
appear, and then she cites Rule 201 that says: 
“A Portfolio Committee in 201.1C may monitor 
investigate inquiry into and make recommendations 
concerning any executive organ of State and so 
forth.” 
And so she says: 
“With regard to my request for the inquiry, it is my 
20 
understanding that the members of the Gupta family 
would constitute any person and can thus be called 
to the committee to give guidance and to produce 
documents. 
 
The 
power 
derives 
directly 
from 
Section 056 of the Constitution.” 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 246 of 269 
 
Now, from what you have already told the Chair my 
understanding is that you accept all of that you agree with 
all of that, am I right?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then she continues: 
“Further, given the specific nature of their business 
relationship - there of course, is a reference to the 
Gupta family - their business relationships to a 
State owned entity Eskom, it is part of the Portfolio 
Committees functions to investigate and inquire into 
10 
this issue.” 
And I think you also agree with that, am I right? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, she says that she sent this letter 
to you on the 12 t h of April and there was very shortly after 
that, a meeting of your Portfolio Committee.  It happened, 
let me find the reference to it in her affidavit.  So she deals 
in her affidavit Chair for your references in volume 2 at 
page 25 paragraph 13.20 she deals with the letter I have 
just read to you.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what page? 
ADV FREUND SC:   It is at page 25 of bungle 2, paragraph 
13.20 that is in Ms Mazzone’s affidavit where she refers to 
the letter that I have just read to Ms Letsatsi-Duba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, I have got it. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 247 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   And then she goes on to refer in 
paragraph 13.22 that is at the next page, page 26, to the 
fact that there was a meeting of the Portfolio Committee of 
Public Enterprises.  She says that meeting concerned 
Alexkor 2014/2015 annual report, but she says that in that 
meeting, you reported to the committee on your exchange 
of correspondence with her.  And then she attaches to her 
affidavit, a report prepared by the Parliamentary Monitoring 
Group of that particular meeting of the 20 t h of April, and 
then she continues, this is what Ms Mazzone says in her 
10 
affidavit: 
“As appears from that report of the PMG, there was 
some discussion about inviting Denel to brief the 
committee about the allegations concerning itself. 
But no decision was taken to support my request to 
summon the Gupta’s and others or to inquire into 
State Capture.” 
And she says: 
“That as the report shows, she said at that meeting, 
it was the PCPE’s job to exercise oversight by 
20 
summoning any person before it.” 
And then she says: 
“Some members, this is in the in the Portfolio 
Committee meeting of the 20 t h of April, took the 
view that the issue was not on the committee's 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 248 of 269 
 
agenda, and it was premature to make a decision 
and they thought it was sufficient to invite the 
Board of Denel to deal with allegations involving 
Denel.” 
And she says: 
“She was not surprised by that, because the 
members of the majority party act in accordance 
with party decisions and instructions, and they had 
no appetite at the time to pursue the inquiry she 
had proposed.” 
10 
Now, my first question to you is this, do you recall that 
there was such a meeting, and do you agree that Ms 
Mazzone is telling the truth when she describes what 
happened at that meeting?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Well, I might not remember sir but 
what I can tell you about Ms Mazzone is that she has been 
very passionate about dealing with issues of corruption in 
State owned enterprises.  Each and every meeting, she will 
passionately raise the issues very, very strongly. And 
remember Chair, if you are a Chair of a committee, you do 
20 
not take decisions on behalf of the committee.  You Chair, 
you make sure you allow members to debate and come to 
an agreement.  
So you do not take sides, unlike if she writes to me 
straight as a Chairperson to say, I am writing to you, this is 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 249 of 269 
 
what I required.  But in the committee meeting where 
people debate you direct the meeting, accordingly, not 
taking any sides.  So the meeting she is talking about, I 
might not remember very well, but I know, for one and a 
half years, I have been there as the Chairperson, she has 
been very strong on issues of the Gupta’s and the 
corruption and so on.  
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, but I want to put to you this 
part of what she says for your comment.  Really what she 
says is, she has received your letter about the legal advice 
10 
you have received.  She had responded to your letter 
saying I think that advice is wrong, and I think we should 
continue with this, and then she says you tabled that 
correspondence at the meeting.  And I think so far, I think 
you would probably agree that that is must be, what 
happened.  Do you agree that you would have told the 
members 
of 
the 
committee 
about 
this 
exchange 
of 
correspondence?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is what the PMG report, and I 
20 
think you have accepted that, am I correct? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now the real point is this. She says 
that the committee members, and she is talking about a 
majority because she, of course, had the support of her 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 250 of 269 
 
side.  The majority simply did not support that there should 
be this inquiry, and that is why the inquiry did not happen.  
Do you agree that that is correct, factually? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think she - the way she puts it that is 
Ms Mazzone has a certain connotation.  She says in effect 
the majority members of the Portfolio Committee, the 
majority party members had no appetite for it.  That seems 
10 
to me to even indicate that they had no interest in the 
proposal.  Ms Letsatsi-Duba would you also go along with 
that, or you are not sure about that part? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, no what I want to correct is 
that, remember in the committee, we had other members 
from other political parties, other than the DA, we had a 
Freedom Front who were consistent in attending meetings.  
We have EFF, who will come from time to time.  We have 
IFP who have been consistent.  
So they all form part of the committee members.  
20 
Now, if you say, a majority, it means majority, including 
those other parties, not necessarily the African National 
Congress members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think you may be right, because I 
have not checked whether she specifically says the

majority party members or she is just saying the majority of 
the members of the Portfolio Committee which would 
obviously include or which may include, I am saying may 
because maybe the ruling party had so many members that 
the majority could only be them.  
But basically, I think what she does say is because 
the decisions of the committee have got to go by majority, 
whether you say majority is the ruling party or majority 
includes other opposition parties, but she says that the 
majority seemed to have no appetite.  And I think you want 
10 
to - you might be saying you do not have a problem that 
that may have been the position.  All you are saying is, 
maybe that might have gone beyond just the members of 
the ruling party.  It might not have been just the ruling 
party.  Is that right? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   It went on when the majority party 
the ANC member, because we had other political types in 
that meeting whom they did not voice, whether they 
20 
support or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but of course, you can only say 
that, if you remember the meeting, and you know that 
members of other opposition parties did not support her 
because it is possible that even with the support of other 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 252 of 269 
 
members, members of other opposition parties, she might 
still not have been able to get the committee to accept her 
proposal because they would still not form the majority.  
But if you do recall that no, I recall that meeting 
she did not even get support from other opposition parties, 
then of course, then that would be that.  Do you recall the 
meeting as such or do you do not recall it but you think 
this is what happened? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   On this particular meeting like I 
said, I do not recall. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay, alright Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you, and I can understand 
that you attended a lot of meetings, but I think you would 
accept this, that that particular meeting of that Portfolio 
Committee had as a majority of its members, the members 
of the African National Congress, do you agree? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   On that particular meeting which I 
do not remember. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, every single meeting of 
portfolio…[intervene] 
20 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Every single meeting no, in most 
cases will be the very same because majority of our 
members were also serving in other Portfolio Committees, 
and even the Chief Whip, not the Chief Whip the Whip of 
the committee she also had other portfolio meetings.  So in 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 253 of 269 
 
most cases, the ANC will be the very same in attendance, 
other parties will be there with the normal numbers they 
normally have. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, Chair since Ms Letsatsi-Duba 
you do not remember the meeting, I do not blame you for 
not remembering the meeting. I just want to give the Chair 
a reference to the PMG report on that meeting, the 
relevant part of that and Chair, you will find that in bundle 
2 at pages 234 to 235, and I will leave this issue at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. I wanted to put some question 
10 
arising out of that answer, yes.  Ms Letsatsi-Duba, would 
you agree, or would you not that if the Study Group of the 
ANC had taken a decision to say this proposal that was 
going to be tabled at the Portfolio Committee meeting by 
Ms Mazzone should be supported by members of the ANC 
who are members of the Portfolio Committee, then it is 
likely that there would have been support from members of 
the Portfolio Committee at the Portfolio Committee meeting 
when Ms Mazzone raised made the proposal.  
Would you accept that?  
20 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Definitely, yes, I do accept.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore that if they did not support 
the proposal, it may well be because they did not 
understand that the ANC was in favour of or the Study 
Group was in favour of that proposal.  Would you accept 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 254 of 269 
 
that? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright thank you, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair and in fairness to you 
Ms Letsatsi-Duba when one reads the PMG report, one 
does find that certain members said, well look, this issue 
was not on the agenda, and they were not fully prepared 
for this issue.  So I accept that that must also be 
recognised in fairness to an assessment of this issue, but 
even accepting that what I want to put to you is this.   
10 
And 
no 
subsequent 
meeting 
of 
this 
Portfolio 
Committee, right up until the time in June of 2017 which is 
more than a year later.  And there were many, many 
Portfolio Committee meetings on Public Enterprises in that 
time.  In no subsequent meeting, did the majority party 
ever expressed support for what they knew Ms Mazzone 
was asking the committee to do, namely to hold this 
inquiry.  Do you agree? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Let me put it in this way, the 
agenda 
of 
meetings 
they 
differ 
from 
time 
to 
time, 
20 
sometimes we will be hosting the department itself, without 
the State owned enterprises.  Sometimes we will hold 
meetings with one SOE which has got nothing to do with 
what Ms Mazzone has raised, so it differ from time to time.  
So when you say a subsequent meeting, members 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 255 of 269 
 
of the ANC or the ANC did not support is because it was 
not on the agenda for that particular, for those meetings 
which followed after she proposed. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, I hear you but let us just 
understand what we are talking about here.  You yourself, 
have told the Chair today that you were aware of serious 
allegations, and you were aware - serious allegations of 
alleged State Capture of alleged corruption.  
You tabled before your Portfolio Committee on the 
one hand Ms Mazzone request that your committee pursue 
10 
an inquiry, and on the other hand your letter refusing which 
you said is based on the legal advice that you had 
received. And I have said to you, in fairness to you, that I 
recognised that some members of that committee on that 
occasion said, well, this was not on the agenda we were 
not ready to deal with this issue.  
The implication being we need to deal with this, 
perhaps on some later occasion, are you following me and 
are you understanding and agreeing with me so far. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now, what I want to put to you is this, 
if you were concerned and this is not directed only at you 
personally, it is really directed at the ANC caucus on this 
committee.  If you were concerned that one needed time to 
study the correspondence and to take a view, it would have 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 256 of 269 
 
been the easiest thing in the world to put it on the agenda 
to have it discussed and to support it, but that never 
happened, did it? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, it did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just so that, your answer is 
recorded.  Please just repeat your answer so that it is 
recorded, I think you may have spoken too softly when you 
were answering. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Before answering the question I 
wanted to deny when the Evidence Leader says that my 
10 
letter refused Ms Mazzone’s requests towards an inquiry.  
There is no reference where we say we deny this, and in 
fact, I was even saying we are looking forward because 
this investigation will help Parliament to deal with them at 
the end of the paragraph.  But because we have discussed 
the issue later of the legal opinion from the Parliamentary 
Legal Services, I will leave it at that.  Now his question, I 
did not get it properly. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, if I can just Chair please place 
on the record that I heard the answer to the question and 
20 
the words that the answer was yes, that did not happen, 
and when you said yes, that did not happen it was in 
response to a question that I had put along the following 
lines. 
That you could have, you the caucus could have if 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 257 of 269 
 
you wanted to put that on the agenda for a subsequent 
meeting and voted in support of it but that did not happen, 
and I think you said you agreed with me and you said yes, 
that did not happen.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now as you saw it, there was 
something of a stalemate. You were not against the 
principle of parliamentary oversight on this issue, some 
10 
sort of inquiry. But the advice that you had received was 
that it could not be permitted unless there was a resolution 
in the National Assembly supporting it.  Do I understand 
that correctly?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes.  
ADV FREUND SC:   And that is what Ms Mazzone testified 
about and she said, well bearing that in mind, the DA in 
September of 2016, proposed a motion in the National 
Assembly and the motion was that the National Assembly 
itself should appoint an ad hoc Committee, Chair, this is in 
20 
bundle 2 at page 357.  So I am going to read to you what 
Mr Manyi read according to Hansard into the record at 
page 357.  He says: 
“I move that the House.” 
He says I move without notice but this is after the debate 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 258 of 269 
 
has taken place.  
“That the House one, notes the allegations of State 
Capture by certain individuals and their alleged 
undue 
influence 
over 
the 
government. 
Two, 
establishes an ad hoc Committee in terms of Rule 
2531A, the committee 2A investigate the alleged 
capture of State resources and undue influence 
over the government.” 
And then other things, make recommendations and he 
explains, 
you 
know, 
how 
this 
committee 
should 
be 
10 
composed, and that was the motion that was put to debate. 
And then if I look at page 361 of bundle 2, I see the people 
who voted no and amongst them is Letsatsi-Duba DB, I 
take it that is yourself? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Who voted where in the National 
Assembly? 
ADV FREUND SC:   Voted in the National Assembly to 
oppose a resolution that the National Assembly should 
appoint 
an 
ad 
hoc 
Committee 
to 
investigate 
these 
allegations.  Not only you of course, all the rest of the ANC 
20 
caucus did the same. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Well you know, the processes are 
so complex and difficult, because if you are not ready to 
can enter into that space of inquiry - then I do not 
remember what was the agreement, but if you say I voted 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 259 of 269 
 
yes, it was not because I did not want the inquiry to 
happen.  It might be because the processes and other 
issues.  But I want…[intervene] 
ADV FREUND SC:   Sorry, sorry to interrupt you.  But in 
fairness to you, I just want to tell you what Mr Frolick said 
because it may be of some assistance to you.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Mr Frolick drew attention to the fact 
that Mr Jackson Mthembu then the Chief Whip moved an 
amendment to the motion and the thrust of it was to say 
10 
this should not be the subject of an ad hoc Committee 
parliamentary inquiry, if anybody has allegations of this 
type, they should take it either to the Police, or the 
Chapter Nine Institutions and according to Mr Frolick that 
was the reason why the ANC members voted against this 
resolution. Now, I do not know if you have any recollection 
of this, of this particular proposed resolution. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I do not recall. 
ADV FREUND SC:   You do not recall because it? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:  Because what is interesting to me, is 
that you gave evidence a little earlier, in which you said 
that you and others contended to Mr Jackson Mthembu and 
others, that it was not adequate to leave these matters 
with the Chapter Nine Institutions or the Police, it was 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 260 of 269 
 
necessary that Parliament itself should play a role in 
investigating the credibility of these allegations, and if they 
were found to have merit to see to it that appropriate 
corrective measures were taken, did I understand that 
correctly?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And that remains your view, that is 
what should have happened? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And as you know, it did not happen 
10 
until at the very first, the letter sent by Mr Frolick in June 
of 
2017. 
There 
was 
no 
such 
inquiry 
anywhere 
in 
Parliament, do you agree with that?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, I agree. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Alright, and then what happened is 
that Mr Frolick on the instruction of the Speaker, and this 
is according to him, on the instruction of the Speaker and 
the Chief Whip, addressed three Portfolio Committees, ag 
four 
Portfolio 
Committee 
Chairs, 
to 
please 
in 
their 
respective committees investigate these allegations, in so 
20 
far as it pertained to their own portfolios.  
And we know that what came out of that, amongst 
other things, was the committee of the investigation of your 
own committee, then under the acting Chairperson of Ms 
Rantho and I presume you were aware of that at the time 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 261 of 269 
 
that they pursued that inquiry.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And I presume that she took over as 
acting Chair, precisely because your - what you told me, 
but I am assuming that you were promoted to a position 
that took you out of this particular Portfolio Committee. Do 
I understand that correctly? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV FREUND SC:   But you would have been familiar, you 
still remained a member of Parliament, and you would have 
10 
been aware of what was going on, particularly in the 
Portfolio Committee and that they were having this so 
called Eskom inquiry.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And you would have been aware, I 
assume, that there was a very limited and belated inquiry 
by the Home Affairs Portfolio Committee, into the issue of 
whether there was anything improper in the manner in 
which the former Minister of Home Affairs had dealt with 
the question of naturalisation of members of the Gupta 
20 
family.  Do you agree? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, I aware. 
ADV FREUND SC:   And were also aware that the 
Transport Portfolio Committee failed to investigate the 
allegations of State Capture, as had been requested by Mr 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 262 of 269 
 
Frolick and that the Portfolio Committee on Mineral and 
Energy, like was really never got to grips and never 
investigated.  Were you aware of that as well?  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   I was aware of that. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Now what I am interested in is what 
light you can cast, if any, on why those other committees 
did not proceed, and I want to put to you a hypothesis and 
see whether my guess is correct.  
I want to put to you that there continue to be very 
considerable resistance by important members of the ANC 
10 
caucus, who continued to oppose this type of investigation. 
Would that be a reasonable guess? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   That would be a reasonable guess, 
yes. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Well, perhaps you could just tell us 
about that a little more, because we were not there, and 
you were, so what can you tell us about this problem? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, no, I would not have much 
information but I know that one, every Thursday we will 
have a broader caucus meeting where these issues are 
20 
debated, and some of the Portfolio Committees Chair would 
not agree with what was discussed in a broader caucus.  
So it relates to the point I raised earlier on to say 
We are at a different level.  Other people will think by so 
doing, we are trying to protect the ruling party and yet on 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 263 of 269 
 
the other hand, they do not know they are inflicting the 
pain on the ruling party itself.  So it is all about that, but I 
was aware two committees, did not want to do the inquiry. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you, Ms Letsatsi-Duba I note 
that it is 7 o’clock I said to the Chair, I would try to finish 
in two hours.  I have no further questions; I imagine the 
Chair may have some further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, not many.  As a matter of interest, 
Ms Letsatsi-Duba I see that when the vote was taken in the 
National 
Assembly 
on 
this 
proposal 
or 
this 
motion, 
10 
somebody referred to as it is LM, abstained.  Would you 
know whether that was he or she was a member of the 
ruling party on not? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   LM? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
LM 
Mchaaesa[?], 
ja 
Jaeesa[?] 
or 
Jaeesa[?] I am just wondering whether this was a situation 
where all the members of the ruling party voted in one way, 
or whether there was one who abstained or whether the 
one who abstained belong to another party? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, I am not aware of that name 
20 
belong to…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  I think the question, the 
other question I have for you relates to the challenges you 
said you encountered when, as a committee, you wanted to 
hold Minister Brown accountable.  You wanted to question 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 264 of 269 
 
her on certain issues relating to her department, and she 
was not responding positively to your request for her to 
come to the meeting.  
I understand that one of the things you could have 
done, would have been to approach the Chief Whip of the 
ruling party to in effect report her to say, Chief Whip this 
comrades, Minister is not behaving properly, can you take 
necessary steps to make sure she comes to meetings of 
the Portfolio Committee, am I right to say that is one of the 
things you could have done and if so, did you do it? 
10 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, you are so correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   You are so correct, Chair but I just 
want to bring you this other element, which always 
happens all the time, because of the personalities, not all 
the Ministers disrespect, the Chief Whip, not all Ministers 
disrespect the Chair of their committees.  And as a result I 
was always in their shoes to say, you know, they had a 
very difficult job, because this person is a Minister you are 
only the Whip, and you must always talk to her to say 
20 
attend the meetings and there is norm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, is your answer that, you did not do it 
that is one you did not so to speak, report her to the Chief 
Whip and the reason why you did not do that is because 
you did not want to add to the challenges that the Chief 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 265 of 269 
 
Whip has because some of the Ministers ignore. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:    No, I did report several times 
through the Chief Whip to say we have a challenge here 
and he will be saying you know what it is so difficult to talk 
to these people because they think being a Minister is 
above everybody else, so I it was really difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do remember…[intervene] 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Not all Ministers like I said others 
tow the line they know Chief whip is the Whip of the ruling 
party, they must abide by the instructions of the ruling 
10 
party to attend meetings, also to account to the caucus, 
others they do understand.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you remember whether – who 
the Chief Whip of the ruling party was at that time or would 
you not remember? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   It was the late Mthembu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay and would it also be correct to 
say, one of the options also would have been to approach 
the leader of government business, who would have been 
the 
Deputy 
President 
at 
the 
time, 
through 
whatever 
20 
channels whether you would go directly yourself or you 
would go via the Speaker or somebody else. But would you 
agree that that is one of the options you would have used - 
that were open to you or is it not? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   No, it was one of the options but I 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 266 of 269 
 
did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, was there a reason why you did not 
do that or there was no particular reason? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   There was no particular reason 
sometimes you get discouraged by the arrogance, you 
know, displays. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, on the part of the particular 
Minister, or on the part of the person. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Now, for how long were 
10 
you Chairperson of that committee was it about one and a 
half years or how long was it? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   It was one and a half years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And during that time when you were 
Chairperson of that Portfolio Committee, is the position 
that Minister Brown never came to meetings of the Portfolio 
Committee when you had asked or is the position that she 
did come to some but not to others? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   She did come to some, if I should 
think I can count only two or three attendances in the 
20 
entire time I was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and what would be your recollection 
of how many more or less how many times she would have 
been required or if she had been committed to appearing 
before the committee each time she was required.   
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 267 of 269 
 
How many times, I am just wanting to have an idea 
what percentage of attendance it would have been.  Would 
it have been two or three times out of 20 times or out of 15 
times or 10 times.  Is that something you are able to help 
me with or not? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Ja, I can help you Chair let me say 
in my own were to say out of 100, she will attend 36 or 25 
of the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Out of how many meetings? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Out of maybe 100 of them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So less than half, far less than half 
actually. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Less than half.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:  Far less than half and that the 
Deputy Chair will always come in, and as members will be 
requesting answers from the executive authority, and she 
will not be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is alright.  Thank you very 
much Ms Letsatsi-Duba. 
20 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Thank you Chair, I just want on one 
point of detail.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 268 of 269 
 
ADV FREUND SC:   Ms Letsatsi-Duba it is correct is it not 
that you Chaired this committee from May 2014 to March 
2017.  In other words, almost three years? 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Almost three years? 
ADV FREUND SC:   That is what you say in paragraph 
seven of your affidavit, from May 2014 to March 2017. 
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Yes, to March, it is almost three 
years. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Yes, thank you, that is just all I wanted 
to clear up. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay which is quite a long time.  Okay, 
alright. Thank 
you 
very 
much, 
Ms 
Letsatsi-Duba 
for 
availing yourself to assist the Commission we appreciate it.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Thank you, I hope my inputs will be 
able to shape our country and the role of oversight in 
Parliament particularly the ruling party to become better, 
thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I think you have given us your 
experiences and your perspectives in terms of what 
happens in the ruling party and I think the point you make 
20 
in the remarks we have just made is quite important that 
we have got to look at these issues in order to see how we 
can assist our country.  That should be the primary 
concern, what should we do to assist our country?  
And what is it that may have been done in the past 
24 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 349 
 
Page 269 of 269 
 
that has not assisted our country, because we must not 
continue with things that do not assist our country, we must 
always look for ways of doing things that would assist our 
country.  So I think that is in part, part of the point you 
have made, and I think it is an important point.  
MS LETSATSI-DUBA:   Thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr Freund. 
ADV FREUND SC:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so that is all for this evening and 
your work stream remains with about two or three more 
10 
witnesses that we will deal with on dates to be arranged.  
ADV FREUND SC:   That is correct, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  No, thank you very much 
we will adjourn.  Thank you to everybody and the staff for 
staying till so late so that we could continue with the work 
of the Commission.  Thank you very much, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 25 FEBRUARY 2021
