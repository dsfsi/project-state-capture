PROCEEDINGS ON 21 JANUARY2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody. 
Are we ready? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes we are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us proceed.  Mr White you are still bound 
by the oath you took yesterday. 
MR WHITE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You appreciate that?  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair when we adjourned yesterday you asked 
Mr White what his conclusions were in respect of the benefits paid to 
the various individuals involved in the Panday investigation.  He has 
overnight had a look at his report more carefully and he would like to 
deal with each of those in turn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us do that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr White could you start please 
in your report which is RR4a at page 311 dealing with the payment 
made to the Oyster Box? 
MR WHITE:  Chair in – in that report it actually starts at page 308 I 
20 
summarise as I have briefly said yesterday the evidence that was 
available relating to each of these payments, who the supplier was that 
was paid, how they were paid and what information there was in both 
the suppliers records as well as the records of Mr Panday’s entities 
recording how the money was paid and for whose benefit it was.  Chair 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 3 of 158 
 
then at the end of each of those payments I make a brief summary of 
the findings and the first one relating to the Oyster Box which was a 
payment of R6010.00 and the person whose benefit it was for was 
Colonel Madhoe.  It is at page 311 and it is at paragraph 15.031 in the 
middle of that page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to get there.  What paragraph again? 
MR WHITE:  15.031 in the middle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Under the heading Summary of findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:  And Chair just all these findings must – must also be at 
the same time taken into account that Mr Panday’s entities were 
receiving in addition to the build up to the accommodation for the World 
Cup they were receiving various orders that they were cover quoting for 
at the same time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So there was a big build up to the – to the R26 million 
procurement but there was ongoing procurement happening at the same 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR WHITE:  And relating to this payment I say:  
“Based on the aforementioned observations it would 
be reasonable to conclude that Madhoe had received 
the benefit from Panday just shortly after an 
application dated 8 October 2009 was submitted to 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 4 of 158 
 
the National Commissioner’s office for authority for 
accommodation of police members for the soccer 
World Cup.  It was also recorded in this letter that 
only Gold Coast Trading had responded to the 
request for quotations whilst Coastlands ignored the 
police’s request to provide a quotation.  So there 
was a statement that Coastlands refuted and they 
said they were never asked to quote at the early 
stage.  So that was documentation already in 2009 
and where they are effectively saying Coastlands is 
10 
one of the only entities or the only entity that will be 
able to provide the accommodation.  And there was a 
benefit to Mr or Colonel Madhoe at the same time 
who was the author of those documents.” 
Chair then the second payment is for flights from Durban to Cape Town 
in the amount of R8584.00.  Those were air tickets for Colonel Madhoe 
and his family.  Again paid for by Mr Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Oh okay now I see.   
MR WHITE:  Chair and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was looking for the amount so I have seen where it 
20 
is ja.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  It is in the heading Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And then Chair the – I summarise my findings on that at 
page 315.  And at page 315 the first paragraph in that – on that page 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 5 of 158 
 
paragraph 15.041. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  I state: 
“I can conclude from the examination of the 
abovementioned documents that Panday has paid the 
cost for Madhoe and his family to fly return trip from 
Durban to Cape Town.  Which means that Madhoe 
received a benefit in the amount of R8584.00.  This 
benefit was received just shortly after the submission 
was made to the National Commissioner’s office on 8 
10 
October 2009 to obtain authority for accommodation 
of police members during the soccer World Cup.  
Where this application indicates that the only 
supplier who was able to accommodate police 
personnel was Gold Coast Trading.” 
Chair the third payment which is directly below that relates to the 
payment to Varsity College of R43 500.00.  Chair I summarise my 
findings… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am still trying to see where that is. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry it is page 315 Chair roman numeral iii. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 315? 
MR WHITE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair the summary that was being 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 6 of 158 
 
referred to with regard to the flights is paragraph 15.041. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  On page 315. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Then you move to R43 500.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Chair and then the – the summary of the 
evidence is set out on the next three pages.  And then I summarise my 
findings on page 317. And the last paragraph on that page at paragraph 
15.049 and I state: 
“I can conclude from the examination of the 
abovementioned documents that Panday as on 22 
10 
January 
2010 
paid 
the 
Varsity 
fees 
for 
Narainpershad’s son in the amount of R43 500.00.  
This payment was made just shortly after the 
submission 
was 
made 
to 
the 
National 
Commissioner’s office on 8 October 2009 to obtain 
authority for accommodation of police personnel 
during the soccer World Cup and where it was 
recorded that the only supplier who was able to 
accommodate police personnel was Gold Coast 
Trading.” 
20 
I continue on the following page, page 318 paragraph 15.050. 
“In this specific instance Narainpershad was also 
responsible for requesting quotations from suppliers.  
One of which was Coastlands who allegedly did not 
respond.  However Coastlands have denied that they 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 7 of 158 
 
were ever contacted in this regard and they have 
indicated that when Narainpershad provided the final 
numbers to them for accommodation just prior to the 
World Cup they were far less than what they had 
quoted.  Narainpershad was approached about the 
concerns that they had but he indicated that he had 
divided the numbers between the three suppliers.  I 
can conclude the numbers were never divided 
equally.  In fact Gold Coast Trading was allocated 
1030 members 80% at a cost of R32 810 000.00 and 
10 
Coastlands, 20 members 16% at a cost…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  200 members. 
MR WHITE:  Sorry. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is 200 members or is that wrong. 
MR WHITE:  No it is 200 members Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR WHITE:  At 16% at a cost of R1 827 500.00.   
“Even when Panday approached Coastlands for 
assistance during the soccer World Cup he allegedly 
20 
indicated to them that he had been mandated by 
head office and asked them to reduce their rate per 
night as he was not making much of a profit.  This is 
untrue as he was billing the SAPS at a rate of 
R850.00 per person per night.” 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 8 of 158 
 
Chair maybe just to explain what I am actually saying there is that 
when the submissions were done to the National Office in 2009 in 
November they said that Coastlands had not responded to a request for 
a quotation.  In fact most of the suppliers they asked they just said 
they did not respond.  In effect and as a result Gold Coast was the only 
supplier that had rooms available. When Coastlands were interviewed 
by the police investigating the matter they said they were never asked 
to quote in 2009.  They were in fact only asked to quote in April and 
May of 2010 and even although they said they had a significant number 
of rooms available a very small portion of that rooms – in fact less than 
10 
half was actually booked by the police.  And in fact Captain 
Narainpershad allocated those rooms or those bookings to Gold Coast 
who then went and booked them at Coastlands and charged the police a 
significantly higher price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I was going to ask whether you were done with 
whatever benefits Colonel Madhoe may have received. 
MR WHITE:  Chair they were – no there is more Chair because they 
were done in date order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR WHITE:  I can jump around but the report was just set out in date 
20 
order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It was summarised one after the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay – okay you can continue as you had planned to 
but maybe later on you can put in a supplementary affidavit where you 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 9 of 158 
 
– you prepare it according the suspects so to speak.  The persons who 
benefitted to make it clear this is the case against so and so, this is the 
case against so and so, this is the case against so and so.  I have no 
doubt that it is in your report it is a question of it has been arranged in 
a certain way and I would prefer – it would be convenient for me if I 
could have a document which makes it clear like that according to 
Colonel Madhoe what did he do, what did he benefit.  The next one and 
so on and so on. 
MR WHITE:  I can do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so but for now we can continue the way you 
10 
have arranged it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair the – the witness will certainly prepare 
that for you and I understand that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The only issue that an advantage of doing it 
in this way and explaining the evidence in this way just at this stage is 
with reference to the timeline that we looked at yesterday with regard 
to significant events. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So where he goes like this then you can see 
20 
the gifts, the date of the gift and what significant event in the 
procurement process occurred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And – I just – I understood that as the 
[indistinct]. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 10 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no that is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Ja.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Okay Chair so the fourth payment was the payment to 
Game stores that is in the middle of page 318.  It was an amount of 
R7154.00. Chair that was the payment for the treadmill that was 
delivered to Captain Narainpershad’s house.  And Chair I summarise 
my finding relating to that on page 322. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That amount is written in an unusual way because of 
that comma, is it not?  R7 154.00. 
10 
MR WHITE:  So Chair throughout my report I have put commas between 
the thousands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR WHITE:  Thousands and the millions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR WHITE:  And then where it is cents it has a full stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  No, no, no that is fine. It is just looks unusual 
to the eye.  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair I summarise the findings to that at page 322 in 
paragraph 15.065 at the top of that page.  Sorry Chair I have jumped.  
20 
Sorry I should be at page 319 Chair sorry.  The paragraph 15.56 at the 
bottom of the page. 
“I 
can 
conclude 
from 
the 
examination 
of 
abovementioned 
documents 
that 
Panday 
has 
purchased a Trojan treadmill in the amount of 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 11 of 158 
 
R7 154.00 on his credit card which was delivered to 
the residential address of Narainpershad on 26 
February 2010.  This purchase was made subsequent 
to 
the 
SAPS 
application 
to 
the 
National 
Commissioner’s office on 8 October 2009 to obtain 
authority for accommodation of police members 
where it is recorded that the only supplier who was 
able to accommodate police personnel was Gold 
Coast Trading. This purchases was also made prior 
the appointment of Panday’s related entities for a 
10 
number of orders before the soccer World Cup.” 
Chair the – the fifth payment at the top of page 320 is the Toyota 
Corolla vehicle in an amount of R60 000.00.  Chair will recall that 
yesterday that was the vehicle we spoke about that was purchased from 
Advocate Cars.  And I summarise my findings on page 322 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether the owner of that business was 
once an advocate.   
MR WHITE:  At page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue Mr White. 
MR WHITE:  322 at the top of the page in paragraph 15.065. 
20 
“I can conclude from the examination of the 
abovementioned 
documents 
that 
Panday 
has 
purchased a 2002 Toyota Corolla in the amount of 
R60 000.00 for Mr T Madhoe on 8 March 2010.  This 
purchase 
was 
made 
subsequent 
to 
the 
SAPS 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 12 of 158 
 
application to the National Commissioner’s office on 
8 
October 
2009 
to 
obtain 
authority 
for 
the 
accommodation of police members during the soccer 
World Cup where it is recorded that only supplier 
was able to accommodate police personnel namely 
Gold Coast Trading.  In addition this purchase was 
also made prior to the appointment of Panday’s 
related entities for a number of orders before the 
soccer World Cup specifically the final order issued 
to Gold Coast Trading in the amount R26320 250.00 
10 
dated 10 June 2010.” 
Chair the sixth payment is directly below that.  That is the payment 
relating to the Dish Restaurant which is in the Royal Palm Hotel and 
the amount was R18 712.00.  Chair I summarise the findings and there 
is a number of documents in between as well as extracts from the 
various affidavits relating to the involvement of the Provincial 
Commissioner in trying to stop the investigation.  Those are extracts 
from Brigadier Kempt and Major General Booysen’s affidavits and I 
summarise the findings at page 337 and 8 and it starts in the middle of 
the page at paragraph 15.095 and I state: 
20 
“I can conclude from the examination of the abovementioned documents 
that Panday has paid the cost of Lieutenant General Ngubeni’s 
husband’s birthday party.  It was held at the Royal Palm Hotel in 
Umhlanga Rocks on 29 May 2010.  The cost of this service amounted to 
R20 962.00.” 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 13 of 158 
 
Chair that includes the amount that was paid to the DJ of the evening. 
“Panday also requested Mr Singh who is the 
Operator or Manager of the restaurant to inflate an 
invoice for this function to the amount of R29 712.00 
and to further prepare the invoice in the favour of Ms 
B M Ngubeni.  I cannot determine on what basis 
Panday would have requested Mr Singh to have 
issued him with another invoice at an inflated amount 
and therefore cannot conclude why this would have 
been done.  However I can conclude that this gift or 
10 
gratification to Lieutenant General Ngubeni was done 
shortly before the deployments for the soccer World 
Cup and the final order.  It was issued to Gold Coast 
Trading in the amount of R26 320 250.00 dated 10 
June 2010.” 
Continue on the following page, page 338. 
“In addition Lieutenant General Ngubeni was aware 
from report received from Brigadier Kempt that there 
was an unusually high expenditure for detachment 
duties in the province and that SAPS SCM were not 
20 
complying with their SCM Policy when making these 
appointments which reports were received just prior 
to the date of her husband’s 50 t h birthday party.  She 
also appears to have been instrumental in attempting 
to stop this investigation.” 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 14 of 158 
 
The seventh payment to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please go back to 337 – page 337.  Mr Panday 
requested that a further invoice be prepared in favour of Ms B M 
Ngubeni.  That would be the Provincial Commissioner? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the significance of that invoice – of a further 
invoice being in favour of Ms B M Ngubeni? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I – 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are able to indicate?  I take it that when he 
talks about a further invoice I take it that there was one invoice that 
went to Mr Panday and now he was – he asked the people to prepare 
another invoice in favour of Ms Ngobeni. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair all I can – I can think is that Mr Panday was – 
was wanting to show the Provincial Commissioner that he had actually 
paid for something that was more expensive that he actually – his 
actual cost incurred.  That is the only inference I can make. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
is 
my 
understanding 
the 
same 
as 
the 
understanding you gained when you did the investigation namely that 
20 
there would have been a receipt or invoice – or invoice for that went to 
Mr Panday and another invoice or a further invoice that went to Ms 
Ngobeni? 
MR WHITE:  Chair the further invoice did not go to PC Ngobeni it also 
went to Mr Panday.  So he got both.  But there is just… 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 15 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It – but it was in her name is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and maybe if I could refer to the specific 
document just – it may be easier to explain and a copy of that – the 
second invoice is at page 325 and one can see at the top of the page 
that is just a photocopy of the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  In the box in the middle it say the customer is Ms B M 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ngobeni. 
MR WHITE:  Ngobeni and then on the right hand side the job number, it 
says Mr Panday. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Now Chair that invoice was not actually paid because the 
actual price was R18 712.00 for the same services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But – so the – is it correct that there were two 
invoices there? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I do not recall if I saw the first invoice but I know… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one for R18 000.00 and then this one. 
MR WHITE:  But the amount actually paid was R18 712.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there would have been a separate invoice for 
that? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there would have been this invoice. 
MR WHITE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which did not represent the true position. 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 16 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the price. 
MR WHITE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the – did these people explain why they agreed to 
do this? 
MR WHITE:  They did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they have not been asked? 
MR WHITE:  They have been asked and provided a statement and they 
said they – Mr Panday asked them to do it so they did it.  They did not 
– they just did what he asked them to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it may have been shown to Ms Ngobeni but you do 
10 
not know? 
MR WHITE:  I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But its purpose could only have been or would 
probably have been that that is the one that she would see? 
MR WHITE:  That would be inference that I would draw Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise what was the point? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If I might just remind you Colonel Van 
Loggerenberg testified about this and he said he personally went to this 
restaurant and spoke to Mr Singh about what had transpired and he 
said that there would – the two factors.  The one was put the invoice in 
the name of Ms Ngobeni.  The second was inflate the amount.  The 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 17 of 158 
 
witness appears to be addressing the second aspect why would he 
inflate the amount.  That might be to show Ms Ngobeni that he paid 
more.  Colonel Van Loggerenberg surmised perhaps there was a tax 
reason to this.  But in regard to the first aspect change the name of the 
invoice.  He admitted that he did change the name so that the first 
invoice was in the name Mr Panday.  If I might just address that aspect 
with the witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he has knowledge of it. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  If this invoice and which you now 
categorise as a gift was in the name of Mr Panday paying for a birthday 
party of Ms Ngobeni would there be a paper trail between the gift paid 
by Mr Panday and Ms Ngobeni? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there is a paper trail for R8 712.00.  So the first 
deposit was made in cash by Mr Panday.  The balance of the money 
was paid using his credit card.  So – so there is some way of tracing it 
as a result but Chair the other point there is no tax benefit in doing 
what was done here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR WHITE:  Because if this invoice was made out in the name of Gold 
Coast then they could claim it as an expense as part of their normal 
business.  But the fact that the invoice is made out to Ms B M Ngobeni 
or even Mr Panday in his personal name would mean his company 
cannot claim it as an expense for tax purposes.  So inflating it there is 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 18 of 158 
 
no reason to inflate it for tax purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Because there would – otherwise it would have to have 
been made out in the name of Gold Coast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So let us go back – leave the inflation of the 
invoice for the moment let us focus only on the change from the name 
of Mr Panday into the name of Ms Ngobeni.  If this party had been 
invoiced to Ms Ngobeni and she had paid for the party would there have 
been any difficulty? 
10 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If this was invoiced out to Ms Ngobeni as we 
– so on the face of it if it had been invoiced to her and she had paid for 
it there would be no difficulty? 
MR WHITE:  Chair there would not be but there is a mistake in trying to 
do that in this invoice is that Mr Panday’s name still appears on the 
face of the document under job number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I was about to say that the … 
MR WHITE:  So they did not achieve that objective if that is what they 
were trying to do.  They should have had his name nowhere on the 
20 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it would be interesting to know what Mr Panday 
would have to say about why his name appears here in an invoice that 
is made to customer B M Ngobeni.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair just – just in that regard.  None of the suspects 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 19 of 158 
 
were interviewed.  I mean the –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The intention was that once a charge sheet had been 
drawn up warning statements would be taken by the police and all 
these questions would be put to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  If they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR WHITE:  If they did not decide to remain silent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it leaves – it leaves it as an incomplete story 
10 
in the sense that maybe at least in regard to certain matters.  You do 
not know what the explanation is that may be given? 
MR WHITE:  I do not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr White.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think counsel for – yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Judge I do not want to interject and I have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  I notice patiently that everyone appeared to be 
struggling a little bit with this issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  But Judge there is no secret about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes oh. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Yes Judge it is filed in high court papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 20 of 158 
 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is it so? 
ADV MANIKLALL:  The full explanation is under oath by Ms Ngobeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  It seems that the witness and the investigators … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have not… 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Have not disclosed at all maybe have not seen it 
themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well – well if… 
ADV MANIKLALL:  That will come in our reply Judge. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well thank you for that information.  The investigators 
and the legal team if they got to know about that should have made 
sure we have got those papers. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Judge yesterday in anticipation of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  I mentioned it to the junior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  That it is already filed in – over at the high court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  There is no – there is no secret about this Judge. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  So we – I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well thank for that I say to the legal team all the time 
if there is a witness who is going to be called and some of the issues 
that he or she is going to deal with are issues which have been covered 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 21 of 158 
 
in some litigation get the papers from that litigation – from court so that 
we have as complete a picture as possible of what is happening. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Judge.  It is absolutely correct in fact I will even 
supply them the case numbers as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja please if you can give the case number. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  It is a matter of public record so it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  It will assist with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes with all of those things. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you very much.  Thank you. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Thank you Judge. 
MR WHITE:  Thank you.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did ….? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  For the record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Apparently something was mentioned to my 
junior, but it was not conveyed to me.  So I did not know about that.  
What had transpired, but if I can deal with this perhaps with the 
20 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well my concern is how did it come about that 
the legal team did not know and the investigators did not know.  It may 
be that the legal team might not know, but I would have thought that 
the investigators when they investigate they would get to know that 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 22 of 158 
 
there was litigation and they would mention that to the legal team and 
the legal team would then say.  Let us get hold of those papers so that 
we have a full picture. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  Apparently this was mentioned at 
4 o’ clock yesterday afternoon.  I can tell you that I was not aware of - 
of this, but what I would suggest is that I get a copy of the explanation 
and I will address it with this witness today.  I will, but I do not 
obviously want to do it without consulting the witness on this issue.  So 
if we can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  That … 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Park this for a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine, but also do not deal with it if you have 
not done the homework - so to speak. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you get - get those papers and … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And I see … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And get the whole story first. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But, I would have expected you to have asked the 
investigators these witnesses - are there no matters which have been 
20 
to court that they will be dealing with, because you remember in regard 
to the IPID witnesses as - as well as General Booysen.  I said let us 
get all litigation, court papers, judgments, affidavits. 
Get everything that may be relevant to give us a whole 
picture.  So I would have thought that you would have said to the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 23 of 158 
 
investigators is there any litigation that is relevant to this … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they do not know.  Somebody must just check, 
because some of - of these things are just in the public domain. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair the only investigation that has been 
drawn to my attention by the investigators - I mean the - the court 
applications is the applications to have the evidence that was seized 
and those subpoenas set aside pursuant to which the evidence was 
10 
seized.  So I was aware of that litigation. 
I was aware that that was dismissed and that after that there 
was the attempt to bribe General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do we have the papers relating to that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  We do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And we have the - the judgment as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So we have all those papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I have never been told about or shown these.  
I can get and I will get an explanation from the investigators as to how, 
where or if they did know about this and I will report back to you on 
that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  That is fine, but just remember I always 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 24 of 158 
 
emphasise the investigators must be guided by the legal team.  You are 
the people who know what may be presented at the hearing.  What … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May not be presented.  You are the people who are 
driving the process of presenting evidence and the investigators need 
guidance as to what they must pursue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I - I understand that and - and clearly 
Chair if I had been told this at 4 o’ clock yesterday afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The first thing I would have done is obtain 
10 
these papers and be in a position to properly address you this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  Well … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I - I apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Getting to know yesterday is too - this morning is too 
short a time … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It is too short a time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To get the papers.  So - so there - there would not 
have been much time to get the papers. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No.  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but the process to get the papers must start as 
20 
soon as possible. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It will start as soon as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if I can just continue with what you know 
Mr White.  From your investigations did Ms Ngobeni ever pay this 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 25 of 158 
 
invoice? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, she - she did not pay the restaurant - the Dish 
Restaurant.  She did not pay that and from what I could see in the 
records of Gold Coast and the various other entities as well as 
Mr Panday’s bank accounts.  There was no payment from her paying 
the money back to Mr Panday either. 
So Chair just for the record I was not aware that Ms Ngobeni 
had challenged this matter in a court proceeding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  I am only aware of what I have read in newspapers … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Where she said she paid the money back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  To Mr Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  There is no evidence that I have seen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That she did pay it back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And neither were in any newspaper articles … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Was there something showing she had paid the money 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  I would also be interested to see what those … 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 26 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Court papers show. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr White if you could then - 
you were dealing with your conclusion with regard to this payment.  I 
think it was at page 3-3-7 to eight - 3-3-8.  If you could deal with that. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair I completed that and then we just went back in 
response to your question … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  You may continue. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, the - the seventh payment continues at page 3-3-8 
and that is the Protea Hotel Waterfront in Richards Bay and the 
summary of my findings is at page 340 and I say: 
“I can conclude from the examination of the above 
mentioned documents that Panday paid the cost for 
accommodation of Narainpersad at the Protea Hotel 
Waterfront 
Richards 
Bay 
during 
the 
period 
3 April 2010 to 5 April 2010 in the amount of 
R7 256,00.” 
20 
Chair, then the last payment was a payment to Europe Car in 
the amount of R1 535,92.  Chair, I do not make a specific conclusion 
about Major-General R S Pillay’s involvement.  I just summarised the 
facts as in summarising that he was the person that hired this vehicle 
at the Durban International Airport and that it was paid for by Gold 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 27 of 158 
 
Coast Trading.  Chair, I then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there any particular reason you did not make any 
conclusion? 
MR WHITE:  There is no - Chair, I do not - I do not know why I did not.  
I actually only noticed last night when I was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Preparing for this morning that I - that I had not, but I do 
refer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  To him in - in the - in the final conclusions at - at the end 
10 
of my report Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And Chair maybe it would then be appropriate to refer to 
that which is at page 509 which is the last two pages in that bundle - 
RR4A.  Just - I summarise my findings most of which I have already 
referred to - to yesterday.  There is effectively three paragraphs at the 
very end that - that draw it all together starting at paragraph 21.0-2-4.  
The second to last paragraph at page 509 and those paragraphs read 
as follows: 
“Panday with the assistance of Privisha Panday - 
20 
his wife - and Arvenda Panday - his mother - set up 
a number of entities which he controlled, but gave 
the impression they were independent of each 
other.  These entities were then used with the 
assistance 
of 
Madhoe, 
Narainpersad 
and 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 28 of 158 
 
Major-General Pillay 
to 
make 
various 
misrepresentations to the SAPS and in so doing 
manipulated the SAPS procurement process so that 
they were awarded orders for the supply of goods 
and accommodation at significantly inflated prices 
that 
were 
not 
market 
related.  
Lieutenant-General Ngobeni 
intervened 
in 
the 
investigation 
into 
the 
procurement 
related 
procedures and tried to put a stop to any further 
investigation by giving direct instructions in this 
10 
regard.” 
And then the last paragraph on the last page - 510. 
“During the same period the goods/accommodation 
was being supplied by Panday linked entities at 
inflated prices to the prejudice of the SAPS and 
when Lieutenant-General Ngobeni tried to stop any 
further investigation.  Panday was making payments 
on behalf of or purchasing various items from 
airfares, a car, accommodation, a birthday party 
etcetera 
for 
Madhoe, 
Narainpersad, 
20 
Major-General Pillay 
and 
Lieutenant-General Ngobeni.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr White you have said broadly that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Does that conclude the findings that I 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 29 of 158 
 
was looking for … 
MR WHITE:  It does Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or there were still some outstanding? 
MR WHITE:  It does in the format that - that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does? 
MR WHITE:  I have included in this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr White are there not some further overall 
findings which you make from paragraphs 15.1.1.3 to 15.1.1.9 pages 
3-4-1 to 3-4-3? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Chair, there are.  It is - it is fairly similar to what I have 
already said in one way or another elsewhere in my evidence to date.  
It is just worded - it is just summarised on those two pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Now with regard to the 
involvement of Ms Ngobeni and stopping the investigation.  You read 
your conclusions in this regard to the Chair, but those conclusions 
appear to be based on an affidavit by an Ms Kemp - Brigadier Kemp 
and an affidavit by General Booysen. 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You deal with these affidavits in some detail 
in your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just thinking about the papers and the 
application that we are talking about.  Maybe there might be a way in 
the meantime with technology for us to have a set of those papers by 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 30 of 158 
 
lunch time. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I can see no reason why you should not 
… (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - it ought to be possible.  Yes.  So - so could those 
- that be done.  So that as soon as possible somebody can have a look 
at - at the - at the papers.  I do not know how voluminous they maybe.  
They are … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They may be quite voluminous, but let us get hold of 
them as soon as possible.  I think counsel wants to say something. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sure. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Thank you Judge.  I maybe of further assistance to 
the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will be very grateful for that. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Yes.  Judge and that is in respect of the allegations 
that is being referred to in the report by the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  This was a subject matter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Of an application to strike off … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  That was brought before the Durban High Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  I will - try and access the case number remotely as 
well … 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 31 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  To hand it over to my learned friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  It is quite apparent that the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  The legal team and the witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Do not have much knowledge of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  This happened … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  A few years ago … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  But maybe subsequent to the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  That is the reason I can assume why … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  This is not before the Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  No.  Thank you very much. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  But I will assist with the case numbers. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Thank you. 
ADV MANIKLALL:  Thank you Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  I am indebted to my learned 
friend for his assistance.  Apart from the - the payment of the birthday 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 32 of 158 
 
party which you have referred to - to Lieutenant-General Ngobeni could 
you - you refer to two affidavits and you quote from them in your report 
and that is the affidavit of Brigadier Kemp and General Booysen. 
Could you please deal with what was said in those affidavits 
that made you come to the conclusion that she was involved in stopping 
the investigation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where - where are you now? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If one could start Chair at page 3-2-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but have I not heard evidence of people who 
were called by Ms Ngobeni.  General Booysen, I think testified and I 
10 
think he - he was called by - by him and he has given evidence.  I think 
there is another witness maybe - I think there is another witness if I am 
not mistaken who - who said he was called.  So that should not be a 
problem. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If Ms Ngobeni comes and testifies and denies.  That 
is fine, but this witness does not have personal knowledge of those 
calls.  He made certain conclusions, but there are witnesses who … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who - who have personal knowledge of that. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I only wanted it to be made clear that he 
came to that conclusion on the basis of these affidavits that were 
provided to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I think it does not really matter when we have 
got direct evidence. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 33 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Chair, unless you 
have further questions about the investigation itself and what it 
revealed.  I propose now to deal with what then transpired with regard 
to Mr White’s report and the involvement of the National Prosecuting 
Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much of that would he know?  Did his mandate 
not end with the report? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He is - it is directly involved Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you can continue then. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr White, when you prepared your report did 
you first prepare it in a draft form? 
MR WHITE:  I did Chair and I set it out in my affidavit at RR4 on page 
26.  So Chair if one goes back.  PricewaterhouseCoopers was 
appointed on 25 January 2012.  Some 15 months later on 10 May 2013 
I prepared a draft report.  It was 373 pages and contained 20 lever arch 
files 
of 
annexures 
and 
that 
report 
was 
given 
to 
20 
Colonel Van Loggerenberg - the lead investigator in the matter from the 
police 
and 
I 
was 
informed 
that 
it 
was 
then 
also 
given 
to 
Advocate Letsholo who was the assigned prosecutor in the matter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And to which unit?  Do you know? 
MR WHITE:  From the Special Commercial Crime Court in Durban.  
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 34 of 158 
 
There was then a meeting held on 21 May 2013 that I attended and this 
was where the report was discussed with Advocate Letsholo.  It was 
given to him and he said due to the length of it he would need some 
time to study it and once he had studied it he would come back with 
any queries that he had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that just the report only or the lever arch files 
with annexures as well? 
MR WHITE:  It would have included the annexures Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR WHITE:  It would have included the annexures. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, the report you need to read it with the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did Advocate Letsholo raise any queries or 
provide you with any comments at that stage? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair some six months passed and then I received a 
message from Colonel Van Loggerenberg on 2 December 2013 and he 
said Advocate Letsholo had studied the report and he wanted to meet to 
discuss 
his 
queries. 
 
Chair 
a 
meeting 
was 
scheduled 
for 
10 December 2013.  That meeting … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that in the affidavit? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Sorry Chair.  I - I should have assisted 
you.  I apologise.  The witness indicated that he is now referring to his 
affidavit and he is dealing with his affidavit from paragraph 28 Chair on 
page 26. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 35 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what paragraph … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that at page or paragraph? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is a page and he started - he has dealt with 
paragraph 28.  He is now dealing with a meeting on 10 December 2013 
dealt with at paragraph 30 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that meeting on 10 December it was chaired by 
10 
the 
lead 
prosecutor 
in 
the 
matter 
- 
Advocate Letsholo 
and 
Advocate Vimbani - the Head of the Special Commercial Crime Court in 
Durban was also present as well as the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess units rather than court. 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I saw that … 
MR WHITE:  Ja.  SCCU Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An advocate cannot be head of a court. 
MR WHITE:  I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  He must be head of the special crime - 
20 
specialised crime unit in the NPA.  I think. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  As well as the various investigating officers and the 
Manager assisting me in the matter - Ms Frenelle Noble from PWC.  At 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 36 of 158 
 
this meeting Advocate Letsholo raised a number of queries mainly 
where he requested some clarification in the report.  We made good 
progress, but we only got to page 116 and I can confirm that, because I 
kept notes of - of what was discussed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
MR WHITE:  There was a follow up meeting then scheduled after the 
Christmas break for … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Before you go.  You leave that meeting are 
there any queries that he raised that are important to share with me 
that were discussed at that meeting? 
10 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  It was more … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing of importance? 
MR WHITE:  Nothing that was not including in the final report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR WHITE:  So it was more of a clarification nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Add something extra here or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  What do you mean by this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Before you go on.  You mentioned in - in your 
affidavit that Advocate Vimbani was also at that meeting? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was his involvement? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it is - it is a lady.  She was just also there.  I mean 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 37 of 158 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  I presume in support of Advocate Letsholo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, there was then a follow up meeting after the 
Christmas break on 15 January 2014.  Again Advocate Letsholo and 
Advocate Vimbani were present and we went through the balance of the 
report and there was again a number of minor additional aspects that 
they wanted me to consider. 
Chair that - I then amended the report.  Dated it.  Add - 
10 
added additional information.  It was not additional documents.  It was 
just more of - of a clarification nature and there was a further meeting 
set for 14 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So up to the end of this second meeting there was 
nothing that appeared to give him any fundamental difficulty with the 
report? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was clarificatory questions and so on … 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe some minor suggestions about some 
20 
issues? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I attended to those queries and there was a further 
meeting set for 14 March 2014.  Again this meeting was chaired by 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 38 of 158 
 
Advocate Letsholo.  A person who was new to this meeting that had not 
been at the previous meetings was Colonel Jones.  Chair and - and the 
main purpose of this meeting was - my understanding - was discuss the 
final report that had now been prepared and to see whether there was - 
what the way forward was and to discuss … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so the - the phase for clarificatory questions had 
passed.  All the issues that he had raised had been addressed in terms 
of clarification? 
MR WHITE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you understood? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  So my understanding was this was to 
report back to say all the queries have been cleared … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the way forward? 
MR WHITE:  What is the way forward?  Effectively for me to issue the 
final report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And then for the - the process in the Criminal Justice 
System to proceed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, there was some initial discussions during that 
meeting and discussed some of the queries and it indicated that they 
had all being cleared. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Where was that meeting held? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 39 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  It was at PWC’s offices in Durban Chair.  Chair there was - 
and I then continue on page 28 - and then Advocate Letsholo asked the 
PWC representatives to please excuse themselves from the meeting as 
there was something confidential he needed to discuss with the DPCI 
representatives. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you can just stop there, because I just 
want to clarify this.  You say that also present at the meeting was 
Ms Frenelle Noble.  Who was she?  Where was she from? 
MR WHITE: 
 
Chair, 
she 
is 
a 
Senior 
Manager 
from 
PricewaterhouseCoopers who was effectively my main assistant on this 
10 
investigation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And she was also excused from the meeting? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Right. 
MR WHITE:  And she had been at the previous meetings as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You can continue. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, a short while after that meeting - and Chair in my 
affidavit I say Colonel Van Loggerenberg.  In hindsight I think it may 
have been Colonel S Y Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that. 
20 
MR WHITE:  At paragraph 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  I say in my affidavit:  a short while after they had finished 
this meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 40 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Colonel Van Loggerenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, in hindsight I think it was Colonel Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Why do you say that in hindsight?  What has 
made you … 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Say this? 
MR WHITE:  I heard Colonel Van Loggerenberg testifying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR WHITE:  And part of his evidence was that he was sick at the time 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Or his wife was sick … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And he was not at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So what was said is the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  (Intervenes). 
MR WHITE:  He normally spoke on behalf of the investigation team. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You are just not sure whether it was him or it 
was somebody else? 
MR WHITE:  Or it - it was either him or - or Colonel S Y Govender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  They were … 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 41 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  The two lead prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Not prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Investigators. 
MR WHITE:  Sorry.  Sorry Chair.  Investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR WHITE: 
 
Chair, 
they 
then 
- one 
of 
them 
told 
me 
that 
Advocate Letsholo had decided that the evidence on which my report 
had been based was tainted.  As a result of an operation that had been 
10 
undertaken by Crime Intelligence in the police in terms of the 
Interception and Monitoring Act being Act 70 of 2002 and that as a 
result Advocate Letsholo has decided to - not to prosecute any of the 
suspects. 
So Chair, my understanding - I was not familiar with this Act, 
but my understanding during this investigation was that this Act is 
something that sets in place very stringent conditions on which 
people’s telephones can be monitored and - and recorded and 
intercepted and that there is a - a rigorous process that has to be 
signed off by a Judge.  Chair that … 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you can just stop at that point.  Were you - 
prior to this and prior to finalising your report - aware that there was 
any Act 70 monitoring going on? 
MR WHITE:  I was Chair, because it - and I will - I refer to the specific 
dates late in my affidavit and I refer to it in a letter I wrote.  That it was 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 42 of 158 
 
discussed at a meeting with Advocate Letsholo earlier on in the 
process.  That there were monitoring taking place, but it was explained 
and the way I understood it was that this monitoring was initiated 
because there had been threats on the investigating officers lives and 
as a result Crime Intelligence had - had been tasked with monitoring 
the telephones of the people that were suspected of making the threats. 
Chair, at no stage did myself or anybody from PWC have 
access to those recordings.  The contents of those recordings was not 
discussed with me and to my understanding based on what I was told 
that in addition to that the investigating offices in case 781 - which is 
10 
the case that I prepared this report for - also did not have access to the 
recordings, because the - the application did not relate to this case. 
The application for the monitoring was for Crime Intelligence 
to try and identify threats to the investigating officer’s lives.  So 
nothing that appeared in the 43 700 documents that I relied on were 
obtained as a result of the Act 70 monitoring.  So Chair, so as a result I 
actually struggled to understand the logic and why it was said that the 
evidence was tainted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as I understand it, that monitoring was lawful 
monitoring, if I understood from other witnesses, but you might not 
20 
know that. 
MR WHITE:  Chair that was my understanding and I was told that there 
had been a formal process obtained to obtain …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja to have authorisation. 
MR WHITE:  But that was just in passing that was said because it had 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 43 of 158 
 
nothing to do with this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And just for clarity when you had prepared 
your draft report which was obviously before you ever had a meeting 
with Advocate Letsolo were you aware of the Act 70 monitoring? 
MR WHITE:  I was Chair and I referred to is specifically in a memo or 
letter I wrote to Colonel van Loggerenberg…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay we will – let’s deal with that in context 
because you then say that you refute – well I don’t want to put the 
words in your mouth but if we’ll deal with that chronologically when it 
10 
comes and I will clarify this aspect at a later stage.  You have said that 
there was nothing in the thousands of documents presented to you on 
which your report was based. There was no evidence that you relied on 
that had been obtained as a result of this monitoring, is that correct? 
MR WHITE: It was my understanding Chair, the documents that were 
provided to me, from what I could see were obtained, either subpoenas 
from banks or affidavits and supporting documents from suppliers to Mr 
Panday’s entities or documents that were ceased from Mr Panday’s 
business premises. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now I’d like to refer you to Annexure TSW28 
20 
it’s Exhibit RR4 file D at page 1992. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s Exhibit RR4 D, and what page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 1992. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  This is a memorandum dated the 25 t h of March 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 44 of 158 
 
2014 to Advocate Vembani by Advocate Letsolo and it sets out the 
reasons why the decision had been made not to prosecute the case, did 
you know about this memorandum? 
MR WHITE:  I did Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And how did you get to know about it? 
MR WHITE:  Chair Colonel van Loggerenberg gave me a copy of it on 
the 9 t h of April 2014 and asked me for comment or input relating to it 
and I wrote a letter back to him, making some preliminary comments on 
the document. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now the letter that you wrote back, Chair is 
10 
found in file RR4 B for boy or bad and it’s at page 516 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that’s fine if the witness has got it and you’ve 
got it you can continue, I remember the letter quite well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you, now having regard to the reasons 
provided in the memorandum and your response could you tell the 
Chair what did you convey in your letter and what – and if there’s 
anything you want to add with regard to the memorandum feel free to 
do so. 
MR WHITE:  Chair maybe just…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe, let me put it this way at this stage we know 
20 
what Advocate Letsolo said with regard for his reasons for declining to 
prosecute, you were given a copy of that letter, you responded quite in 
detail, this is the chance for you to tell me what your views were about 
that decision and the reasons that were given to justify that decision.   
MR WHITE:  So Chair based on my knowledge and my involvement over 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 45 of 158 
 
the 18 months in the case the reasons given didn’t make any sense to 
me, I’d never had access to anything from the Act 70 monitoring, 
Advocate Letsolo had been told at one of the early meetings that there 
was such monitoring taking place and it didn’t relate to case 781 which 
is 
the 
reference 
on 
the 
police 
system 
for 
this 
investigation…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Was that a matter that was denied by 
Advocate Letsolo? 
MR WHITE:  Well he said, Chair, that the first he knew of it was when 
he received representations from Mr Panday in, I think, February 2014. 
10 
Chair that just wasn’t true because I’d been at a meeting where it was 
discussed way earlier in the investigative process.  Chair the – so that 
was the one thing which just – was factually not true…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can repeat your points you made in your letter if 
you – feel free do to that and just the important ones.   
MR WHITE:   So Chair maybe just before I do that if I could just 
highlight a couple of extracts from the memo written by Advocate 
Letsolo on the 25 t h of March, just in the context of what I’ve testified in 
the last days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR WHITE: At the second page of his memo at page 1993 in the first 
paragraph at the top of that page he states, 
 
“I informed them that based on the information contained in 
the docket given to me that there’s just no evidence against the 
Provincial Commissioner.  Colonel van Loggerenberg responded thereto 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 46 of 158 
 
by saying, that if I’m not going to charge the Provincial Commissioner I 
may as well just close the docket”, 
 
Chair I do recall that discussion taking place, Colonel van 
Loggerenberg, in the discussions with Advocate Letsolo in those 
previous meetings when we were discussing the draft report he was 
asked what do you think of the evidence, how strong is the evidence, 
he confirmed he thought there was a strong case and that there was 
strong evidence against the accused.  He was initially unsure about – 
against R S Pillay and then at a following meeting he agreed there was 
evidence but he, at no stage, was mentioning the Provincial 
10 
Commissioner.  Colonel van Loggerenberg then said, what about the 
Provincial Commissioner and he was of the view that there was no 
evidence against the Provincial Commissioner. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And did he say why? 
MR WHITE:  He just said he didn’t think there was, he believed that the 
docket and the forensic report and the supporting documents didn’t 
indicate – it included the affidavits of Brigadier Kemp and Major 
General Booysen, he was of the view that there was no evidence.  
Colonel van Loggerenberg...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I’m 
sorry 
the 
case 
against 
the 
Provincial 
20 
Commissioner did it relate to the instructions that the investigation 
should be stopped only or did it also relate to anything else she may or 
may not have done with regard to the benefit or the payment by Mr 
Panday for her husband’s birthday party or was the position – was it 
the case that because she had – because Mr Panday was paying for the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 47 of 158 
 
birthday party of her husband this is what motivated her to give the 
instructions? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that was the conclusion the investigating team 
came to, was that the interaction with Brigadier Kemp and Major 
General Booysen was – started a few weeks prior to the birthday party 
being paid for.  So the inference that the investigating team was 
drawing or was wanting the prosecutor to draw was that, that payment 
directly related to an inducement for the Provincial Commissioner to act 
in the interest of Mr Panday and try and stop this investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
10 
MR WHITE:  So that’s what the investigating team was – and the timing 
it’s all within a month Chair, the initial instructions to stop is followed 
by that and there’s a further instruction to stop and the investigation 
continued but there were direct instructions to stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, alright continue. 
MR WHITE:  Chair there’s then, in paragraph 3 on page 1993 of that 
memo it says, 
 
“On 14 February 2014 I was provided with a copy of the 
 
representations made on behalf of Dr Panday”, 
 
Chair those representations weren’t made available to myself 
20 
so I couldn’t comment on them so the meeting that took place now 
where a decision was made not to prosecute any of the suspects, that’s 
not the normal process Chair in all the years I’ve been involved in 
these kind of investigations, assisting the police.  The normal process 
is, the prosecutor would share those representations with the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 48 of 158 
 
investigating officer as well as the forensic auditors that are appointed 
so that we can provide input into seeing one, whether the 
representations are actually based on real facts compared to what we 
have but also secondly to then say normally there would be further 
work to be done by the investigation team because based on a 
representation the prosecutor may say go and check A and B and if you 
can prove those points then the representations aren’t valid.  So that 
wold be the normal process.  In this instance it wasn’t made available 
to myself for comment and to my knowledge it wasn’t made available to 
the investigation officers either for their input.  So that’s just a second 
10 
point which…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you said you have been involved in many 
investigations, forensic investigations over the past 20 years, would 
many of those have entailed you working with the police and 
prosecutors or not really or only some? 
MR WHITE:  Chair most of them which relate to criminal investigations 
had that involvement so Chair in many instances as the matter proceed 
even though the forensic report is complete there’s then – the 
prosecutors ask for assistance with the summary of the substantial 
facts for the indictment or the charge sheet because they just – the 
20 
detail, not the actual charges but the facts and then in response to 
requests for further particulars.  In some of those cases these requests 
are very substantial and in some instances because of our involvement 
with the documentation it’s easier to identify the relevant extracts that 
the prosecutor needs to refer to in those responses, so it’s very much – 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 49 of 158 
 
normally a team effort.  The investigating officers from the police, the 
forensic accountants as well as the prosecutors working together to get 
to the same – the end result. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you, I think let’s take the tea adjournment 
and then we can continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We’ll take the tea adjournment and we’ll resume at 
half past eleven, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr White before the tea 
adjournment you were dealing with the memorandum dated the 25 
March 2014 from Advocate Letsholo to Advocate Vimbani it is at – we 
were dealing at this stage the memorandum starts at page 1992 and 
you were dealing with page 1993. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe what we should do because it is a detailed 
letter your response.  When you get to it maybe you can confirm 
whether the contents of your letter commenting on Advocate Letsholo’s 
decision and his reasons whether you stand by what is stated there and 
20 
then you can highlight those points in your response that you regard as 
quite important to mention but you confirm that the whole contents are 
still what you think about that memorandum.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  [Not speaking into the microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 50 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.   
MR WHITE:  Chair maybe just two other paragraphs in that 
memorandum of Advocate Letsholo.  The first one at page 1993 
paragraph 3.2.  It reads: 
“It was – it is important to note that at no stage 
whatsoever was I informed by the investigating 
officers in this case that there are tape recordings 
available in this matter.” 
So Chair – well firstly it is correct there were no tape recordings in this 
matter because they related to a Crime Intelligence matter that was not 
10 
related to case 781 it related to the threats on the investigating 
officers’ live.  But in that regard Chair I was present at a meeting on 
the 21 May 2013 where that was explained to Advocate Letsholo.  So 
he was told, there are – is monitoring and that is what it relates to.  It 
does not relate to this case.  He goes on further in this paragraph and 
says: 
“The first time I became aware of this specific issue 
was as a result of the representations made on 
behalf of Toshan Panday.” 
So Chair that is just not true.  And then: 
20 
“Furthermore there is nothing in the docket to 
suggest or indicate that there was an application 
made for the Authority to permit the police to monitor 
certain telephone conversations.  The nature of the 
investigations in this matter is straightforward and 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 51 of 158 
 
there was no need for an application of this nature to 
be made.” 
Chair it is 100% correct.   You would not expect it to be in this docket, 
it did not relate to this docket, the matter was straightforward, it was 
based on documents and payments.  So there was no need for a 
monitoring of the telephone conversations of Mr Panday, Mr Madhoe, 
Colonel Madhoe or anybody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does the part that you just read of his memorandum 
suggest that  
1. He thought the monitoring related to the 781 investigation. 
10 
2. That he thought the monitoring of telephone conversations was 
done without necessary legal authorisation. 
When I read that part I gained that impression but that impression may 
be wrong.  I am just checking with you.  When he says there was no 
application? 
MR WHITE:  Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no application in 781? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as I understand the position there was an 
application in regard to the death threats of the investigators. 
20 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I got the impression that he was saying or 
suggesting that the monitoring that had happened had been – had not 
been legal.  Is that the same impression you got or not necessarily or 
am I missing something? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 52 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Chair it is not that impression I got because I knew for a 
fact that he had been told.  So I did not read it that way because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  I knew he had been told there was monitoring and he had 
been told what it was about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So I did not read it in the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  That the Chair suggested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:  Because I knew the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But why would he – why would the – why would 
it be relevant to say there was no application in this case?  Again 
maybe I asking you something you would not be able to deal with 
because you – you do not deal with those things.  I was just wondering 
why – why it was important for him to say there was no application 
unless he took it – he was of the view that the monitoring of the 
conversations was illegal. 
MR WHITE:  Chair the – the inference that can be drawn is that an 
excuse is being looked for Chair.  The evidence it has been confirmed, 
20 
it is good evidence.  There is now further questions being asked about 
the Provisional Commissioner. The Prosecutor was uncomfortable with 
– whether there was sufficient evidence.  The investigating officers 
were fairly insistent there was sufficient evidence.  And suddenly 
without addressing the fact or the query from the investigating officer of 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 53 of 158 
 
– is there sufficient evidence to prosecute the Provincial Commissioner 
suddenly the case is – is – there is a decline to prosecute the entire 
case without dealing with the merits of the case but for an external 
reason.  Which then does not deal with a case that the prosecutor has 
already said there is a good case.  And Chair and in that regard in the 
last page of that – that memorandum at paragraph 7.-and the last page 
is page 1997. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  At 7.41 he then states: 
“I am not prepared as a representative of the state to 
10 
go to court with dirty hands.  I do not want to be 
seen 
to 
be 
condoning 
improper 
investigative 
techniques by the police.” 
In paragraph 8. 
“I have therefore taken a decision to decline to 
prosecute this matter.” 
But Chair nowhere does he say there is no case but he now comes with 
a reason which on the facts is actually incorrect Chair because the 
facts do not – as I know them – do not support the Act 70 and the use 
of it in this case.  Because that was Crime Intelligence matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel is my understanding correct that the 
monitoring of the conversations had been done – had been authorised 
by a Judge? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it would have been lawful monitoring? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 54 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So going – just the paragraph to which you have just 
referred Mr White.  It is difficult to think that he would regard – he 
would have regarded that monitoring as an improper investigative 
technique as he refers in paragraph 7.41 at page 1997 if he thought – if 
he – if he thought or knew that the monitoring of the conversations – 
telephone conversation was lawful. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair the – the point he tries to make in his 
memorandum is that somebody from Crime Intelligence is alleged to 
have told Mr Panday that they knew what his defence was in this matter 
10 
based on telephone conversations they  had overheard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  I think that is the point he is trying to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  To say that that is the improper investigative techniques. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  But Chair the – that was not shared with the investigating 
team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  To my – I was never – had any knowledge of that and to 
20 
my understanding the investigating officers in the case 781 also did not 
have any knowledge of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you.   
MR WHITE:  Chair I just – when that memorandum was given to me on 
the 9 April I immediately the same day wrote a response to Colonel Van 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 55 of 158 
 
Loggerenberg which is at – in bundle RR4b at page 516. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There are just a few aspects I would like to 
deal with – with this memorandum before we got there if you do not 
mind?  If we can just go back to page 1994.  And I want to refer you to 
paragraph 3.6 again where it is stated: 
“Once again it needs to be emphasised that taking 
into 
account 
the 
nature 
and 
extent 
of 
the 
investigations that were being carried out in this 
matter there was no need whatsoever for such 
applications to be made.” 
10 
You see that? 
MR WHITE:  I do Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now as far as you are aware was there any 
illegal monitoring in this matter being take – undertaken by the 
investigators in this matter? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if one then has regard to paragraph 7 on 
page 1996 it says: 
“In light of what is postulated above and more in 
particular taking into consideration that public policy 
20 
is concerned not only in ensuring that the guilty are 
held accountable but also that the investigating and 
prosecural 
agencies 
conduct 
themselves 
with 
propriety in securing evidence against criminal 
suspects.  That public policy also sets itself firmly 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 56 of 158 
 
against 
admitting 
evidence 
obtained 
through 
improper means or evidence obtained in deliberate or 
flagrant violation of the constitution.” 
Was any of the evidence that you relied on obtained by improper means 
or n deliberate or flagrant violation of the constitution? 
MR WHITE:  Not to my knowledge Chair.  And Chair where – like by 
way of example we relied on the documents seized from Mr Panday’s 
business premises.  There were court challenges in those processes 
and the investigating officers were found to have complied with the law. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then paragraph 7.2 it says: 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that just I think the paragraph to which 
you have just referred Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he says there was no need whatsoever for such 
applications to be made and in the paragraph before that he says that 
is 3.5, he had – had – he had learnt that or had been told that various 
applications for the tapping of the phones and to monitor conversations 
of certain individuals had been made.  Then he says, he was not in a 
position to give more details referring to – I am not sure who he is 
referring to.  But he says, it was clear that the other applications were 
20 
made – were done in respect of the investigations in this case.  Those I 
think are applications for authorisations for monitoring – the monitoring 
of conversations.  So you would emphasise that as far as you know no 
such application was made in regard to the investigation in which you 
got involved namely case 781? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 57 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and at no stage did any of the investigating 
officers in the case say to me oh we have just learnt about X because 
of some recording.  That was never … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Said at any stage during the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair Colonel Van Loggerenberg testified 
that he was the head investigator and no applications in case 781 for 
monitoring were made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now referring just finally on page 1966 after 
we have said that the implication is that the evidence had been secured 
and a clandestine illegal, improper, unconstitutional manner.  It is then 
said in 7.1: 
“It 
is 
submitted with respect 
that 
the issues 
surrounding the tapping of the phones is inextricably 
linked to the manner in which the evidence was 
obtained in this matter.  That the evidence as it 
stands at this point is irredeemably stained.” 
Was there any evidence that had been submitted to the advocate prior 
20 
to this, dealt with in your report or in the docket that indicated that 
there was any evidence obtained through the monitoring of a phone? 
MR WHITE:  There was none Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He then concludes 7.2: 
“To 
take 
this 
case 
to 
court 
under 
these 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 58 of 158 
 
circumstances would mean that I as the prosecutor 
will have to turn a blind eye to the manner in which 
the evidence had been obtained and subject the 
judicial process in moral defilement something I am 
not prepared to do.” 
Was the – [indistinct – mumbling]. 
MR WHITE:  Chair again there was – to my knowledge there was 
nothing wrong with the manner in which the evidence was obtained and 
where it had been obtained in terms of a search warrant it had been 
challenged and the finding was not in favour of the state. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – do you remember whether he provided in his 
– in this memorandum any evidence showing that there was evidence 
obtained for the 781 investigation that was improperly obtained? 
MR WHITE:  There is not Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  This memorandum all he does is refer to representations 
made by Mr Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Which the prosecuting – which the investigating team was 
not asked to provide input on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And as far as you know the persons that he 
says in his memorandum gave certain information to Mr Panday.  Do 
you know whether any statements from those persons were made 
available to the investigators in the 781 investigation and to you? 
MR WHITE:  They were definitely not made available to me and to my 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 59 of 158 
 
knowledge they were not made available to the investigators either. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr White if you could then please 
go to your response.  It is contained in bundle B so Exhibit RR4b at 
page 516. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you done with Advocate Letsholo’s memorandum? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it is subject to you wanting to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  From your side are you done? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes from my side yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr White are done with your response to that 
10 
memorandum? 
MR WHITE:  Chair apart from referring to the written response I made 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So as far as commenting on it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Just not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you confirm that all the points you made in that 
letter you stand by them? 
MR WHITE:  I do Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if we could just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want me to go to which Exhibit? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair it is Exhibit RR4b. 
CHAIRPERSON:  B for Beatrice? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 60 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  B for Beatrice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  Page 516? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So Mr White this is the letter that you referred 
to and it is the letter you just confirmed. 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair.  That is the letter I wrote to Colonel 
Van Loggerenberg on the 9 April 2014 commenting on the memorandum 
that had been prepared by Advocate Letsholo.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you could just deal please – we have dealt 
10 
with your comment in paragraph 4.  If you could please deal with 
paragraphs 5 and 6 on pages 517 and what you state there? 
MR WHITE:  Chair paragraph 5 states: 
“Towards the end of the meeting on 15 January 2014” 
So Chair that was the second meeting to discuss the draft report. 
“Advocate Letsholo was asked by one of the SAPS members present I 
cannot recall which one, what he thought of the case and our evidence.  
Advocate Letsholo stated that it was his view that there is a very good 
case 
against 
Narainpershad, 
Madhoe 
and 
Panday. After 
some 
discussion and further clarity regarding R S Pillay he agreed that there 
20 
was also a case for Mr Pillay to answer.” 
In paragraph 6: 
“Up to this stage Advocate Letsholo had made no 
mention of the Provincial Commissioner Ngobeni.  
Colonel Van Loggerenberg asked what about the PC 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 61 of 158 
 
to which Advocate Letsholo replied that he had some 
reservations.  There was then further discussion 
during which Colonel Van Loggerenberg compared 
the evidence implicating Narainpershad specific 
mention was made about the tread for Mr – treadmill 
Mr Panday had bought for him and the birthday party 
that Mr Panday paid for for the PC’s husband.  
Colonel Van Loggerenberg then went on to say if 
Advocate Letsholo does not think there was enough 
evidence against the PC then there was not enough 
10 
evidence against Narainpershad as the evidence was 
the same and he might as well close the docket.  
Advocate Letsholo then said, he would relook at the 
evidence and would provide feedback at the next 
meeting.  No feedback was provided at – in this 
regard while I was present in the meeting which was 
on 14 March 2014.” 
Now Chair that was the date of the – when that memorandum was 
written subsequent to that meeting saying that he had decided not to 
prosecute any of the suspects.  But at no stage did he say there is no 
20 
evidence.  He just had drawn his own conclusion that it was tainted and 
the conclusion appears to be based on the incorrect facts Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and if I recall correctly in his memorandum he 
really does not refer in any significant way to the evidence against the 
suspects on the merits. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 62 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  He does not refer to it at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At all ja.  And you said that you had been working on 
this investigation on your part of the investigation for about eighteen 
months before you finished your report or was it more than eighteen 
months? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it was fifteen months I think up until when we 
provided the first draft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Which was in the May of the previous year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR WHITE:  Then – we then did not do any more detailed work because 
it was sitting with the prosecutor for six months and then there were 
these meetings just before Christmas and then early in this New Year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So the only additional work done from – from my side was 
to update the report to address the prosecutor’s queries and at the 
meeting on the 14 March I was ready to sign the report.  I thought it 
was all addressed we can sign the report and – and I was expecting to 
be asked for information relating to a charge sheet that would be drawn 
up. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You have indicated the view that was 
expressed by Colonel Van Loggerenberg at that meeting that the 
evidence against Captain Narainpershad and that against the Provincial 
Commissioner was the same.  Do you agree with that view? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 63 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  I do Chair to the extent that I was of the opinion that they 
were both being receiving some form of gratification to do something 
that was improper.  It was different things they were being asked to do. 
As in Captain Narainpershad was being asked to not comply with the 
police procurement processes for the benefit of Mr Panday and his 
entities while based on the affidavits that have been provided to me the 
Provincial Commissioner was being given a gratification to try and stop 
this investigation so again something for the benefit of Mr Panday and 
his entities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course – of course the – it could not be really 
10 
100% correct to say the evidence against the Provincial Commissioner 
is the same as the evidence against Colonel Madhoe, Mr – and Mr 
Panday and whoever else because they certainly on what I have seen 
here this is not the same situation as where people are together and 
they do something and they are witnessed by one or two witnesses and 
those witnesses say the same thing in regard to all those people who 
were there doing there doing whatever it was they were doing.  It is an 
illegal gathering or assaulting somebody.  In regard to the Provincial 
Commissioner the main conduct of her part – maybe it is not the main 
but very prominent part is the fact that she was said to have made 
20 
certain phone calls to people under her to say, stop the investigations.  
Now the people who would testify whether that happened are not the 
people who would – they were not going to give evidence about phone 
calls to - made by somebody else in relation to the same thing.  So – so 
it might not be accurate. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 64 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Chair I get your point.  It was not the same alleged 
irregular or illegal conduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It was just – and also the one is based on documentary 
evidence relating to Captain Narainpeshad whereas the Provincial 
Commissioner is based on what two of her subordinates said.  There 
are not documents to prove that that is what she said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So there is a difference in that regard.  The – the – my 
understanding of where Colonel Van Loggerenberg was saying it is the 
10 
same is that based on the documents and the affidavits of suppliers 
both Captain Narainpershad and the Provincial Commissioner received 
a benefit to do something improper that is not in the course of their 
duties for the benefit of Mr Panday.  So that is the extent to which it is 
the same but I take your point Chair that the evidence is not exactly the 
same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Now after you had been 
shown the memorandum by Advocate Letsholo and you had responded 
did you discuss the reason for stopping the investigation with Colonel 
20 
Van Loggerenberg? 
MR WHITE:  I did Chair because we were all – I think 
probably the right word is a bit taken aback – this – the people had 
been working diligently on this for months and in the case of the 
investigating officers years and suddenly it was just stopped in its 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 65 of 158 
 
tracks for want of a better word.  And the investigating officers were 
very upset about that and they wanted to identify how it could be taken 
– taken forward.  And I am not sure who suggested it but in the next 
couple of months a suggestion came out that the matter should be 
reported to IPID.  Because this matter is alleged to involve the alleged 
police corruption and as a result it would fall under IPID’s mandate and 
as a result there was then a decision made that it be reported to IDIP 
and they be asked to look at the evidence and proceed – proceed 
further.  So Chair that – but prior to that meeting with IPID being set up 
the Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Noko also 
10 
wrote a memorandum.  It was actually dealing – its main purpose was 
to deal with case 466 which is the case dealing with the alleged bribe 
by Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe of General Booysen, but in that 
memorandum she also deals with case 781 and - and … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So let us just find that memorandum first and 
then we will comment.  Chair, it is RR4B for Beatrice.  Annexure TSW5 
page 5-1-9. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that - that memorandum it starts at 5-1-9.  It is 
addressed 
to the 
SAPS 
investigating 
officers and it 
is 
from 
Advocate Moipone Noko 
- 
the 
Director 
of 
Public 
Prosecutions 
20 
KwaZulu-Natal and it is dated 21 October 2014 and the subject is 
Durban Central CAS 466/9/2011. 
Corruption 
against 
Mr Thoshan Panday 
and 
Colonel Navin Madhoe.  Chair, in this memorandum just at - at a high 
level what she does is.  She now provides reasons why there is no 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 66 of 158 
 
prosecution in cases 466 and 781 and effectively she says: 
“There could not have been a bribe in 466 if there 
was no evidence in case 781.” 
It is effectively what she says, because the bribe related to 
the - to the former case.  What she then does Chair is she does not use 
the reasons advanced by Advocate Letsholo for saying there is no case 
being that the evidence was tainted.  She now actually says that 
Advocate Letsholo has come to the conclusion that there is no evidence 
against the suspects. 
Chair which is just factually wrong, because that was not 
10 
Advocate Letsholo’s view.  His view in meetings was that there was a 
good case.  So Chair, she … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If … 
MR WHITE:  Has some … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you can just refer then to paragraph 2.3 
where this is said and perhaps just read what was said into the record 
please.  That you are commenting on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well if he has covered it.  It is fine.  It … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might not need to be read.  Unless there is a 
20 
special reason why it should be read. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There are aspects … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is covered but - by what he has said. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  There is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 67 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There are some aspects that I would like the 
witness to comment on - if I may Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell him what - what the points are that are made in 
the paragraph and let him comment. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It - it is suggested there that there was 
absolutely no evidence to prosecute any person with any offence and 
then it is said when the investigators realised that the PC could not be 
charged simply because there was no evidence against her.  Then the 
prosecutor - the investigator - who is Mr Van Loggerenberg - said he 
may as well close the 781 case.  Can you comment on that? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Chair, the way it is written … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It contains a number of facts that are just wrong Chair.  So 
just - because it is written as if the reasons given are that the 
investigation 
was 
directed 
to 
try 
to 
implicate 
the 
Provincial 
Commissioner.  Chair that was - was never the intention.  It was around 
procurement and the Provincial Commissioner comes right at the end of 
the investigation in - in the timeline and in - in what happened and if 
one reads and just one sentence I would like to read out of this 
paragraph which is two thirds of the way down.  It said: 
20 
“It appears Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe featured 
nowhere in the 781 then as the focus was on the 
PC.” 
 
Chair if anyone read my report or the docket they would see 
that is not the case. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 68 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean the - the whole investigation under 781 
related to Mr Panday and he - and he and his entities and the conduct 
of certain people within SAPS. 
MR WHITE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Madhoe and so on. 
MR WHITE:  That is 100 percent correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so the point you make is only somebody who had 
no clue what the - your report contained and what the 20 lever arch that 
you told me about contained would say this? 
MR WHITE:  Chair to use your words.  Yes.  The person had no clue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Either they did not read it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Of if they did they did not care what it said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And they wrote something that is just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It is based on the wrong facts Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but one would have expected that before she 
wrote that there was no evidence.  She would have taken the trouble to 
20 
go and check the files. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, taking into account that this involved the most 
senior member of the police service in the province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It involved other senior police officials.  The amount of 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 69 of 158 
 
money was significant.  Ja.  It just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is difficult to understand the reasoning. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, based on - on all logic it - it - on the facts it is 
difficult to understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Unless there is an ulterior motive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  That can be the only inference that can be drawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and - well she may have misconstrued 
Advocate Letsholo’s reasons to decline to prosecute in 781 as well, 
because you made the point that it is - it is apparent from her note that 
she thought Advocate Letsholo said there was no evidence to justify 
prosecuting the suspects in 781. 
Whereas his approach what he said was certain things tainted 
the investigation and because of that he was declining to prosecute 
irrespective of what the strength of the evidence is, but as you said he 
did say in - in your meetings that at least the case against certain of 
the suspects was strong.  That is what you say he said.  Is that right? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Chair that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Chair and - and with respect I cannot see that she could 
have had that memorandum … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 70 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Or referred to it when writing this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Because that memorandum is very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It does not ever say there is no evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It just - a cursory read of it would - would lead one to that 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I - well she might have read it at some 
stage and did not have it at the time or she might just have heard that 
10 
Advocate Letsholo refused or declined to prosecute and took what 
would be the normal reason for not prosecuting, because the normal 
reason would be there is not enough evidence or there is no evidence, 
but this was a case where Advocate Letsholo was not relying on that.  
Okay. 
MR WHITE:  I cannot take it any further Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair and just to remind the Chair that in 
the memorandum it was said twice and if not three times in the course 
of the memorandum that there was absolutely no need for any 
20 
monitoring, because it was a straightforward case.  The - the 
memorandum is premised on the basis that there is good evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But then a conclusion is drawn that the 
evidence was tainted which the witness has said is fundamentally 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 71 of 158 
 
flawed.  At paragraph - I - I do not know if you - if you want to comment 
on it, but you can.  At paragraph 2.10 if you wish on page 5-2-2 
Advocate Noko comments on why on earth would it be necessary to 
backdate this report and says - and when read with the previous 
statement made about Colonel Madhoe which is to the effect that he 
had done nothing wrong. 
There was absolutely nothing wrong.  There was no evidence 
against him.  Do you agree with the conclusion that there would have 
no motive for Colonel Madhoe to bribe General Booysen? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there - there was a motive.  Chair and - well it is 
10 
- if one does not understand the background to this.  It is quite difficult 
to understand, because it is referring to this report.  The report that is 
being referred to is a document prepared by Major-General Booysen 
and that contained evidence that was used in support of the 
applications for the - the Section 205 subpoenas of the bank 
statements from the - from the various banks relating to Mr Panday’s 
entities. 
If that report had been dated after the subpoenas it would 
have mean that the subpoenas were applied for without there being 
reasonable grounds to ask and as a result could have been invalidated 
20 
which would mean all those documents that had been relied upon in the 
investigation would be inadmissible. 
So that is what the attempted bribe was to do.  Was to get 
General Booysen to date it after the dates of the subpoenas so that 
there could be a legal - a technical legal argument that the evidence 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 72 of 158 
 
was inadmissible.  So that is what - but then my understanding of what 
Advocate Noko is trying to do here is to say, because there is no 
evidence in 781. 
There would not have been a reason to backdate it or to - to 
get the - to pay a bribe to try and get the evidence to be inadmissible.  
So it is a bit of a circular reasoning, but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  At the end of the day … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the argument falls flat if there was evidence? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair, if there was - if there was no 
evidence one would wonder why an application would be made to set 
aside a subpoena to exclude evidence.  It - it just does not make any 
sense whatsoever.  Mr White if we could then go to page 34 paragraph 
41 of your report? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, it is RR4.  It is the affidavit. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The affidavit.  I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confused me. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry Chair. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 73 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr White. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, at paragraph 41 I then - previously I had said 
that there was discussions about taking the matter to IPID and a 
meeting was scheduled for 14 November 2014 at IPID’s Offices in 
Durban.  The meeting was convened by General Maharaj who was the 
KZN Head of IPID and the Executive Director being the Head of IPID 
Nationally - Mr Robert McBride also attended the meeting. 
I was present as well as a number of the investigating 
officers.  Mr McBride was briefed around the details relating to the case 
and the dissatisfaction from the police’s perspective about the fact that 
10 
the decision had been made not to prosecute.  He then called someone 
from his cellphone in the meeting who I believe was the NDPP at the 
time - just based on the conversation from what I could hear - which 
was Mr Nxasane and he said that this matter is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be Mr Nxasane … 
MR WHITE:  Nxasane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And for the transcribers N-X-A-S-A-N-E.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
MR WHITE:  And Chair he - he then said this was a - a serious matter - 
that being Mr McBride - and needed to be taken forwarded and the 
20 
perpetrators prosecuted.  Chair, there was then - if I could jump 
forward in my - my document to page 39 of my affidavit.  There was a - 
at paragraph 43 - there was then a follow up meeting scheduled to 
discuss the detail, because Mr McBride wanted to involve senior 
investigators out of the Pretoria Office of IPID and that meeting was set 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 74 of 158 
 
for 21 November 2014. 
There were a number of IPID members present.  I do not 
specifically recall all their names and again they asked me to explain 
the background to the matter and some of the detail which I did and 
then they asked why the report was still in draft, because subsequent 
to the meeting where Advocate Letsholo declined to prosecute I had 
never issued a final report, because I was of the view that if there was 
a new prosecutor appointed at some point in the future. 
They may have different queries.  I explained to the IPID 
members that the report was final as far as I was concerned and could 
10 
be issued.  They then requested that if that was the case if I could 
issue a final report so that they could take the appropriate actions.  I 
then issued the final report three days later when I was back in Durban 
on 24 November 2014 and that is the report that is attached as 
Annexure TSW1 to this affidavit. 
Chair, continuing at page 40 of my affidavit.  There were then 
two further follow up meetings with IPID representatives to work 
through the detail to - I mean - it is a significant amount of evidence.  
That was on 26 November 2014 and 23 January 2015.  Chair, I was 
then asked to attend a further meeting in Pretoria at IPID’s Office on 
20 
3 February 2015 to again discuss this matter. 
When I arrived at the meeting there were a number of IPID 
representatives including Mr McBride and also in attendance was 
Advocate Gerrie Nel and Mr Andrew Leask from the NPA in Pretoria as 
well as Major-General Booysen and Colonel Van Loggerenberg.  Chair, 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 75 of 158 
 
the - the purpose of as it was explained to me of Advocate Gerrie Nel 
being present was that the NDPP … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr White.  Somehow I have lost you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel where - where are we now? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought we went to page 43 at some stage. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No.  He is dealing with paragraph 46 now on 
page 40 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On - on page 40? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 40 paragraph 46 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair maybe just to recap.  That was the meeting on 
3 February 2015 at IPID’s Offices and this was now also attended by 
Advocate Gerrie Nel and Mr Andrew Leask from the NPA.  It was the 
first time I had met either of them relating to this matter and it was 
explained to me that or it was explained in the meeting that 
Advocate Nel was attending the meeting on instruction of the NDPP as 
he wanted him to consider the matter to see whether the NDPP should 
consider reopening the cases and whether somebody should be 
20 
prosecuted in the matter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who explained that to you? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I am not specifically sure.  It was either Mr McBride 
or - or Advocate Nel himself … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 76 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  But Chair before the meeting formally started Mr McBride 
made what I thought at the time was a very strange comment.  He said 
that he is going to dust off his fishing rods as he is going to be doing a 
lot of fishing in the near future.  Everybody looked at him with a bit of 
amazement and asked him what he meant by this and he said that we 
have been going places we are not supposed to and are treading on the 
toes of the wrong people and that he had heard in the corridors that he 
was going to be suspended shortly. 
Chair that meeting was on 3 February 2015.  Mr McBride was 
suspended the following month.  In March 2015 and I continue at the 
10 
following page.  Page 41 paragraph 48.  Advocate Nel in the meeting 
said he did not understand Advocate Letsholo’s decision and the basis 
on which he came to it and he said he would recommend to the NDPP 
that the NPA proceed with the formalities of reopening the matter. 
However shortly after that in May 2015 the NDPP vacated his 
position and Advocate Abrahams was appointed.  Chair, since that date 
I have not been further consulted in the matter.  So it is some five 
years Chair.  All that happened subsequent to that was IPID requested 
further copies of the documents, because Chair at the time people in 
IPID were being suspended, reinstated, suspended and I assumed 
20 
documents had been lost. 
So further copies were provided in June 2016 and then in 
addition to that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  So if a decision had to be taken whether the 
decision not to prosecute in this case was to be reversed.  The person 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 77 of 158 
 
who would have had to reverse it would have been Mr Nxasane, 
because he was the NDPP at the time.  Is that right? 
MR WHITE:  Chair that is my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood the position. 
MR WHITE:  Chair that is my understanding, because the - the DPP had 
made the decision not to prosecute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, at provincial level. 
MR WHITE:  So that would be the only way for it to be reopened would 
be for the NDPP … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:  To become involved and - and take it on review and - and 
come to a different conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Continue. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - I am sorry.  Early on you testified about a 
meeting which you attended where Mr McBride made a call to 
Mr Nxasane.  Is that right? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that call - that meeting was it discussing the 
matter to which your report relates? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  It - it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the 466 matter? 
MR WHITE:  It related to both Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To both.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  So both cases were presented to Mr McBride at that 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 78 of 158 
 
meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Because they - they linked in a way … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Because 466 is a direct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Offshoot. 
MR WHITE:  Result of 781. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So - so the DPP had come to the conclusion that there 
was no evidence against the suspects in 781 and 466. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that was some five years ago.  I was then or a 
person in my office became aware that in September 2018 Advocate 
O’Brien from the SCCU in - in Durban had now been allocated this 
matter and she had requested copies of the flow of funds and the 
timeline diagrams which were provided to her. 
Chair, but as far as further consultations or processes I - I 
have heard nothing in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So for - effectively for five years nothing has happened 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm and all the evidence was ready as far as you 
knew? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, there is literally 100’s of affidavits … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 79 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  In the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  The forensic report is complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It is - it is issued in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  My understanding was the investigating team was just 
waiting for a charge sheet from the prosecutor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And on your understanding has a charge 
10 
sheet ever been prepared? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Mr Panday ever arrested? 
MR WHITE:  Not in relation to - to 781 Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then if we can just - if you do not mind.  I 
want 
you 
to 
deal 
with 
a 
response 
by 
Colonel Booysen 
to 
Advocate Noko’s memorandum.  You deal with it in your affidavit at 
paragraph 42 on page 35 and Chair the memorandum itself he - he 
quotes from the memorandum.  The memorandum itself is in EXHIBIT 
RR4B at page 5-2-7. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what is the point about the memorandum? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So is it correct that you responded to 
Advocate Letsholo’s memorandum and by that letter that we referred to 
earlier in your evidence? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 80 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that the memorandum of Advocate Noko 
that 
we 
just 
referred 
to 
was 
- 
was 
responded 
to 
by 
Major-General Booysen on 19 November 2014? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you quote from this memorandum in your 
affidavit and he deals - well I - I am just going to deal with it in your 
affidavit at paragraph 36 from your quote.  Where he says at the top of 
the page: 
“Quite how it has been revealed by the SCCU that 
the SAPS members charged with the investigation 
10 
of Durban Central case 781 was gunning for the 
KwaZulu-Natal 
Provincial 
Commission 
Lieutenant-General Ngobeni is unclear.” 
I want to ask you were you at any stage when you were - in 
the 15 months you were conducting this investigation told by the 
investigators to focus on the Provincial Commissioner? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there anything in your interactions with the 
investigators 
that 
suggested 
that 
they 
wanted 
the 
Provincial 
20 
Commissioner - they were - they - they wanted the Provincial 
Commissioner to be given some special focus? 
MR WHITE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if they did not say so in so many words. 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  There were - there was - she was not being 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 81 of 158 
 
singled out for specific attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  There was no greater focus on her than any of the other 
suspects in the matter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  And Chair that is also quite clear if one looks at the 400 
pages of report.  There is - I - I do not know off the top of my head - 30 
or 40 pages that deal with her … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  She was not the focus, because … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  She had a specific involvement at the - at the end of the 
time period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  We were investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So in the entire files of evidence - 20 lever arch 
files I think you said.  You - you would say more or less whatever 
related to her might have taken about 20 or so pages. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair the - the evidence against her is the handful of 
documents from the - the Dish Restaurant … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Relating to the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  The bank statements showing the payment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 82 of 158 
 
MR WHITE: 
 And 
then 
the 
affidavits of 
General Booysen 
and 
Brigadier Kemp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  I - I do not recall off the top of my head how long they are 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
MR WHITE:  But they are not - they in the 10’s of pages.  Not the 100’s 
of pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then I would like to refer you to the 
middle of page 36 of your affidavit also still quoting from a letter of 
General Booysen.  It is just the - what he says in the middle of that 
paragraph on the top of that page.  He says: 
“The investigation focused on irregularities before her 
appointment as Provincial Commissioner, it is thus ludicrous 
to believe a suspect i.e. Panday and Madhoe in this regard. 
The investigating officers could not have wanted to falsely 
implicate the Provincial Commissioner for a crime that took 
place before she assumed her post.  Her involvement in the 
20 
matter relates to attempts by her to interfere with the 
investigation after she assumed her position as Provincial 
Commissioner and not with regard to the procurement of the 
irregularities per se”. 
Now can you comment on that? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 83 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON: Well he has already said that isn’t it, he has said that 
the investigation under case 781 related to the procurement issues 
relating to Mr Panday and whatever related to the Provincial 
Commissioner was the allegations that she stopped the investigation 
and the payment for – by Mr Panday for her husband’s birthday party. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair the averment that was made by 
Advocate Noko in the memorandum was also that the reason – although 
there was absolutely no evidence against the Provincial Commissioner 
that this investigation had been focused on her was because General 
Booysen wanted her post and the point that he is making here is that 
10 
the investigation started before she got her post and then the 
allegations against her only arose after she was then appointed.  It 
could never have then had the affect of stopping her getting her post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you covered that didn’t you with the head of 
the investigation Colonel van Loggerenberg? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes it has been covered thank you Chair.  
Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like us to move as fast as we can, we are not 
moving as fast as I would like to I’m not blaming anybody but I’d like us 
to move rather faster. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I now wish to – 
unless there’s anything further that you would like to address with 
regard to the Panday matter, I would like to now move on to the 
investigation into the Intaka matter 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lets go straight to it. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 84 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr White how did you come to be 
involved in the investigation in the Intaka matter? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I set it out by saying…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let’s start by saying what was the Intaka 
matter? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair Intaka is a name of an entity based in Cape Town 
that supplied, amongst other things, water purification plants and self 
generating oxygen plants that were supplied to the Department of 
Health and the Department of Local Government in KZN as well as to 
the Department of Health and various municipalities in the Northern 
10 
Cape.  So it’s called Intaka because it’s the name of the entity it’s also 
colloquially called the Amigos case because that is the manner in which 
Dr Savoi, the owner and main shareholder of Intaka refers to people in 
emails and letters, he’s from South America and that’s the way it got 
the terminology.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It relates to allegations of, again, procurement 
irregularities around the appointment of this entity and then around 
allegations of corrupt payments made by Intaka to various officials 
within the Department of Health and Local Government both in the 
20 
Northern Cape and KZN as well as alleged payments to the Political 
Heads of the Departments or for their benefit that also – whose 
departments did business with Intaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes how did you get involved? 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 85 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  How did you get involved in the investigation? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I set it out at page 42 or RR4, Chair initially PWC 
was appointed by the Department of Health in KZN in May of 2009 to 
investigate the initial contracts that the Department of Health had 
entered into, it was then – our mandate was further extended in 
February of 2010 and Chair then it was identified that this case is a lot 
bigger than the Department of Health it also involves Local Government 
in KZN as well as significant payments to entities in the Northern Cape.  
At that stage the investigating officer in the matter, Colonel du Ploy 
approached National Treasury, the Accountant General and said that 
10 
this case goes across a number of Departments in a number of 
provinces and requested that National Treasury become involved 
because of the procurement irregularities that were involved.  National 
Treasury agreed and the appointment of PWC to undertake these 
investigations and to assist the police going forward in preparing 
reports for Court, the mandate then came from National Treasury. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Were you given instructions as to the manner 
you should carry out this investigation? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair we were to take instructions from the police so 
while National Treasury was paying the fees, for want of a better word, 
20 
they were not directing how to undertake the investigation because we 
reported to the police so the police directed the investigation together 
with prosecutors that were then – became involved in the case, there 
were a lot of jurisdictional issues and trying to manage it as one 
investigation even although it was a number of departments and a 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 86 of 158 
 
number of – and two different provinces but the one piece – rather than 
direction and I’d rather say it’s advice that the Accountant General 
gave us at the time was, if you …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say Accountant General? 
MR WHITE:  Accountant General Chair, in the National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Mr Freeman Nomvalo he said, do the investigation from 
the bottom up and his explanation – because it didn’t, initially make 
sense to me, was if you start at the top and politicians are involved 
you’re not going to make headway with your investigation.  So prove 
10 
the case from the bottom up and if at the last minute politicians are 
identified as being involved, it’s very hard to derail the case because 
you’ve, effectively finished and that’s effectively how the investigation 
was 
done. 
 
The 
Supply 
Chain 
Management 
processes 
were 
investigated, who was involved, how they were involved, reports were 
prepared and where it was identified that there were allegations based 
on that evidence, that politicians were involved, further supplementary 
reports or affidavits were prepared that were then given to the 
prosecutors. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So Mr White you deal with the reports that 
20 
you prepared on paragraph 56 page 43, could you please briefly explain 
to the Chair which – what each of these reports dealt with just in high-
level terms, we’ll go into greater detail in due course? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair as I said before there’s two types of – mainly two 
types of products that were being purchased.  So the one is the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 87 of 158 
 
Oxyintaka self generating oxygen plants.  What that plant is Chair, is 
effectively a plant that had been designed by Intaka it’s installed on 
site at a hospital and the benefit it has is that it generates oxygen on 
site so there’s no need for tankers or cylinders to be trucked to the 
site, you effectively make the oxygen on the site. So that was – so 
those were purchased in KZN and in the Northern Cape. There was 
then water purification plants that were purchased by the Department of 
Health in KZN and in the Northern Cape and by Local Government in 
KZN as well as by some municipalities in the Northern Cape and then in 
addition to that there was also procurement in the Northern Cape of 16 
10 
dialysis machines, also from Intaka, not made by Intaka or under 
license from them, they had bought them from a third party and then 
there are two additional reports which I refer to that there’s the 
supplementary report that relates to  the MEC of Health a the time Ms 
Peggy Nkonyeni in KZN as well as in an affidavit I set out the 
involvement of the MEC for Traditional Affairs and Local Government in 
KZN Mr Michael Mabuyakhulu.  Chair those reports are attached again 
to this affidavit, the lever arch files of supporting documentation, 
there’s some 30 files, have been made available to the Commission in 
electronic form, so again in those reports we report – documents are 
20 
referred to in the right hand column on each page, the Annexures have 
been provided in electronic form to the Commission.  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now you’ve prepared a diagram, it is TSW19 
and Chair, if you’ll just bear with me it’s contained in Bundle D – sorry 
Chair Exhibit RR4 Bundle D at page 158. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 88 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair it’s 1958. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry Chair we need this diagram to be put on 
the overhead screen if you might bear with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remember that when you speak away from the 
phone the transcribers will have a problem transcribing – typing what 
you were saying, there will be a lot of inaudibles, so try and speak 
when you are closer to the phone – the mic. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Char I apologise I’ve lot my assistant for 
10 
the bundles so – perhaps yes.  Sorry Chair if you’ll just bear with me- 
thank you Chair, I appreciate the indulgence.  Mr White with reference 
to this diagram could you please explain to the Chair what your 
investigation entailed and what it revealed? 
MR WHITE:  Chair what I’ve attempted to do in this diagram at page 
1598 was prepared at the time that the investigation was done, some 
ten years ago.  What this diagram sets out to do is to explain the 
significant events or transactions that took place relating to the alleged 
crimes that happened in Kwa-Zulu Natal. So it doesn’t deal with the 
Northern Cape which was, effectively a different set of investigating 
20 
officers, different set of prosecutors.  So I was requested to comment 
on the matters in KZN so I’ve restricted my affidavit to that as well as 
this diagram. So Chair what this diagram shows is that at the centre of 
the diagram is Intaka and flowing to or from that are various arrows in 
different colours and briefly what I’m trying to show in that diagram 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 89 of 158 
 
Chair, if one looks at the bottom half of the diagram it’s the dealings 
that took place between Intaka and on the bottom right the Department 
of Health in KZN. If one goes up to the right-hand side – the top right 
of that diagram I then deal with the transactions with the Department of 
Traditional Affairs and Local Government in KZN as well as the payment 
that Intaka made via the bank account of Kuboni and Shezi attorneys of 
R1 053 000.00 which Dr Savoi, in his affidavits – affidavit that he 
provided to the police described as a donation to the ANC and just – I 
then track where that money flowed via the Attorney’s Trust account 
how it was spent on personal expenses of Mr Tshabalala, the head of 
10 
the Department of Health in KZN and subsequently in cash to the MEC 
of Traditional Affairs and Local Government Mr Mabuyakhulu .  Chair 
then on the left of that page I then also detail two payments that were 
made to an entity called Rowmoor Investments, two payments of 
R500 000.00 each.  Rowmoor investments is an entity – the director of 
which is a gentleman by the name of Lindon Mkhwanazi who at the time 
was the boyfriend of the MEC of Health in KZN Ms Peggy Nkonyeni.  So 
Chair and we’ll come to all the detail, but effectively there was 
procurement irregularities, the procurement process was manipulated to 
the benefit of Intaka in both the Department of Health on two instances 
20 
for the purchase of the water purification plants as well as for the 
purchase of the Oxyintaka plants it was also manipulated in the 
Department of Traditional Affairs and Local Government and at the 
same time the MEC’s for both those departments or people linked to 
them were receiving payments. Chair, I’m not sure if Ms Wentzel wants 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 90 of 158 
 
me to go into the details but I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja she will lead you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr White can we start first and 
remembering that the Chair doesn’t know all the details and what each 
matter involved so we need to explain these things very carefully, can 
you deal with the procurement in the first instance that involved Mr 
Tshabalala and then when we’ve done that, we will then as a separate 
inquiry, look at the procurement that involved the MEC for Health Mr 
Peggy Nkonyeni, is that suitable? 
MR WHITE:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay so can we start now dealing with the 
procurement that Mr Tshabalala was involved with and perhaps we can 
start with a memorandum dated the 9 t h of May 2005, it’s Annexure 
TSW13 on volume C Chair, page 1088. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You explained that Ms Peggy Nkonyeni was MEC for 
Health and you explained who Mr L H Mokoena was, I think you said Mr 
Mabuyakhulu was MEC for Traditional Affairs is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  And Local Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Local Government. 
MR WHITE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was Mr Tshabalala’s position? 
MR WHITE:  Chair he was Head of Department for the Kwa-Zulu Natal 
Provincial Government – sorry Head of the Finance Department, 
Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Provincial Treasury? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 91 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Provincial Treasury Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay and S D D Tshabalala that appears there was 
his spouse? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair that’s Mr Tshabalala himself, Mr Sipho 
Tshabalala. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and then the B N O – the initials B N O is the 
wife? 
MR WHITE:  That’s the wife Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR WHITE:  You had a separate business that she had entered into of 
10 
which Gaston Savoi – Dr Savoi was also a Director of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were Directors of a particular entity Shiroz 
Medical? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So we’re now referring to the memorandum it 
starts at page 1088 or 1089 it’s Annexure TSW 13 and if I might refer 
you to page 1116…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give me the page numbers again and it’s RR4 C? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja page number? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the document Chair, starts at page 1089 
and perhaps Mr White you can identify the document, it’s a report by 
you dated the 29 t h of July 2011, is that correct? 
MR WHITE:  That’s correct Chair, that’s the report that I prepared 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 92 of 158 
 
based on the investigation that had been conducted into the purchase 
of 20 water purification plants by the Department of Local Government 
and Traditional Affairs in Kwa-Zulu Natal.  So that effectively 
summarises the procurement process, who was involved, what they did, 
what they did incorrectly down to the payments, the flow of funds, I 
refer to a number of affidavits that were obtained by the investigating 
officers in the case.   Chair this investigation was different to the 
Panday investigation that I referred to previously, in that myself as well 
as staff working for me, assisted the police with actually interviewing 
witnesses and obtaining statements.  So it was – there was more 
10 
involvement in this investigation whereas the Panday investigation was 
more just an analysis of documents that were provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Chair just to – the link into KZN, Mr Sipho Tshabalala the 
head of the Provincial Treasury was one of the first people that met Dr 
Savoi from Intaka.  He was introduced to him there was a trip to South 
America to Brazil and I think to one other country that amongst others 
Mr Tshabalala went with to see what products and services Intaka could 
provide to see them in operation in Brazil that was a trip that was paid 
for by Intaka.  Following that there was then …[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know why it would have been – it should have 
been paid for by Intaka in terms of Mr Tshabalala why it wasn’t paid for 
by Government or was that one of the issues you had to look at? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it wasn’t something we investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 93 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  It appeared that the trip was at the suggestion of Intaka to 
try and convince the provincial Government, these are the things and 
you should come and see them so that we can then take further what 
we can offer you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Char that…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If we can return to the memorandum that I 
was referring to it’s on page 1116 Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there something you still wanted to say Mr 
White? 
10 
MR WHITE:  No Chair, it’s fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it fine? 
MR WHITE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If we can refer to the memorandum from Mr 
Tshabalala to Dr Makizi, dated the 9 t h of May 2005 appearing on 1116 
and if you could please explain that and what it revealed to the Chair, 
Mr White. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair subsequent to the visit to South America there’s 
then various documents that are prepared, many of which Mr 
20 
Tshabalala either initiates or is part of the preparation or one of the 
signatories to the documents that are proposing the use of Intaka for 
various – the supply of Oxyintaka being the oxygen units and the 
Wataka being the water purification units and this memorandum is 
written to the MEC at the time Dr Nkeez and it’s relating to the proposal 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 94 of 158 
 
to supply gas generating equipment and water purification to the 
province and I just state in the document that he states – in my report I 
just take some extracts and he says, this being Mr Tshabalala, 
 
“Proposal have been received from a company in Cape Town to 
supply equipment for on site generation of gas as well as equipment 
that purifies water at source. The Department of Health is piloting the 
gas generating equipment at Murchison Hospital Trade and Investment 
KZN has been involved in the water purification equipment for some 
time”, 
 
Chair the Trade and Investment entity in KZN, the idea was 
10 
they were trying to convince Intaka to set up a manufacturing plant in 
KZN, so to generate jobs. That never happened in the end, it’s used as 
one of the reasons to appoint Intaka to provide Wataka’s, the water 
purification 
plants 
but 
Intaka 
doesn’t 
manufacture 
the 
plants 
themselves anyway they outsource it to a third party and the 
manufacturer of those plants was based in Cape Town because that’s 
where Intaka was based but this memorandum Chair, which is the first 
initiation of the appointment, it’s effectively where it started to appoint 
Intaka by the Traditional Affairs and Local Government, Mr Tshabalala 
states, and I’ll read from paragraph 9.33 third line, 
20 
 
“Going through communities during the pre-budget roadshows 
 
we experience…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry this is not a memo written by Mr Tshabalala 
it’s your summary of what that memo said. 
MR WHITE:  It’s extracts of it Chair, so some of it is direct quotes and 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 95 of 158 
 
some of it is a summary.  So if its in italics…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so in other words it’s your comment on that 
memo. 
MR WHITE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not the memo itself. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair just – if there’s a need for the documents that 
reference in the right-hand column D1 would be the electronic version 
the Commission has. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR WHITE:  So in that memorandum by Mr Tshabalala I’ve quoted an 
extract in paragraph 9.33 where he states, 
 
“Going through communities during the pre-budget roadshows 
 
we experienced first-hand that communities still need water 
 
desperately whereas we are undergoing an exercise with 
 
Umgeni Water on the long-term solution of water provisioning 
 
in the Province we still have to contend with the fact that our 
 
community still do not have access to clean water”. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what recommendations did he make in the 
20 
letter? 
MR WHITE:  Chair I quote the recommendations on the following page, 
page 1117, he made the following recommendations, 
 
“It is recommended that we encourage the MEC for Health 
 
and the head of department to finalise the installation of the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 96 of 158 
 
 
Oxyintaka 
at 
Murchison and 
to consider 
seriously 
the 
 
acquisition of further equipment to optimise on the benefit of 
 
the equipment.  It is recommended that an amount of 
 
R22million be allocated from the Poverty Alleviation to 
 
provide the water generating equipment to all the municipal 
 
districts.  It is also recommended that negotiations are 
 
commenced with the benefiting municipalities on the running 
 
cost of the equipment”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think we’ll have to stop there for the lunch 
break, we’ll take the lunch break now and we’ll resume at 2 o’clock.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr White prior to the lunch 
adjournment you dealt with the memorandum dated the 9 May 2005. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you switch on your microphone. Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  From Mr Shabalala at bundle C page 1116, is 
that correct? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
SUSAN 
WENTZEL: 
 
Now 
after 
that 
was 
there 
further 
20 
correspondence between Mr Shabalala and Mr Savoi? 
MR WHITE:  There was Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And do you deal with that correspondence in 
your report? 
MR WHITE:  I do Chair. I set out various interactions with them on the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 97 of 158 
 
pages that – on the next few pages that follow Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then the next significant correspondence 
appears at page 1125.  If we could go to that?  And this is a letter from 
Mr Shabalala to Gumbi-Masilela dated the 31 August 2005.  Is that 
correct? 
MR WHITE:  That is correct.  I – Chair that is where I refer to that letter 
and then copy some extracts of that into my report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Who was Gumbi-Masilele? 
MR WHITE:  Chair she was the Head of Department of the KwaZulu 
Natal Local Government and Traditional Affairs at the time. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you please tell the Chair about this 
letter and what it stated? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair this again – appears to indicate that the – if 
there was any urgency in this process to procure these water 
purification plants from Intaka the only urgency was to spend the 
money rather than an urgency for the community that needed clean 
drinking water.  And I say that Chair because – and I quote an extract 
out of that letter which is from Mr Shabala at paragraph 9.053 at the 
bottom of that page and it reads in the – starting at the end of the third 
line: 
20 
“As we are now approaching mid-year in the financial 
year there is a considerable urgency to allocate and 
expend the funds in question lest we are left with 
unspent funds at the financial year end.  As this 
project requires careful investigation an extensive 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 98 of 158 
 
consultation with the Municipalities it would be 
appreciated if you would update this office as a 
matter of urgency as the progress to date if any.” 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the process with what did that refer? 
MR WHITE:  Chair that is progress with identifying the Municipalities 
that would require these water purification plants and installation 
thereof.  Because the issue Chair there was quite a history to this but 
when it came to installing them one needed to identify an appropriate 
site with a source of water, with a local municipality that was prepared 
to pay for the maintenance as well as the chemicals to run the plant.  
10 
So there a number of things that needed to be done.  It was not just a 
matter of dumping something somewhere and it would just work.  So 
you needed buy-in from up to 20 municipalities to take these plants and 
have them installed in their areas. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So ultimately just to explain that how many of 
these water purification plants were bought? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair 20 were bought in the end and I will come to the 
detail later. But in some of them three years later they still had not 
been installed.  But they bought on the basis that it was an emergency. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And why was emergency utilised – the? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Chair my view the sole purpose of that was to avoid going 
out on a competitive tender process.  There could be no other reason. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then if we could go to page 1127. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair in that – on that page in the middle I refer to the 
meetings of the inter-departmental task team that were held in 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 99 of 158 
 
September and October of 2005.  Chair because this – the installation 
of these water purification plants now involved more than one 
department because Provincial Treasury was pushing or motivating the 
idea. They were arranging for the money to be reallocated from the 
poverty alleviation fund to the Department of Local Government.  Local 
Government needed to identify the communities where they would be 
installed and then Economic Development was also involved because 
there was an initial thought that Intaka would set up a construction 
facility in KZN to build these plants – a manufacturing facility.  So as a 
result they set up this task team of the three departments to try and 
10 
manage and sort out all the logistics of procuring these.  And again 
Chair I just want to refer and in the fourth line of – of paragraph 9.058 I 
state: 
“It must be noted that even at this early stage the 
only emergency seemed to be the need regarding the 
funding for this project with the following being 
stated in the minutes.  There was extreme urgency to 
finalise this project given the fact that six months of 
the financial year had already lapsed. The adjusted 
estimate was just around the corner and a decision 
20 
regarding the funding needed to be made soon.” 
So Chair not an urgency or an emergency that the communities do not 
have clean drinking water but rather the need to spend the money. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then if we could go to page 1133?  And the 
joint memorandum dated the 10 October 2005 referred to in paragraph 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 100 of 158 
 
9.068. 
MR WHITE:  Chair just for the record if I could make two corrections to 
that paragraph?  In that paragraph in the third line I refer to the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of Local Government.  Chair it 
should be the MEC in both instances it should not be the Minister.  
Chair that is a memorandum that was issued jointly by Mr Shabalala the 
Head of the Provincial Treasury, Ms Gumbi-Masilela the Head of Local 
Government and Traditional Affairs and I think it is Ms Phaphama the 
acting Head of Economic Development.  That memorandum was 
addressed to Doctor Mkhize as the MEC of Finance and Economic 
10 
Development and Mr Mabuyakhulu as the MEC for Local Government 
and Traditional Affairs.  That memorandum is title Proposal to allocate 
R43 million … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a – I am sorry Mr White. 
MR WHITE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It Mabuyakhulu.  It sounded like you were saying 
Mabayakhulu.  I may have misheard you. 
MR WHITE:  Thank you Chair I will try and get … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mabuya – buyakhulu. 
MR WHITE:  Correct going forward. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should not be difficult. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
MR WHITE:  I am from KZN Chair so I have got no excuse.  The 
proposal to allocate R47 – sorry R43 million from the Poverty 
Alleviation Fund to the Department of Local Government and Traditional 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 101 of 158 
 
Affairs to purchase Itaka water purification plants. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay if you can stop here.  The memorandum 
that we spoke about before the lunch adjournment referred to a figure 
of R22 million.  How have we now got to a figure of R43 million? 
MR WHITE:  Chair in the intervening period there was a quotation that 
had been sent to Mr Shabalala.  It said it would cost R43 million and 
other than that there was no reason for the increase in the amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The initial – was there an initial amount which was 
less than R43 million? 
MR WHITE:  It was 22 Chair and I refer to it in one of those previous… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, no I think I remember I saw that.  Ja  
MR WHITE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You testified about that. 
MR WHITE:  So they have just increased the amount now.  Now it is at 
43.  Chair it ultimately ends up at 44.5 plus transport of 5.8 million.  So 
it just steadily increases over the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is never explained how it increased? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  But Chair just to put it into context.  The cost according to 
20 
the manufacturer of the Watakas so the entity external to Intaka that 
manufactures them said the delivered cost would be R750 000.00 each. 
Here they bought 20 for R44 500 000.00 each so R2.2 million each plus 
there was a further R5.9 million transport for the 20.  So they 
effectively paid R50 million close to R2.5 million each and the cost 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 102 of 158 
 
price to Intaka is R750 000.00 delivered. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  If you can then deal further 
with this memorandum of the 10 October 2005? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair this memorandum effectively summarises what 
the departments will do that are going to – to make this procurement 
happen and the processes.  So the entities identified as Intaka 
Investments and then in paragraph 2 on that page, 1133,  
“The 
Department 
of 
Local 
Government 
and 
Traditional Affairs made a number of comments 
including and then I quote Chair – accepting 
10 
responsibility for the project.  Conducting preliminary 
investigations.  Compiling a business plan and then 
importantly obtaining waiver of tender requirements 
approval from the Central Procurement Committee 
with the assistance of Treasury.  Entering into a 
contract with the supplier to purchase 20 plants at a 
price of original quotation and compiling memoranda 
of agreements with district municipalities prepared to 
accept plants.” 
So Chair one of the – the key things they needed to do was to obtain a 
20 
waiver of the tender requirements with the assistance of the Provincial 
Treasury of which Mr Shabalala was the head of and I will show you 
ultimately had a significant role in obtaining that waiver.  And then if we 
go to the bottom of the page what Provincial Treasury made two 
commitments to expedite the project.  The first one is transferring an 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 103 of 158 
 
amount of R43 million from the Poverty Alleviation Fund to Local 
Government and Traditional Affairs in the adjustment estimates for the 
2005/2006 financial year subject to an approved business plan.  And 
then the second point.  Ensuring that Local Government and Traditional 
Affairs obtains central procurement committee approval for waiver of 
tender procedures.  Chair just at the time in KZN there was a – all 
tenders were approved regardless of which department they were by a 
central procurement committee.  Each department could not approve 
the acceptance of a tender it went to this committee which was chaired 
by Mr Shabalala. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So am I understanding you correctly that he 
was going to chair a committee that was going to – was asked to 
approve a waiver of tender requirements in respect of a tender that he 
had introduced to the department and in respect of which he had 
travelled overseas with Mr Savoi? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is the position not – should not that – there was 
going to be no tender? 
MR WHITE:  Ja but Chair there needed to be a waiver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they had… 
20 
MR WHITE:  So – so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the waiver ja. 
MR WHITE:  So the waiver goes to the tender committee to approve 
that there is no requirement to have an external – third parties quote 
for it. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 104 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair you are correct.  The – my use of 
the word tender in that instance was – was misused.  Thank you.  Could 
we then – so this is happening now on the 10 October 2005, is that 
correct? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If we could then go to page 1138. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair at the top of that page in paragraph 9.077 I 
summarise – in fact I quote from an email that was sent by Mr 
Shabalala to Doctor Savoi of Intaka on the 3 November 2005.  Chair in 
10 
these – this came from the electronic records of Intake that had been 
seized by the South African Police Service.  So they seized, they made 
images of computers and then they provided it to us for further 
analysis.  And this was one the emails identified.  It is titled Intaka and 
then Holla Amigo.   
“Thank you for the email I have received it.  Thank 
you also for the…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I am look – it looks like I am looking at – 
am I looking at the right place 9.077 the paragraph? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and then the number 1 below that, the sub 
20 
1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
MR WHITE:  So I am referring to an email from Shabalala to Doctor 
Savoi dated the 3 November 2005.  And the contents of that email read: 
“Wataka, Holla Amigo thank you for the email I have 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 105 of 158 
 
received it. Thank you also for the tie it is bright and 
lovely.  I wish to ensure you that the province is 
really doing its best to ensure that by the end of the 
year there is real progress on this issue.” 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And this if you just – for the timeline this is 
approximately weeks after the memorandum was addressed requested a 
waiver of the tender requirements? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and it is not – it is just not the type of email 
you would be expecting from a Head of Provincial Treasury to a 
prospective supplier.  There was a relationship between the two that 
10 
was much closer than one would normally expect from an official in this 
situation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then if you can give… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I see that it says Holla Amigo.  I think that 
some of us will understand that language in a certain way especially 
certainly in the townships they will understand it. Okay alright.  Thank 
you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Could you then deal – still 
on page 1138 with the submission from Gumbi-Masilela to the Central 
Procurement Committee dated the 16 November 2005? 
20 
MR WHITE:  So Chair even although all these decisions had been made 
there was then still a need for want of a better – better words to tick 
the boxes to say it has gone to the Central Procurement Committee and 
they have decided that there is no need to go out to tender.  So 
effectively grant the tender waiver.  The formalities had to be – to be 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 106 of 158 
 
followed through.  Chair this submission which came from the Head of 
Local Government and Traditional Affairs it is to request the waiver for 
the purchase of the water purification plants and then reading from the 
fifth line down a quote from the memorandum: 
“The entire project can therefore be regarded as a 
pilot project with major growth potential.  As a result 
establishing a manufacturing plant in KZN job 
creation and skills transfers.” 
Chair then I go on to say: 
“The writer does not include relevant delegation 
10 
applicable to the waiver but concludes it is submitted 
that the waiver of tender and the placing of an order 
upon Messrs Intaka Investments is the only avenue 
by which the equipment can be procured and 
payment effected within the timeframe of this 
financial year.” 
Chair there is absolutely no motivation as to why this is urgent or an 
emergency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am just thinking about this waiver issue.  I – I 
had last year a number of witnesses particularly from Transnet where 
20 
there were issues about tender procedures that had not been followed.  
And there was a lot of evidence about exceptions when procedures do 
not have to be followed.  One of them I think is that if the product you 
are looking for or the service or the goods and there is only one 
supplier for that product if I recall correctly.  And my query was always 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 107 of 158 
 
what is wrong with inviting anybody who can provide that because if 
that supplier is the only one then it will be the only one which will 
respond to the invitation.  But just in case there is somebody else that 
you do not know about who can provide then they can come up and that 
is – that is – that should be good for you as a government entity.  But 
the question that arises is whether this was a situation where Intaka 
was the only entity that could supply this because I think the person 
who is writing there seems to suggest that as a basis for seeking a 
waiver. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair if one reads this carefully they do not actually – 
10 
nowhere do they say this – they are the sole supplier of this product.  
What they in a roundabout way are trying to get to is to say that Intaka 
says they will build a manufacturing plant in KZN if you order these as 
a first step and then order further from us in the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think I was looking at that last sentence.  It 
says: 
“It is submitted that waiver of tender and the placing 
of an order upon Messrs Intaka Investment is the 
only avenue by which the equipment can be 
procured.” 
20 
MR WHITE:  Chair but… 
CHAIRPERSON:   
“And payment effected within the time frame of this 
financial year.” 
MR WHITE:  Chair the… 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 108 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I was look – I was focussing on the only way in 
which the plant can be procured. 
MR WHITE:  Chair the problem is the word and.  Because and paid for 
within the financial year.  So if they went out to tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the… 
MR WHITE:  They may not have been able to pay for it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but the question I am asking is, whether this plant 
could be obtained anywhere other than through Intaka as a matter of 
fact? 
MR WHITE:  Chair as a matter of fact there were similar products that 
10 
could be made – that could be purchased. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That could be? 
MR WHITE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which could do the job just as well? 
MR WHITE:  They are not exactly the – they are not exactly the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  But they are similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But they could – they do the same job? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair it is purifying water Chair it is not a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR WHITE:  It is not a unique 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Thing that they doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as a matter of fact it would not be – it would not 
have been true to say Intaka was the only one who – which provided a 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 109 of 158 
 
plant that would do the kind of job that would be used for the purpose 
for which this one was required. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  Intaka is not a sole supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes was not a sole supplier. 
MR WHITE:  There are other entities and we did speak to some others 
in the process of the investigation trying to work out what a 
comparative pricing would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR WHITE:  So that is why I can say with – as a matter of fact there is 
some similar products out there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay that is helpful. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did Intaka manufacture these plants? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair they were manufactured on their behalf by a 
manufacturer in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so there is a man – there was a manufacturer in 
Cape Town? 
MR WHITE:  That – that – the manufacturer in Cape Town actually 
made stainless steel vats for the wine industry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And effectively they used stainless steel tanks with some 
pumps and a filtering process that is attached to the stainless steel 
tank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 110 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  So they used – they gave the design to them to 
manufacture for Intaka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  And just to digress pursuant to the 
Chair’s point about being the only people who could manufacture these 
plants.  In the course of your investigation was the – did it ever occur 
that it was only Intaka that met the bid specifications and how did that 
occur?  And we will deal with it in more detail later but if you can just 
alert the Chair to that? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there were no bid specifications.  It was – this 
10 
was effectively an unsolicited bid that worked its way through the 
process staring with Mr Shabalala and they never went to them and 
said, this is what we require.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It was – it was different with the Ox-Intaka where there 
were bid specifications but the issue with that is Intaka helped the 
department set the bid specifications so they ended up being the only 
one that was compliant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  So that was different.  But on the Watakas there were no 
20 
bid specifications set. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.   
MR WHITE:  Chair just to continue with that submission and the 
approvals that were then given.  The approval was not done in a formal 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 111 of 158 
 
meeting it was done on a round robin basis. So the submission was 
sent to all the members of the Central Procurement Committee where 
they could write approved or not approved and their reasons.  Chair I 
set those out on the following page, page 1139 and what the various 
comments were by the different members if they wrote a comment.  So 
For Mr Sipho Shabalala he merely said approved.  He did not declare 
any conflict of interest.  He did not abstain from giving a view.  He said 
approved.  Doctor Mbnjwana [?] supported the recommendation.  Mrs 
Coetzee supported the recommendation but she made a comment next 
to her – her signature which said, more info on how the particular 
10 
supplier was selected would be useful.  So she effectively asked a 
question.  Mr Conradie supported the recommendation and made the 
comment, I have no problem with the waiver as an urgent case but the 
market should have been tested.  Mr Malloy also supported it with the 
comment, information provided not entirely satisfactory however the 
need and desirability for the project implementation is admissible and 
Mr Ibraham just said supported.  So Chair three of the members while 
they supported it effectively raised queries about the process that had 
been followed.  Chair that never – so that led to some questions 
effectively in the process that followed.  And there were some 
20 
questions from Local Government and Traditional Affairs as to whether 
this was approved or not and whether further action needed to be 
taken.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So then if I can refer you to page 1141 and 
the letter from SCN to Tender Award Committee Department dated the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 112 of 158 
 
12 December 2005 at paragraph 9.8 – 9.086? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair based on that submission that had been prepared 
to the Central Procurement Committee and the comments about 
supported with various comments attached there was then a letter 
prepared by Supply Chain Management and Provincial Treasury which 
summarised the outcome of the process and in that she stated: 
“The Central Procurement Committee has by way of round robin granted 
approval for the waiver of normal tender procedures for the 
procurement of 22 mobile water purification plant through the Poverty 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  Where are you reading from? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair.  On the bottom of page 1-1-4-1  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR WHITE:  Paragraph 9.0-8-6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  And from the - the middle of the fourth line in that 
paragraph. 
“Central Procurement Committee has by way of 
round robin granted approval for the waiver of 
normal tender procedures for the procurement of 22 
mobile water purification plant through the Poverty 
20 
Alleviation Fund from Intaka Investments at a total 
cost of 43 230 000.  However concerns were 
expressed that there is no problem with the waiver 
as an urgent, but market price should be tested.” 
Chair that is an exact quote out of her - her memorandum 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 113 of 158 
 
that was prepared.  Chair, I - and I know you asked me just briefly 
before that about a sole supplier.  The difference between what may 
have happened at Transnet and what happened in KwaZulu-Natal at the 
time was KwaZulu-Natal had a KZN Procurement Act. 
So they needed to comply with that Act when procuring and 
Chair if one - I then extracted from that Act at the bottom of that page.  
Where I say I examined the KZN Procurement Act and there is no 
provision for urgent cases.  Nor does it detail waivers in such a case, 
but there is a subsequent KZN Provisional - Provincial Treasury 
Practice Note 2 of 2006 that does define urgent and emergency cases. 
10 
“When the following criteria have been met.” 
And I am reading from the top of page 1-1-4-2 and there is 
three criteria. 
“The duration of invitation of bids would have a 
material 
impact 
on 
service 
delivery 
community/public i.e. is of critical importance 
resulted from natural disaster i.e. beyond human 
control and immediate action is required to avoid a 
dangerous or life threatening situation, misery or 
want.  Poor planning is not a justifiable cause of an 
20 
emergency or urgent situation.  Written motivation 
must be provided detailing the reasons as to why 
procurement must be done under circumstances of 
urgency or emergency.” 
Chair, the - the submission to the Central Procurement 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 114 of 158 
 
Committee never covered any of those criteria.  Chair while there - 
there was a doubt in anybody that we spoke to that there was a need to 
provide clean drinking water in the rural areas in KZN.  There was no 
specific emergency identified where it needed to be done now to such 
an extent that you could not follow a procurement process and Chair 
what is interesting is that this process some four years later some of 
these Watakas had still not been installed.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Any justification even if it was justified as an emergency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR WHITE:  You cannot justify it four years in advance of using it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you then refer to the further letter from 
Mr Shabalala to Gumbi-Masilela dated 27 January 2006 referred to on 
page 1-1-4-2 paragraph 9.0-8-7. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that is where Mr Shabalala as the Chairperson of 
the Central Procurement Committee - there was this letter written 
where he refers to the waiver of tender and he notes that there has 
been slow progress in this key poverty alleviation project and that it is 
effectively of great concern with the need to commit the funds before 
20 
the end of March 2006 which is only two months from the end of the 
financial year. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you say that the fact that only two months 
remains in this financial year seems to be as important to Shabalala as 
the basic needs of the affected communities. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 115 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair.  The - the common thread throughout these 
- these meetings and minutes and memorandums etcetera is the need 
to spend the money.  One would think the starting point would be the 
need of the community and the spending the money and the date you 
spend it by is once you follow the process. 
Whereas here it looks like you are more interested in 
spending the money than - than actually delivering a service to people. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what happens if the end of a financial 
year comes and you have not spent the money as a department? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, it - it goes back to the Treasury or to the National 
10 
Treasury. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So now the further minute referred to on the 
same page - 1-1-4-2 of the KwaZulu-Natal CPC Meeting held on 
2 February 2006.  If you could please deal with that. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that meeting on 2 February ratified the decision 
that had been taken by round robin, but the minutes for that meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you talk about the minutes.  I just want to 
raise something here.  You mentioned that the approval of the waiver 
was not done in circumstances which complied with the criteria - which 
met the criteria spelt out in Practice Note 2 of 2006.  That is earlier in - 
20 
on the same page. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
If 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
KZN 
CPC 
was 
on 
2 February 2006 was that practice note in operation already? 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I would have to check.  I do not … 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 116 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because it is quite early - the meeting is quite 
early in the year.  There - there may well be a possibility that the 
practice note came after the date of the meeting. 
MR WHITE:  I would have to check Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  But the point being even if it was not spelt out in that 
practice note similar provisions appear in procurement policies and 
procedures throughout the country.  So one would not be able to just 
make up the basis for a waiver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no.  I under - understand that.  It is just that 
10 
if we say they acted in breach of that practice note - the requirements 
of that practice note.  You must just check whether it was in operation 
or not.  You are probably right that there would be some other 
legislation or policies that would apply.  That would prescribe certain 
requirements. 
What one does not know would be whether they would be 
exactly the same.  I think the last two requirements or criteria as they 
call them in the practice note seem to be quite familiar.  The - they - 
they or they cannot be contentious.  I think it is the first one that I am 
not sure about whether it would appear in other policies as well.  At 
20 
least the way it is framed. 
MR WHITE:  I take your point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Now Mr White in the 
minutes of the meeting held on 2 February 2006 there it is stated that: 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 117 of 158 
 
“The decision had been granted by way of round 
robin for the waiver.  However concerns were 
expressed that the market price should have been 
tested.” 
The minutes were only confirmed and signed on 2 June 2006 
by what appears to be Mr Shabalala.  If you could just deal with that 
and then what transpired the next day on 3 February 2006? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair because of the way those minutes were recorded 
indicating that there were concerns about the market price.  On the 
next page I refer to a letter - it is at the top of page 1-1-4-3.  That 
10 
Gumbi-Masilela - the Head of Local Government and Traditional Affairs 
- sent to Mr Shabalala on 3 February 2006 and she questioned the 
market price should be tested as it was not understood and whether 
quotations should be obtained prior to issuing the order to Intaka, 
because it was not clear from the minutes. 
The waiver was approved, but should they now be getting 
quotations or not.  Chair that document was responded to not 
personally by Mr Shabalala, but by somebody from his office.  Chair 
and I apologise.  The - the lines are not numbered, but if one goes 
down to approximately the middle of the page.  Mr Shabalala’s office 
20 
then made a similar report to Gumbi-Masilela on 13 February 2006 and 
stated and I quote: 
“It is clear that the CPC’s reference to the market 
price should be tested was only meant to refer to 
the ideal situation which would apply in normal 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 118 of 158 
 
circumstances when time is not an issue and where 
waiver of tender is not required.” 
As a result of that and the fact that the minutes were 
ultimately approved on 2 June 2006 and order was subsequently placed 
with Intaka for R44 million - R44.5 million on 5 June 2006.  So Chair 
effectively despite the concerns of members of the Central Procurement 
Committee about the fact that the market had not been tested. 
Prices had not been obtained and the process had dragged 
on now for more than six months.  The decision was now made to place 
the order. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But even those members of the - of that committee.  
They did not represent that the queries they were raising were of 
sufficient concern for them to say we cannot make a decision until we 
know about A, B, C, D.  They were happy to approve and just provide 
some comment. 
MR WHITE:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they felt strongly that they were not satisfied.  They 
should not have provided approval. 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It - it maybe - it comes across as a situation 
20 
where they were happy to approve, but they just wanted to mention 
something - you know - and - and the question is whether really it puts 
them in any different position to those who just approved without any 
comments, because they did not say I am approving on condition that 
the following will be - the following requirement will be met or 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 119 of 158 
 
something like that. 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR WHITE: 
 
So 
effectively 
Chair 
that 
whole 
committee 
just 
rubberstamped the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  It was almost a formality … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  Process that had been started by Mr Shabalala some 
months before. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  He had undertaken in the - the joint memorandum that 
Treasury would arrange for the ten - tender waiver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  He chaired the committee that now approved it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So effectively he did what he said he will do.  I will get the 
tender waiver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  So it was not - it was almost like there was no doubt for 
20 
months before that this would be the outcome. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And also his response to the concern raised 
that the market should be tested, because that is only relevant when 
you are not asking for a tender waiver. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 120 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now you say these minutes were then signed 
on 2 June 2006 and three days later the order was placed on 5 June.  
What happened after that? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair maybe if I could go back to TSW19 which is on - 
in RR4D at page 1-9-5-8.  That diagram Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want the diagram to be put on the screen? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  It needs to be TSW19.  So Chair that - that diagram and 
10 
the piece we have been referring to at the moment is at - is to the top 
right of that diagram - the Department of Traditional Affairs and Local 
Government - and the lines I am referring to are the - are the blue line 
that flows from the department to Intaka. 
So there is an order on 5 June 2006 for 21 Watakas as a 
price of R44.5 million.  Chair there was then some backwards and 
forwards between Intaka and the department and Intaka said this is an 
ex-works price Cape Town.  If you want the product in KZN you must 
pay for the delivery.  Suddenly the department did not have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was never part of any documentation? 
20 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how could - how could anybody have thought that 
there would be an extra if it was not in the documentation? 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair and all along the - the funding available had 
come from the Poverty Alleviation Fund and it was 43 million. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 121 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  They have now actually spent 1.5 million more than they 
received from the Poverty Alleviation Fund and now Intaka says you 
need to pay for the transport and delivery.  So as a result the whole 
process delayed by another six months.  Then on 5 November 2006 a 
further order was placed on Intaka for the transport of R5.6 million. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if the matter was urgent why did it take so 
long for the transport to be arranged? 
MR WHITE:  Well Chair that is - that is why everything goes against the 
fact that it was urgent.  Chair then there were some further delays, 
10 
because the department … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - I am sorry.  So - so the amount now with delivery 
would have gone up to about 50? 
MR WHITE:  50.1 million Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  50.1 million? 
MR WHITE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Coming from 22 million? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair there were then further delays with the delivery, 
20 
because the Department of Local Government could not tell Intaka 
where to deliver them to and the - and the issue with that was the 
specific sites and municipalities had not been identified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if it was urgent why would all of those things not 
have been done in time? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 122 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  So Chair when the - that - that is the question.  The - that 
begs the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How - how can you say - how can you take all kinds 
of measures to say we do not have time even to follow procurement 
procedures because this is urgent and yet do not know where you will 
put it once it is delivered. 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  But then what happened was the - one, the financial year 
end of March 2007 was now approaching plus Intaka was now saying 
10 
we manufactured the goods.  We want to be paid.  If you cannot tell us 
where to deliver them.  It is not our fault.  The department … 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you cannot blame them for that. 
MR WHITE:  I - I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least that part of it.  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  An inspection was then allegedly done by Mr Koen from 
the Department of Traditional Affairs and Local Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By Mr …? 
MR WHITE:  Koen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And he said I verified they have been manufactured in 
Cape Town and as a result a payment was then made.  So the payment 
by the department of 44.5 million - so not for the transport, but for the 
manufacture was then made on 5 March 2007. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 123 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, I will later refer to where I verified some of these 
Watakas in 2010 and 10 of the 20 were standing on a piece of vacant 
ground outside of Durban in storage and the manufacturer’s plate that 
was riveted onto them with a serial number etcetera said they were only 
manufactured in 2008. 
So if Mr Koen verified plants that had been manufactured in 
February 2007.  It was not the ones that came … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  To KZN. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  It may have been ones that went to the Northern Cape or 
somewhere else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  They were paying in advance of their plants being 
manufactured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And when you did the inspection were there 
only 10 plants at that inspection? 
MR WHITE:  So - so that is correct Chair.  I - during our investigation 
20 
we received information that where some of these plants were being 
stored.  It was just outside of Amanzimtoti South of Durban and on 
26 July 2010 I physically went there with the investigating officer and 
some members of my team verified that 10 of the plants were standing 
there. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 124 of 158 
 
We took photographs and Chair this was more than three 
years after they had been paid for.  They were still now standing 
uninstalled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where they were standing was not the site where 
they were supposed to be or was it the site where they were supposed 
to be, but not installed … 
MR WHITE:  So Chair it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you do not know? 
MR WHITE:  It was in an industrial park where there are factories 
around this and was an undeveloped piece of land. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So it was not … 
MR WHITE:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was clearly not where they were supposed to serve 
the community? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  It was just land that was rented as storage 
space for them to be placed on until the sites could be - be identified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was their condition three years after they 
were paid for … 
MR WHITE:  So Chair ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or had they just arrived there? 
20 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  They had been standing there for some time.  
You could see they had been standing there for some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  But they are stainless steel.  So they do not rust, but you 
could … 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 125 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Just see by looking at them that they were not - they had 
not come yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  They had obviously been standing there for some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But the department if they were still there 
three years later obviously viewed no urgency in deploying this to the 
community that needed purified water or to drink clean water. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there was - I - I agree 100 percent.  The problem 
10 
was they could not identify the sites to install them.  They bought 
something that they now did not know where to put. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they - in the memorandums - in the - in the letters 
they projected themselves - that is now Government people/officials 
involved in this thing - projected themselves as being concerned - very 
much concerned about the needs of the communities which would be 
helped by these plants. 
Did not the - were these plants such that they could not be 
installed in the communities where they were required or did they 
require a special kind of environment or what? 
20 
MR WHITE:  Chair, they just had not identified the sites.  So the initial 
… (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they had not gone there to - they gone out to the 
communities and basically have a look? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 126 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which might suggest they - when they talked about 
communities or a community that needed this kind of plant.  They may 
have just been talking in general.  Not because there was a specific 
community or there were specific communities which had been 
identified. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WHITE:  Because one of the initial lists that had GPS coordinates 
where they should be installed - one of the coordinates was in the 
middle of a dam.  Another coordinate was on the top of a hill where 
10 
there was no water source and that is why Intaka said we cannot install 
these, because there is no - you cannot put them in those sites. 
So that is the lack of actual thought that had gone through 
the process and that is why it took years to eventually install them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how do you - how do you as a Government official 
commit a Government department to paying millions of taxpayers 
money to get a product that you have not done your homework about to 
see how and if it will be used?  I guess … 
MR WHITE:  So Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not a question really for you, but … 
20 
MR WHITE:  But the unfortunate thing is the negative inference can be 
drawn is that it was done, because there was a promise of a payment to 
Mr Shabalala.  So he had negotiated at the beginning and I will refer to 
an affidavit from Dr Savoi of Intaka.  That he required a donation linked 
to this procurement … 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 127 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR WHITE:  And that is what I am referring to in that - in that diagram 
Chair.  The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the R100 - R100 million donation? 
MR WHITE:  No Chair.  It is the R1 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  R1 million. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry.  Before you go there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well you - you cannot blame me Mr White.  I 
have heard evidence here of lots of 100’s of millions.  R600 million and 
- and billions of Rands.  So R1 million has not featured much.  Yes. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If we can just go back to the timeline.  What 
date did you say the payment was made to Mr Savoi’s company - 
Intaka? 
MR WHITE:  It is 5 March 2007. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what happened seven days after that 
payment was affected? 
MR WHITE:  So that is when the payment of R1 053 000,00 was made 
to a firm of attorneys in Durban called Khuboni and Shezi Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  How much was that? 
MR WHITE:  1 053 000. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  That was made - that payment was made 
… 
MR WHITE:  Seven days later Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About seven days after the department had paid 
Intaka? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 128 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair and that is also referred to on that diagram 
at TSW19.  Where if you look at you can see there is then a - a 
payment to that firm of attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Chair, maybe to then link that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe - I am sorry Mr White.  We will come back just 
now.  I just would like us to take a five minutes comfort break.  We will 
just adjourn for five minutes.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr White before the 
adjournment, we were referring to your diagram Annexure TSW19 and 
you indicated that seven days after payment was made by the 
Department to Intaka, an amount of R1053million was paid on the 12 t h 
of March 2007 to Kuboni & Shezi Attorneys was that paid into a 
business account or a Trust account? 
MR WHITE:  My understanding it was paid into the Trust account of the 
Attorneys Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry? 
MR WHITE:  To the Trust account of the Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And now to explain what then happened to the 
money, I’d like to refer you to the further diagram Annexure TSW21, 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 129 of 158 
 
Chair Bundle D page 1978. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that’s in the same Exhibit, same lever arch 
file? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it’s RR4 D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1978 you said? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes, Chair it won’t be in that same file, the 
file that I think you’re working with now is C and this is in D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now we were looking before the break at the diagram 
10 
and I’m looking at the file that had the diagram that we were looking at 
before the five-minute adjournment. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes that is the same file, that is the correct 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is D? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That is D and we were looking at TSW19 and 
we now want to refer to Annexure TSW21. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At 1978? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I believe so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay it looks like I’m about to find it – okay thank 
you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now we know the money you say goes into 
Kuboni & Shezi Attorneys Trust account, could you, with reference to 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 130 of 158 
 
document TSW21 explain to the Chair, what then happened to the 
money? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that are you able to throw any 
particular light why it was not R1million it was R1 053 000? 
MR WHITE:  Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The amount was R1million and something, is that 
right? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it R53 000? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright, no it just sounds a little unusual – it 
looks unusual in my eyes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair and you will in a very short while 
understand why, perhaps that amount looks like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright okay, continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Let’s just look at this side of the transaction 
and then we’ll go back.  What was this money that was paid into the 
Attorney’s Trust account, what happened to it, did you follow the 
money? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair we did and in that diagram at page 1978 in the 
20 
box in the middle of that page I summarise what happened to that 
money.  So that money was then dispersed by the attorneys on the 
instruction 
of 
Mr 
Tshabalala 
or 
his 
wife 
to 
various 
entities 
predominantly relating to the operations of his farm.  So Chair it was 
used to buy…[intervenes]. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 131 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the operation of his? 
MR WHITE:  To his, being Mr Tshabalala’s farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Farm? 
MR WHITE:  Farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair it was for the community watch, it was to 
purchase fertilizer, it was to repair a tractor, it was to procure irrigation 
parts and to repair irrigation systems and then in the second line of 
those boxes, Blue Serenity is an entity owned by his wife and R300 000 
in two separate payments was paid to that entity.  So Chair, effectively 
10 
what happened and how it was possible, I can only assume it was 
because the money earned interest over the time that these payments 
took place but R1 056 000 was spent for the benefit of Mr Tshabalala 
and his wife.  Chair then those payments started taking place on the 
19 t h of February 2007 so Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that have been within a few days after Kuboni 
Attorneys…[intervenes]. 
MR WHITE:  It was a week Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Within a week? 
MR WHITE:  Within a week. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  And the money, the final payment…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It couldn’t have earned much interest while it was 
with them. 
MR WHITE:  No Chair but it was paid out over the next six months. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 132 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so the first payment was within a week? 
MR WHITE:  The first payment was on the 19 t h of February and the last 
payment was on the 21 s t of August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  So they used this money over that six-month period to 
defray their personal expenses on their farm, Mr Tshabalala and his 
wife. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was paid out, so to speak in instalments? 
MR WHITE:  In instalments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was paid out to the Tshabalala’s – all the 
10 
instalments were directed either to their accounts or to the accounts of 
entities associated with them? 
MR WHITE:  Well to entities that they owed money to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that they owed money to? 
MR WHITE:  So these were effectively suppliers to the farm, to 
equipment for repairs for security etcetera on his farm and him or his 
wife gave the Attorneys at Kuboni Shezi Attorneys instructions on who 
to pay and how much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s unusual I would imagine. 
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair there’s nothing usual about this transaction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s unusual unless you are – you normally do that 
for that client but it’s unusual with a kind of once-off payment that you 
then, you know, don’t pay it to the client you get directed where to pay 
it by the client but maybe that’s just my experience it might not be 
everybody’s experience. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 133 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  So Chair based on the facts the prosecutors allocated to 
this matter drew the conclusion that this was just a way of laundering a 
corrupt payment. So it was paid through these attorneys on an invoice 
that they had submitted to Intaka for legal services provided.   So again 
why it goes into a Trust account and not into a business account is 
unanswered but Kuboni Shezi Attorneys issued an invoice to Intaka, 
and I will refer to it shortly, it’s a one-line invoice for legal services 
rendered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is usual for attorneys to receive the month into 
– for their services into the Trust account and then transfer it into their 
10 
business account afterwards so that part is usual it’s just easier to 
account for it if it goes that way or at least that part is normal because 
you can always check first, you know, if there is enough money this 
side and then go over that side. 
MR WHITE:  But Chair the allegation here was, the services had 
already been rendered so it wasn’t paid as a retainer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes – no, no even when the service has been 
rendered it’s quite usual to do it that way, maybe other firms do it 
differently that – during my time in practice a lot of – at least black 
firms would receive the money in the Trust account and at the end of 
20 
the month when you are supposed to pay your bills, pay your staff, you 
then check what you have worked for and then you transfer money from 
the Trust account, because the money in the Trust account is the 
client’s money, you transfer it if you have worked for it, you have 
earned it, it’s your fees, into your business account then you pay 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 134 of 158 
 
yourself and you pay other people, okay alright. 
MR WHITE:  Understand Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair unfortunately I think that, that in this 
instance is entirely theoretical because is it clear Mr White that – or is 
it true Mr White that Mr Savoi himself deposed to an affidavit where he 
explained why he had made this payment to these Attorneys and before 
we get to it, so that we can just make this clear, did he say that any 
legal services were rendered to him in respect of this payment? 
MR WHITE:  Chair he said the invoice was arranged by Mr Tshabalala 
and that this firm had provided no legal services to Intaka. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was there an invoice that was sent out by this law 
firm to Intaka? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And for how much was it, if you remember? 
MR WHITE:  R1 053 000 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly the amount? 
MR WHITE:  Chair maybe if I could refer to this specific invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WHITE:  It’s in RR4 C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  C? 
20 
MR WHITE:  C, Chair at page 1398. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page on C? 
MR WHITE:  1398 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 1398, so the invoice is dated 14 February 2007 and 
it’s addressed to Dr G Savoi, Intaka Investments Pty Limited and it 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 135 of 158 
 
says, 
 
“to our fees for work done with the taking of instructions, 
 
telephone 
calls, 
correspondence, 
drafting 
of 
contracts, 
 
consultations, attending meetings, drafting legal opinions, 
 
correspondence and miscellaneous attendances, period 2003 
 
to 2006 and then the total is R1 053 000.00”. 
 
Okay so that is the invoice that was issued by the attorneys. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you’re saying Dr Savoi said they never rendered 
the services that they say in the invoice they rendered? 
10 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   But you were saying something about 
Tshabalala – Mr Tshabalala and his involvement in this invoice or? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair in that same file with that invoice – that invoice 
was actually attached to Dr Savoi’s affidavit and the affidavit starts at 
1386, that same file if you go back about 12 pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1386? 
MR WHITE:   1386 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’ve got it. 
MR WHITE:  Chair that, some twelve page affidavit is an affidavit that 
20 
Dr Gaston Savoi provided to the police and my understanding is that he 
came to know that these investigations were taking place, particularly 
around the R1 053 000 as well as two payment of R500 000 to Linda 
Makwanazi of Rowmoor Investments and he – my understanding was in 
an attempt to try and convince the police that he would co-operate 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 136 of 158 
 
provided this affidavit and this affidavit sets out the background to the 
payment of this payment to Kuboni Shezi Attorneys and Chair just to 
read some of the relevant paragraphs if I could go to page 1389 at 
paragraph 14…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you could perhaps start…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1289 – 1389? 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just to put it in context and the purpose of the 
affidavit if you could just first read paragraph five on 1386. 
MR WHITE:   So Chair that’s on the first page of the affidavit at the 
10 
bottom of the page and it reads, 
 
“I’ve been advised that the issues that have been raised and 
 
with which I should deal in this affidavit are firstly a certain 
 
donation that was paid by Intaka in February 2007 and 
 
secondly 
two commission payments 
paid by 
Intaka 
to 
 
Rowmoor Investments 738 Pty Limited in August 2007, I shall 
 
now deal with each of these issues”. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes, you wanted to go to a paragraph at 1389? 
MR WHITE:  That’s at paragraph 14 Chair and he states, 
 
“In addition at this time the question of a donation to the 
20 
 
party was also raised which I understood to refer to the 
 
ANC”…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Perhaps you should start with paragraph 13 
please to just put that in context on page 1388. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair, paragraph 13 reads, 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 137 of 158 
 
 
“The issue of Intaka possibly building a factory in KZN to 
 
manufacture water purification and treatment units and create 
 
jobs in KZN was also raised by tick KZN from the time of our 
 
initial discussions.  In response I indicated whilst we were 
 
always supportive of local economic development initiatives 
 
we already had a factory in Cape Town and a decision as to 
 
whether or not to build a further factory in KZN would be 
 
based on business considerations such as the number of 
 
units ordered.  At the time, as I recall there was some 
 
discussion of the possibility of 80 units for one area alone in 
10 
 
KZN” 
 
It then continues at paragraph 14 on the following page, 
 
“In addition at this time the question of a donation to the 
 
party was also raised which I understood to refer to the ANC.  
 
As I recall the person that did so was Mr Sipho Tshabalala 
 
head KZN treasury and I was not averse to the idea of making 
 
such a donation as it is a common procedure in any country, 
 
however, I did not pursue the matter any further at that time.  
 
Paragraph 15 continues, against this background, at Intaka’s 
 
costs I therefore arranged a fact finding visit to South 
20 
 
America, [indistinct] and Rio de Janeiro for a delegation from 
 
KZN so that its members could see for themselves how both 
 
the self generating oxygen and water purification plants 
 
operated in order to assist the delegation in deciding whether 
 
the equipment might indeed prove useful in KZN”, 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 138 of 158 
 
 
Chair Mr Tshabalala was one of those delegates and then on 
page – the following page 1390 paragraph 20, 
 
“Against this background the KZN Provincial Government via 
 
it’s department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs 
 
subsequently purchased 20 Wataka units from our company  at 
a unit cost of R2 228 181.82 the total amount involved was  therefore 
R44 563 636.40 inclusive of VAT and the relevant  
department 
contract tender number being ZNT14262005LS.  I  
have 
no 
direct 
knowledge of the procedures followed within  
the 
KZN 
PG 
in 
order to purchase the equipment from Intaka  
but 
I’ve 
always 
10 
assumed that whatever necessary steps –  steps necessary to be taken 
departmentally were in fact  
taken”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Wentzel I think we were looking at the 
donation and the trip it made, let’s not get out of that track, let’s finish 
that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes it will be dealt with if you could perhaps 
then go to page 1393 where in paragraph 31 you say, you note that the 
Wataka’s were finally launched with some publicity by the MEC for the 
Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs on the 5 t h of 
April 2008 some two years after the initial purchase of the equipment. 
20 
You can then deal with what is said in paragraphs 32, 33, 34 and 35. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair in those paragraphs Dr Savoi now refers to the 
donation, and in paragraph 32 he says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But before that the paragraph 31 that talks about the 
launching, the launch, this would have been a launch before the sites 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 139 of 158 
 
were identified where these plants would be installed. 
MR WHITE:   Well Chair they installed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They installed some? 
MR WHITE:    Ja, one or two, so that was the start of the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR WHITE: So just before they launched the first one, or installed the 
first one it took two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
MR WHITE:   So in 2020 they may have got to ten, there were still ten 
left. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:   Over the next two years they installed another nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:  But even the very first one took more than two years, and 
that’s on Intaka’s version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you know the last time you knew what was 
the position about what ultimately happened with ...[intervenes]  
MR WHITE:   Chair I don’t know what happened to the last ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes okay. 
MR WHITE:    Chair then in paragraph 32 Dr Savoi goes on to state: 
20 
“Be that as it may when Intaka finally received payment in 
early 2007 I asked Mr Tshabalala about the issue of the 
donation to the party, which had originally been raised right 
at the outset of the initial discussions in KZN.   He informed 
me that Intaka would be sent an invoice against which we 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 140 of 158 
 
should make payment.  I also note that as a general you 
make payments for any goods or services only against 
invoices and that we had been informed by professional 
advisors that we should always obtain documentation in 
support of payments.” 
It goes on in paragraph 33: 
“Subsequently I received an invoice from a firm of attorneys 
called Shezi and Gabone for an amount of R1 032 000 
inclusive of VAT, which invoice was subsequently paid by 
Intaka.  I attach a copy of the invoice and supporting 
10 
documentation for the payment.” 
He then goes on, on the following page in paragraphs 34 and 35 to say: 
“I have no knowledge of what happened to this money once it 
had been paid to the attorneys and do not know whether the 
party in fact received it.   I have no acknowledgement of this.   
However I confirm that no legal services as referred to in that 
invoice were ever rendered to Intaka by the attorneys 
concerned.   
Although 
I 
acknowledge 
that it is incorrect to have 
categorised the donation as legal expenses I am not familiar 
20 
with the manner in which political donations are sourced and 
dealt with in South Africa.  I merely responded to the 
directions of Mr Tshabalala in this regard.   I feel I should 
also add that Mr Tshabalala was one of the most helpful 
officials with whom we dealt with in the KwaZulu Natal 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 141 of 158 
 
Provincial government and that he has never requested a 
personal donation for himself from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WHITE:   So Chair on Intaka’s own version they link the payment of 
this R1 053 000 to the money they received from the department of 
Judicial Affairs and Local Government, so that’s not just an inference I 
am making that it is the same money, they say it is the same money, 
the issue of a donation was discussed when we first discussed doing 
business in the province with Mr Tshabalala, now that we have received 
a significant payment we asked him about it and he arranged effectively 
10 
fraudulent documentation from attorneys that didn’t provide a service, 
he effectively laundered the proceeds of this donation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And Chair it is my submission that that would 
explain why the invoice or the amount paid wasn’t exactly R1million, 
the invoice which had been requested by Mr Tshabalala was the amount 
of R1 053 000 and the amount that was ultimately paid to the benefit of 
Mr Tshabalala was R1 056 204.98, it is only that difference, with 
respect Chair, that can be accounted for by interest and it is my 
submission that the only inference for it being made in that amount is 
20 
to disguise the fact that it was a round figure million Rand and not for 
legal fees. 
 
Now in your investigations did you determine whether we know 
from following the money, the money from the trust account is used to 
pay Mr and Mrs Tshabalala and expenses in respect of the farm, it pays 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 142 of 158 
 
their expenses, is that correct? 
MR WHITE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, so it came into the trust account of the 
attorneys and it went out to Mr Tshabalala’s creditors through the same 
account. 
MR WHITE:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It didn’t go via the business account. 
MR WHITE:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   Now  well maybe later you will deal with it but 
10 
I would be interested to know how the attorneys explained not being 
paid for their services. 
MR WHITE:   They don’t Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They don’t? 
MR WHITE:   They were merely following the instructions of Mr 
Tshabalala. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they were owed according to their invoice a 
certain amount and they said it is for legal services. 
MR WHITE:   It wasn’t Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they admit that no legal services had been 
20 
provided? 
MR WHITE:   Correct Chair.  Chair that is why that invoice can’t be 
processed through their business account otherwise they are going to 
pay tax on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 143 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:   So that’s why it stayed in the trust account and never 
transferred across. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Did you discover whether the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But is there an explanation why they allowed 
themselves to do something that was clearly wrong? 
MR WHITE:   Chair there was no explanation, but the one thing that I 
do know is that they did significant work for the Provincial Government, 
as a firm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR WHITE:   So they only inference I could draw is that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not want to disappoint him? 
MR WHITE:   They were now keeping Mr Tshabalala happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   So if their version is correct Mr Tshabalala said 
to them send an invoice to Intaka Investments for this amount, say that 
you have provided legal services, knowing that they had not provided 
any legal services and they did exactly that, also knowing that they had 
not provided any legal services. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And Chair it doesn’t stop there.  Did you 
determine whether the million Rand donation was ever paid to the ANC? 
MR WHITE:   So Chair there was, because that was where we 
understood from the affidavit it was ultimately ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Switch on your microphone again.  Thank you. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 144 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  So Chair inquiries were made because that is where the 
money was ultimately according to Doctor Savoi intended to get to and 
in that regard the prosecutor, one of the prosecutors involved in the 
process early on the prosecutors changed a number of times received a 
letter from Ngobani Wills Incorporated a firm of attorneys in 
Pietermaritzburg and Chair that – a copy of that letter is at TSW29 
which is the last two pages in RR4d Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am there. 
MR WHITE:  So Chair that letter which is dated the 2 February 2010 it 
reads: 
10 
“We refer to our previous correspondence regarding the 
above and advise that we have consulted with a senior 
member of our client the ANC MEC Michael Mabuyakhulu 
who at the material time was the Provincial Treasurer of 
the ANC in KwaZulu Natal.  We are instructed to convey to 
you the following. 
1. That in his capacity as the Provincial Treasurer at 
the time Mabuyakhulu authorised the receipt of the 
R1 million donation from ANC member Mr Sipho 
Shabalala. 
20 
2. That he wishes to place on record that such a 
donation was received in cash and was verified to 
be R1 million. 
3. That he Mabuyakhulu further authorised the funds to 
be utilised for various purposes related to the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 145 of 158 
 
KwaZulu Natal ANC Provincial Conference that was 
held between 20 t h and 22 n d June 2008.” 
Chair so effectively Mr Mabuyakhulu says we received the money.  It is 
not quite the R1 053 000.00 but it is now been rounded to a R1 million 
and he says it was received and it was received in cash. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now he also deposed to an affidavit dealing 
with this and that is at page 1854.  If we could deal with that first? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I missed that I was still looking at this 
letter from Ngobani Wills. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Sorry I just want to check I have the 
10 
reference right I think it is SW16.   
MR WHITE:  Chair it was correct it – 1854 page. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  At page 1854. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same Exhibit? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is Exhibit D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  D? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  1854. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1854. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  And if you could deal with 1855 from 
paragraph 5 so that the Chair can see what it is that was said? 
MR WHITE:  Paragraph 5 Mr Mabuyukhulu’s affidavit reads as follows: 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Oh no I am looking at 1984.  You said 
1854? 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 146 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  1854 and then at 1855 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes this is Mr Mabuyukhulu’s affidavit.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if you could… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph at 1855? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Paragraph 5 at 6 and 7 first. 
MR WHITE:  Chair paragraph 5 it reads as follows: 
“During my tenure as Provincial Treasurer I was inter 
alia responsible for fund raising for the ANC.  During 
2005 I made the call to the ANC leadership and 
members to fundraise on behalf of the ANC.  The 
10 
funds were required for the ANC’s day to day 
administration and for the ANC Provincial Conference 
which was to take place at Ndumiso Training College 
during June 2008.  I recall that Mr Sipho Shabalala 
was one of those who undertook to raise funds on 
behalf of the ANC.  Prior to the conference he 
informed me he had fund raised and wished to pay 
funds to the ANC.  I do not recall the exact date that 
he informed of this but I believe it was approximately 
two months or so before the Provincial Conference.  
20 
Thereafter I received payment from Mr Shabalala in 
the amount of R1 million.  To the best of recollection 
I received the funds from Shabalala on or about 11 
June 2008.  The funds were received shortly before 
the Provincial Conference.  I was still the ANC 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 147 of 158 
 
Provincial Treasurer at the time.  I confirm that it is 
not the ANC’s policy to disclose where private 
donations are received from nor is it our policy to 
disclose how the funds were spent or dispersed.  
These are private matters and not in the public 
domain.  I can however state that the funds were 
used by me to defray expenses arising from the then 
upcoming June 2008 conference.  The funds were 
used by me in my capacity as Provincial Treasurer at 
the time.” 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then at paragraph 12 on page 1858 he 
refers to the letter from Ngobani Wills Incorporated dated the 2 
February 2010 which you have already dealt with.  What does he say 
about that? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair paragraph 12 at the bottom of page 1858 he 
states: 
“All ANC leaders were requested to raise funds.  I 
wish 
to 
clarify 
this 
statement. 
 
Mabuyakhulu 
authorised the receipt of the R1 million donation.  Mr 
Shabalala informed me that he had received funds 
20 
and he wished to pay these over as reported in 
paragraph 6 above.  I do not know how and where Mr 
Shabalala raised funds.  I only learnt of the funds 
when Mr Shabalala informed me that he had funds to 
pay over to the ANC.  When he informed me of the 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 148 of 158 
 
funds it was arranged that I would meet him to 
receive them from him and duly did so at the date set 
out above.  I did not specifically authorise the 
receipt of specific funds but fund raising in general.  
I confirm that the funds were received in cash and 
were used by me to defray certain of the expenses of 
the conference as stated above” 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now in the course of your of investigations 
did you have an opportunity to examine the books and records of the 
ANC and determine whether these funds were recorded in their books 
10 
and records? 
MR WHITE:  I did Chair.  While we did not have the detail records 
behind the financial statements the financial manager of the ANC at the 
time while he initially provided a statement saying the money was 
received.  He subsequently withdrew that statement and said there was 
no knowledge – he had no knowledge of the money being received, no 
invoice – sorry no receipt was issued and it was not accounted for in 
the ANC records. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair if I can refer you to those two 
affidavits now.  The one is dated the 4 May 2009 and appears at page 
20 
1843. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  43 in the same bundle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  43.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So this is the 4 May 2009 and what did he say 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 149 of 158 
 
in that affidavit? 
MR WHITE:  Chair in the second paragraph he says: 
“In the course of my duties I confirm that a donation 
of R1 million was received by the African National 
Congress from a donor who I am advised was a 
certain Doctor Savoi.” 
Then in paragraph 3: 
“Mr Sipho Shabalala had advised the organisation 
that such a donation had been made and when the 
money was requested Mr Shabalala brought the 
10 
money to our offices in cash.” 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if we can look at page 1845 and just 
more than a year later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he does also say in paragraph 4 he was aware 
that the money was utilised to pay for various service provider – to pay 
various service providers for items related to the Provincial Congress 
held in August 2008.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair I apologise for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  For [indistinct] that.  Okay now a little more 
20 
than a year later on the 30 August 2010 on page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this was – I am sorry this was 2009 when? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  4 May 2009. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He deposed to this affidavit? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.   
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 150 of 158 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And now we have a year later the 30 August 
2010 on page 1845 what did he then say? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair effectively what he now says is that – that 
statement that he signed was prepared by Ngobani Wills Attorneys.  He 
was – it was just brought to him, he signed it and he did not have 
knowledge of it.  He then goes on to say that and if I can refer to page 
1846 at paragraph 7.2 where it states: 
“A few weeks later I received a call from Ms S 
Ngobani Wills Incorporated advising me that there is 
10 
a matter under investigation by the South African 
Police 
Services 
Commercial 
Crime 
relating 
to 
donations received by the ANC KZN.  She had further 
advised that she is acting for ANC KZN in the matter 
and she asked me to sign an affidavit that she had 
prepared giving the circumstances of the donation.” 
So Chair he then in the following page at 1847 the affidavit is badly 
written because he effectively answers questions that had been sent to 
him Chair.  But in B under paragraph 8 he then – he states: 
“I have no personal knowledge of the answer 
20 
required.  These questions must be directed to the 
lawyer who prepared the affidavit for – on my 
behalf.” 
And then C. 
“I was informed by Mr Mabuyakhulu I have no 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 151 of 158 
 
personal knowledge and details of the donation used 
to pay for the items not paid for by the officers of the 
ANC KZN.  The question can be directed to Mr 
Mabuyakhulu save for the last paragraph where I 
explain how the statement was commissioned on 29 
August 2009.  I received an email attached – 
attached an affidavit from Ms S Ngobani and she told 
me to have it signed and commissioned and I took it 
to the Broad Street Police Station.” 
And then D. 
10 
“I have no idea I did not investigate this matter.  I 
have no knowledge.  My sources are Mr Mabuyakhulu 
and the lawyer.” 
And the E on the next – last page: 
“I therefore request to withdraw the initial affidavit 
which was provided to me to sign.” 
Chair effectively he distances himself from the first affidavit which he 
did not prepare and he distances himself from the facts contained 
therein. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but this is – this is somebody who has a B.Com 
20 
degree, B.Com accounting.  He is a financial manager.  He is told that 
the affidavit he is going to – he is being asked to sign is connected with 
police investigation.  Clearly he is going to have a look at that affidavit 
carefully before he takes an oath and signs it.  Did he ever explain that 
part to you how he could have signed such an affidavit knowing that 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 152 of 158 
 
this was connected with the police investigations?  Even if it was not 
connected with police investigations how could they – how could he just 
sign 
such 
an 
affidavit 
without 
understanding 
that 
he 
was 
misrepresenting the position at least as far as he was concerned? 
MR WHITE:  Chair it is inexplicable.  There is no… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Justification for what he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  And it appears that many for want of a better word junior 
people in these different organisations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Just did what they were told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  Without thinking of the potential consequences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But at least that is what he should be saying.  
He should be saying in the second affidavit this is how it came about.  
This is what I was told.  I signed because of this and that and that but 
to just say that it is an affidavit that was prepared by somebody else 
and it was given to you and you signed.  Because when he says that he 
wants us to believe that when he signed that affidavit he did not know 
20 
what it was saying.  Because if he knew what it was saying the question 
is how did you take an oath and depose to it if what it was saying was 
not true?  
MR WHITE:  Chair I agree and it is – it is not like it is a thick affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 153 of 158 
 
MR WHITE:  It is a few lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is possible that it was not true what was there 
and he knew it but maybe there was some pressure, he was scared, I 
do not know but he does not say that it seems in his second affidavit to 
say, look I did not think I had a choice and I have had time to reflect on 
this.  Now I am changing my mind.  
MR WHITE:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair he also says in paragraph 3 on page 
1845: 
10 
“That 
as 
a financial 
manager 
my 
duties and 
responsibilities involve financial management and 
bookkeeping and when we receive donations we 
follow ANC internal processes.” 
But we know as a matter of fact from Mr White’s examination of the 
ANC’s books and records that there is no reference to this donation he 
previously said had been received.  And surely it would have been the 
purvey of its duties he says himself he had that it should have been 
recorded.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Mr Savoi explain why in his company’s records he 
20 
reflected that this payment to these attorneys was for legal services if 
his – if it was for a donation? 
MR WHITE:  Chair he just went to say it was wrong and it was 
corrected.  In a review of his records I noted that initially it was 
accounted for as legal services and it was subsequently changed some 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 154 of 158 
 
time later to reflect that it was a donation.  So Chair it appears that the 
initial attempt was to hide what it actually was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And the question is, why would – why would 
they hide – hide it if it was a donation? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair there would be no – if it was a donation that was 
not as a repayment for receiving work – so if it was just a donation 
there would be no need to hide it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR WHITE:  But the problem with this donation is it was actually linked 
to irregularly being awarded a contract for some R50 million. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja but the point is if it was a genuine donation, 
a bona fide donation then there was nothing to hide.  You hide it if you 
feel that it is wrong because it is connected with what you have just 
got. 
MR WHITE:  Chair I agree and also if it was a genuine donation you 
would expect it be recorded as such. But also pay it to the entity you 
donating to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WHITE:  You would not pay via… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes attorneys who sent you… 
20 
MR WHITE:  Trust accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who send you an invoice that says it is for legal 
services.  Well maybe he will be able to explain or some of the 
implicated persons will be able to explain some of things that do not 
seem to make sense at this stage.  Thank you. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 155 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Mr White if you can just remind the Chair 
at this stage what was Mr Mabuyakhulu’s position in the ANC? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why – why is it difficult to say Mabuyakhulu?  It is so 
simple. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I know Chair you know unfortunately 
and it is a mark of our past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but because I am sure all of you if I say Honolulu 
you will say Honolulu.  So why can you not say Mabuyakhulu? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  My – very, very sadly it is – there – it is 
inexplicable but I find it terribly difficult to get my – myself around a lot 
10 
of the words and even the spelling because I never learnt an African 
language and it is a – it is a travesty and I am terribly embarrassed by 
it and every time I have to say a name I am blushing inside and feeling 
terribly shy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I can – I can understand – I can understand 
when it comes to certain words but I just see Mabuyakhulu as so easy.  
And also the only – the only alphabet you seem to have a problem 
pronouncing is U.  This is not like certain names and surnames that 
could really be seen as difficult.  It is U – U – Honolulu, Mabuyakhulu. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I know.  That is a cause of huge 
20 
embarrassment to me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It really is.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV 
SUSAN 
WENTZEL: 
 And 
actually 
humiliation 
more 
than 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 156 of 158 
 
embarrassment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can tell you I – I have names that I struggle 
that are not my – in my language – my language myself you know but I 
– all – the only point I am making here is I was trying to understand 
because it seems to me that it should be easy. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise I do accept that when it is not your 
language there could be names that you cannot – you can struggle to 
pronounce.  You know it happens with me in regard to languages that I 
– I do not – are not my own.  Yes but that is fine.  Let us continue. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What was Mr Mabuyakhulu’s – I hope it was 
slightly better?  
CHAIRPERSON:  I give up. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What was his position in the ANC? 
MR WHITE:  Chair Mr Mabuyakhulu’s position… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was much better. 
MR WHITE:  Positon – he was the Provincial Treasury in KwaZulu 
Natal. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was his position in the Department? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair his political position was – he was not in the 
20 
administration but he was the MEC of Traditional Affairs and Local 
Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was the political head of the department. 
MR WHITE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was his involvement in this 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 157 of 158 
 
contract? 
MR WHITE:  So Chair he was – a number of the documents passed his 
desk for want of a better word in the lead up.  So I have referred to 
documents relating to the transfer of the money from the Poverty 
Alleviation Fund. That there were memoranda prepared that amongst 
others came to him.  So he knew that the project was happening.  He 
was also – he opened it when the first one was installed.  So it is not 
that he did not know about Intaka and what it was about.  So ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I have now if we have regard to the 
10 
diagram at Annexure TSW19 dealt with the one side of the investigation 
and that is into the procurement of the water purification plants by the 
Department of Traditional Affairs and Local Government.  The other 
side of the investigation involved the procurement by the Department of 
Health in KwaZulu Natal for both water purification plants. I find 
difficulties with some English words and also with oxygen self-
generating oxygen plants and some dialysis machines. Chair it is four 
o’clock and I am going to need some time to also explain those 
transactions.  Would it be an appropriate time to take an adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long do you think – do you estimate we might 
20 
need to finish with Mr White? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I am hoping to finish his evidence by 
lunch time tomorrow and then the afternoon the two remaining 
witnesses should be short.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 JANUARY 2020 – DAY 202 
 
Page 158 of 158 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I do not believe they should be more than an 
hour each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay alright.  Mr White I take it that you were 
warned that you could be in that seat for two and a half days? 
MR WHITE:  I was Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Alright.  We are going to adjourn for the day and 
we will start at ten o’clock tomorrow. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.
