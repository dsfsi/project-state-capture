PROCEEDINGS ON 29 MAY 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I am told the technicians could not get 
things sorted out in time for us.  I hope they will check them much 
earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We hope so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we are not delayed in starting. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the future.  Okay let us – let us continue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we have taken the 
liberty of pulling out your volumes 3 and 1 because they are the next 
volumes we will dealing with.  We hope that we will save you the time 
of searching for the volumes behind you.  Mr Sedumedi when we parted 
yesterday we had – we were on slide 53.  We had dealt with the RFP 
and you gave context to what you are about to talk about next.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You recall that we considered the provisions 
20 
of the RFP and in particular spoke about the notion of break pricing. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the lever arch file that we were using yesterday 
we do not need this morning? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 3 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No that is Volume 2.  We parted on Volume 2 
which contains the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi has highlighted those aspects of 
the RFP that are relevant to this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got only Volumes 1 and 3 on my desk. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes and it is because we now move onto 
Volume 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh we are done with the other ones? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are done with two for now. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is what I was asking. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So I was just recapping. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  From yesterday that in considering Volume 2 
we looked at the terms of the RFP and the conditions of – of 
engagement of bidding.  And we parted on this 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the understanding that bidders were aware 
20 
before they submitted their bids that Transnet reserved unto itself the 
right to reduce the number of locomotives to change the timeframe 
within which they must be delivered before contracting. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that for that none of the bidders would 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 4 of 235 
 
penalise Transnet by way of increasing the price per locomotive? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We then considered the situation – the rights 
reserved by Transnet for itself post contracting which introduces the 
notion of break pricing should after contracting Transnet decide to 
terminate the contracts before all locomotives have been acquired there 
shall be a break price that is attached – that would be payable by 
Transnet as a consequence of that decision. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we have put that to the side.  You now 
10 
have slide 53 which is annexed and it is titled Batch Pricing.  Could you 
take the Chair firstly through the notion of batch pricing?  Where it 
derives from and what your slide 53 communicates to him? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thanks.  The phrase batch 
pricing does not necessarily appear anywhere in the RFP document.  
The concept arose during one of the negotiations.  Secondly on the 
memorandum that the then GCE Mr Brian Molefe submitted to the board 
accounting for an increase in the ATC.  There was a cost element of 
R2.7 billion which was associated with what was called on that 
memorandum batch pricing.  However when now one especially in the 
20 
context of what Advocate Sello has spoken about wanted to reconstruct 
what could this batch pricing be?  You could directly infer to the 
paragraph on 3.1 in the RFP that speaks about the fact that Transnet 
does not expect to pay a price premium should it decide to reduce 
quantities of the locomotives.  So that is the only time when the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 5 of 235 
 
concept of batch pricing arises.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But then our understanding through you 
yesterday is should Transnet so decide or should Transnet split the 
award amongst various bidders there would not be a price attached to 
that decision? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So now you are saying that the price that was 
imposed or the penalty imposed on Transnet for doing precisely that 
which is to split the award amongst different bidders gave rise to what 
is called batch pricing? 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But it does not help us to go into the RFP to 
try and understand what batch pricing is because RFP does not 
contemplate such a notion? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It does not contemplate such a 
notion that is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You say it arose during negotiations. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you take us through then the detail of 
that? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.  Chair the on the slide 
there that table that appears on the slide is a replica of a document 
that appears on Volume 3 page 5147.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is it necessary to go there or at least for the 
record you have confirmed that you uplifted it directly from that page. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 6 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  Yes but we need not 
necessarily have to go to there but there is another one on 5148 which 
we did not reproduce.  But maybe let us just take the Chair through this 
specific one.  It will be found on page 5148 of the – 5147. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The – in terms of the PPM 
because the PPM did contemplate that parties may embark on a post 
tender negotiations.  So the PPM expects that one there must be a 
team that must be set up and all members of the team must have sort 
of a consensus or a common approach or a mandate on negotiating 
10 
various items that will form part of the negotiations.  And as well they 
must seek approval from the board that indeed they can go and 
negotiate all those items.  And we know as a matter of fact that indeed 
on this one there was a board submission that was prepared to get 
permission to go and negotiate.  Now this document is a sheet titled 
Negotiation Baseline Worksheet.  And it says Price.  So there were 
different elements on price albeit that must be negotiated.  Now on this 
issue it does say what is the negotiation point?  It says batch pricing.  
This document comes from Transnet itself.  Produced at that time of the 
negotiations albeit it is written draft it is – I must indicate because we 
20 
talk about what is the relevance of that aspect.  Then it says next item 
current offer.  They typed in price changes based upon quantity 
ordered.  It means this now what the drafter of this document is telling 
the negotiation team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think I must go to what you are looking at 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 7 of 235 
 
because I think you may be looking at Volume 3? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 3, 5147 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  5147? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is at 5147 is replicated on the slide. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I just picked up now Advocate 
Mahlape? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Sir. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That this specific one – the other 
10 
ones have been attached but I think on my bundle I do not have the one 
that speaks to break pricing. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I think but we can use that one 
on the slide. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought some of the things you were reading I 
could not see on the slide that is why. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No they are on the slide Chair.  
Slide 53. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh maybe this one that I was looking at.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay on slide if you repeat? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not got something to show us exactly where 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 8 of 235 
 
it is? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We tried that Chair and… 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Let us see if it does not allow my 
point. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes I understand there is something about 
white light. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the pointer will not be able to work on the 
screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright well you can just do the best you can. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay, okay.  On the top Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To tell me.  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the top Chair the title says 
Negotiations base worksheet 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And it… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So before we go on.  You stated that there 
were a number of these worksheets? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Dealing with different topics? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Different topics as it is apparent 
from page  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  5148 you indicated. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 9 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  51 yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So these – did these worksheets reflect 
Transnet’s agreed to negotiating position? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  Can you just clarify that 
aspect Chair because these documents we received them from Transnet 
when we were conducting our investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And obviously as well when we 
had interviews with Mr Jiyani amongst others he confirmed that indeed 
people had mandates.  But it turned out later after our – the [indistinct] 
10 
report that this as Mr Jiyani said was just a draft document to guide the 
team.  In our interview as well with Mr Laher and he confirmed in 
written that this is the only document that was provided to them to 
guide them in negotiations.  So it is then now we know this was the 
document albeit being written in draft on a document but it was at least 
the document that was used as a guide to those who were negotiating. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So as far as these negotiating 
worksheets are concerned you would like us now to consider the 
worksheet dealing with batch pricing? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The one dealing with batch 
20 
pricing. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is what we have at your slide 53 
Volume 3 page 5147. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then you can take us through the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 10 of 235 
 
detail? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.  So you will see on that 
one [indistinct] negotiation point.  The  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In the first column. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The first column. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the left negotiation point and 
on the right it says batch pricing.  So that is – now we know this 
specific worksheet deals with batch pricing and it then stipulates… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And negotiation point basically means negotiation 
10 
item which it is not? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And [indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:  A point where they stand on a particular issue it is 
just a negotiation item. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  It is a negotiation item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I think that is the better 
phraseology. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is a negotiation item.  And the 
current offer because now this reflects what is on offer.  It says price 
changes based upon quantity ordered.  Right? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now on that price – current offer it is what is 
offered 
by 
the 
bidders? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 11 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is what the document 
signifies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now the negotiation issues.  So 
what is it that you must negotiate?  The drafter of this document says?  
The price remains fixed as if order is placed for full 599 or for 599 for 
the electric or 465 for the diesel.  So now we know this is what their 
team must note.  Now what is important Chair is the comment – the 
column after comments.  It gives the team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well just to go back negotiation issues.  I know we 
10 
said negotiation item earlier on.  Now they say negotiation issues.  But 
actually do they not mean Transnet’s negotiation point there to say this 
is where we are, we stand, this is our position? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct.  I think – Chair 
you are quite correct that is how we understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The issue to say this is the 
position that Transnet adopts… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On this particular item. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Item exactly. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Being batch pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is how all these 
worksheets must be understood. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 12 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  They just got their terms mixed up a bit. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now after comments it is blank.  
The terms at the bottom it gives ranges.  What is the most desirable 
outcome?  Was a list acceptable agreement and what is the target 
agreement if you go from first, second and third column?  Because 
remember this is a negotiation so it might be and this point will come 
more clearer if you look at other points to indicate the ranges to say 
what is the most desirable outcome?  What is the most least acceptable 
10 
agreement and what is the target agreement?  You will see on this one 
under all items it is remove batch pricing.  So the most desirable 
outcome remove batch pricing.  The least acceptable agreement 
remove batch pricing.  Target agreement remove batch pricing.  There 
is no change in terms of what is the scope that you give to the team?  
And this is consistent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think what is – what gives rise to confusion is 
the dividing line between the horizontal column where you have most 
desirable outcome.  Least acceptable agreement and target agreement.  
20 
The dividing line creates the impression that where it says remove 
batch pricing is – enjoys the same status as comments, negotiation 
issues, current offer whereas from what you are saying it seems to me 
that that dividing line should not be there and remove batch pricing, 
remove batch pricing, remove batch pricing under different headings all 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 13 of 235 
 
falls under the column that has most desirable outcome. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What it – it means is that the most desirable outcome 
is the removal of batch pricing. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct because that [indistinct] 
is grey, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And least acceptable agreement but that does make 
sense or does it? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair may I? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If we go to Volume 3 page 5147. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What you have at slide 53 is an attempt to 
uplift that table in its entirety.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I think perhaps technology got the better of 
Mr Sedumedi and did not quite work out.  It is better understandable at 
5147 and the Chair can see the various option – outcome options that 
are considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the position adopted by Transnet in each 
instance which is remove batch pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  But in – in my – on my 5147 there is no 
remove batch pricing under most desirable, is that right? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am at  
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 14 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At 5147 are we on the same page? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Apologies Chair.  You swopped it around it is 
5148. 
CHAIRPERSON:  5148. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  5148. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Batch pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was only told of … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I apologise I only noticed when the Chair 
draws that to my attention.  So what we have on slide 53 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is what appears at 5148. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – it is much better. Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – ja it is – one understands it much better. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I – on this one I am going to do something on 
this line that will make sure three months from now if I look at this page 
I will understand it the way I should understand it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  5148 Volume – yes Chair. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but I wanted to say – I wanted to say – saying 
least acceptable agreement remove batch pricing and also having that 
as the most desirable did not seem to make sense to me. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  You see Chair because I 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 15 of 235 
 
think if you understand these – this was a template. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This was a template he did not 
customise the template for every – for each item but we adopted a 
same template all [indistinct] changing was the – the mandate that they 
seek.  So the – all the worksheets the headings most [indistinct] they 
appear as they are but I think the message that was being put across 
here is that under all circumstances the position was just view one.  
There is no variance on the position remove batch pricing so they just 
put in under all three items remove batch pricing.  They were consistent 
10 
at least in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON: Well I – You know I thought that what they meant was 
their most desirable outcome is remove batch pricing but that they will 
not or maybe I expected that they would not accept batch pricing under 
any circumstances. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that cannot be correct because they say, list 
acceptable.  So it still – which means it is still acceptable.  So list 
acceptable can only as I under – It can only mean we can live with it 
but we do not want it.  So but that is why it is still acceptable but we 
20 
will take it and we will be – we will take it grudgingly you know whereas 
my expectation was that they would say, there is no way we are going 
to take batch pricing so remove it.  That was my expectation but my 
reading of list acceptable agreement I do not know whether you have 
the same understanding is we can agree to it but we rally will be 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 16 of 235 
 
complaining. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But Chair if you look at what is 
the outcome that they want under the list of acceptable agreement is 
remove batch pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it is… 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is an unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON: They do not say we do not want it altogether under 
any circumstances.  You understand? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I follow what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like it is their bottom line. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Their bottom line is remove batch 
pricing because you will recall Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe is bottom line the correct word maybe it is 
not the correct word. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair may I perhaps see if we can try and 
understand that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With reference to another page? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have 5147. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you will get 5147 as an 
example Chair.  Which was a for one to understand the context of how 
they use the sheets. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then if we compare the two. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 17 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair will see that in the shaded areas 
and the – and what is typed in italics that appears to be the form – the 
manner in which the form comes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is typed in normal font is a response to 
the respective issues.  So if – it would appear that every worksheet 
must indicate a position for the most desirable outcome, least desirable 
and the target agreement.  So when one looks at 5147 the Chair 
realises the responses are different.  At 5147 the most desirable 
10 
outcome is no compensation for loss in profits only 50% of related 
[indistinct] costs paid for.  The second then column says well if we 
cannot get the most desirable outcome what is the worst case position 
we can live with and that now says break pricing as offered by bidders.  
So there is a difference there.  When we got to 5148 our understanding 
what is sought to be communicated is under any scenario we will not 
accept batch pricing.  So even if you come out in the least – with the 
least acceptable agreement it should not provide for batch pricing.  
Could have been better, could have communicated the point better 
admittedly but in reading these worksheets that is the interpretation I 
20 
think Mr Sedumedi led us to understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see my understanding is that what this document 
sought to do is to give Transnet’s negotiating team their mandate. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For negotiation.  Now when you give somebody a 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 18 of 235 
 
mandate for negotiation you give them your first price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might give them your second price, that price but 
one of the things you do is what the bottom line is and your bottom line 
might be if they are not prepared to for example remove this item there 
will be no agreement.  Okay? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is one position.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Another position is you say to your negotiation team 
10 
this is my first price, this is my second price, this is my third price go 
and do the best you can but you know we cannot afford not to have an 
agreement with these people.  I really do not like – I will not be happy 
if they do not agree to my first price, my second price, my third price 
but rather than have no agreement with them I will take this but I will 
be very unhappy. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will still have an agreement but I will be very 
unhappy.  Now where it says least acceptable agreement it seems to 
me to be saying.  I – we will still have – we will still accept an 
20 
agreement that has got this but it is – it is the last – it is the – it is 
something that we will really take with – we will really be complaining 
we do not want it.  It is just that the alternative of not having an 
agreement is something we cannot afford.  So that is my understanding 
as opposed to saying if they insist on batch pricing there will not be an 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 19 of 235 
 
agreement.  That is different.  I do not understand that to be what is 
communicated by least acceptable price or agreement.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it may be that when one reads other documents 
then maybe reads them together one can come to a different 
understanding. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I guess it will depend and we will see if Mr 
Sedumedi can assist us with that.  Whether reference let us say to 
least acceptable agreement relates to the point under consideration or 
negotiation or relates to the agreement as a whole.  Because if it 
10 
relates to an agreement as a whole then this page would communicate 
in my view that when it comes to batch pricing even the least 
acceptable agreement will not have batch pricing.  The last column 
says target agreement.  What are we targeting agreement to look like in 
respect of all the various points under negotiation and insofar as batch 
pricing is concerned is the target is the agreement should not have 
batch pricing.  So I say it depends what – whether agreement refers to 
agreement on the point or agreement as a document the contract to be 
concluded. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe you are in a position to say what you 
understanding was or what your understanding is of what is being 
communicated here without what you may have been told during the 
investigation but you may have – this may have been clarified during 
the negotiations by relevant people and at Transnet to say this is what 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 20 of 235 
 
we were communicating whether or not we succeeded in articulating it 
might be another matter. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But maybe let us address in two 
fronts Chair.  At least this document on the face of it before the 
negotiations were completed it at least confirms that Transnet at its 
early stage at least they were still in [indistinct] the reason they put up 
this is – this was informed by the position in the RFP document but 
Transnet does not expect to pay a price premium should there be any 
reduction in the quantities.  And that as we can see on that item like 
the Chair correctly said should be a negotiating – negotiation position 
10 
but the price must remain fixed as if the order is placed for the full 500 
[indistinct].  So that is consistent with the provisions of the RFP.  Now 
Advocate Sello had said the items on the most desirable let us compare 
it with break pricing.  On page – and any other one for that matter.  It is 
– can break pricing or any of the sheets that Chair can look at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the break pricing now?   You know we 
have got batch pricing now break pricing? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay you recall Chair yesterday 
when we… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi I apologise.  Chair you asked if 
20 
we had done with Volume 2? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Perhaps it might be appropriate to got to 
Volume 2 because break pricing at least is specifically dealt with there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay I just want to understand. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 21 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then Volume 2 and I will give you a page 
and then Mr Sedumedi can contrast break pricing and batch pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 2 Chair.  Page 4552. 
CHAIRPERSON:  455? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  4552 it starts and overleaf there are two 
bullet points.  The second bullet point specifically relating to break 
pricing is at 4553 at the top of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So perhaps the Chair can read that and then 
10 
Mr Sedumedi will try to distinguish that batch pricing from break 
pricing. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So break pricing envisage the 
situation we are at during the seven year (indistinct) that the OEMs will 
deliver the locomotives over a seven year period which is why the RFP 
then made provision for the table … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  For the bidders to indicate in the 
event that Transnet opts to terminate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The agreement at different stages.  
What would be the price of a locomotive for each of the three points …? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 22 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If I can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Use that phrase.  Now those prices 
as per the diagram there it says that must be called break pricing 
because if you look at the column at the – on that table – as an 
example Chair this is a (indistinct) schedule in batches.  It indicates 
different delivery periods and they inserted a different number of 
locomotives per period and they are expecting the bidders not to 
indicate what will be their break price. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  For a particular batch for a particular period? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That that is – that is the break price? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the break – that is the break 
price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can I – can I interrogate that a bit?  Is it a 
particular price for the particular batch or is it my pricing is based on a 
seven year delivery per locomotive and if after contracting you then 
reduce the quantities because I would have put up my production line 
20 
to produce – let us say 599?  I will have certain sunken costs in the 
first year that I was hoping would get (indistinct) I will recover over 
seven years but then if you bring it forward then I might be saddled 
with certain costs. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 23 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That I am not able to recover.  If that were to 
happen you agree that if according to my bid I had given you R100 per 
locomotive in the first – the first year and R120 in the second year over 
a seven year period.  If you break that – the contract in the third year I 
go back and revise my price for the first year.  It is no longer R100.  It 
is R150.  That is the break pricing as  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the break price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As I understand from the document. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was that your understanding as well? 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is my understanding as well … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be the price that would have been 
originally given plus whatever extra costs may the bidder would 
otherwise suffer as a result of no longer having to deliver over a seven 
year period? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And that would happen after the 
20 
contract has already been concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This could only arise … 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 24 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In a post contract award stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It can be before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three years four years? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then we go to batch pricing now.  We 
need to contrast batch pricing with that one. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  So on page 5147 Chair a 
similar template but this time the negotiation item – not the point – I 
just spoke of a – the negotiation item is break pricing, right.  Reduce 
risk and cost under (indistinct) and the current offer is a price due to 
(indistinct).  So that tells you there is a bridge of a contract that has 
been already concluded by Transnet and the OEM.  Now what is a 
negotiation stance?  It says: 
“The price remains fixed.  No risk of additional cost 
to Transnet.” 
But then again just like in batch pricing - the same table as you can 
20 
see Chair.  I am using the very same template.  What is the most 
desirable outcome? 
“The least acceptable agreement and a target 
agreement.” 
Now you see on this one the most desirable outcome that Transnet will 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 25 of 235 
 
desire – would like to have is no compensation for loss in profits only 
50 percent of the related sunken – related sum costs paid for.  Now 
what will be our – the least acceptable.  If you say you have now been 
able to achieve that which we desire is to – it says break pricing as 
offered by the bidders.  So you see now that is now an example that I 
just spoke about to say there is this range that is being offered to the 
team to say this is our target but in the event that you are not able to 
reach that target at least then accept – if you say you have lost on this 
point is when you have accepted the break pricing as currently offered 
by the bidders.  Now contracts distinguish that with batch pricing.  On 
10 
batch pricing if you use the same table the most desirable outcome is 
to remove batch pricing.  The second option if you say you have lost 
still remove batch pricing.  So therefore on this point it is not an option 
for you to accept the batch pricing as offered by the bidders.  Thou 
shall not accept batch pricing.  As to whether that will (indistinct) that 
is another issue all together.  The bidder will try to demonstrate on its 
own is that at least that demonstrates that this draft document is 
consistent with what the RFP had already envisaged.  So the drafters 
were quite alive to the fact that the mandate as per the FRP is that 
Transnet should not pay a price premium as a result of reduction in the 
20 
quantity of the locomotives that are delivered. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before contract conclusion? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
Before 
the 
contract 
is 
been 
concluded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 26 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At 54 – at page 5147 least acceptable agreement 
break pricing as offered by bidders.  What do you say that – that 
means? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It means – remember if you compare 
with – you recall Chair on that table that we spoke about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to say please do not compare it for now.  We 
can compare it later (intervenes). 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No, no I am not comparing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your under – ja just (intervenes). 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  My – my understanding … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Is this but in the bid documents … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Are submissions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In response to that table that we read 
earlier on.  The bidders have indicated that their prices would be for 
different stages … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of Transnet breaking the contract.  
20 
So there is – there are figures on the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So the least acceptable means then 
accept that which the bidders have offered when they submitted their 
bids. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 27 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see that is my own understanding … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To on that point … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is why when you go to the slide at 53 I was 
saying there seems to be a contradiction between saying – when you 
say the least acceptable agreement is remove batch pricing because 
least acceptable seems you will accept – it seems to say you will 
accept grudgingly but you are saying remove.  So – so – but I think – I 
think irrespective of what the wording is maybe one should understand 
10 
it to be that they actually did not want batch pricing at all. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where they might just not have articulated that 
properly because maybe – maybe in regard to batch pricing the heading 
should have been unacceptable agreements – you know – so if you 
come back to us and say we must accept batch pricing that is 
unacceptable.  So we will not accept that – you know – because I think 
that is what it seems they were trying to convey but when you say least 
– when you say least acceptable under 5147 … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the understanding that you give that – that I can 
understand. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess that what you are saying is when it comes 
to batch pricing your understanding was simply what they were saying 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 28 of 235 
 
that will be unacceptable to have batch pricing. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to – was that to the extent that if batch pricing 
was insisted upon by the bidders there would rather be no agreement? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At least on – on this point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There can now be an agreement.  
Now one would have expected the team to have done then in the event 
10 
as it – as it turned out obviously there was a push back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On this item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SDUMEDI:  It now speaks to how then do we 
depart from the provisions of the RFP … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At this point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because when the bid was advertised 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It was made clear to all the bidders 
that we reserve the right to – these awards between more OEMs the 
effect of which will obviously lead to a reduction in quantities and in 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 29 of 235 
 
that same table on page 4552 of volume 2 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Transnet said it does not expect to 
pay a price premium should there be – should it – it has an option of 
changing qualities.  So that is what was pronounced in the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I am not sure what they – what they had in 
mind but surely if we have an agreement over a seven year period and 
that agreement entails that from year one - I mean - over seven years 
that from year one or year two or whatever I may start incurring certain 
costs on the basis that I have a seven year agreement with you. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I do not incur those costs in the second year or 
third year I will not be able to deliver in the fourth year or fifth year. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I – if I incur certain costs in order to ensure that I 
perform later on in terms of the contract and then you change the – the 
duration of the contract it seems that – you know – that should affect – 
you should pay something because I am obliged if I want to make sure 
that I perform in terms of the contract in the fifth year or sixth year or 
seventh year.  If I am obliged to spend money much earlier but that 
20 
those costs I would otherwise not recover if you change your mind and 
you terminate on the third year fourth year.  It seems fair that you 
should – you should compensate me.  So – so I do not know whether 
they - they meant that they did not want to pay even that or they simply 
meant to say we – we do not want you to change the price in terms of 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 30 of 235 
 
getting income.  At the expenses one would think they should be paid 
for. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Mr Chair that which you have 
explained … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Is break pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  That is break pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is break pricing? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is break … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is acceptable? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is acceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is why if you look at page 5147 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It does say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That this is what - at least if you 
negotiate the most desirable is for us only to be liable for 50 percent … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the sum costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That one (indistinct) was quite alive 
to that. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 31 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So batch pricing would be something else? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Batch pricing is something else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We say before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We even conclude the contract … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I am telling you now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But you might not get the full 599 or 
10 
465.  So know now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Before we even conclude contract at 
this bidding stage you must know now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That you are not going to get the full 
599 and you must know that if I decide before award to reduce these 
quantities I do not expect you – I do not expect as Transnet … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  to pay a premium for that.  So that is 
20 
a pre … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Contract conclusion position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 32 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The break pricing – like the Chair has 
correctly outlined … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Could – those costs could only arise 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  During the course … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is the distinction between … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Batch pricing and break pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well the – over – over the – the seven year 
period there would be a change in prices for everything just generally.  
So the components which you would use in order to build the 
locomotives – you know – the components would become more 
expensive each year – you know – 10 percent higher.  I would imagine 
that that was built – would have been built into the price? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what more would they have wanted if they had 
built that into the price? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What more would the bidders have wanted really if 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 33 of 235 
 
they would have built that into the price?  I am trying to see whether 
during your investigation you got to understand what it is that they 
would otherwise have been wanting if they had built in the annual 
increases that would have occurred. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because Chair (indistinct) those are 
the usual effect that even in this conversation when you speak about 
escalations and hedging … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
That 
is 
where 
things 
like 
(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Those (intervenes). 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Into the price to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Look into the duration of the delivery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So all those costs would have been 
effected in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As well them been aware that 
Transnet is not willing to pay a price premium … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  For a reduction in quantity. So that 
has already made the offer at the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They would have taken that aspect … 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 34 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Into account as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it is this premium that I am trying to 
understand what – what it is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They call it a premium.  It is a penalty really 
in effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a penalty. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if you put out a bid for 599 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I then split that award before four OEMs 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It means each OEM which individually had bid 
for 599 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ends up with less.  Let us say 200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  None of them is going to increase the price of 
the locomotives because now they have got 200 instead of 599. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the – what we call premium penalty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Penalty explains it better. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The language – we are losing the language of 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 35 of 235 
 
the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you.  Let us – let us continue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So then we understand and – and your 
understanding of the position adopted by Transnet in negotiations 
regarding batch pricing is important because that goes to certain 
findings you make? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if you could just very briefly wrap up your 
understanding and then inform the Chair what the eventual position was 
as regards the batch pricing. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Right Chair.  At the beginning of this 
letter I had said the – one of the cost elements that were indicated by 
Mr Brian Molefe in his memorandum to the Board on why the price 
increased from the approved 38 billion to 49 (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  38 billion to 49 billion? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
There 
are 
various 
costs 
that 
contributed towards that increase and an amount of 2.17 billion was 
dedicated only to batch pricing and he does even put an explanation 
20 
there that this is an adjustment of the price as a result of Transnet now 
having split the bids amongst the four OEMs.  So as a result of that 
decision these are costs that is attributable to that item and the total 
amount of that is 2.7 billion.  So we are saying in carrying of that cost 
was contrary to the provisions of the RFP and it was thus irregular 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 36 of 235 
 
under the circumstances.  So that is the point that we wanted to 
demonstrate on this issue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just for the record.  In that same response 
you said it was a cost of 2.17 billion. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then you said 2.7 billion.  Can you correct?  
What is the final number? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is 2.7 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You had said 17 at some point.  I just 
wanted to make sure that we are on the same page.  Okay.  Then that 
10 
deals with your slide 3 which is now for the first time we see an 
introduction of a particular cost that was not contemplated in the RFP 
and it – at least the first addition to the original 38.6 billion approved 
by the Board has now increased by 2.7 billion on the basis of this.  Is 
that correct? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is – is the position that the negotiation team was 
given this mandate which on your understanding meant that they should 
not agree to batch pricing but ultimately they did agree to it or what 
happened? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ultimately they did agree to it which 
is why Mr Molefe had in his explanation to the Board he itemises the 
issues that contributed to the increase in the batch price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do – do we know why they agreed to it in 
circumstances where their mandate did not include agreeing to it? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 37 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  Yes Chair.  I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or am I making you to jump to … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No, I will provide an explanation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To the Chair because obviously after 
we – you recall Chair at the beginning of our testimony yesterday we 
said the – the reports were made available to all the persons who were 
implicated in the reports.  So we got various responses.  We will start 
first with Mr Jiyane and Mr Laher.  One, they conflated batch 
pricing/break pricing.  In their response they are saying no look at the 
10 
RFP break pricing was envisaged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Break pricing? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Break.  So in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, break ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In responding to an allegation that 
the RFP did not envisage batch pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They respond about break pricing? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The respond about break pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So they conflate the cost of break 
20 
pricing and batch pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But these were senior people who should have known 
the difference quite well in their own organisation.  I know that you 
might … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I – I concur. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 38 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not be able to say anything. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
Well 
I 
fully 
share 
the 
same 
sentiments Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I think that is - which is why in our 
report we made that point.  Secondly Mr Laher … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so in other words they - they said what is wrong 
with you people.  There was nothing wrong that was done here.  We – 
you know – what was done was envisaged by the RFP. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The RFP, correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were talking about break – break pricing. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They were talking about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Break pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – but I guess that your team would have said but 
that is something else and then what was their explanation when they 
were confronted with the different – with the two meanings of the two 
concepts? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This is what Mr Laher says in writing.  
We have in our report as well attached a copy of the subsequent email 
20 
correspondence with Mr Yousuf Laher. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You – sorry.  You may provide Chair with a 
summary of that response.  We will try and locate it (intervenes). 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later on. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 39 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I still know it vividly.  He says this 
draft document should have been updated because it was now clear 
after the split that the OEMs were not going to accept to charge a same 
price that we had offered when the full component of 599 was offered.  
So therefore this and the words that he used in that email is that the 
draft document should have been updated to take into account that 
point.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  He had raised the fact that – because 
at this point that is now – that is where now he sees the difference 
10 
between batch pricing and break pricing.  He says but these (indistinct) 
should not have been a correct position that you should have adopted 
because the bidders were putting pressure that they want batch pricing.  
Now secondly we then listen to the - there is a video recording where 
Messieurs Laher and Jiyane were now briefing Mr Anoj Singh on the 
day’s proceedings because probably on a daily basis they would have 
some daily briefings with Mr Singh to report on what transpired during 
the day and this transcript is one of those that will be made to the 
Commission as part of our (indistinct) yesterday.  In this transcript 
when Mr Laher reports on various issues he then says oh batch pricing 
20 
– these OEMs they got – the word that he used - that they nearly fell 
off their chairs when we told them that our position is that we do not 
want batch pricing.  Their offers must not change depending on the 
qualities that are being offered.  So that now indicates that despite 
what the subsequent that he says now that report is out.  At that time 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 40 of 235 
 
when the negotiations had been – that was the position that he adopted 
as a Transnet Official - but then as it is common cause - obviously that 
position was not successfully advanced.  There was a push back from 
the OEMs and eventually they relented.  In actual fact on that same 
transcript Mr Jiyane says look – you know - that is just a wish.  I do not 
think the (indistinct) are going to agree to this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who - who says that? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is Mr Thamsanqa Jiyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now telling … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Anoj Singh? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Telling Mr Laher at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No it is Mr Laher that is reporting on 
that specific item.  So the response that comes from Mr Jiyane is that 
that is a wish use of – I do not think these guys are going to agree to 
that point but at least it confirms a point that the (indistinct) principle 
that at that time when the issue was being discussed.  At least there 
was that understanding that batch pricing is something that Transnet 
does not expect to incur.  All response that we get now is more of 
20 
people trying to justify what had happened at the negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see maybe it – maybe this demonstrates why we 
spent a little bit of time trying – trying to understand what least 
acceptable agreeable means. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 41 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when you give a negotiating team a mandate 
it is important that they should understand what your bottom line is.  
What it is that you say if they do not – the other party does not agree 
to this item. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we will have none – no deal. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where you say look try and get the best you can 
but if you do not get it do not rock the boat.  You must still have an 
agreement that kind of thing but based on what you are saying it 
10 
certainly does appear that Mr Jiyane – at least at that time of that 
meeting when he said that is just a wish - at least he did not 
understand the – Transnet’s position on the batch pricing to be that if 
there is no agreement from the OEMs then there would be no deal at 
all.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair I have just handed a document to – to 
Mr Sedumedi extracting it from the volumes.  It is from volume 1 page 
4318 and I just need Mr Sedumedi to confirm whether that is the email 
he just referred to and gave Chair the context.  This is a response by 
Mr Yousuf Laher to MNS. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As regards this – these issues. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it would appear to go slightly beyond 
what Mr Sedumedi has indicated because Mr Laher justifies the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 42 of 235 
 
inclusion of the batch price on a decision by the Board to include batch 
pricing of 24 January 2014 at that paragraph 1. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair.  If as an example the 
point that I made paragraph 8 which appears on – first this – this email 
from Mr Yousuf Laher dated 14 August 2018 this was now after he had 
received the report addressed to Mr Ndlovu the Chairperson – the 
Chairman of MNS and the item there speaks to the Transnet 1 064 
locomotives.  Now in paragraph 8 of – after he explains his position 
about the role that he played.  He says: 
“I was never given an approved mandate for 
10 
renegotiations.  Only a draft version was provided.” 
This document that he has drafted he now confirms is the document 
that was used. 
“Nevertheless I added in good faith to be the best 
that I could for Transnet.  The draft renegotiation 
mandate is surely incorrect and outdated as the 
Board’s decision to reduce the batch sizes to four 
OEMs instead of two OEMs prior to negotiations 
was not filtered through into the negotiation 
mandate.” 
20 
Now again in his thinking the result of the award being split, which 
eventual that to reduction in quantities necessitated Transnet incurring 
batch pricing but that is not in line with what the RFP envisaged, 
because the RFP was clear, if we split and there’s a reduction in the 
quantities Transnet does not expect to pay the price premium/penalty 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 43 of 235 
 
should that happen. 
 
So this explanation as well does not accord with what is 
contained in the RFP.  He might have very, very good reasons why it 
made economic sense for bidders to penalise Transnet as a result the 
reduction in (indistinct) but that is not what Transnet had actually 
envisaged when it issued that RFP, because the bulk of its email is 
dedicated to explaining that rationale of economies of scale. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But isn’t the, or shouldn’t the position have been that 
you don’t put in a bid if you do not accept that Transnet will not pay 
any premium if they decide to split the tender or the – in other words, if 
10 
in the RFP, included that requirement must the position be that if you 
submit the bidded bid you accept that requirement and if you don’t 
accept that requirement you shouldn’t put in a bid.  Therefore, why was 
Transnet even opening negotiations on an issue like that, when they’ve 
made it clear those that put in a bid must be those who are prepared to 
accept the terms of the RFP, did you get to understand any of this 
during your investigation why they would – they opened discussions 
with the OEM’s on this point. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair the constant thing in our 
reports on charges written to procurement is that tenderers prepared 
20 
their bids (indistinct) accordance with what is contained in the bid 
specifications, an organ of State should not be at liberty to materially 
change the terms of the bid documents during evaluation so that is the 
benchmark that we used to assess every conduct that spoke to changes 
(indistinct).  You’ll recall Chair, even on a 95 BBBEE became a problem 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 44 of 235 
 
during evaluation despite the fact of it being a requirement in the RFP.  
So there seems Chair to have been this approach that we can change 
the rules of the – you see either people are not fully appreciating the 
input of what is contained in the RFP when you’re evaluating or some 
others – one could just not understand on that basis where people just 
feel the need to change the bids.  I mean, even now, during the 
disciplinary proceedings (indistinct) because now one is able to, sort 
of, also get a feel of what went through people’s minds when these 
things happened.  They seemed to be explaining the difficulties that 
they experienced with the RFP and now being creative to (indistinct) 
10 
whatever they’ve conducted they seem to be experiencing without 
appreciating the fact that, that consideration must take place at the 
time when the specs are prepared.  You can’t get those noble 
considerations halfway in the process.  So that’s the issue that, I think 
the procurement team was failing to grasp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you know whether the bids that were put in by 
the bidders in response to the RFP, do you know whether those bids 
contained anything along the lines that we are not – I’m not accepting 
or we’re not accepting this condition or this requirement that there 
should be no premium and that is how the issue came to be the subject 
20 
of negotiation or did the bids not raise that issue at all, it might mean 
they were accepting and if so who introduced this for discussion and 
under what circumstances when the RFP was clear? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the first question Chair, there 
is no bid that expressly stated rejection of the Transnet’s position 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 45 of 235 
 
outhit point.  We know that the bids in this – he OEM’s sorry made 
submissions on bench pricing, as of course, requested by the RFP so 
there’s that part we know but whatever offer that was on the table at 
that stage would have been an offer relating to bench pricing.  As to 
who and how the concept of bench pricing arose Chair, that is not quite 
clear save on this draft worksheet that was produced and as well a 
review of that video material where Mr Lehar was reporting on this 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be interesting to know who introduced it and 
what was their concern because if, for example, it was introduced by 
10 
somebody from within Transnet, you know, one would really want to 
know, why introduce something that’s been accepted because the RFP 
says here is a tender you can bid but these are the conditions and the 
bids come in, they accept that condition, there’s nobody who makes an 
issue of it, so how does it come up and if it is raised by the bidders at 
what stage is it raised and on what justification after they have 
responded positively  to a RFP that makes it clear that this is one of 
the conditions, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes Chair perhaps Mr Sedumedi might assist 
us in that regard. Mr Sedumedi in your investigations were you able to 
20 
determine when the notion of bench pricing first reared its head, were 
you able to trace it to its source and time? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The source and time, on 
investigation, is at a negotiation stage, the proof of how it was 
introduced was this document that we picked up, the draft worksheet 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 46 of 235 
 
that now had a concept called bench pricing.  We did not have sight of 
all – it’s not all the sittings, because we’ve got a couple of recordings 
of the sittings so those that we have reviewed, we could not pick this 
issue out except for that time when Mr Lehar was now reporting back to 
Mr Singh that this issue arose but again, he doesn’t describe who 
would have raised it save for loading and expression (indistinct) when 
you raise this point the OEM’s nearly fell off their chairs, that’s the 
phrase that he used.  Other than that one was not able to really pick up 
who would have initiated the issue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I don’t know if that assists Chair but at least 
10 
we’ve got a sense that …(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Up until negotiations it was not an issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we are able, at some stage to get more particulars 
of the issue that would be helpful but if we don’t that’s okay but I guess 
as – at some stage when we have got some of the people who were 
involved – well the people who were involved in the negotiations should 
know who brought this issue up and why. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the email we referred to – that Mr 
Sedumedi referred to and I gave him a copy and for the record it’s 
20 
volume 14318 from Mr Lehar to MNS at paragraphs 11 and 12 gives us 
a sense of what Mr Lehar’s understanding is and perhaps, Mr 
Sedumedi, you might want to read 11 and 12, although I doubt that it 
will answer the Chair’s issue fully but seeing as this is Mr Lehar’s own 
words who was part of the negotiating team let’s see how much that 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 47 of 235 
 
may assist. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Correct because we never had – 
because at paragraph 11 he just mentions that this was dealt with at 
some sub-committee which one, under what circumstances we are not 
privy to – we don’t even have the minutes of that sub-committee so it’s 
just his version of what might have transpired there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just read that, the Chair doesn’t have it open 
before him. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay, page 11…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paragraph rather. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Sorry paragraph 11 of the email 
reads thus, 
 
“The bench pricing was accepted by the sub-committee of the 
 
steering committee on the basis that the sub-committee or the 
 
steering 
committee 
accepted 
the 
overall 
price 
of 
the 
 
locomotive.  My understanding being that the sub-committee or 
 
the steering committee deemed that they were obtaining value 
 
in other areas of the negotiation e.g. Forex hedging and the 
 
sub-committee or steering committee found the overall price 
 
acceptable.  Then each item being negotiated was accepted on 
20 
 
an overall basis”. 
 
So that is what – in the next paragraph, 
 
“The overall calculation making up the price had to reflect the 
 
reality of what was finally accepted by the sub-committee or 
 
the steering committee which includes an element of bench  
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 48 of 235 
 
 
pricing which contributed towards the price increases.  It was 
 
common knowledge that this had to be included in the 
 
calculations based upon the overall price as accepted by the 
 
sub-committee or the steering committee.  Had the bench 
 
pricing been excluded, it would have been incorrect as it would 
 
have misled the sub-committee or the steering committee of  
 
the actual price.  In order to provide the sub-committee or the 
 
steering committee with the full facts, my calculations had to 
 
include the component pricing for each element of which bench 
 
pricing was one of the elements”.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That Chair, then is Mr Lehar’s explanation of 
ow bench pricing came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I don’t know about the Chair I’m still not quite 
clear even on Mr Lehar’s explanation but that is his own words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, no I’m also still not but I guess that’s the 
best…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   That’s the best that’s available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay let’s proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Thank you, that then brings to an end our 
20 
discussion on the inclusion of bench pricing of 2.7billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to go back to a point, did you say that in the 
increase of the price from 38billion to 49billion how much was the 
percentage that related to bench pricing in rands? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The figure is 2.7billion, that is 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 49 of 235 
 
the amount that is equitable to that …(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  To bench pricing. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To bench pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So part of the point you make is that the request for 
proposals, the tender that was issued made it clear to those who 
wanted to submit bids, that in effect, no bench pricing, if you put it that 
way would be acceptable so whoever put in a bid would have to know 
that, that would not be part of the deal but you say, notwithstanding the 
fact that the request for proposals made that quite clear, Transnet 
ultimately accepted a deal which included bench pricing and that 
10 
increased the price by at least 2billion rand. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they had stuck to what the request for 
proposals had said on this issue that amount would have – would not 
have been incurred. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Chair.  Proceeding with your 
presentation then we’re now at your page 54 and you are expressing 
your views on the lawfulness on the increase and the final estimated 
20 
total cost, can you take us through that. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s right, just as a contexture 
again on this slide, like I said when we spoke about the previous slide, 
here (indistinct) analyse each element, you will recall that there was a 
memorandum that Mr Brian Molefe prepared to the Board, that 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 50 of 235 
 
memorandum was prepared after the conclusion of a contract at a rate 
of 49billion and in that memorandum he lists the various issues that 
caused the increase.  So this afternoon we also hear the evidence now 
on – to test the justifiability or otherwise of those elements.  So in this 
slide we are only focusing ourselves on whether in them increasing the 
original price did they require to comply with the law, was there 
anything for them to get an approval or (indistinct) report this item to 
the Minister.  So the overall conclusion (indistinct) is that, that increase 
of the ETC was unlawful in that it did not comply with applicable, legal 
prescripts and the reason as follows.  You’ll recall that in terms of 
10 
Section 52 (2) (d), if …(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Sorry of the PFMA? 
MR 
TSHIAMO 
MICHAEL 
SEDUMEDI: 
 
Of 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management Act, the – an organ of State or a public entity in this 
regard, before it acquires or dispose of a significant asset, it must 
obtain the approval of its Executive authority.  Now as an entity if now 
you want to consider – the Act does not define what a significant or 
what significant means the (indistinct) regulations it then provides that 
the shareholder Minister and the Board, the Accounting Authority will 
then agree on what constitute significant under the circumstances and 
20 
then provide some methodology as to how you determine that figure.  If 
you look at the (indistinct) that was concluded and that will then be 
reduced in what the PFMA envisaged to be a (indistinct) that is 
concluded on an annual basis in terms of the shareholders compact 
that was concluded with the shareholder Minister, what was considered 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 51 of 235 
 
to be significant was an amount of 3.9billion.  so any transaction to the 
value of 3.9 it must get the approval of the Minister, the Minister must 
keep tabs – that’s the whole scheme of having that oversight over an 
organ of State, you need to be appraised as a Minister as to the 
transactions that this entity is concluding especially if now it reaches 
the amounts as agreed on this particular one.  So that’s what it says on 
the significance and material framework of Transnet.  Now the ETC that 
was…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Mr Sedumedi, I thought you would 
address this, you indicated that – and if I misunderstood you please 
10 
correct me.  Section 54 (2) (d), of the PFMA read with the MOI requires 
that any transaction by Transnet above a certain value requires 
approval not up to 3.9. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not up to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    A transaction of 3.9billion and 
above. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And above? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the one yes. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Anything that falls below that 3.9, 
obviously that’s when they can transact without the necessity of 
obtaining an approval from the Minister. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that’s the context and we all 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 52 of 235 
 
know that these transactions when it was initially concluded, indeed the 
shareholder Minister did approve the amount of 38.9.  Now this 
transaction, the ETC amounted to 49 that is an increase of round about 
15, if my maths…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Over perhaps. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Over its roundabout 15 so that 
tells us that this transaction the Minister, when he approved, he 
approved on a basis that it was 38.9 to an extent that the increase that 
was – that occurred now is way above 39billion.  It is our view that 
Transnet ought to have went back to the Minister to appraise him of the 
10 
increase and obtain his approval in that regard.  So (indistinct) on 
record, you don’t have any record of an application being made to the 
Minister for such an increase.  So this is on a basis that we are saying, 
that aspect, on its own violated the provision of Section54 (2).  We are 
quite aware that in terms of the DOA…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Please indicate what the DOA stands for? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The Delegations Of Authority. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   It indicates that any – in the 
event that the transaction that was approved and the increase, you 
20 
want to vary that by 15% you need to report that transaction to the 
Minister.  So first there’s this compact that speaks of the 3.9billion, 
there’s a Delegation Of Authority (indistinct) document – sorry a 
document agreed to with the Minister that provides that if there’s any 
increase in a transaction that was previously approved if that increase 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 53 of 235 
 
is by 15% you must report that transaction to the Minister.  In this 
instance, even this increase that you speak about far exceeds 15% so it 
was not even reported to the Minister.  So if – when you use the DOA in 
terms of (indistinct) reporting or if you align with the view that they 
were required to obtain an approval based on the compact, neither of 
the two events occurred which is why we are saying this increase was 
not in line with the applicable agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You then make reference in your slide to 
expose factor ratification, would you like to address yourself to that 
briefly? 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Correct yes, it’s common cause, 
like I said this memorandum happened in May…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This memorandum by…(intervention). 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    By Mr Molefe to the Board 
motivating the increase in the ETC. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    The agreements were already 
concluded in April already. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   The same year? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the same year.  So the Board, 
20 
upon being presented with the memorandum by Mr Molefe indeed 
approved that increase.  So it is our view that an ex post facto 
ratification by the Board does not cure that violation of (indistinct) of 
the PFMA or the – its own internal delegation of authority that Transnet 
has provided. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 54 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me check if I understand you correctly, are you 
saying that in terms of Section 54(2) there was an obligation on the 
management of Transnet or on Transnet to seek the approval of the 
Minister once the price had reached 3.9billion? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As soon as the increase in the 
price exceeded at 3.9billion we hold the view that, that would have 
required the triggering of Section 54(2). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you say they didn’t get such approval from the 
Minister but they did get approval from the Board and you say that 
approval from the Board didn’t cure the defect in the sense that – or 
10 
the breach of Section 54(2) in terms of their failure to obtain the 
Minister’s approval, that’s the point you make? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   That’s the point that I’m making 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Is there anything else you 
would like to draw the Chair’s attention to as regards your findings on 
this unlawful increase? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That would be our position 
(indistinct) nothing further Chair. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Mr Sedumedi you may proceed with 
your presentation then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I ask in regard to this point of the failure to 
obtain the Minister’s approval, what was their response to that point, 
the management after they saw that, that’s what you were thinking or 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 55 of 235 
 
that’s what the report was saying? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Even before we – during our 
interview with Mr Siyabonga Gama because this is one of the issues – 
because different persons that we were interviewing had different 
issues that we wanted them to address.  We raised this issue with Mr 
Gama, we said, Mr Gama the increase in the ETC, this is the view that 
– when did you know about the increase, he said, one, I was not part of 
the – I recall Chair at that time Mr Gama was the GCE at Transnet but 
you’ll recall that when this happened he was he was the Chief 
Executive at TFR (indistinct) but this transaction related to his division.  
10 
So by the time when we interviewed him he was already now the GCE 
at Transnet.  We raised this issue, he said he only became aware of 
this increase on that morning when the agreements were already 
concluded in the morning because he alleged that he was not part of 
the negotiations so he only became aware of the increase when the 
agreements were already completed in the morning and at that time 
there was a press conference that was already going to be called by 
the Minister to announce the successful conclusion of this transaction.  
So therefore he was not privy to the amounts, we then asked, should 
you not have – now that you are GEC, should you not have – as 
20 
Transnet that is, have sought the approval of the Minister, he agreed 
with us that indeed we were required as Transnet to obtain that 
approval.  However, at that late stage he was part of the negotiations 
he only learnt that morning, it was only a month later when a 
memorandum was presented by Mr Molefe – Brian Molefe, that he saw 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 56 of 235 
 
what (indistinct) he now was in a better position to understand or be 
appraised of what led to the increase in the ETC and besides by that 
time the horse had already bolted nothing much could have been done.  
That is the position that I know was advanced by the former GCE during 
our investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you never got to hear what Mr Molefe’s position 
is because he was no longer at Transnet at the time when you needed 
comments. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair from my recollection of the 
reports that one perused because I think (indistinct) in response to the 
10 
Werksmans report, the view that was held by Mr Molefe was that there 
was no need for Transnet to obtain further approval from the Minister 
once this was done because he had already obtained the initial 
approval when the 38.9 billion was approved.  But we never had a 
direct [indistinct] anything this is what I am saying is purely based on  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  On the reports 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The reports that I have read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Who was the leader of the negotiation team? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It as Mr Anoj Singh and Mr 
Thamsanqa Jiyani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they give you any comments on this point and if 
so what did they say? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Mr Singh always you will recall 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 57 of 235 
 
Chair was no longer at Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which is why we asked the GCE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This issue because we held the 
view that as the GCE 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Even as a CE of Transnet of TFR 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Was this budget will come from 
10 
his division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So he is the one that ordinarily 
would have approved such costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which is why we had focussed 
our energies on understanding his thought process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because at the end he is the 
person accountable for this transaction at least at the TFR level. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have thought that when you are talking 
such big amounts no deal would be reached without the CEO of is it 
TFR? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is TFR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  TFR and the GCEO having been fully briefed what has 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 58 of 235 
 
happened and with them having said we have satisfied ourselves that 
everything is in order before the negotiating team could go back and 
say okay we have a deal.  You did not get a sense that – that happened 
or you did get the sense or what is the position? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The sense that we got and 
especially as confirmed by the response by Mr Gama is that the 
negotiating team were in different – in some premises because on that 
day the meeting I know it was at some hotel as he mentioned even 
though he could not provide us with the name of the hotel when the 
transaction was concluded.  But from the look of things Mr Brian Molefe 
10 
who at the time the GCE was obviously away of the [indistinct] because 
he Mr Gama, he handed that question to Mr Molefe to say what is the 
final figure Mr Molefe?  Apparantely Mr Molefe said it is on 49 in his 
words he said he was actually shocked by… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Mr Gama? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  He was shocked to hear that 
figure.  In actual fact on that day he was in the company of the 
chairperson of the board Mr [indistinct].  He conferred Mr {indistinct] to 
20 
hear what Mr Brian Molefe is saying we will see how we will deal with 
this issue because at that time [indistinct] when he interviewed him was 
that there was a press conference that was about to happen in a matter 
of minutes and the Minister was also aware of this new amount and now 
they were going to announce that… 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 59 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The deal had been concluded? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes at the time the agreements 
were signed already so it is why… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the agreements had already been signed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There is a press conference to 
announce that we have now successfully concluded the – one of the 
biggest locomotive transaction that is going to have all these benefits 
for the country and so forth and so forth.  So that is the context that we 
understood from Mr Gama at least when we interviewed him on this 
aspect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well certainly I think the – the GCEO you know GCE 
you know should really look at a contract like this before it is signed 
when there are such big amounts involved and certainly also the CEO 
of the unit concerned.  So – but we will hear from them.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  And just to place on record 
the summary of your discussions with Mr Gama in this respect will be 
found in the transcript? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes they are in the transcript 
Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That you will be providing. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Now the Chair. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They have already been 
compiled. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now the Chair – the Chair asked you about Mr 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 60 of 235 
 
Gama’s understanding and the position he took and you provided an 
explanation.  I would like to refer you back to Mr Laher’s email Volume 
1 page 4318 that you dealt with earlier and that would – and I would 
like you to have regard to paragraph 16 because paragraph 16 appears 
to give an indication of an appreciation of the increase in the ETC and 
how that issue was dealt with before the contracts were concluded. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Let me just give you context to – 
let us read the paragraph so – before I give the context. 
10 
“Mr  
CHAIRPERSON:  Please do not forget what the question was? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I – I know the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
1. At some stage I would like somebody to read Section 54 to me at 
some stage. 
2. I would like to know who were members – who were members of 
the negotiating team but that I can be told now or later.   I am 
easy. 
You are ready to read 542 okay just read it ja okay. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The heading of Section 54 is 
Information to be submitted by accounting authorities being the board. 
“Before a public entity concludes any of the following 
transactions the accounting authority for the public 
entity must promptly and in writing inform the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 61 of 235 
 
relevant treasury of the transaction and submit 
relevant 
particulars 
of 
the 
transaction 
to 
its 
executive authority for approval of the transaction.  
It releases various transactions of its nature.  The 
relevant one for this purpose is D being acquisition 
or disposal of a significant asset.” 
So that is what Section 54 2 D reads. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you said there is no definition of 
significant… 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Oh and then if you refer back 
10 
Chair to Regulation 28.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Treasury Regulation 28.3 of the 
PFMA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But just to complete in the act there is no definition? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In the act itself there is no 
definition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And that is explained because 
those will vary from time to time.  For purposes of material [see Section 
20 
55[2]] of the Act and significant [See Section 54[2]] of the Act the 
accounting authority must develop and agree a framework of acceptable 
levels of materiality and significance with the relevant executive 
authority so that will be now an agreed framework between the board 
being the accounting authority and executive authority.   
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 62 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Minister 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And being the Minister 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And you know that this will be on 
an annual basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you go to the [indistinct] this 
aspect will be addressed to say  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  For purposes of this financial 
10 
year  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  These are the assets ex 
[indistinct] of these assets constitute material framework so it is this 
transaction then of this value that must then be reportable.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because in that practice knows 
then they will flash out how then you go about agreeing the framework 
between the Minister and the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes.  So – so each year the executive authority 
20 
and the accounting authority are supposed to agree what – how they 
will understand significant materiality to mean in terms of Section 54[2] 
read with the regulations. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair because the 
guidelines issued by treasury in terms of calculating what is significant 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 63 of 235 
 
and material speaks to the total assets 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So to an extent that there will be 
increase of assets that will require a revision of the actual amounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which is why the committee – 
even though the committee does not necessarily deal only with this 
aspect because there are other issues that are contained in 
10 
shareholder compact but is one of the items in the shareholder compact 
is this aspect – this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say that for the relevant period in this case 
the amount in the increase of the price would – that would trigger that 
provision was 3.9 billion. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  And perhaps for reference 
purposes that shareholder compact is part of the exhibits to be found at 
Volume 3 page 4980 and that will give us the trigger threshold of 3.9 
20 
billion.  Thank you Chair.  Getting back to the questions Mr Sedumedi. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You were going to explain to us or at least 
highlight to us Mr Lehar’s understanding regarding the increase and 
what steps he took. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 64 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  When he realised that the ETC would be 
increased. And you do so with reference to Mr Lehar’s email at page 
4138 volume 1. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  Let me read paragraph 
16 before I provide the context Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   
“Nevertheless I acted in good faith to the best that 
could be done for Transnet and together with Mr 
10 
Danny Smith we advised the GCFO Mr Singh that the 
transaction is exceeding ETC prior to conclusion of 
the contracts.  The GCFO said that he would deal 
with it.” 
The reason Mr Lehar sent us this email is that during our investigation 
we came across a document prepared by him and Mr Danny Smith.  The 
document did not have a date.  It just said April 2013.  2014 my 
apologies.  In that document he was explaining the reasons for the 
increase and saying this increase or this amount that we are about to – 
or this amount that we have now agreed on exceeds the ETC that was 
20 
approved.  We need to get approval from the board.  That is what the 
gist of the memorandum was saying.  Now in our preliminary report that 
he produced in June we had said because we are – at a stage we were 
not yet interviewed Mr Laher.  We said we picked up this document.  
We do not know whether it was prepared before or after the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 65 of 235 
 
negotiations.  So we need to enquire before we take any action against 
Mr Laher we first need to enquire to determine his capability.  We need 
to enquire whether was this done before or after.  So that is this note 
that was in the report which he got.  Which is why now you [indistinct] 
an explanation to us to say no that document which you have accepted 
it was not dated it is in April but we prepared it with Mr Smith prior to 
the conclusion of the contract.  But the CFO Mr Singh had said do not 
submit that document we would – I will deal with the issue of the 
increase.  Which is why in response to this when we now finalised our 
report we then did not make any finding against Mr Laher at least on 
10 
this aspect.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this you – you do – and – I will rephrase.  
As you indicated to the Chair Mr Singh is not one of the people you had 
the benefit to interview? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No we never interviewed Mr 
Singh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Then I – if the Chair is clarified 
on the issue of increase of the ETC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We may proceed with your presentation. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The next part of the presentation 
Chair speaks to you will recall in our mandate we required [indistinct] if 
indeed there was a relationship between Tequesta and CSR.  So in this 
part of the slide we will be focussing on that item.  But before we deal 
with that particular specific agreement it is prudent that we first outline 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 66 of 235 
 
the relationship between Mr Iqbal Sharma and Mr Salim Essa.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this you do because understanding that 
relationship is relevant to the question of the agreement with Tequesta. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In the agreement and the findings 
that you have made around that agreement.  This diagram indicates 
that – we start with a company called Elgasolve on top.  Mr Sharma 
declared Transnet on the 28 February 2013 that he is a – he has 50% 
shareholdership in a company called Elgasolve and he only conduct the 
CIPC record confirms that Mr Salim Essa was a director in that 
company.  So at least now we know the first link that there is a 
10 
business relationship there.  At the bottom it is also… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is a pity I cannot… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay now at the bottom you say is that bottom 
centre, bottom block, box. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. At the top block that says 
Elgasolve. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which I have just spoken about 
now. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Elgasolve owns 80 % shares in a 
company called if you go to your left NADP. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And the directors of NADP is Mr 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 67 of 235 
 
Iqbal Sharma and Mr Essa. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And that is the second link.  In 
turn NADP 20% shares in NADP are held by a company called Essa 
Capital PTY Limited and Mr Iqbal Sharma was a director in Essa 
Capital. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So it is now it confirms that at 
least insofar as Elgasolve, NADP and Essa Capital Mr Sharma and Mr 
Salim Essa have business interests in various – in varying degrees of 
10 
course.  And as well Essa Capital owns a company called VR Laser 
Properties.  Towards your right which is owned by Mr Iqbal Sharma who 
was a director for – sorry he was a director in that company from 9 
December 2012 to 12 October 2015 according to the CIPC records.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I think that is 2013. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes 2013 to 2015. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  VR Laser has leased premises to 
a company called VR Laser Services in which Mr Salim Essa is a 
director.  In turn that VR Laser 79% of its shares are held by Elgasolve 
20 
where at both Mr Salim Essa and Iqbal Sharma have a stake.  So there 
is that relationship that we wanted to at least outline so as to 
understand some of the conclusions that we reach later on in our 
slides. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 68 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In this – slides just outlines the 
role of Mr Iqbal Sharma within Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We know that he was a board 
member in 2010 to 2014.  He was also the chairperson of the BADC.  A 
member of the BADC between 2012 and 2014.  And on 24 January 2014 
this BADC which was chaired by Mr Iqbal Sharma at the time approved 
the award of the 1064 locomotive transaction to Bombardier, CNR and 
CSR.  CNR, CSR and GE.  So we know that at that time when the award 
took place the chairperson of that committee was Mr Iqbal Sharma.   
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So at least that is the context 
that we thought the Chairperson must have as we are proceeding with 
the next slide. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And before you leave that slide I note you 
indicate that based on that decision by BADC. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  BT were allocated 240 electric locomotives, 
CNR 23, CSR diesel, CSR 359 electric and GE 233 diesel.  I note at 
your page 57 at the bottom. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair that is CNR electric let 
me see this should be – [indistinct] because the two are electrics and 
the other two are diesels. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh the 232 awarded to CNR are electric. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 69 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So there is an error there.  So instead of 232 
diesel to CNR it should read 232 electric. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You correct – you sure about that ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  All these corrections that need to be made… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They will be followed by a statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will be [Indistinct].  Ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is just that it is important that this 
10 
correction be noted at this juncture because the number of locomotives 
make their – find their way into the agreement that Mr Sedumedi will be 
dealing with and to avoid confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So 232 becomes? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Electric.  It is wrongly defined in the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As diesel? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As diesel.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is 323 electric locomotives.  We correct 
thus far Mr Sudemedi? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which would mean the CSR 359 are diesel? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no, no.  Are you –  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I am just… 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 70 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Getting it right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it right? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Let me just get that thing right 
Chair.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just getting there.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  359 must be electric Chair.  359 
is electric. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes which is CSR? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Let me just confirm that.  I know 
CSR got … 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay let us do this Mr Sedumedi.  Let us 
proceed Ms Molefe will try – will find the award documents and then we 
can place on record that correction of course to be subsequently 
followed by a statement regarding all the corrections you have made to 
your slides. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So in the interim then let us proceed to your 
page 58.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now on page 58 we deal with the 
business development agreement that we – was concluded between 
20 
CSR and a company called Tequesta.  Tequesta in the – the agreement 
is found in Volume 3 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Page 5149. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And is it necessary for the Chair to 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 71 of 235 
 
have regard to the actual document? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No just not quite but just save to 
note the following key features coming out of that agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Tequesta was represented by Mr 
Salim Essa.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In terms of that agreement it 
confirmed that this agreement is in relation to the 359 electric 
locomotives awarded to CSR. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Secondly it indicates that 
Tequesta will be paid 21% of the contract value between Transnet and 
CSR and 21% is stipulated that as R3 980 916 720.00. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I was able to rehearse the figures 
this time around Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Sedumedi I assume you are just a lawyer not 
a chartered accountant so you may be forgiven.  Yes. 
MR 
TSHIAMO 
MICHAEL 
SEDUMEDI: 
 
And 
agreement 
further 
20 
acknowledge this fact that CSR already paid 3.9% of the contract value 
being R706 707 480,00 to a company called JJT Trading FZE.  And this 
amount which has been paid to JJT is deductible to the fee that is due 
to Tequesta. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the R70 million is deductible for the 3 – 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 72 of 235 
 
from the R3.9 – for the 3 – from the R3 billion due to Tequesta in terms 
of this contract. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Further confirms that Tequesta 
would provide services to CSR during the procurement period.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And there is a clause in that 
agreement that says there is no need for Tequesta to prove the 
services rendered [indistinct] that there is an acknowledgment by CSR 
10 
that it would not have secured the 359 locomotives awarded from 
Transnet had not been for the active efforts of Tequesta.   
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 56 on the slide  at page 56 in that slide you 
gave us a breakdown of the entities – of certain entities in which Mr I 
Sharma and Mr Essa were directors but I may have missed something.  
Did they have any presence in Tequesta? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not Mr Sharma Chair it was Mr – 
only Mr Essa, Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but is that on any page that we have dealt with 
that I might have missed? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay Chair the agreement itself if 
you… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At Volume … 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At Volume… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2 according to your slide page 5149. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 73 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  5149? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that document 5149 starts on 
5149  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It ends on 5167 but I want to 
draw the Chair’s attention to page 5166 which is the signature page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  On page 5156? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  5166. 
CHAIRPERSON:  5166. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  You will note the signed at 
Shinzen on that date for and on behalf of Tequesta name Mr Salim Essa 
designation director and that is also confirmed in Mandarin. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You can confirm that? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I can confirm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Tequesta a company based in China? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not China it is not a South 
African company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how come you did not include that information on 
your slide in – at page 57 – 56 because that is under your discussion of 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 74 of 235 
 
Tequesta is it not? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On page 58. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is on page 58? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair.  The first bullet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ja it says represented by – but of course 
somebody can represent them even if they are not directors so being a 
director would be much more important. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Well so the information that we 
see now on page 58 that there was no need well 1. Tequesta would 
10 
provide services during the procurement period.  Okay.  Then it says: 
“and no need for Tequesta to prove the services rendered save 
and acknowledgement by CSR that it would not have secured 
the 359 locomotives award but for the active efforts of 
Tequesta.” 
That seems to – to have elements that we saw with Homix in some way.  
Homix you – you were telling me that in effect it was difficult to see 
what or it was not you.  It was another witness. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No.  It was not Mr Sedumedi.  I was about to 
say that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is a Neotel transaction yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is why he is wondering about (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And MNS did not investigate that transaction 
Chair. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 75 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was the witness before him. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  No that is fine then.  Then I will not 
say anything to him. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair perhaps can just note … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You gave … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The similarities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You gave evidence immediately after the other 
10 
witness and … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There seems to be some similar features.  Yes, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I guess Chair we are getting to information 
overload stage.  That is understandable.  While we are on 58 you noted 
your – your sub bullet to bullet 2 that the contract makes the point that 
3.9 percent of the contract value and we – are we to understand 
contract value being the contract awarded to CSR? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct for the 359 locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To the value of 706 million had already been 
20 
paid to JJ Trading and that amount is deductible for the fee due to 
Tequesta? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were you able to determine who JJ Trading 
is? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 76 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No we could not because it is not a 
South African company.  So we could not determine who JJ Trading FZE 
was. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were you able to determine why in a contract 
between CSR and Tequesta for a payment of a fee for services provided 
by Tequesta payment to a third party would – would be deductible from 
Tequesta’s fee?  Were you able to establish a relationship between any 
of the two parties in that triad? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We could not say for our own 
(indistinct) loss … 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And draw some conclusions but from 
the look of things it seems as if prior to Tequesta providing this service 
it seems as if JJ Trading would have rendered a similar service prior to 
Tequesta because in actual fact in their agreement it says that in the 
event that JJ Trading claimed this money that is when it will be 
deductible 
from 
this 
fee. 
 
So 
it 
seems 
to 
have 
– 
in 
the 
acknowledgement that there was a prior relationship between CSR 
Hong Kong and JJ Trading on a similar topic. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and the clause you refer to would it be 
20 
to Clause 6.1.1 at page 5158?  I confine myself to the English version.  
I will ignore the Mandarin. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Six … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  1.1. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  That was Clause 6.1.1. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 77 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Appearing on page 5158. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now this clause according to your first 
bullet point is dated 18 May 2015? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The award and the contract concluded 
pursuant thereto was in March 2014? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The award to CSR? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct, yes.  By the time this 
10 
contract was dated and concluded the award had already taken place. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A year previous? You say this is 18 May 2015. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The award is in March 2014. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this contract speaks of services provide – 
to be provided or provided by Tequesta during the procurement period. 
I am trying to reconcile the two dates and I am – I am struggling.  Are 
you able to assist? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is quite a (indistinct).  The - how 
20 
the wording is phrased it is phrased as if the service is still going to be 
performed because it says we hereby appoint Tequesta to provide the 
following services, right. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  However in this one it gives the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 78 of 235 
 
impression of a future event.  It speaks of the award because it defines 
the project as 359 electric locomotives awarded by Transnet to CSR.  
So there seems to be a misalignment of (indistinct) because it speaks 
of the future and as well acknowledges that you will not have gotten 
this contract had it not been of the votes of Tequesta. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Maybe one day I will understand but in 
the meantime I would like you to have regard to Annexure A to that very 
same contract at page 5167 and I am particularly interested in item 5 of 
that Annexure 1 which is headed “Statement of Advisory Services to be 
Provided by Tequesta to the Company in Respect of the Project as 
10 
Defined in Clause 1.1 of this Agreement.”  Now at item 5 it states as 
follows and I quote: 
“Assist the company in negotiating with the client 
on pricing levels in relation to the project.” 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were you able to determine the meaning of 
that service to be provided and if – you referred the Chair to a number 
of video clippings you have of the negotiations.  Were you able to tell 
from those video clippings whether Tequesta was represented in the 
negotiations? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
On 
the review 
of the videos 
(intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  All that we know is that those were 
CSR personnel that were negotiating with Transnet.  We did not see 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 79 of 235 
 
Mr Salim Essa.  Mr Essa is a popular face.  So we did not see 
Mr Salim Essa on the videos that were – that were reviewed at least. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now staying with Annexure A under the six 
items the following is noted: 
“It is hereby noted and agreed between the parties 
that the above services are provided as a pre 
project service and will conclude on the company 
signing the contract for the project with the client.” 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Are you able to – were you able to determine 
10 
what the pre project services were? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We could not establish what that is 
because the same agreement versed the responsibility of compiling the 
bid documents with CSR.  So insofar as that lot is concerned we are 
quite – I will have to rephrase that – the compilation of the documents 
and ensuring that the bid complies with the bid requirements that was 
the responsibility of CSR.  Now it was quite a curious notion for us to 
say then what is this service that Tequesta would have rendered to CSR 
to ensure that CSR secures that 359 electrical locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And lastly do you confirm that CSR bid for the 
20 
full 599? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At the beginning CSR submitted a bid 
for the full 599. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And yet in – in the definition section of – of 
this agreement at page 5153 I note the following item being defined:  
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 80 of 235 
 
Project 359 and this is defined as follows and I quote: 
“Refers to any portion of the tender for the supply 
of 359 electric locomotives to Transnet SOC Limited 
South Africa hereinafter referred to as the client.” 
359 is what was awarded to CSR? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is a result of a negotiation – that pre 
negotiation? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at that time CSR was not aware how 
10 
many they would eventually be awarded? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct because at that time well 
they had only submitted a bid for the full 599. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So no services then could have been 
capable of being rendered in respect of 359 because nobody know that 
CSR would get 359?  Is that a fair …? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  As pointed out that it is tea 
time – quarter past 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the tea adjournment and we will resume 
20 
at half past 11. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Court adjourns. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 81 of 235 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank You Chair.  Mr Sedumedi you move on 
then to your slide 59, in your report you have drawn certain inferences 
and conclusions from this contract which you highlight at your slide 59, 
would you like to go through that? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair, so after analysing 
this agreement and (indistinct) between Mr Sharma and Mr Essa we 
said to ourselves, surely the procurement of the 1064 was required to 
comply with the provisions of the (indistinct) in particular and the PFMA 
10 
relating to being competitive and fair, so we could not establish any 
lawful or commercial reason why would  Mr Essa, Salim Essa interpose 
between Transnet and potential bidders because the bids are supposed 
to be evaluated on the base of their strength when you submit them and 
it was a irresistible (indistinct) to say Mr Sharma, having been the 
Chairperson of the BADC at the time when the bids were awarded and 
taking into account that he had (indistinct) with Mr Essa would have 
used his position to ensure that CSR is awarded this contract, so this is 
the inference we are saying was irresistible to arrive at.  So it’s purely 
(indistinct) that those are – what would have transpired. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to that were you told what role he played in 
meetings to discuss this or were you just basing that on his relationship 
with Mr Essa, in other words in terms of minutes did you look at the 
role he played in meetings from which you are able to say, you know, 
he played a critical role in the decisions that favoured CSR. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 82 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In that Chair, (indistinct) we 
analysed he minutes which we can get the transcript of them but for the 
minutes as the Chairperson he was in charge of the proceedings when 
the management presented (indistinct) bidders ought to be, the split, 
the negotiation at (indistinct) those who were shortlisted and the 
ultimate award.  So that’s all that we could see in the minutes but we 
did not necessarily interrogate the transcript to see is there any further 
active role that he might have played to sway a decision away from 
CSR as an example, which is why we are saying just…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or towards, or rather away from – towards CSR isn’t 
10 
it. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:      Ja I’m saying 
if maybe he 
was swaying decisions away from other bidders (indistinct) so that’s 
what I meant so…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you didn’t have access to that, you didn’t see 
anything like that. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so it was just a relationship he had with Mr 
Essa. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on that score, I don’t know if you are in a 
position to express an opinion on the reasonableness on a bidder 
paying 21% of the total value of the contract received presumably they 
do so with still profit to spare, would you…(intervention). 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That was a (indistinct) of intense 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 83 of 235 
 
debate when we finalised our reports because we found it strange that 
as a business person or entity would you be willing to forego 21% of 
your margin to an entity whom, on the agreement, you’re saying you 
don’t even need to know what services have they rendered, I’m just 
acknowledging that there is some service that they’ve rendered without 
any need for proof.  So a reasonable conclusion to reach or inference 
is that you might have factored in this 21% when you made your offer 
during negotiations, you might have found some way of factoring in this 
21% that you are required to pay (indistinct) in terms of this agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But that as a matter of fact is not something 
10 
you have been able to determine. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    No that is purely, as I said it is 
just an inference that we just drew because we could not have 
(indistinct) we didn’t even include it in our report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you establish whether this entity that was going 
to be paid this 21% whether it had – what it had done, if anything to 
assist CSR to get the contract.  I think the agreement was saying that it 
wouldn’t have to prove but CSR just acknowledged that had it not been 
for their assistance CSR would not have got the contract. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the time of (indistinct) financial reports it 
was not done, you recall Chair, I did say that we are in the process of 
engaging the OEM’s this is one of the agenda items in our discussions 
with CSR and we disclose with them when we met with them in 
December that this is an item that we need to really get around.  So we 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 84 of 235 
 
(indistinct) at a stage where we have arrived at understanding the role 
that Tequesta would have played. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know that earlier on I mentioned too – I made 
mention of Homix and I thought you were the one who had given 
evidence, you probably have heard of Homix in terms of Transnet and 
so on and so on. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I have come across the name in various 
(indistinct) that we’ve conducted Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes one of the issues that the witness before you 
testified to was that Homix entered into an agreement with Neotel and 
10 
in terms of that agreement Homix was going to be paid some money on 
the basis that they had help or would help break a deadlock between 
Transnet and Neotel in terms of negotiations but part of the problem 
was that their witness said that there was no deadlock between 
Transnet and Neotel that was such that it could be said that Neotel had 
lost the business because the agreement was saying lost business – 
was referring to lost business but also either the agreement was 
reached on the day when the agreement between Neotel and Homix was 
reached on the day when the agreement between Neotel and Transnet 
was signed or the formal agreement between Homix and Neotel 
20 
happened after the agreement between Transnet and Neotel had been 
signed and also that witness gave witness when I asked him whether – 
because he was an important character in the negotiation team of 
Transnet I said, well if there was a deadlock between Transnet and 
Neotel and somebody was asked to help break the deadlock surely they 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 85 of 235 
 
would speak to the negotiating team, did they speak to you, you said 
no, did they – as far as you know did they speak to any member of your 
negotiating team, no.  So the question arose what were they going to 
be paid for if they never spoke to, at least one of the negotiating teams 
but they were going to be paid a lot of money.  So you have here 
another entity where – which is going to get a lot of money but their 
agreement with sales bar is that there’s no need to prove what we’ve 
done, so it may well be a pattern that we see develop of how some of 
these things were done.  I guess that I haven’t – I can’t remember with 
regard to whom it’s obviously it’s important to look at the personalities 
10 
involved in Homix compared to the personalities involved in this 
Tequesta whether in Homix for example you’ll find Mr Essa or some 
other person that features prominently in some of these transactions. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will do that analysis Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You – I’m still at your 59 at your concluding 
paragraph would you like to speak to that, the conclusion you have 
drawn regarding this transaction – this agreement. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair, as I said it’s just a 
emphasis of the point that I’ve already made that there just can’t be 
20 
any rational basis for this agreement to be concluded in a context of an 
open and competitive process where bids are supposed to be  
(indistinct) on the strengths so it means the Tequesta active efforts 
viewed 
against 
the 
relationship 
with 
Mr 
Sharma, 
would 
have 
undermined the spirit of an open and competitive bidding process, that 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 86 of 235 
 
was just the conclusion that we just (indistinct). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    But whether or not they did, it’s something 
that …(intervention). 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It’s something –it’s an inference 
that was purely an inferential (indistinct) it is irresistible to draw that 
type of an inference. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be important to establish whether 
anybody in the negotiation team – in the Transnet negotiating team 
knew any active efforts by Tequesta or was aware of any such active 
10 
efforts, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that’s once again something that we will 
pick up with those who were part of the negotiating team Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That brings us, according to my pack to the 
end of the issues you’ve dealt with and you raise around the Tequesta 
agreement. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You then move on to the next transaction. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The next set of slides Chair, 
20 
speaks to the appointment or the procurement of the transaction 
advisors.  The Chair would recall that 1064 given the magnitude of the 
transaction I might have acquired some external (indistinct) providers 
to provide some services.  So the TA’s as they are called, transaction 
advisors,  they are the persons or the professionals that advise 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 87 of 235 
 
Transnet on, amongst others, the validation of the bids case, the 
evaluation of these bids, how to structure the various agreements that 
would be required in the implementation of the project and procurement 
advice and of course legal services would have been also part of that 
scheme.  So what we have done – so all this work is contained in two 
reports, we named them volume 2(a) and 2(b).  For purposes of my 
evidence I will be focusing myself on volume 2(a) which will be the 
procurement of those advisors, the contracts that Transnet concluded 
with those advisors and the payments that were made.  Now volume 
2(b) which would have been the evidence, probably on Friday will then 
10 
focus on the technical analysis of the transactions that Transnet would 
have concluded at the instance of the advice from the transaction 
advisors.  So I thought I must just make that delineation of the 
evidence and how the reports are compiled. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Understood, yes please continue. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We then move to slide 66, in May 
2012 Transnet issued a confinement RFP to 9 entities for appointment 
of transaction advisors, we know on, review of the records that there 
were 
four 
responses 
that 
were 
received 
comprised 
of 
three 
consortiums, there was one led by the McKinsey consortium, we’ll talk 
20 
about that, KPMG consortium PWC and then there was Weber Wentzel 
Attorneys did not form a consortium they just sent in a bid on legal 
services, but for purpose of our discussion nothing much turns on those 
issues expect to say that we all know that McKinsey consortium was the 
successful bidder. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 88 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   And the consortium was led – 
this diagram indicates that McKinsey is a company incorporated even 
though the consortium was called McKinsey consortium, it was a main 
bidder and a core bidder called Letsema Consulting and the rest of the 
members were sub-contractors.  So meaning the leads on (indistinct) 
McKinsey (indistinct) and Advanced Relative Technologies, Nedbank, 
Edward Nathan, (indistinct) and Auto Capital were the sub-contractors 
as indicated by that diagram on the right there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now we now deal with the 
finding, the MNS findings on the procurement process.  The 
confinement RFP on page – volume 4 page 5637, by now you 
understand there are various stages of evaluation.  So there was a first 
stage being administrative responsiveness, amongst the various 
documents that you required in that stage was for the bidders to 
complete all the forms that were enclosed in the bid documents but 
quite critically was the submission of the audited financial statements 
for the previous three years and in that bid again, is state, failure to 
comply with the provisions of stage 1 will render the bidders proposal 
20 
to be non-responsive and that amounts to a disqualification.  McKinsey 
Incorporated did not submit audited financial statements when they 
submitted their bid there was no financial statements as required by the 
bid but in that response of theirs they enclosed a letter that is in 
volume 4 page 5336 where at they said, and I quote it’s an extract from 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 89 of 235 
 
their letter, 
 
 
“In terms of an internal governance regarding the provision of 
 
annual 
financial 
statements 
McKinsey 
provides 
such 
 
statements 
only 
in 
terms 
of 
statutory 
or 
regulatory 
 
requirements or when compelled to do so through any legal 
 
requirement”, 
 
That’s what we submit in the letter, the same letter also 
indicates – or it makes reference to a report of a factual findings by 
PWC purport indicating that McKinsey – the whole idea in that letter 
10 
was, you know, we attach a PWC report that demonstrates our financial 
position, however, that report referred to in the letter was not even 
enclosed in the bid documents. Now the requirement for financial 
(indistinct) not just a miscellaneous requirement it is just innocent or 
(indistinct), paragraph 15.2.6 of the Transnet procurement procedure 
manual which is in the volumes, it indicates the purpose of requiring 
financial statements is to assess the financial stability of the bidders, 
that’s why at the very early stage of evaluation we need to see who are 
we dealing with.  So it’s not just one of those miscellaneous 
requirements that are required by the bids.  So this purpose as 
20 
mandated by the PPM could not be achieved because Transnet then 
could not satisfy itself of McKinsey’s financial stability as a result of 
them not providing this statement.  So it was our view that McKinsey’s 
submission or proposal was non-responsive and should not have been 
entertained proceeding further in the evaluation process. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 90 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said that is – apart from the slides that’s dealt 
with in volume 4? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let’s go back and start with the question of 
administrative responsiveness that’s where you start to direct the 
Chair’s attention to the volumes.  On your slide 68 you said it’s volume 
4 page 5637. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Page 5637. 
ADV 
MAHLAPE 
SELLO: 
 
Yes, 
and 
you 
go 
further 
in 
your 
slide…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’ve got 5637 now yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair, you go further in your slide 
and say that page must be read with…(intervention). 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Read with 5647. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes so we keep our finger at 5637 and go to 
5647, yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On 5637 it indicates there 8.1 
step 1…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’m sorry I may have missed something now about 
– just briefly the point you were making about test for administrative 
responsiveness…(intervention). 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair it’s on page 5637. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  You’ll see at the top of that page 
again paragraph 8, evaluation, methodology and criteria, Transnet will 
utilise he following methodology. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 91 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And criteria in selecting a 
preferred service provider is so required, that is the statutory term that 
they include in their RFP’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder what this “if so required” means because I 
think we saw it in regard to another transaction, I mean, will there be a 
case where it won’t be required to use them? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  My interpretation and (indistinct) 
might be incorrect is that Transnet doesn’t have an obligation to 
appoint a service provider, I just assumed that it means it doesn’t 
10 
follow that at the conclusion of this process there might be – or this 
might result in an appointment of a service provider.  I say that based 
on a disclaimer that they always put in their bid documents, that they 
don’t have an obligation of appointing anyone for this bid, that’s how 
I’ve always…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I understand but that is in another place. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so this seems to suggest that we may not be 
required to use this methodology and criteria in selecting a bidder. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There are two choices Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I understand you Mr Sedumedi.  Mr 
Sedumedi’s understanding, if I quote you correctly is that if the 
qualifier, if so required relates to the selection of a preferred bidder 
and not to the use of the methodology. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 92 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That a qualifier, if so required relates to the 
second portion of the statement which is regarding the selection of a 
preferred bidder so, if so required we will select a bidder.  It does not 
relate to the first part of that statement regarding the use of 
methodology, as an interpretation it attaches to it, it’s a question of 
sustainable...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m not sure if I understand it because the criteria – 
the methodology and the criteria they are talking about are only 
applicable in selecting a service provider or the preferred service 
10 
provider isn’t it, that’s the only time they use them, they don’t use them 
for anything else isn’t it? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you remove the words, “if so required”, then 
what you would understand 8 to mean is, in selecting the successful 
bidder this is the methodology and these are the criteria we will use. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Or if we follow this methodology 
we must take it to its logical conclusion and select a preferred bidder.  
Now as I’m saying, reading that thing in view of the disclaimer that they 
always put that there’s no obligation to award, that’s how I make – how 
20 
we made the connection that it might be that they don’t want to be tied 
to finishing the process up until…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that I understand but that’s overall, they can 
follow the whole thing and then not appoint, you know, so that they 
should put somewhere  where they, in effect they say we can follow this 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 93 of 235 
 
process but still not appoint, all the different stages not necessarily 8, 
you know but anyway it might not be  - it might not make any difference 
in regard to  these transactions. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Or even perhaps to similar transactions Chair 
because we know that there’s a methodology prescribed we’ve dealt 
with that yesterday in the PPM’s.  So it’s a question of whether or not 
they – Transnet may conduct any evaluation outside the prescribed 
methodology, that’s the question to be debated and secondly then – 
then the second question that arises is whether or not in issuing a RFP 
Transnet may seek to absolve itself in position of the methodology in 
10 
the PPM.  So if we accept that they don’t have scope to do so, then it 
may be argued that a proper reading, contextual reading of that 
sentence must be, if I am required to select a preferred service I shall 
do so having followed this methodology. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe it might mean that, again if you have got 
that qualifier somewhere, where it says my following this process 
doesn’t oblige me to appoint, then you don’t need this in paragraph 8 
but it’s okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But maybe when we talk to those who 
evaluated this tender maybe they will shed light and explain how they 
20 
approached it and on what basis they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that’s fine. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now for step 1 the test for 
administrative responsiveness the test for – I’m reading this on top of 
the table there Chair, the test for administrative responsiveness will 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 94 of 235 
 
include 
the 
following, 
the 
relevant 
parties, 
second 
bullet…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  You’re reading at 8.1?   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  8.1 Whether the bid has been 
lodged on time.  Second bullet whether all returnable documents and or 
schedules were applicable were completed and returned by the closing 
date and time.  And the last bullet whether the bid documentation has 
been duly signed by the respondent.  The next table reads: 
“The test for administrative responsiveness it is step 
1 must be passed for a respondent’s proposal to 
10 
progress to step 2 for further evaluation.” 
If we now go to page 5647 because you will see Chair that on the 
returnable date it refers to Section 4 the returnable – starting on page 
5647. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They list the items that must be 
provided by the bid – by the bidders when they respond.  And if you 
turn overleaf at the top of the table after [indistinct] there is audited 
financials for previous three years.  And there is paragraph underneath 
that table to say: 
20 
“Failure to provide all the above referenced returnable documents 
married with a tick will result in a respondent’s disqualification.  
Bidders are therefore urged to ensure that all and all is underlined – all 
these documents are returned with the proposals.  And as you can see 
the financials at the top there has a tick.  So it was mandatory for the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 95 of 235 
 
bidders to provide at least those documents that are listed there.  Now 
when McKinsey submitted their proposal they ticked audited financial 
statements for the previous three years were not enclosed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry in – at page 5637 oh okay now I see it is 
the second bullet point under 8.1 that must be read with 5648 – 5647 
and 5648. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so one of the criteria was whether all of 
returnable documents were completed and returned by the closing date 
and 5648 makes it clear that failure to return all of them disqualifies a 
10 
bidder. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what the returnable documents are is set out in 
the list at 5647 to 8. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And it is not – and there is no 
discretion that has been afforded to any person [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There is no discretion 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As to whether you will be 
disqualified or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Apparently in a case that you 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 96 of 235 
 
going to get disqualified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And then you were dealing with – you were then – 
you were starting to move onto the point of showing that somebody did 
not return all the documents. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair.  The – on slide 69 
we are referencing the letter from McKinsey contained in Volume 4 
page 5336.  5336 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This letter  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Two seconds Mr Sedumedi. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is from McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is and part of the bid 
documents the heading there is policy on provision of annual financial 
statements.   
“McKinsey Incorporated in the state of Delaware 
United States of America South African branch is a 
privately held entity.  In terms of the internal 
20 
governance 
regarding 
the 
provision 
of 
annual 
financial 
statements 
McKinsey 
provides 
such 
statements only in terms of statutory or regulatory 
requirements or when compelled to do so through 
any legal requirement.  In order to provide details of 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 97 of 235 
 
the financial bona fides of McKinsey an original 
statement from the auditors of the entity is provided.  
Please refer to the original report of factual findings 
as prepared by Price Waterhouse Coopers covering 
their financial period as required.  In the event that 
McKinsey is successful in its submission and it 
remains a requirement to view the annual financial 
statements.  The annual financial statements can be 
viewed through an onsite inspection.” 
That was the letter that was enclosed in their bid documents. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the bid document required financial 
statements for three years, audited financial statements for three years 
and McKinsey found it fit to provide financial bona fides whatever that 
mey mean instead? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  Which for the record 
when you reviewed their bid that report that purports to indicate their 
financial bona fides was not enclosed in that bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the starting point is that they failed to comply 
with the – with one of the bid requirements to furnish audited financial 
statements for the period that was indicated. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of what we – you have referred us to in 
this bundle Exhibit – volume 4. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They should have been disqualified?  Is that right? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 98 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As per the requirements  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we know they were not disqualified. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To cut a long – the – McKinsey 
was eventually the successful bidder on this transaction.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were you able to establish through your 
10 
investigation the basis on which – whichever body decided this tender 
or this award why the requirements of the RFP were not upheld? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is not apparent in the 
records that we reviewed.  We assumed they just took McKinsey’s word 
for it as contained in this specific letter. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in the absence – considering the purpose 
of the financial statements as [indistinct] in paragraph 13.2.6 of the 
PPM as you state in your slide 69.  Such documentation is necessary to 
enable Transnet to test the financial stability of a bidder? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We know that we do not have them now so are 
we to accept that McKinsey was awarded notwithstanding that Transnet 
could not test its financial stability 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 99 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – there would have been a team or body that 
would have determined whether McKinsey should go beyond stage 1.  
What was that body or team? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ordinarily it should have been a 
cross-functional evaluating team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That would have had to evaluate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This part of the bid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Again ordinarily there would have 
been or they could – Transnet Internal Audit that would review such a 
process.  So those structures at least would have been required to 
check if the evaluation of this bid was in line with the process.  I mean 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the requirements of the RFP? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  So that I mean the 
whole governance surely would have been required to test that this bid 
complied with the requirements of the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that team as you understand the position would 
20 
that team have been a standard team that does this kind of job for 
stage 1 in regard to all tenders or does it composition change 
depending on the nature of the tender or transaction involved because 
the witness before you did give evidence in regard to Neotel and CSR 
and there was a team I think they were also called cross-functiional. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 100 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Cross-functional yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever, whatever team 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Evaluation team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and if I recall correctly in regard to the transaction 
that the witness concerned was testifying about they changed or they 
recommended the changing of one of the evaluation criteria in that 
case. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would appear that in regard to this transaction 
that you are testifying about to the extent that there may have been 
10 
such a cross-functional evaluation team involved in evaluating whether 
McKinsey’s bid should go beyond stage 1 it would appear that they 
either did not pick up that McKinsey did not comply with this 
requirement of financial statement or maybe they did pick that up but 
decided that there should be condonation or that this was not such an 
important requirement.  Or maybe they also recommended that this 
requirement should be waived so it would be important to establish 
whether each time we are dealing with the same people who form that 
team or is it different people and whether there are certain 
personalities that appear in each such team if those teams are 
20 
different?  But you say you do not know the composition of such teams 
or such team? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  What we can confirm Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Is that the CFET would be 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 101 of 235 
 
customised/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In accordance with the bid at 
hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So there is no generic CFET. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So it is put together each time there is a 
transaction. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There is a transaction… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where they would – they would need to do this kind of 
10 
evaluation. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes because you need to look at 
the expertise required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To assess the capabilities of the 
bidders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At that – they have submitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As an example a CFET for – to 
20 
evaluate the 1064 locomotives as an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It would not be the same persons 
that will be evaluating a transaction like this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  But your team you did not seek to establish 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 102 of 235 
 
who were the people who made up that team in this particular case? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Such record will be in our records 
in the office Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Even though it is not necessary 
get reflected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because for us it was more to 
10 
say 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Just an analysis of the 
documents at hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The members 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  whoever they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is not even an issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Those persons failed  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To evaluate this bid in 
accordance with what was required from them. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 103 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But to an extent that maybe that 
will [indistinct] we can provide information on who would have been the 
members of the CFET for this specific transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is important and in regard to the other 
transaction involving Neotel Ms Sello 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we must also check that.  Just see whether 
there may be certain personalities that are common to both teams. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed we will Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And perhaps on this score Mr Sedumedi 
yesterday we dealt with a number of cross-functional evaluation team 
reports in respect of different transactions.  Insofar as this transaction 
is concerned are you aware of one such report because if memory 
serves me well normally at the end of that report a couple of people 
sign the report and that might begin to answer the question that the 
Chair poses as to their identities of the members of that team? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes there would. For each and 
every phase you will recall even on the other transactions somebody 
20 
will have to sign off to say this is an evaluation that we have done and 
these are the persons that must be appointed.  So we will check in our 
records who are the persons that would have signed off on this specific 
phase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now my question is do you have in your 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 104 of 235 
 
record as it currently stands copies of the CFET reports regarding this 
transaction from your recollection.   Are they part of the record? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  From my recollection I do not 
remember that being part of our annexures. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because like I was saying in the 
main we are looking at the documents and what transpired.  We 
definitely do not come up in – come up or came up with a document 
that seemed to recommend any change or waiver of the evaluation 
criteria in this specific instance. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay then as we have indicated to the Chair 
you will make a search of your records and see what reports you can 
unearth regarding the evaluation of this tender and then we will submit 
them to the commission. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – it would be strange if McKinsey’s omission of 
the audited financial statements was not picked up by that team 
because its sole function is to check whether those requirements are 
met.  So I am very interested in seeing what the explanation is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  For McKinsey to be allowed to go to stage 2.  Did 
they check all these requirements because it is like a list that you must 
tick?  Yes we have seen this, yes we have seen this. This is not there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know and then if it is not there why are they not 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 105 of 235 
 
disqualified? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair.  We then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in particular it may be that the chairperson of that 
committee if it is established that it go through such a committee that 
committee may have to be called to explain. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Shed light on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair.  We have made a note of that Chair 
and we shall revert.  We then move onto page 70 if my order is still 
right of your slides. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is correct.  After the evaluation 
of those bids then on 26 July 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Sedumedi.  At a certain stage relevant 
people saw your report? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What answer did you or comments did you get with 
regard to the fact that in terms of the RFP requirements any bidder who 
did not supply all the documents should not have gone beyond stage 1 
but McKinsey proceeded beyond stage 1 despite the fact that they did 
not supply financial statements.  Were you given any answers or – by 
20 
all relevant authorities that were still within Transnet? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This report was submitted in 
March this year it was made available to Transnet so the same modus 
operandi where they will circulate that to the executives.  The report 
was also availed or just the findings thereof to McKinsey because we 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 106 of 235 
 
have been in engagements with McKinsey as well on some of the 
issues.  They confirm that indeed – so there is no dispute about 
whether they did not provide.  They did confirm it indeed they not 
provide the financials and this letter is the [indistinct] letter that they 
normally use when they respond to bids or request for proposals and it 
has not been an issue.  So that is the furthest that we could… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They said there was no – this was never made an 
issue with them by Transnet? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is just that it is quite a serious thing because 
10 
you know Transnet could end up giving a big contract to an entity that 
really does not have the financial strength and other abilities to carry it 
out.  Ja okay alright.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  You move on then to the co-
bidder. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At your slide 70. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Right.  So on 26 July the 
Transnet acquisition council awarded this contract then to McKinsey. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  McKinsey Consortium to be exact? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  McKInsey Consortium my 
apologies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now on 22 August 2012 there is a 
memorandum compiled by Mr Anoj Singh to the Group Chief Executive 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 107 of 235 
 
who at that stage was Mr Brian Molefe.  In one of the issues raised in 
that [indistinct] is that there is a conflict of interest between Letsema.  
Letsema was one of the consortium members of the McKinsey 
Consortium.  He says there is a – seems to be a conflict of interest 
between Letsema and Barlow World so McKinsey will be required to 
replace Letsema with another entity of equal standing with Letsema or 
better.  That is the phrase that they used in [indistinct] the risk conflict 
so that is all that we can input.  But [indistinct] did not necessarily 
expand on the nature and extent of this conflict between Letsema and 
Barlow World. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were you able to establish in the course of 
your investigations I appreciate that you – you have not had 
opportunity to interview Mr Brian Molefe or Mr Anoj Singh but from 
other employees within Transnet were you able to determine the nature 
of the supposed conflict between Letsema and Barlow World that 
necessitated Letsema to fall out of this consortium? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Various enquiries that we made 
with the [indistinct] been interviewed we could get the clear answer or 
explanation as to what is the nature of the conflict.  It think it was just 
accepted as a fait accompli that there seemed to have been some 
20 
conflict of some sort which necessitated Transnet advising McKinsey 
Consortium that it would have to replace Letsema with a bidder or an 
entity of equal standing or better. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the Chair can accept that you have not – 
you have not interviewed Letsema or any of its directors. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 108 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We have not interviewed 
Letsema. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Yes you may proceed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Nor Barlow World.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Nor Barlow World yes.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now on the slide… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we will need to get to know exactly whether 
there was a genuine conflict of interest there and how it was handled.  
So – so the investigators can also do that.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the commission to… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To talk to those people to try and establish what kind 
of intra – conflict of interest was that? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair we will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Mr Sedumedi you may proceed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now in dealing with this whole 
20 
replacement of Letsema we first analysed the – the bid submissions of 
McKinsey to establish what role would Letsema play within the 
consortium notwithstanding is it a minor role player or a key role 
player?  These slides next two slides indicate the roles that the 
consortium itself are assigned to various members of the consortium. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 109 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So on the left those are the 
issues that would have been put in the RFP to say these are the 
requirements that Transnet have or the strengths or the skills of the 
members.  And the Chair will note that Letsema played or at least when 
you look at the RFP submission or the bid submission Letsema played 
quite a key role compared to I mean just on slide 71 Nedbank has only 
one role for Nedbank they have been there ability in project deal 
structuring.  Whereas Letsema and McKinsey played significant role on 
various items the same principle applies on the next slide.  So that is 
10 
the consistent pattern.  In actual fact if – not necessary [indistinct] 
document the percentage that Letsema had was quite a significant one.  
The highest would have been McKinsey if my memory serves me 
[indistinct] 35 with Letsema being on 20 and the rest of the sub-
paragraphs had a smaller portion of the cake.  So Letsema was a key 
partner in this consortium.  In actual fact you will recall that the bid 
said it was Letsema is a co-bidder.  That is the word that was used in 
the proposal. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I do not know if you went to the actual 
report.  Mr Singh’s report you referred to at Volume 4 page 5528 this 
20 
you have in your page 17.  At 5530 actually sets out in percentage 
terms the work split amongst the various consortium members.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  That will be … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 4, 5530. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 110 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At item 17. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is where I saw the split.  
Page 5530. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The heading is Financial 
Implications.  The estimated value for locomotive advisory services 
required is R50 million.  The percentage split of the work is anticipated 
to be as follows:  McKinsey 35%, Procurement Partner [Letsema] place 
two conflicts Barlow World is 20% so the stake for Letsema was 20% 
and then the Outa and Nedbank 10%. [indistinct] will recall Chair was 
10 
not part of the consortium per se because they were – they submitted 
their bid for individually they had 20% and Advanced Rail Technologies 
was 15%.  So that demonstrates the key role that Letsema played in the 
configuration of the consortium.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You might or might not be able to answer this 
question.  When a tender has been awarded to a consortium or joint 
venture and there is a problem which results in the consortium or joint 
venture being able to continue with the contract as they are or as they 
– as they were when they were appointed.  Are they free to just change 
partners and with – and continue without the employer having an 
20 
opportunity to see who – to see the joint venture that will continue or to 
look for another one or is that something that you would not know? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  A (indistinct) is contained in our 
report Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 111 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The view that we hold on the matter 
because we know that post this memorandum – let me just talk about 
what happened (indistinct) such as to properly answer the question that 
the Chair is asking.  On 6 December 2012 Transnet then issues or 
concludes what is called a Letter of Intent and in that LOI – Letter of 
Intent – it describes the parties as McKinsey being the supplier and 
they list as well as other members of the consortium namely Regiments 
Capital, Advanced Rail Technologies, Nedbank and (indistinct).  Now 
from this letter you could see now that Regiments is an entity that 
would have replaced Letsema.  So the view that we have in the report 
10 
is that – and this – remember all this happens pre award.  It is not like 
the (indistinct) happens … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  After the fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This is at the stage we pick up this 
conflict before we award this bid and it says Letsema – sorry – 
McKinsey must find a replacement that is of the same value.  The 
(indistinct) was that it cannot be up to McKinsey to make a 
determination of who is of equal standing.  They got the points that 
20 
they got being the preferred bidder on the strength of the submissions 
that they have made and then informed by the expertise that various 
members of the consortium would have brought to the table.  So it is 
that that would have enabled them to outscore the other bidders.  So it 
then goes without saying that any person who substitutes Letsema or 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 112 of 235 
 
any member for that matter should be put through at least the same 
process (indistinct) to a lesser extent to determine if with this entity is 
the McKinsey Consortium still meeting the requirement of being the 
preferred supplier.  So from the records that we had we could not seem 
to find anything that suggests there was some re-evaluation of some 
sort to test the strength of Regiments.  In actual fact the Letter of 
Intent it says McKinsey has agreed to partner with Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Suggesting maybe inadvertently that the new entity 
was suggested to McKinsey and McKinsey agreed?  You need not say 
anything.  Okay.  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Mr Sedumedi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just saying the language suggests that it did not 
come from McKinsey. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At the least the reading of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, the language. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is a curious way of putting it in the LOI but 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is what it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may proceed Mr Sedumedi.  So now we 
know at this juncture the LOI already recognises Regiments Capital as 
a replacement for Letsema? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the point you make at your 74 is that 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 113 of 235 
 
Letsema – no – Regiments was not evaluated? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So there was just a direct replacement … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Without assessing the impact of the loss of 
Letsema to the consortium relative to the other consortia … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And whether they still occupied the first 
position? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair.  So that 
10 
process we reckon it was irregular as well.  Now we know – we now 
know that we are now at the stage where there is an LOI. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We felt it appropriate that we need to 
just highlight the key terms of this LOI because it becomes important as 
we go through the various phases of this process. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are now at your 76? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is slide 76. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So one: 
20 
“The LOI even if the word says that of intent but for 
intents and purposes it regulates the relationship 
between 
Transnet 
and 
McKinsey 
Consortium 
pending the conclusion of a Master Services 
Agreement.” 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 114 of 235 
 
So it was contemplated that this LOI will at some point be replaced by a 
proper Master Services Agreement as they called it in the document. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And the LOI itself would be valid for 
90 days or when the LSA was finalised whichever comes first.  If the 
LSA is concluded prior to the expiration of 90 days then obviously – 
then it will then replace the LOI. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It also specifies that the advisory 
services that will be performed under the LSA will be for nine months 
10 
commencing 15 January 2013 to 15 October 2013.  Any deliverables 
that will be completed – that are not completed by 15 October which 
being the 90 – the expiration of the 90 day period … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Will continue at no cost to Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If – if I may it may assist perhaps the Chair if 
we find the actual LOI.  I do appreciate at your 76 that it is a summary 
of the LOI and on your previous slide you had … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  (Indistinct). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indicated that it is volume 7 - 6570 and it 
20 
might help to have it close at hand because I – there are few questions 
I would like to get your view on or answers to from you. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay, (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 7 – 6570. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you say volume 7? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 115 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Seven Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the page? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  6570 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I – I am – I am looking at page 6571 in 
particular under conditions precedent.  You state in your slide that at 
item 3/bullet 3: 
“The transaction advisory services were to be 
performed under the MSA for nine months.” 
I just want to check this with you.  Whether that is not meant to be 
10 
under the LOI/MSA as the case may be and I say so with reference to 
paragraph 1.01 and its wording. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  1.1? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  1.1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So the extent that your slide may 
suggest that the nine months is – we start to compute from when the 
MSA is signed.  That is not what you intend to communicate? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  The point was just the 
relationship between Transnet and McKinsey would be for a nine month 
20 
period but you will recall that at the LOI itself is supposed to … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Endure for 90 days. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  90 days.  I am clarifying.  Thank you, you may 
continue. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 116 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay and the point that I made 
earlier on that McKinsey agrees to contract with Regiments as a SD 
partner.  SD being Supply Development partner and the LOI as well 
puts up the contract value to be 35.2 million … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And the breakdown of how that figure 
should be split in terms of the various services is on slide 77. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That becomes key as you move what 
was – you know that there is a budget item for4 each of the services 
10 
that the consortium will provide to Transnet.  I just want to flag that 
because we will come back to that issue I think some six slides down 
the line.  Now on 4 March 2013 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because that was just before the 90 
day period would expire the parties then conclude what they called a 
first addendum to the LOI to extend the duration of the LOI from 
6 March to 15 October 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Then again and that is contained in 
20 
volume 7 page 65 – nothing much turns on that.  On 14 October the 
parties then – I think because that is now before the date of 15 October 
– they conclude a second addendum to the LOI to extend the duration 
of this one from 15 October to 18 November 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that now exceeds the term period of the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 117 of 235 
 
engagement? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That exceeds the nine month period 
that we referred to earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because that you will recall would 
have actually expired on 15 October … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Be that as it may 18 November 
10 
comes and goes.  By the time 18 November comes there is no further 
extension to this LOI meaning by this date there is no agreement 
between the parties and we further confirm that at least by this date 
McKinsey was paid a total amount – there were two invoices that they 
submitted.  It was R11 000 300 to round it off.  So beyond 1 October 
there was no (indistinct) contract between Transnet and McKinsey. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You are on 1 December? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  From 1 December 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Remember 30 November 2013 that is 
20 
when the period of the second addendum comes to an end.  However 
on slide 79 we see an agreement signed by Mr Anoj Singh.  The parties 
to that agreement is Transnet and Regiments … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And the key issues of that agreement 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 118 of 235 
 
is that it provides for Regiments to provide some of the transition 
advisory services which were part of the LOI.  We know from our review 
of documents that at this time – 20 January 2014 – Nedbank had pulled 
out of the consortium and this was even though this was testified as 
well to by Mr Callard because Nedbank was saying they were going to 
or not Mr Callard.  It was Mr – the GCE – Mr Mohamedy that Nedbank 
had wanted to provide downstream services when the SWATs and those 
things were concluded.  So it is at this point were now this agreement 
to appoint Regiments to provide that service and the duration of this 
agreement 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
for 
12 
months 
commencing 
10 
24 January 2014 and the cost of the services was to be R15 million for 
this ring-fenced service … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Plus 10 percent proved expenses. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh.  So now let us understand we know 
that there is an LOI … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For a nine month contract for provision of 
certain services? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A first addendum is issued to extend the LOI.  
That is followed by a second addendum to extend the period of 
contract? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And no further addenda are issued thereafter.  
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 119 of 235 
 
The effect of that is by 1 December that contractual relationship has 
ended? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
Two 
months 
later 
on 
23 January 2014 
Mr Singh signs an agreement with Regiments.  What was the purpose – 
the purpose – main purpose of this agreement and what – how does it 
interrelate with the LOI? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At least the reading of this agreement 
… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It makes reference to the services 
that are listed on the LOI … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But we could not pick up and you will 
see when we look at the notes that because on its own - if viewed on 
its own there is no connection between these documents and the LOI 
because the LOI had lapsed in any event. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But strange enough the services that 
are referred to in this agreement are the services that are contained in 
20 
the Letter of Intent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Some of them at least.  That is the 
only connection that one could make between this document and the 
LOI. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 120 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For now can we accept based on the – the 
parties to the LOI that Regiments was not a direct party to that 
contract? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct which is – which is why I am 
saying that is the only connection between – because Regiments was 
not a party to the LOI … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  With Transnet.  The only link is that 
this document seems to make reference to some service that is in the 
LOI. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright, thank you.  You may proceed. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Then when Mr Singh signs this 
document … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  He makes the following notes that 
appear on page 6590 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the bundle.  He says … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is EXHIBIT 4 - 6590? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  65 – okay but that document Chair 
20 
EXHIBIT 4 starts on page 6587.  This is the agreement that in the 
beginning … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 7 page … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Volume 7 page 6587. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is where the document starts? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 121 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is where it starts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it is volume 7? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I am looking at volume 7 but we have been 
dealing with volume 4 for such a long time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is right.  We got stuck in volume 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So the page is 65 …? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  87. 
CHAIRPERSON:  87? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is where the document starts and that is 
10 
what Mr Sedumedi’s slide suggested – slide 79 – and you wanted to 
refer us to a particular page of this document. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It appears as page 6590. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  6590. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  You will see there where Mr Singh 
signs.  He says subject to items listed below … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And that is what is been paraphrased 
20 
in the slide but in a sense he says … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “The contract for the supply 
of these services is with McKinsey and Regiments 
Capital is contracted to them.” 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 122 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To McKinsey? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To McKinsey. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
Furthermore 
because 
in 
this 
document it envisaged a performance fee.  So he says … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Payable to? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To – to Regiments. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So he says: 
10 
“Regiments is not entitled to a performance fee.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that clause must be removed.  He 
further says: 
“The payments in term of this agreement remains to 
McKinsey ...” 
Which is why I was making that link to the LOI. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
“…and 
the 
costs 
and 
payment in the scope may not be above R9 million 
20 
without specific approval from Transnet.” 
So it is – that is what Mr Singh notes on this agreement.  The 
conclusions that we have reached is that this agreement is irregular in 
that it has no procurement event that – to this agreement if we get the 
parties.  It is Regiments and Transnet and seeing who would have had 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 123 of 235 
 
the authority to bind or appoint transaction advisors on behalf of 
Transnet because this was not falling within this delegated authority 
especially looking at the amount that they are talking about – R9 
million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is insofar as it relates to this 
agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No I – I am at page 6590 which is the same 
page of that contract and I note the following that Mr Singh signed this 
contract on 14 January – no on the 23 r d … 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the 23 r d. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of January 2014. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh and then Mr Niven Pillay on behalf of 
Regiments had signed it on 20 January 2014. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So Mr Pillay signs first and Mr Anoj Singh 
signs later.  When Mr Pillay signed the contract the conditions set out 
there by Mr Singh were not there? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when Mr Singh accepts the contract on its 
terms he then inserts the conditions? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do we have a record of whether or not 
Regiments agreed to – because effectively those conditions would 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 124 of 235 
 
amend the terms of the contract. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This is – this amounts to a counter … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Counteroffer? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  A counteroffer of some sort. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now do we know what the attitude was - of 
Regiments was regarding this counteroffer or suggested amendments to 
the contract.  Were they acceptable or not? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We do not have any record … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That stage of the fate of this 
10 
agreement as to whether Mr Pillay on behalf of Regiments did accept 
the counter proposal coming from Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which is why we had to assess this 
agreement based on what do we see on this document. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So the point we make is that at least 
looking at the notes of Mr Singh he seems to acknowledge that 
Regiments has no contractual relationship with Transnet which is why 
he says this is with McKinsey and Regiments is their subcontractor and 
20 
as of the (indistinct) when they will be made will be made to McKinsey 
not … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Regiments. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Regiments. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now based on what you just said what 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 125 of 235 
 
Mr Singh notes on the document is an acknowledgement that Transnet 
has a contractual relationship with McKinsey? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At least that is what … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is what he suggests. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is what he suggested. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Whether or not he is factually correct in that 
regard … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is another issue all together. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is another issue. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He appreciates though that this particular 
contract that requires his signature is – is with Regiments for services 
being provided by McKinsey? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And he proceeds to sign it? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  He proceeds to sign the agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So what is the effect of the condition that the 
services you seek to provide to me are already being provided by 
McKinsey?  Have you applied your mind to that?  Do you have a – an 
opinion? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We just find it to be a very, very 
strange document Chair because like you said earlier on one, in these 
matters it makes reference to the LOI.  The person who is signing is not 
even a party to the LOI.  You tell Regiments that okay I agree to this – 
this is contained in the LOI.  When I pay I will pay Regiments – 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 126 of 235 
 
McKinsey but McKinsey is not even part – it is not like it is a tripartite 
of some sort.  McKinsey is not even part of this document which is why 
(indistinct) that this document is just an irregular document more so 
because it cannot pick up any procurement event that would have 
culminated in the conclusion of this agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also why the need to include in an agreement 
with Regiments Services that are already provided for in an agreement 
in the agreement with McKinsey. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what is the need and to – that does not 
10 
appear 
to 
have 
been 
any 
compliance 
with 
any 
procurement 
requirements and procedures.  Here it looks like Regiments was just 
identified.  Is that right? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is – that is what it seems.  Like 
you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what it seems, yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the only conclusion that one 
can reach … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  When we get this agreement … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because it just sprouts from no you 
have got any procurement event that (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you – you implied in your evidence here that 
in terms of that agreement there may have been other services that 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 127 of 235 
 
Regiments was required to provide which were not covered by the 
agreement between Transnet and McKinsey. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair because when you 
analysed the deliverables in terms of this document against the 
deliverables that were contained in the LOI there seem to have been 
some (indistinct) but even in the main you could see the scope relates 
to the financial advisory services that were conducted or supposed to 
be conducted by Nedbank in the main LOI.  That is our observation 
when you just look at the – but in a way it was those things that were 
contained in the LOI. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But then looking – sorry – looking at the 
agreement with McKinsey recognising the seeming overlap between 
that and the LOI are you saying the Regiments Agreement purported to 
extend the scope of the LOI insofar as the services to be rendered by 
Nedbank were concerned or it is replicating the same services that are 
contemplated in the LOI?  I think that – that was the Chair’s question.  
Does this contract award more services than were originally covered 
under the LOI or is it the same services albeit not all services 
contemplated in the LOI?  Which is broader of the two as far as the 
services are concerned? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This agreement Chair expands or 
provides for more services … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To – which is why as well you see 
them even allocating an amount for this to say this service will be R15 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 128 of 235 
 
million but if you exceed R9 million you must seek Transnet’s approval. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
Okay. 
 
Now 
have 
you 
found 
any 
documentation that would indicate whether or not firstly McKinsey was 
aware or this agreement considering that Regiments is a co-partner in 
its consortium on practically the same services and expressing 
McKinsey’s view on this agreement? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We have not as yet engaged 
McKinsey on this agreement but it is one of the issues that as part of 
(indistinct) there are various issues that we are engaging McKinsey on.  
So it is one – going to be one of the issues that we will be raising with 
10 
McKinsey but to date we have not picked up any document that 
suggests that McKinsey was made aware of this agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Chair my clock seems to indicate 
it is lunch time.  I do not know if it is an opportune time for the Chair to 
take a lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I was hoping to finish by lunch time but 
judging by what is left … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I – I will finish both witnesses today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Still by 5 o’ clock.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think when we come back I would like to know 
whether through your investigation you established that there were 
services that Regiments actually did provide under this agreement that 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 129 of 235 
 
they had separately from McKinsey with – with Transnet. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair that we covered with the 
(indistinct) slides. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That might be still coming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  We will take the lunch adjournment now 
and resume at two.  We adjourn. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Ms Sello? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are ready Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi when we broke for lunch we 
were at your slide 79 and we had just gone through the agreement 
concluded by Mr Singh for Transnet and Regiment and the conditions 
that he inserted on the document by manuscript, then we continue then 
at slide 80 where you express a view that this constituted an irregular 
and unlawful extension of the Regiment scope, are you there? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  (Inaudible – mic off) 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thanks, if you may proceed.  Your mic is off, 
thank you.  You may proceed 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  What happens thereafter Chair 
this agreement is in February.  On the 4 t h of February 2014 Transnet 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 130 of 235 
 
and Regiment concluded an agreement, let’s call it an agreement, 
purporting to extend the scope of the letter of intent that was concluded 
between Transnet and McKinsey and the title of this document or this 
agreement is titled Third Addendum for GSM12/0457 for transaction, for 
adversary services related to the acquisition of the 1064 locomotives so 
that reference Chair is a reference that is used for the 1064 locomotive 
transaction.  So even the first LOI that was concluded between 
Transnet and McKinsey would have had this reference number.  So this 
document as it says it’s a third addendum to the LOI, you will recall 
that there was a first and second addendum that was extending the 
10 
duration of the initial LOI, so this now was titled the third addendum to 
extend both the scope and the value of the LOI.  The document is 
contained in Volume 7 page 6605. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, so McKinsey and Transnet conclude an 
LOI. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  There’s a first addendum in 2013 to that LOI, 
there’s a second addendum, following the second addendum there is a 
contract between Transnet and Regiment purporting to transfer, if I may 
use that term, the functions of Nedbank contemplated in the LOI to 
20 
Regiments, that’s the 24 t h of January 2014. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thereafter you say in terms of page 6605 in 
Volume 7 there is now a third addendum to the original LOI. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct ma’am. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 131 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, you’ve got that, you may take us 
through it. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.  In this Addendum 
...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like I said the parties thereto is 
McKinsey and Transnet, the essence of this addendum is to increase 
the scope of the LOI by incorporating the scope of work that was 
contained in that agreement that we spoke about before the lunch 
break, the 24 or 23 January 2013 agreement, so ...(intervention)  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Between Regiments and ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Between Regiments and 
Transnet, so that scope then finds expression in this document that we 
will now call the third addendum, so that’s the first key issue about the 
third addendum and as well it then increased the contract value of the 
LOI, the Chair will recall that the contract value of the letter of intent 
was 25.2million, now this was now increased to 41.2million and the 
document, the third addendum let’s call it, to the LOI does indicate that 
15million will be reserved for this additional scope, so in a sense it 
mirrors the terms of that 24 January agreement, so that’s what this 
20 
document purports to do.  We will later on deal with the effect, if any, 
of this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s very strange isn’t it that an agreement between 
Transnet and Regiments purports to extend and increase the scope and 
the value of an agreement between Transnet and McKinsey, isn’t it, or 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 132 of 235 
 
do I miss something? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No, no you are not missing 
anything Chair, it’s quite – but along the line maybe the strangeness of 
that aspect we will come to later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it will be clarified. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this third addendum on the dates you 
have provided just 4 t h February 2014 is concluded three months after 
the lapse of the LOI? 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct, you will recall that 
the LOI lapsed on the 30 t h of November 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may proceed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And then the next activity is a 
conclusion on 21 February 2014 McKinsey signed a Master Service 
Agreement with Transnet, Chair you will recall that in terms of the LOI 
it was envisaged that on expiration of the LOI or before its expiration 
for that matter the parties would conclude a Masters Service 
Agreement.  Now on 21 February McKinsey then signed a Masters 
Service Agreement contemplated in that LOI which we have just said 
20 
now that it had lapsed on 6 December, Transnet countersigned this 
document on the 11 t h of August 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they signed it after more than a year had lapsed 
since the lapsing of the LOI? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not a year because the LOI 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 133 of 235 
 
lapsed ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well your page 82 says it lapsed on 6 December 2012 
and ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  (Indistinct) the lapsed LOI dated, 
no, no the slide says the lapsed LOI dated 6 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  6 December is the date of the 
LOI, but the LOI ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  How much was the period after it had lapsed? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I beg your pardon Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much was the period that had lapsed between 
the lapsing of the LOI and the signing of this agreement between 
McKinsey and Transnet relating to the Masters Service Agreement? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That rounds to three months but 
to be precise two months and twenty days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And some weeks, okay, alright.  Thank you. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes, so all that this MSA did it 
simply recorded the terms of the LOI dated 6 December including the 
fact that the value of this agreement is 35.2million and as well it 
records that this agreement will lapse on 31 s t March 2013. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So Transnet then signing on the 11 t h of August 
2014 as it did signed after that very agreement itself had expired? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct, as you can see the 
signatures appearing on page 6632 of the document 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 134 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But curious enough the MSA was 
silent, that is this one, was silent on that agreement that was 
concluded between Transnet and Regiments on 23 January and as well 
it does not make any reference to the third addendum, that was 
concluded two weeks earlier, being the third addendum or a document 
purporting to be a third addendum to the LOI concluded between 
Regiments and Transnet.  It makes no reference to those two 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that date of 31 March 2014 deliberate, 
intentional as the date recorded as expiry date of the MSA, so does 
10 
this mean that the MSA’s life was about just over a month? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The commencement date 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is 21 February 2014 according to or at least your 
slide says 21 February 2014 is when it was signed  ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s when it was signed by 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe the commencement date is defined 
differently. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct, that’s why it was 
20 
important we must reflect the different dates, the Chair is quite correct 
on the actual document it says commencement date is 15 January 
2013, but it is signed 21 February even if the Chair can have regards to 
page 6332, it was signed by McKinsey,  there’s a table that indicates 
the signatories to the document. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 135 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the right that’s for and on 
behalf of McKinsey signed by Mr David Fine, at 21 February 2014, and 
then on behalf of Transnet is Mr Anoj Singh on the 11 t h of August.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So the one, McKinsey signed it on the 21 s t February 
2014, and Transnet signed it a number of months thereafter on 11 
August 2014. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  From the look of things Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was said to be the commencement date was 
said to be what date?  That’s in the definition section? 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  15 January 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where do I find that? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is on page 6609, the front 
page of the document, of the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, right.  Is that all that they did put the 
commencement date there on the cover page and did not include it in 
the definition section or did they do that as well? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the definition section actually 
on page 6611 paragraph 2.5, the commencement date means 5 January 
notwithstanding the signature date of this agreement. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please indicate the full date. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  5 January 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there would be no agreement ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Your mic Chair. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 136 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  There had been no agreement for the best part this 
period but the agreement was signed much later and then they say it 
would start much earlier, ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just to check Mr Sedumedi you – have 
you had opportunity to compare the terms of LOI with this agreement? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We have definitely the terms of 
the LOI we did compare the two. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And is it so that the MSA reflects to a large 
extent the LOI, it’s not in conflict therewith, save in this respect the 
period of the agreement itself. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct, Chair will recall 
that in terms of the LOI the duration of the relationship was a nine 
month period and in the event that the services go beyond nine months 
then that will be at no cost to Transnet, so to an extent that this 
agreement, at least it’s expiry date goes beyond nine months from 
January that will be in conflict with what the letter of intent had 
specified on 6 December 2012. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, alright, so now we have the MOI which 
we know was due to expire on the 31 s t March 2014. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Master Services Agreement, I apologise, 
the MSA. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You can take it from there. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Well the next milestone if I can 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 137 of 235 
 
use that word ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you go to it of course this thing of signing 
an agreement today and saying its commencement date is sometime 
last year is just a physical impossibility.  This is something you might 
not be able to comment on because you – but I’m wondering whether as 
you were appointed to investigate you sought to investigate why it was 
necessary to have an agreement that sought to do the impossible.  
What was sought to be the value for Transnet? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If I can posit a view, maybe it 
might be simply to record the terms of the LOI but for what purpose I 
10 
am not quite sure because in any event the LOI had lapsed, it is not 
like this MSA came before the lapsing, it was something else maybe it 
came before the lapsing but the (indistinct) came after, in fact three 
months after its expiration one would not understand the rationale.  I 
am aware though Chair, and this was not part, this happened in the 
past few weeks.  We have received correspondence from I think it 
Norton Rose, they are the legal representatives of McKinsey, to say 
that was just to record what was also being recorded already before in 
terms of the LOI, so it’s more of a regularisation, that is just my 
interpretation of how they envisaged this issue, (indistinct) that you got 
20 
in the last few weeks as you were engaging on this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it’s – it would be important to find out what 
those, particularly from the side of Transnet who agreed to such a thing 
what they sought to achieve for Transnet because if there’s something 
that was supposed to have been done and it wasn’t done if they acted 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 138 of 235 
 
transparently all they needed to do is to record that the following things 
were supposed to have been done and they were not done, or the 
following things were done, they should have been done after the 
agreement had been concluded but were done without an agreement 
and they are hereby, by agreement between the parties accepted to be 
– they must be dealt with as if the agreement was in existence at that 
time if there’s something transparent but when you say you sign an 
agreement today and you say it’s commencement date is a year ago it’s 
very, very strange, I mean when both parties were conducting 
themselves in a certain way during that time they didn’t have any 
10 
contractual obligations, so when can  you say they were in breach of 
this agreement that didn’t exist, what purpose does it serve, it just 
makes you wonder whether there is something hidden that it was 
supposed to cover but okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  We then go onto the next 
slide, Mr Sedumedi your slide 83. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  83? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On 16 April 2014 McKinsey 
addressed a letter to Transnet advising that it had ceded its advisory 
20 
rights and obligations to Regiments on 5 February 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the rights and obligations being – sought 
to be ceded arise from which document or which contract? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It could only be the rights and 
obligations in terms of the letter of intent. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 139 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So would the following be a correct 
understanding of that letter, Transnet is advised, albeit on the 16 t h of 
April 2014 that as early as the 5 t h of February 2014 McKinsey had 
ceded all its rights and obligations to Regiments arising from the LOI. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Notwithstanding such cession on the 14 t h of 
March McKinsey concludes an MSA deriving from the same LOI with 
Transnet and Regiment doesn’t feature there as a cedent. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s what seems to be the case 
(indistinct) I know legally speaking it does not make sense but at least 
10 
...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But that’s a correct understanding on our part 
if we take ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is a correct understanding 
of what that letter says. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which then the following week or 
so on the 24 t h of April Transnet and Regiments conclude a first 
addendum to the Master Service Agreement.  The purpose of that 
addenda amongst others was to vary the MSA, to add additional scope 
20 
and as well amend the price that was in the MSA.  The Chair will recall 
that the MSA we refer to just embodied the terms of the LOI concluded 
in December, so this document, the first addendum then sought to 
amend that document by amongst others and in terms of the scope it 
says: 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 140 of 235 
 
“The scope was varied by the additional scope such as to 
assist Transnet with own negotiations on accelerated delivery 
of the 1064 locomotives, compute the effects of hedging and 
escalation, optimise and reduce foreign exchange hedge costs 
and the value of the contract you will recall that the LOI and 
the MSA was 35.2, then this it records it has been increased to 
78.4million.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Again so we don’t get our dates mixed up we 
know the MSA tells us at the front page that the commencement date is 
15 January 2013 and the expiry date is 31 s t March 2014.  The 
10 
addendum you refer to as the first addendum to the MSA is concluded 
24 t h April 2014, three weeks after on the terms of the MSA itself the 
MSA has expired. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that first addendum now is concluded 
between Transnet and Regiments and no longer McKinsey. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We follow, you may continue. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Then on 16 July 2015 Transnet 
and Regiments conclude a second addendum to the MSA and the 
20 
essence of that MSA to summarise again it was to amend the scope of 
service, to change the remuneration model and as well to extend the 
duration of the MSA.   
 
Amongst the serves that were now included in varying the 
original terms was to provide tinker support including the building cost 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 141 of 235 
 
escalation, models and total cost of ownerships, to develop a detailed 
funding plan for the acquisition of the 1064 locomotive from GE, 
Bombardier, CNR and in a sense from (indistinct) saying we will provide 
a funding plan on how you fund the acquisition of the locomotives from 
the four EOM’s.   
 
The value was then increased to an amount not exceeding 
R265 000 500, that’s the cap and as well the contract was now 
extended to 18 May 2016 or until such time that Transnet notifies 
Regiments that its deliverables have been successfully completed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that could presumably take ten years, 
10 
two, five, have your pick. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Whichever comes first. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now again I go back, we are now in the 
original LOI/MSA read them together, the original contract amount is 
R35million, the first addendum to the MSA increases that value to 
R78million. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that happens April 2014? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  July 2015 that 78 further increases to a figure 
20 
not exceeding R265million. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is now the latest contract value. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s the latest contract value. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, please continue. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 142 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now in the slide we then bring all 
these agreements together to see from a legal point of view whether is 
there any sense that one can make of the agreements, we then sat with 
the third addendum to the LOI, or the purported third addendum dated 
24 t h February, our conclusion was that the LOI had only lapsed on 13 
November 2013, that is the first issue. 
 
So any attempt by anyone to extend the LOI is an attempt to 
do the impossible.   
 
Secondly Regiments was not even a party to the LOI, because 
that LOI was between Transnet and McKinsey. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So even if that lapsed it was 
impossible for Regiments in any event to conclude this agreement 
because they were not a party to that LOI.  So that’s the first issue that 
we address with the third addendum. 
 
We then looked at – because you will recall that there’s a 
letter that we got, that Transnet got on the 16 t h of April being advised 
that there was a cession that occurred on the 5 t h of February.  We have 
not been able to locate, despite numerous searches and enquiries we 
could not locate this cession. 
20 
 
Now again even if McKinsey ceded as their letter suggests 
there was nothing to cede, because the LOI, whatever rights that they 
had they ceased to exist at least on the morning of the 1 s t of November 
2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  1 s t December 2013? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 143 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So it was legally and practically 
impossible to cede rights that do not exist.   We looked at the MSA that 
was concluded on the 21 February.  That MSA as well suffers the very 
same fate that the preceding document suffered in a sense that the 
[indistinct] lapsed on the 30 November and besides on the 21 February 
McKinsey had already ceded his rights on the 5 February to or in favour 
of Regiments.  So it could not have concluded this MSA because it did 
not have any rights notwithstanding the fact that the LOI had not lapsed 
10 
but they had already on their own version ceded the rights in terms of 
the LOI to Regiments on the 5 February.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The first addendum between 
Transnet and Regiments the 24 April addendum same issue.  The first 
addendum to the MSA derives its [indistinct] from an invalid MSA.  So if 
the MSA is invalid it goes without saying that even this first addendum 
as well is invalid and in any event Regiments was not a party to that 
MSA because the session that they made reference to on the 5 
February occurred when LOI had already lapsed.  A similar fate 
20 
bedevils the second addendum to the MSA between Regiments and 
Transnet for the same reasons that we have used for the previous ones 
equally apply to this second addendum.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is insofar as the fate of 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 144 of 235 
 
these agreements come to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may continue.  We follow. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now in the next slide we then 
said that was now insofar as agreements are concerned.  We then tried 
to on the left column put up all these agreements and attempt to 
compare them with the payments that we know Transnet paid to both 
McKinsey and Regiments.  By 1 – 18 November 2013 I did [indistinct] 
already that McKinsey was already paid an amount of R11 003 000,00.  
So at least we can safely say these payments arose as a result of the – 
the LOI and their respective – that is the first two addendi. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We then pick up when we 
analysed the spreadsheets was this came from – we analysed the 
invoices that were submitted to Transnet and appearing on a payment 
records of Transnet for these periods.  We are not necessarily 
attaching these payments to these agreements but we are simply 
saying these payments seem to have occurred at least during the 
period of the purported existence of these agreements.  By – between 
18 February and 20 – 18 February 2014 and 7 April 2014 Regiments 
was already paid an amount of R36 765 000,00 that is by 7 April.  As 
20 
well during the period of the first addendum there was a payment of 
R79 230 000,00 because there was an invoice that Regiments raised on 
the 27 March for services that they have already rendered.  Lastly the 
second addendum that period we know that Regiments raised an 
invoice in March which was paid on – in June on the 11 June 2015 that 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 145 of 235 
 
was 6 March 2015 for an amount of R189 240 000,00.  So those are the 
payments that we could group in relation to the agreements that we 
have analysed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But what you point out to the Chair is 
notwithstanding how you present this information.  We should not 
understand the payments to Regiments the respective payments to 
derive from the contracts that are placed next to the payment. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  All you tried to do is you highlight the dates 
on which certain contracts came into being purportedly. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you – you consider in that period whether 
Regiments was paid. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you determined that? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But we cannot go so far as to say that they 
claimed the R36 million on the basis of the third addendum or the MSA? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We understand.  Yes you may continue. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair the – and this speaks to – 
this slide speaks to the payment of R79 208 000,00. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is your pay – slide 87? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Slide 87. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 146 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  You recall earlier when we put up 
the table of the amounts in the letter of intent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And the MSA albeit concluded a 
year later those two documents allocated an amount of R13.5 million 
for the technical evaluation and execution services.  So this in a sense 
was the assistance or advisory services that was going to be provided 
to Transnet in the evaluation of the bids that were received and 
ultimate conclusion of the locomotive supply agreements with the four 
OEM’s.  Now on the 16 April 2014 there is a memorandum prepared by 
10 
Mr Anoj Singh to the then Group Chief Executive Mr Brian Molefe 
requesting approval of an amount of R78.4 million excluding VAT as a 
success fee to Regiments on the basis that Regiments as part of their 
scope in evaluating – assisting in the evaluation of the bids they 
achieved some services for Transnet.  So on that basis Regiments 
ought to be paid an amount of R78.4 million for that work.  And we now 
know that on the 17 April that memorandum was approved.  This 
approval in actual fact that culminated in the signing of the first 
addendum to the MSA where that amount of R79 million was paid.  The 
view that we held and still hold is that this approval of this amount was 
20 
irregular because the LOI when the McKinsey Consortium won the bid 
there was a specific allocation for this very savings that Regiments had 
just provided and the amount that was allocated for that service was 
R13.5 million.  So it cannot be that now there must be a memorandum 
that purports or creates an impression that as a result of Regiments 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 147 of 235 
 
intervention on the work that in any event was awarded to the 
Consortium and budgeted for that Regiments must now be paid R78.4 
million.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now this memorandum you speak of you say it 
emanated from this then Group CFO Mr Singh to Mr Molefe.  In that 
memorandum does Mr Singh support payment of this R78 million?  
Does he argue for its payment? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes he does argue for the 
payment of this amount. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Does he make reference to any document 
10 
presumably emanating from Regiments as to how that amount of R78 
million was arrived at and how it directly – how that – whatever 
particular service directly resulted in the savings that is claimed? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair in that memorandum we 
know when we conducted our investigations that there was actually a 
proposal coming from Regiments where they were motivating that due 
to the hard work that have conducted as part of assisting Transnet in 
evaluation they obtained some savings for Transnet and as a result of 
that saving they were motivating that they must be paid a success fee 
for that savings.  So that we picked up that document was coming 
20 
initially from Regiments.  It was for a higher figure but we know that 
when the memorandum was prepared it was for this figure by the very 
same reasoning that was advanced by Regiments in their letter were 
captured in this specific memorandum.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now do either document speak to the original 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 148 of 235 
 
R13.5 budgeted amount for the very same service?  So is this a 
payment of 78 over and above the 13.5 or is the 13.5 now included in 
the 78?  Do any of the two documents speak to this issue? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  From my recollection Chair I do 
not have the document in front of me now but the 78.4 was not a top up 
from the look of things.  This was now just a self-standing amount that 
is supposed to be paid to Regiments. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may proceed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that 78.4 is not 78 around the 78.4 million? 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is 78 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ,4? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  400 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thousand.  78.4 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Your slide does not have – it just have R78.4. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  78 – 78.4 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Million? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  There is it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Is that on the projection it says 
68.4? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh well… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 4 is very close to the comma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the one on the hard copy at page 87 … 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 149 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The last bullet point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that was has got a million on the screen. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This one does not have that on the hard cover. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The last bullet point reference to 78.4 – the 
last bullet on the hard copy does not have the m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indicating that it is millions 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because that was changed – 
that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was subsequently corrected. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  When I became wiser on figures. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay please proceed.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the slides Chair it is just to 
reiterate the point that we made earlier when we looked at the – to 
explain to the Chair that the difference between Volume 2A and 2B to 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 150 of 235 
 
say there will be a witness that will in detail now analyse some of these 
transactions including this very same 78.4 but the point that we – the 
overall point that we make is that and it will also be demonstrated when 
that witness testifies that there was just no legal basis for Transnet to 
conclude an agreement to pay Regiments on any other figure that was 
not provided for in the MSA or at least even the LOI when it was still 
alive.  And that is – that work is contained in Volume 2B and the 
testimony will be led Friday morning.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there – were there common personalities on the 
part of Transnet that were involved in all of these addenda and 
10 
agreements? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes on this one I think one can 
safely say I know as a matter of fact that Mr Anoj Singh was there.  On 
Mr Gama was around.  There is a Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi the head of 
treasury but he came just shortly after the conclusion of the first 79 
million but this specific one I know he was involved and he was quite 
appraised of the previous memorandum.  So it is those are the two that 
come to mind if I [indistinct].   
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that this might not have been covered it 
would be important to see who signed on each one of the agreements 
20 
and the addenda and apart from just signing if possible to see who was 
otherwise involved in the negotiations of these agreements and 
addenda even if they did not sign from Transnet’s side. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously it would be important also to see from 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 151 of 235 
 
either McKinsey’s side or Regiment’s side for what it is worth but 
particularly from Transnet it might be important to see who signed and 
who was involved in the negotiations or discussions apart from those 
who signed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair I – I believe that the first question can 
be immediately answered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With reference to a Mr Sedumedi can check 
my – whether I am correct it would appear from the LOI the first 
addendum to the LOI and the second addendum to the LOI all were 
10 
signed on behalf of Transnet by Mr Anoj Singh. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It would also appear from the records as well 
that agreement went through between Transnet and Regiments of 
January 2014. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That that signed by Mr Anoj Singh on behalf of 
Transnet. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So to was the MSA concluded between 
20 
Transnet and McKinsey in March of 2014 it was likewise signed by Mr 
Anoj Singh. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the two – the third alleged addendum to 
the LOI signed between Regiments and Transnet was once again signed 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 152 of 235 
 
by Mr Anoj Singh for Transnet and the last two addenda to the MSA now 
concluded between Transnet and Regiments were signed on behalf of 
Transnet by Mr Anoj Singh. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Am I correct? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So at least that – Mr Anoj Singh’s signature 
appears in all of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is common in all of them. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is a question of are there any other 
10 
signature? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That are appearing? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and are there any other Transnet people that 
were involved in the discussions or negotiations even if they did not 
sign? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair may I make a correction.  My junior 
points out to me that in fact the first addendum between McKinsey and 
Transnet are indicated was signed by Mr Anoj Singh for Transnet no it 
appears at page 6582 to have been signed by Mr Garry Pita. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. But we will prepare a full list 
based on the documentation made available to us indicating who signed 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 153 of 235 
 
on behalf of Transnet and whether there were any witnesses to such 
signatures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then that would then go to answering the 
next question that the Chair had posed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because I think over and above 
the agreements we must look at the various memoranda. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  How [indistinct] internally. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which approved or motivated for 
the conclusion of these transactions. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will do so Chair and revert. Thank you.  
You may continue Mr Sedumedi. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But the – this is – on slide 89 
speaks about in volume 4 page 5579.  It is a memorandum dated 28 
April 2015 by Mr Siyabonga Gama addressed to the board Acquisition 
And Disposal Committee requesting an approval to confine an 
appointment of G P Morgan to hedge the financial risks arising out of 
20 
the 1064 transaction.  Secondly … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry just to clarify.  We are finished on the 
topic now of the LOI’s and the MSA now changed topics we are now 
talking about J P Morgan and Trillian and the appointment. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 154 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of [indistinct]. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  My apologies for not  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  For not concluding properly on 
that topic. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thanks. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So in this memorandum Mr Gama 
requests approval that J P Morgan must be appointed to hedge the 
10 
financial risks.  That is the first assignment.  The second assignment is 
for J P Morgan to lead arrange and under-ride the ZAR Secret Club 
Loan.  What – and you will hear more about the club loan on Friday but 
in essence it was a syndication of various lenders for them to combine 
and provide the load because individually was – they could not 
[indistinct] the big amount that was requested so various lenders then 
considering their efforts each one contributing a specific amount that is 
why it is called a club loan.  It is a club of lenders.  So obviously then 
we will need a lead arranger to co-ordinate and show that all these 
participants are able to or synchronise their terms and conditions.  So 
20 
those are the two mandates that Mr Gama sought approval for.  And as 
well that very same memorandum as well increased the extension of 
contract for Regiments from 99.5 million to 265.5 million.  But for now 
nothing [indistinct] on this specific third bullet.  The focus is about the 
two bullets above.  Confinement for hedging and lead arranging two 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 155 of 235 
 
separate mandates.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Indeed on 29 April the BADC 
considered the matter and J P Morgan was only appointed to hedge the 
financial risks not a [indistinct].  So – and as well for record purposes it 
also confirmed this extension of contract for Regiments.  From the 
reading of the minutes there is no indication whatsoever that the BADC 
ever considered the other second request to appoint J P Morgan to lead 
and arrange the club loan as requested.  But it confirms that J P 
Morgan can be appointed to hedge the financial risks. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now that is what it is.  However 
five months after that appointment on the 17 September Mr Gama 
prepares another memorandum requesting the BADC to approve the 
substitution of J P Morgan by a company called Trillian Asset Managers 
for the lead arranger role for the club loan.  Chair will recall that 
Advocate said that the BADC never or J P Morgan at least from the 
approval of the BADC never had the mandate to perform the lead 
arranger role.  However this memorandum now requests that Trillian 
must replace J P Morgan on that role.  And indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that - I am sorry.  Did you say that you 
had regard to the minutes of the BADC meeting and there is nothing 
reflected in those minutes that indicates that they considered this part 
of the request? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  The minutes appear on 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 156 of 235 
 
Volume 4 page 5515 of the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that memorandum indeed was 
approved on 1 October where at Trillian replaced J P Morgan for the 
lead arranger role in the ZAR Club Loan.  So it was our finding that the 
entry of Trillian into the system was irregular in the sense that that 
function was never assigned to J P Morgan in a very first place so it 
10 
could not have been that then Trillian could then step into the shoes of 
J P Morgan to lead and arrange the ZAR Club Loan.  And for that 
service Trillian was paid an amount of R93 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the resolution of the – of the BD 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The BADC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the BADC – did the resolution also say nothing 
about this part? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It was quiet Chair.  We can refer 
to … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi perhaps let us take it in turn.  
20 
Chair unfortunately for that we are going to have to make you pull out 
Volume 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have to deal with it now.  If you want to 
deal with it later.  I just wanted to have an idea because you said from 
the minutes it does not appear that they – that committee considered 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 157 of 235 
 
and I wondered whether they might have resolved without considering.  
So… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is our [indistinct] to consider the documents 
now Chair.  It is the right time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  So and for that we need to go to Volume 
4 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may request you to pull it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Am I still going to need Volume 7? 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or Volume 1? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No Chair we are done with Volume 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Volume 1? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We need – Volume 4 is our last volume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only Volume 4? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Only Volume 4 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What page? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: Let us start with the memorandum by Mr Gama 
to BADC that is at 5579. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that the memorandum you referred to Mr 
Sedumedi? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct dated 28 April 2015. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 158 of 235 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is addressed to the Acquisition 
Disposal Committee from Mr Siyabonga Gama. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   
“The purpose of the submission is to request the 
Acquisitions and Disposals Committee to: 
1.  Approve the confined appointment of J P Morgan.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   
“To hedge the financial risks emanating from the 1.5 billion 
10 
US dollar see D below back into ZAR South African Rands. 
2.  Approved the confined appointment of J P Morgan to 
lead and underwrite the equivalent syndicated ZAR 
loan of 1.5 billion dollars.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So those were the two approvals 
that were sought by this memorandum.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you leave that page there is a third 
one regarding Regiments now. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay oh that is the one that we 
20 
spoke about earlier on. 
“To approve the contract extension from 99.5 million 
to 265.5 million for the appointment of Regiments for 
transaction 
advisory 
services 
and 
support 
to 
Transnet on the 1064 locomotive transaction.” 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 159 of 235 
 
You will recall Chair we spoke of the second – no that is not the one.  
Let me just ignore that one ja.  So this was that one does not appear so 
this is the approvals. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That were then sought by Mr 
Gama from the BADC. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And then if you look at volume 4 page 
5515 that is the resolution.  No not this one.  My apologies - 5515. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I had – I had the wrong document. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Paragraph 5.4. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you say can I just confirm what that 
document is? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This document … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is a resolution by … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is a certified extract from minutes 
20 
of the meeting of the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee held on 
9 April 2015 and item 5.4 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
Management 
distributed 
the 
documentation in the meeting.  This will be that memorandum that we 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 160 of 235 
 
spoke about earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The documentation was taken as 
read. 
“The purpose of a submission was to request the 
Committee 
to 
approve 
the 
following: 
 
the 
confinement appoint of JP Morgan to hedge the 
financial risks emanating from the US$1.5 billion.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “The contract extension for 
10 
the appointment of Regiments for transaction 
advisory services and support to the company on 
the 1 064 locomotive transaction from 99 million to 
(indistinct) million.” 
You will note from this Chair that the only reference that the minutes 
refer to is the hedging component.  Not that second element that I 
spoke about regarding the lead arrangements and this – if you look at 
the resolution then that appears on the next page how did it then 
resolve on this matter. 
“Resolve 
that 
the 
Committee 
approved 
the 
20 
following:  the confined appointment of JP Morgan 
to hedge the financial risks emanating from the 
US$1.5 billion CDB loan into South African Rands 
and as well to complete the point to the contract 
extension for the appointment of Regiments for 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 161 of 235 
 
transaction advisory services and support the 
company on the 1 064 locomotive and as well that 
the delegation of authority to the (indistinct) GCE to 
approve the documentation relation to the confined 
process.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is what the BADC resolved on 
this issue which is we had said in our point that a review of these 
minutes indicate that there was no consideration of that request to lead 
arrange which is why it becomes strange that on 1 October the very 
10 
same day received or at least before the day received there is a 
memorandum that is prepared by Mr Gama requesting a substitution of 
JP Morgan for this with Regiments for this service and that is then 
subsequently approved by BADC. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Trillian not Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you …? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get to know whether the agenda or whether 
the supporting documents that were actually placed before the BADC 
Committee included this part that was not reflected in the resolution.  
20 
Did the – did it reach that point – was it ever before them?  Do – do 
you know about that? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether what was ultimately before them might not 
have included this – that part? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 162 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  From the look of things Chair – look 
this specific one we know it was signed off by all the relevant parties 
that are required to sign and the next activity on the 28 t h is the actual 
sitting of this meeting.  There is no other meeting of BADC.  So the 
only issue pertaining to JP Morgan would have been entertained at this 
specific meeting.  What we are obviously not privy to is whether maybe 
either in the morning of the meeting maybe that component would have 
been withdrawn but the point that we wanted to advance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Was simply to say … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The subsequent appointment of 
Trillian purporting to replace JP Morgan cannot be correct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because there was never any 
approval … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of that specific act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the point that we … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand that point.  I am going beyond 
that.  I am – I am – because you said the minutes do not reflect that 
the Committee ever discussed that component – you know.  What I am 
wondering is whether when the Committee was considering this issue 
what was before them included that component or not because if it did 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 163 of 235 
 
include them – if – if the – if what was before them did include that 
component one could have looked to them to say what happened to that 
component but if one does not know whether that component did reach 
them that might be a different issue.  Now the memorandum that had 
been prepared did include – include it but the question is whether we 
know that that memorandum … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ever … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was left before the Committee as we see it. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As we see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I think I have got some (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Although Chair I must say the minute of the – 
of BADC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the opening page of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It quotes verbatim … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is set out under purpose in the 
memorandum. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it repeats precisely … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What has – has been sought to be approved 
… 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 164 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that reads exactly the same way as the 
memorandum reads … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But that however does not answer the 
question whether the memorandum itself physically served before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Or whether it was quoted from but we know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We know that the minute does record the 
10 
three specific approvals that were been sought at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well no that – that does help. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the sense that if the minutes reflect that – reflect 
that … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What it means is that the – the Committee at least at 
a certain stage of the meeting was aware … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That among other things they were required to 
20 
approve that component as well … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In fact Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we see at the – when we look at the 
resolution that it is not there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 165 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  When we look at page 5515 volume 4 that is 
the extract of the minute.  At 5515 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It starts off precisely with the approvals being 
sought from the Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 5516 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It then lists the resolutions taken by the 
10 
Committee … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the resolutions exclude … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  One of the requested approvals being in 
respect of the appointment of “lead arranger”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – did you receive comments from those 
concerned to this criticism on your part of how this issue was handled 
20 
and what – what their comments as to how they could have Regiments 
take the place of JP Morgan in regard to an issue that had never been 
approved by the Committee? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair by the time we completed this 
portion of our investigation Mr Gama was no longer part of Transnet.  
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 166 of 235 
 
So we could not (indistinct) him on this aspect but I know when we 
interviewed Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi because he was a compiler of this 
document as it appears on the memorandum.  He could not provide a 
coherent answer on this issue because there were other queries that 
we raised that were not making any sense including the subsequent 
memorandum to appoint Trillian to substitute JP Morgan.  We were 
hoping that at his disciplinary hearing he was going to be able to 
answer that but when he received a letter intending to suspend him he 
resigned from Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not – you did not try to get any answers 
10 
from members of the BA – B … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  ADC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ADC ja – that Committee – BADC? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No.  The BADC Members – you must 
remember BADC is comprised of Board Members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I accept that. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So we did – we did not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
The 
modus 
operandi 
of 
the 
investigation was … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Internally focused … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – it is … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Something that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And part of it is regrettable because some of those 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 167 of 235 
 
people would not – I assume - I am sure there would have been some 
who would have been quite happy to cooperate … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And give answers and those answers could have been 
helpful – you know? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say how come – what happened here and they 
might have been able to say well as among ourselves as Members of 
the Committee there was – here are of the things that were happening 
and so on and so on.  So that part is regrettable. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair perhaps not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because that is a role that can be played by 
this Commission. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  MNS assists us insofar as it managed to do 
investigations up to a certain point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Any gaps that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, no.  If I was in charge of Transnet and I 
paid money for people to investigate I would not want them to 
investigate and not interview people who could have important 
information because some time later a Commission might look into that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no Chair it is … 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 168 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would want them to – I would want them to do their 
best interview those people.  If they refuse and they do not have power 
to force them that is another story. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But all those who are happy to assist because maybe 
they were not party to any agendas – you know – should be 
interviewed.  I want to know what they know. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no Chair.  I absolutely agree.  I do not 
take issue with that.  I was just saying when the Chair says it is 
regrettable my point was as far as the Commission is concerned not all 
10 
is lost yet … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that I accept. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because the Commission can still do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that I accept.  It is just that if they had been able 
to do that we might not have had to – to do that because we might have 
answers already. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But Chair you will recollect ours – 
this was – is a legal analysis.  The documents as they stand they speak 
for themselves right.  It is clear whether there is a view that a BADC 
Member had now we did not think JP Morgan was (indistinct).  It is 
20 
immaterial.  The point is JP Morgan as applying for item 1.  So 
therefore it is impossible for anybody to substitute item 2 which JP 
Morgan never had in the very place.  So the documents in our view they 
spoke for themselves to be able to be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think that – that would have satisfied me and 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 169 of 235 
 
I do not think that Transnet authorities should be satisfied with that.  
Actually the fact that that happened should want Transnet authorities to 
want to understand how it happened.  Were there – what was the role 
of various members of the … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  BADC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Committee.  Were there elements within the 
Committee who were pushing a certain agenda or not and you cannot 
know that without talking to people – you see.  Documents are not 
going to tell you everything.  So that is my point and there maybe 
people who were members of that Committee who might say to you if 
10 
you approach them as an investigator I will tell you what happened.  So 
and so was saying this or saying this who have been put under 
pressure by so and so and so and so.  You get that information.  That is 
useful information for Transnet authorities.  That is useful information 
for us as a taxpayers.  Okay, alright. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thank you again Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but as I said to the extent that people might not 
have cooperated and you did not have power to force them.  That is 
understandable.  The part that I am saying regrettable is not try.  Okay, 
thank you. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thank you again Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then getting to your last point the 
substation of Trillian and the lead arrange role. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 170 of 235 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You expressed the view that JP Morgan was 
never appointed in the first place in that role so therefore Trillian could 
not have replaced it. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Trillian could not have replaced JP 
Morgan for that function and we know they were actually paid an 
amount of – that is Trillian – they were paid an amount of 93 million for 
lead arranging in (indistinct).  The reason that the phrase “lead 
arranger” is in quotes is that you will hear in the testimony that in 
actual fact that service was never rendered by Trillian.  It was 
10 
performed by Regiments.  The documents that were reviewed indicate 
that that was the function that was actually performed by Regiments not 
even Trillian and that is part of litigation that Transnet has instituted 
against Trillian to recover this amount and as well there is litigation 
between Trillian and Regiments where they are having a dispute over 
this (indistinct).  Regiments correctly so indicates that they have 
performed this service.  That is why the “lead arranger” was put in 
quotes for that purpose. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may continue. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And that Chair will be the conclusion 
20 
of my testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much.  If a need arises you will be 
asked to come back but thank you very much for – for your evidence. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair before you excuse Mr Sedumedi two 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 171 of 235 
 
things.  First is the Chair had posed certain questions to Mr Sedumedi 
yesterday regarding in particular Ms Tshepe’s … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Oh yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Attendance at the BADC Meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And regarding the question of delegation of 
authority whether firstly Mr Gama had the authority to change the 
evaluation criteria and secondly whether Mr Jiyane had the power and 
authority to authorise the payment of 1.3 billion to CSR.  Mr Sedumedi 
has found certain documentation and has prepared a statement he must 
10 
still sign and we shall submit that it is a small bundle together with 
supporting documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I think it is self-explanatory and will not 
require Mr Sedumedi’s presence in the witness box.  With permission 
Chair we may do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Will it be an affidavit or just a statement? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just a statement currently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Unless the Chair has a preference. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know what the contents are but if it is an 
affidavit and there is nothing controversial he will not need to come 
back and testify about – about it really but if it is a statement that is 
not an affidavit and it remains as a statement that might not have the 
right status.  So preferably it should be an affidavit but it just depends 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 172 of 235 
 
on its contents. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the contents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – I will let you exercise your – your judgment … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair we shall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of its contents.  It may be a statement and 
still be just as fine.  I just do not know until I see (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will reapply our mind … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Minds to it and see what works best Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and then we shall revert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Secondly Mr Sedumedi you – you have 
testified as to certain aspects of the MNS investigation? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Could you advise the Chair how MNS 
proposes to take the rest of the outstanding issues forward? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  The Chair would recall that if 
you – if one had – you regard to slide 62.  The slides must not go too 
far back.  It is just indicates – it is a diagram indicating the various 
20 
transactions that we investigated.  My testimony touched on 95, 100, 
some parts of 1 064.  I also touched a little bit on the procurement of 
transaction advisors but on 95 – sorry – on 100 and 1 064 we did – I 
did not elaborate much on the reasons that were advanced for the 
increase in ATC because even on 100 there was an increase in the 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 173 of 235 
 
ATC.  So Mr Alister Chabi will come and testify about that aspect.  
Secondly the issue of the relocation of the two (indistinct) to Durban.  A 
colleague Mr Thobani Mnyandu who is a Director at the firm focusing on 
construction engineering role will come and testify about that.  Lastly 
on Friday Dr Jonathan Bloom will then unpack the various transactions 
that were concluded by Transnet on the advice of the transaction 
advisors.  So that will be the evidence that will be led by MNS on those 
two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And lastly Chair the Chair will recall that 
10 
yesterday Mr Sedumedi indicated that they have a list of people they 
have interviewed in the course of investigations on these transactions.  
Chair if I may … 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 20 or I think that is … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If they are … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what he said I think, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I enquire Chair if somebody managed to 
slip the following into your bundle while the Chair was probably not 
aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not seen anything. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  An EXHIBIT BB8A after the thank you page is 
there no documentation the Chair’s … 
CHAIRPERSON:  After? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The thank you page of Mr Sedumedi’s slide 
presentation. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 174 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that I have seen. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that – the thank you page is at slide 92. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me see.  No they did not follow your instructions. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Clearly not Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But I confirm that a list has been provided … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And your BB8A shall be updated accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  By the way in regard to each one of those 20 or 
so people who you interviewed there will be a transcript of the 
10 
interview? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair I can confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In actual fact … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  By last night when I left the office … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
The 
colleagues 
were 
already 
photocopying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  All the transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All – okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So we hope that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That would be very helpful. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 175 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And basically the transcripts take the place of 
statements or there will also be additional – there will be statements 
from each one of them or just the … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Transcript of interviews? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  These were the transcripts of 
interviews … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the interviews. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And professionally transcribed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  By the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Those who are qualified transcribers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  You are excused. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair as the Chair indicated yesterday we are 
running till five today – pm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The next witness is ready … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I think yesterday the Chair took a 10 
minute break at half past three. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 176 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see it is now 25 past three.  May I request 
that we take that break now?  That would allow for a changing of the 
guard.  We need to set up the next witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because he also is working off slides and we 
will couple that with a comfort break and we might be back at 20 to four 
and run until five if that would suit the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No let us take a 10 minute break then. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we will resume at did you say – no it would be 15 
if you said 20 to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I would like about 15 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  15 minutes? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It will be a 15 minute break.  We will resume at 
20 to four. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Ms Sello? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are ready thank you Chair.  Chair we call 
the next witness, also involved in the MNS Investigation, we have 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 177 of 235 
 
cleared your table Chair of all files and as the previous witness this 
witness will present evidence by way of slides.  We have prepared the 
Chair a copy which we beg to hand in and Chair we have taken the 
liberty of marking that one EXHIBIT BB8B and Chair it has the same 
problem as the previous, the 8 is very close to B and they shall all be 
corrected at the same time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  B5 that has been handed up now dealing with 
Origin 1064 review of estimated total cost of R38.6billion evaluation of 
a R15.6billion increase in estimated total cost, will be marked EXHIBIT 
BB8B. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I almost said BBB, because the 8 looks almost like a 
B. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I hasten to add an error Chair hoping you will 
not point that out but nonetheless yes, it shall also be corrected as with 
the first pack of slides. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair before we proceed 888B is mainly in 
two parts, the slide one up to slide 32 deal with the review of the 
increase of the approved ETC of R38.6billion and that relates to the 
20 
1064.  From page 33 the witness will deal with an evaluation of the 
increase of the 100 locomotives and well it’s a very brief set of slides 
that one, the issues are not as significant as in the 1064.  In the course 
of this presentation the witness will refer to a document that is in the 
MNS exhibits, just one document.  To avoid too many files we have 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 178 of 235 
 
taken the liberty of extracting that document from the relevant files and 
we have attached to the slides and it will appear after the tab in 
Volume one 4532 to 4370.  With this at hand we need not refer to any 
other file Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that’s fine.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On that basis may I request that the witness 
be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, swear in the witness. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
ALISTER CHABI:  (duly sworn, states) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, Ms Sello you will have to repeat the 
witnesses name in full. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes I will repeat the name in full Chair, I know 
the first name to be Alister, one “l”, surname Chabi, C-h-a-b-i.   Thank 
you Chair.  Mr Chabi could you tell the Chair about yourself, insofar as 
your professional life and qualifications are concerned. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay as I have already mentioned my name is 
Alister Chabi, I am an actuary in terms of qualifications, I am a Fellow 
of the Faculty of Actuaries, that’s a United Kingdom body.  I am also a 
Chartered Enterprise Risk Actuary and that’s a global association that 
20 
grants actuarial associations across the world the right to confer 
designations on actuaries, the CER designation Actuary, sorry.  I also 
hold a Masters in Business Administration from the University of – from 
Gibbs sorry and I also hold a Bachelors in Economic Science from the 
University of Wits – Witwatersrand. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 179 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank You and what do you currently do and 
where are you employed, if at all? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay for the better part of my 12 year working 
career I have been advising Trustee Boards on their pensions and 
investments, 
in 
particular 
formulating 
investment 
policies 
and 
strategies and evaluating pension funds along with that opening on the 
salvage of those retirement funds, largely for corporates.  I currently – 
well the bulk of my time currently, besides working on this project has 
been taken up by the counsel for medical schemes which is the 
regulatory body for medical schemes in South Africa, I sit on the 
10 
costing committees and technical expert on that committee assisting in 
evaluating financial models and developing them. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And are you attached to any firm in particular 
currently and if so what firm? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I am All5 Holding Company I am a founding 
member and employee of the entity. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now you come at a time, or you appear before 
the Chair at a time when we are considering investigations conducted 
by MNS into certain transactions within Transnet, can you inform the 
Chair what role you played in that regard and how you came to be 
20 
involved? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   So in May of 2018 MNS, that is Mncedisi Ndlovu 
& Sedumedi Attorneys approached our entity All5 Holding Company to 
assist it with the financial aspects of the acquisition of the 1064 
locomotives. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 180 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it’s correct that the company then 
appointed you to lead the team to undertake the work? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    You deal with the mandate you received from 
MNS in your slides. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Agreed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So if we could then turn to your second slide, 
page 2 of your slides and then you can take the Chair through the 
mandate that you had received from MNS. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   Okay, thank you Chair, so as we have it 
10 
overhead, essentially when MNS approached us in May of 2018, they 
wanted assistance with the aspects involved in the 1064 acquisition 
and they were investigating alleged irregularities within the acquisition 
of the 1064 locomotives and what they’d asked us to do at the time was 
to assess, basically analyse the financial model back in the business 
case that led to the transaction going ahead (indistinct) Board 
(indistinct) transaction, in particular the  evaluating on the 38.6billion 
that was approved in 2013 by the Board was indeed an acceptable 
estimated total cost for the transaction and then thereafter to look at 
the reasons put forward for the increase in the (indistinct) cost from 
20 
38.6billion to 545billion and give an opinion as to whether those 
increases are valid and were they not provide (indistinct) a reasonable 
increase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay I see you have listed the mandate you 
have broken it up to three, 1, 2 and 3 and 3 has got 3 further sub-
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 181 of 235 
 
sections and you propose to deal with each in turn. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I do advocate, so the presentation is structured 
in 3 parts, the first part deals with the assumptions on the identified 
variables okay, assessing whether those assumptions were indeed 
reasonable.  The second part of the presentation looks at the 
38.6billion so in other words the accuracy of that ETC.  The last part 
looks into the increase the plausibility that those reasons put forward 
for the increase and our being what a reasonable increase should have 
been at the time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay when you’re ready then you may take us 
10 
through the first issue, the reasonability of variables and assumptions. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay thank you advocate.  So the approach we 
have taken is will they have the mandate and will they have the fund 
finding and then we go into detail on the methodology taken to arrive at 
the finding.  So starting with the first which is the business case, in 
other words looking at the variables and the assumptions around the 
variables and determining whether they were reasonable at the time we 
conclude that the assumptions in relation to those variables were 
reasonable and we will touch on why we felt that they were reasonable  
when we...(intervention). 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for that you’d like us to turn over to slide 
4? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Let me just look at the slide number here, slide 
4…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I use the page numbering as the slide 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 182 of 235 
 
numbering if that’s okay with you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So I’m still on slide 3 but we’ll carry on with 
slide 4. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Whenever you’re ready. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   Thank you, okay advocate so we felt it’s 
important before getting into the variable and assumptions to explain to 
you Chair, how the model actually worked, okay, in other words how the 
revenue was projected, how the costs were projected, what the 
profitability was around the project at the time and then, of course, 
conclude with the assumptions and backing, those projections.  Now 
10 
two measures were, in particular, which is in the business case and 
actually arriving at – in our (indistinct) the business case okay and 
those are the net present value and estimated total cost now.  At the 
risk of stating the obvious Chair I think I will take the time to explain 
what the net present value is in this instance.  It essentially represents 
the expected profit in current money terms and that would have been 
April 2013 at the time and if that was positive, of course the project 
would go ahead if it met the requirements of the Board at the time.  So 
you would of course discount your revenue to current terms – discount 
your cost to current terms take the difference of the two and if that was 
20 
a positive figure then the project was a – would be deemed viable.  The 
estimated total cost, on the other hand, is a very simple summation of 
the cost of acquiring the locomotives in the various years, we’ll look at 
the delivery schedule in a bit and that was over a seven-year period 
starting 2013 to 2019, we’ll touch on that in a short while.  But going 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 183 of 235 
 
back to the net present value modelling that was over a 39-year period 
and I bring this up because it will become relevant when we look at the 
memorandum in a bit more detail later on in later slides. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    I’m moving on to slide 5, how is he revenue 
models at the time in the business case essentially.  The revenue was a 
tariff per ton per kilometre, okay.  So revenue is essentially taken as 
the product of the volume to be transported by these wagon okay by 
these locomotives at the time and the average distance to be travelled 
over the year by the tariff okay and that was over a 39-year period okay 
10 
from 2013 all the way to 2049, thereabout.  You had a number of costs 
in this instance, you had locomotive costs, you had wagon costs, 
infrastructure costs and so forth.  Your ETC actually sits within the 
locomotive costs so your ETC which is your estimated total cost is 
actually a part of the locomotive costs and I think we’ll look a bit later 
at what component or what percentage your ETC made of the first 
bullet there.  The first bullet is actually the total cost and ownership of 
the locomotive in other words everything relating to the operation of 
that locomotive, the direct cost of the operating of the locomotive and 
those include personnel, maintenance, insurance, emission costs are 
20 
also included in that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    We then look at the net present value and 
we’ve already touched on the revenue and on the cost components 
okay, what you have – what you see there, basically is what the present 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 184 of 235 
 
value of your costs were at the time, what the present value of your 
revenue was at the time.  The revenue was 109billion, you can see the 
net present value, which is the expected profit in current money terms 
as at April 2013 was just about two and a half percent of your revenue, 
that’s a very thin margin to say the least.  Your costs were in the region 
of 107odd billion rands, okay and as I’ve already mentioned your ETC 
forms part of your total costs for ownership as you can see that there’s 
diesel TCO and ten there’s electric TCO, TCO standing for total cost for 
ownership, okay and the ETC made up just over 47% of those costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  The present value that you’re looking at about 
20billion so your ETC in April 2013 was about 20odd billion rands and 
then we talk of 38.6billion but as I said the ETC of 38.6billion is just a 
summation over the 7-year period, when you discount that, using that 
hurdle rate that you see there of 18.56 percent you get about 20odd 
billion.  Of the total cost your ETC made up about 20 percent of your 
total cost.  Like I say in the grander scheme of things it was a very - a 
small part of your overall cost. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And net present value calculated 2.7billion as 
calculated on the basis of a hurdle rate of 18.56 firstly, if you could just 
20 
remind us what the hurdle rate is and secondly why you used 18.56. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    Okay so – this is not what I used this is what 
was employed in the business case and everything that you see here is 
actually taken from the business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 185 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   Okay that was put together for the Board at the 
time now the hurdle rate is essentially what your shareholders – 
generally what shareholders would want from a project before they go 
ahead with the investment.  We talk hurdle rate, we talk discount rate.  
The discount rate is, by definition quite different to what you would – to 
the hurdle rate in the sense that your discount rate is what you would, 
essentially value the project at, it reflects the risks inherent in the 
project whereas your hurdle rate is essentially what the shareholders 
want before they can go ahead with the project.  Your hurdle rate would 
obviously be slightly more than your weight average cost of capital and 
10 
what that is essentially, what it costs the entity to – what the capital 
cost within the entity, I mean within the organisation.  You would 
obviously have equity, you would obviously have debt okay, the 
weighted average of those two would give you the weighted average 
cost of capital. Your hurdle rate would sit slightly above that to, of 
course, account for the cost of that capital.  18.56 was used in the 
business case as a reflection of the risk inherent in this particular 
project, okay there’s a policy of course that backs this number up, a 
very detailed process in actually arriving at this discount rate a lot of 
his is actually an evidence based approach that was taken to arrive at 
20 
this discounted rate 18.56 okay.  It is one of the variables we have 
looked at and we thought it was reasonable given that this project was 
a Green Fields project, Green Fields, meaning it’s something  that 
Transnet was undertaking for the first time, it had no history of having 
undertaken such a project in time passed.  So discount of 18.56 was 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 186 of 235 
 
deemed appropriate. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the time. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  At the time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the hurdle rate of 18.56 is prescribed by 
the policy? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   It is prescribed by the policy yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And all the  drafters of the business case 
had to do in determining the NPV is to go to the policy see what the 
applicable hurdle rate was at the time and apply to the calculations in 
order to arrive at a correct – at an actual net present value? 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Indeed correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you, you may proceed. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Now the next slide basically tries to show you 
Chair what the impact is on the net present value as you change the 
discount rate which happens to be the hurdle rate here.  As you can 
see that net present value actually increases as the discount rate 
decreases as I’ve already mentioned the discount rate is a reflection of 
the risk inherent within the project.  So this analysis that you have here 
shows that dropping the discount rate from 18.6 percent to 12.6 percent 
increases your profit from 27billion, your net present value, sorry, to 
20 
34billion, that’s a huge increase, just a side note that the 12.6 was 
actually the weight average cost of capital for Transnet.  Now we have 
there what is called the internal rate of return it’s essentially  what the 
project is expected – was expected at the time to give you over the 
investment term which was 39 years in this instance and that was 19.6 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 187 of 235 
 
percent and we’ve already spoken about how thin that profit margin 
was, it was sitting – it sat at 2.5 percent, very thin and if you look at 
that internal rate of return it is not too far from the risk discount rate.  
Bearing in mind the risk discount rate is a reflection of the risk inherent 
within that project so if the risk had to increase slightly this project 
could easily go from a profit position to a loss making position. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes thank you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    So that is essentially the business case as I 
have presented to you there it’s a very, very high level summary of 
what would have been put forward to the Board at the time.  Now when 
10 
I look at some of the variables and assumptions around those variables 
and what we looked at was the inflation assumption used in the 
modelling, we’ve actually just pulled up the key variables without – are 
worth discussing given that the context is – well we’re talking about 
escalations and Forex okay so we restricted what we were discussing 
here to economic financial variables as opposed to the engineering 
aspects, the 1064 locomotives and so forth.  Now starting with the 
assumption that was used for SA inflation PPI was used and I guess the 
question that would come up is, was PPI the right index to use, you’re 
looking at locomotives, you’re looking at the manufacturing sector, 
20 
produce a price inflation would ideally be the right index to use and not 
the consumer price inflation which is a different index to the producer 
price inflation.  Now what was assumed in the business case for PPI 
was a rate of 5.3 all the way to 5.9 percent okay, we were pretty happy 
with that given what – well where inflation was in the past and going 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 188 of 235 
 
forward what the Reserve Bank tries to talk in terms of inflation the 
upper bound is 6 percent, it’s an assumption pretty close to that for us 
was – we felt was pretty reasonable.  Okay foreign currency, we’ll talk 
about that in a bit, the hurdle rate we have spoken about it was a 6 
percent margin over the weighted average cost of capital and we have 
mentioned as well that it was evidenced based.  The approach taken to 
a (indistinct) 18.56 was an evidenced based approach.  Okay so a lot of 
work went into arriving at that rate including researching over 160 
companies across the globe. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay and you conclude on that, that they had 
10 
already (indistinct) of 18.6 was reasonable in the circumstances. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    It was reasonable ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    When we compared the US – what they 
assumed, so SA PPI was of course for the local content inflation, there 
was a foreign content or a foreign component to the locomotives and 
you had to allow for inflation on that side as well on that part and what 
was assumed the business case was CPI, the consumer price index as 
opposed to the producer price index.  We felt that the producer price 
index would have been more appropriate however they’ve assumed a 
20 
consumer price index.  What we have put before you there is the 
correlation between US CPI and US PPI and you can see they are 
highly correlated and positively so, in fact when you look at the long-
term average for US CPI and US PPI the difference is about 0.27 
percent on the yearly basis, 3.26 versus 301 we felt using US, I mean 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 189 of 235 
 
CPI as opposed to PPI was therefore more conservative, being a higher 
figure.  That of course would have the impact of reducing the net 
present value but then of course erring of the side of caution, so were 
pretty comfortable with that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then the use of PPI would actually have 
given better results. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    If you had used PPI correct because  you would 
have used a lower rate of inflation or riskalation, it’s termed riskalation 
here but …(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the use of CPI reflect a conservative 
10 
approach. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Indeed yes 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  We thought it would be important to show the 
impact of the local content assumptions employed in the model given 
that it’s quite a contentious issue – was or still is actually.  What was 
assumed the model was a 50 percent local content an assumption and a 
50 percent foreign content assumption.  We do know that at some point 
National Treasurer came out with a note stating that for diesels you had 
to have a local content of 55 percent at a minimum and for electrics 60 
20 
percent at a minimum, however what was employed in the business 
case at the time and my understanding from the legal expert is that the 
note was not out at the time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  However, what was the impact of that, was it 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 190 of 235 
 
material enough to evaluate the business case so what we show you 
there is that an increase from 50 percent to 60 percent for the local 
content component would have resulted in a slight drop in your ETC as 
you can see there from 38.6billion to 38.555, I think that’s about 0. – 
negative 0.12 percent.  The NPV would have increased slightly as you 
would expect from a drop in ETC. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Your costs drop, your expected profits increase – 
would have increased from 2.739billion to 2.75billion and that’s a 0.4 
percent increase.  You can see that the assumption was conservative in 
10 
this instance therefore acceptable and the difference is negligible in 
our view. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    So we accepted it and especially that it doesn’t 
invalidate the business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    So at a very high level, Chair, those are the 
assumptions that we thought would be important to bring to the fore 
and discuss with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    So up to this point you do not take any 
serious issue with the assumptions and variables you used for the 
business case? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    No we don’t take any issue with 
those…(intervention). 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 191 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    You deem them reasonable? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Then we can go to the second item of your 
opinion. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay so we now move to the second part of the 
presentation which looks at the estimate total cost of 38.6billion.  the 
mandate here was essentially to determine whether this amount was an 
acceptable estimated total cost.  In addition to that, to address the 
contentious issue of whether that ETC included Forex hedging and 
whether it included escalations.  The finding on that was the 38.6billion 
10 
was an acceptable ETC…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Did you say was or wasn’t? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Was an acceptable ETC and it did indeed include 
Forex hedging and escalation which we will try to demonstrate a little 
further down as we continue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Alright. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    So that was essentially the original delivery 
schedule as you see there, we’ve spoken about already so 465 diesel 
locomotives were predicated and 599 electric and as you can see there 
the schedule shows a hundred for each year starting  2014 to 2017 and 
20 
then 65 in the last year, that’s what the business case model, the 
delivery on and for electrics starting off with 65 in 2015, 130 in 
between and ending off with 144 in  2019, 7 year because it started in 
2013 ending in 2019.  Now the first delivery for diesels, as per the 
business case would have been in April 2013. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 192 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay but allowing for a four month testing period 
that means your locomotives started operating round about August 2013 
and that’s when you start to generate revenue essentially.  For your 
electric locomotives delivery would have started in April 2014 okay, 
same testing period of four months meaning you started generating 
revenue for electric locomotives in August 2014.  Now at some point we 
felt that four months was a little – well not us but the engineers we 
worked with at the time felt that four months was a little too short a 
period for testing, they felt that an average was about nine months.  We 
10 
did not have an issue with that particular assumption being in the 
business case again, why because it was conservative you’re 
essentially bringing your costs forward and lowering your net present 
value, so we were okay with that.  If it had been a testing period of 15 
months, let’s say that would have been concerning. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:    So what we show you there, basically is the 
breakdown of 38.6billion in ETC its split by diesels and electric you can 
see the total of 38.6 with the bulk of that ETC coming from the electric 
locomotives nationally so because you had more electric locomotives 
20 
and the price for electric locomotives was a lot higher than that of 
diesel.  As a matter of fact, the cheapest electric locomotive was more 
expensive than the most expensive diesel locomotive hence that 
significant difference between the two.  We broke it down into 
escalation costs as we’ve already mentioned it’s escalation here 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 193 of 235 
 
essentially is inflation so on the South African side you had PPI on the 
foreign side you had CPI in particular US because the business case 
gets actually modelled – was modelled on US Dollar locomotive or US 
Dollar price locomotives and contingents also make up part of the ETC 
as you can see there roughly at about 6.51 percent of your total cost 
okay 2.2billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    So when you look at the extreme right 
column total we get the 38.6billion, that is the total cost of acquisition 
of both diesels and electrics. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It is. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And do we understand your slide to mean 
the 38.6billion is made up of the five components listed above which at 
a very simplistic level can be broken down into the cost of acquiring the 
– the cost of the locomotive itself at 30billion, the escalation cost 
based on the PPI and the CPI so they are factored in at 1.8 and 713. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And these inflation costs are over a period 
of 7 years. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  They are over a period of 7 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is it hot Mr Chabi are you feeling hot 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I’m still trying to calm the nerves down Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Chair, and that is then followed 
by the hedging costs of 3.3billion. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   Correct. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 194 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And equally so the hedging is over a 7-year 
period. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It is over the delivery period which is 7 years. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  That’s right. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And you have contingencies at 2.2billion and 
that is just a function of a percentage of …(intervention). 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Of the total cost – of the cost you see above so 
6 percent of the cost you see above roughly 8 percent of the locomotive 
costs. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And that gives us 38.6billion. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It does. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    So if we say that the Board approved an 
ETC of 38.6billion on the basis of this slide, that 38.6billion included 
both escalation and hedging over a period of 7 years. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It did yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I suppose there’s not enough to show on a slide 
that these costs are included so we thought it important to actually 
demonstrate that, okay if the Chair will allow. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes go ahead. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    And just to explain, in order to do that you 
have to get out of your slides and go into excel. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Into the model itself yes.  It's quite a diesel 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 195 of 235 
 
model, it’s taking time to upload. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, while it uploads could you at least give 
us a sense of what you expect when it comes up? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So what you will see before you Chair is the 
model that was used to back the business case.  It's a 49 sheet model, 
very detailed, a number of different aspects per models there including 
the MDS the Market Demand Strategy just with the volumes that they 
were targeting at the time.  We'll have our focus on two sheets in this 
instance and that's the sheet that's actually labelled The Transnet 
Hedged Curve.  Hedge rate curve as well as the main control input 
10 
sheet.  But the main control input sheet- it's not showing so right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it coming up?  
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I think I'll need- can you see it there? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, your computer is connected because I can 
see your screen.  What is not coming up is the actual worksheet that 
you want to work to demonstrate on. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Duplicator input.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Apologies.  So this was actually the model used 
at the time its Transnet models not one that we developed.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So as mentioned, we will look at sheets in 
particular.  That's the main control sheet which is where your 38.6 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 196 of 235 
 
billion rand output is situated. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  As you can see that's what you have right there.  
It's a bit- 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you enlarge it a bit perhaps? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I'll try and enlarge that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you perhaps might want to use your 
pointer to direct us. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  On the screen, okay.  So there's your 
38.6 billion there, your Nett present value is just right beneath it at 2.7 
10 
billion as you can see.  Now what you would expect of course is when 
you look at the FX curve.  As you change the FX curve assumptions, 
you should be able to see the 38.6 billion rand change because the 
sheets are intellect. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And with the FX curve, do you mean the Forex 
curve? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  The Forex curve. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  The foreign currency.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The language must be that of lawyers to the 
20 
extent possible.  Thank you 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Pleasure advocate.  Okay, so Chair what you 
have there, essentially that sequence of numbers is what is called the 
FX curve.  So essentially it's what you expect to purchase each dollar 
at in the future.  And if you can see as at 18 April 2013, the spot rate 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 197 of 235 
 
was 9.1285.  Exactly a year after that you would have expected to 
purchase the dollar at 9.5854 as you can see there.  2014/15 at 10 rand 
to the dollar, you get 10.04 10.5 and so forth.  And so you can see that 
curve is actually an increasing curve.  So you expect the rand to 
depreciate over time.  And essentially that's where the cost actually 
comes in.  Your cost is essentially the difference between your forward 
rate and your current rate.  So in other words, it's not that different to 
inflation this instance.  Now as I mentioned Chair, if you change any of 
these numbers here you should be able to see a change on the 38.6 
billion.  So I'll give it to the Chair, I'll let you decide which number you 
10 
want to change and which one to change it to.  Its if- 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I'm trying to understand the principles. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  The principle behind it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rather than the actual figures. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I think the principle is you make an estimate 
of what the for example rand dollar exchange likely to be in two years 
time three years time. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And so forth each year going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You work around your price on that basis.  Is that 
20 
right? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct.  So essentially you're modelling your 
price, your dollar price on that curve.  So in other words to get the 
price in three years time, you get the forward rate in three years time 
plus what you expect to equals an expense in three years time in dollar 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 198 of 235 
 
terms you mock up until you get the rand value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, with an appreciation that your estimate might be 
wrong, might ultimately be wrong. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Well, maybe then I should explain what Forex 
hedging is in the sense that-  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So essentially it's an agreement between you 
and... [intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that the estimate you will use. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  That's the rate you're going to buy with.  Well 
10 
not an estimate, it's actually the amount at which you're going to buy 
the rand and the dollar in the future.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So you agree with the part?  And that's what 
hedging essentially is.  If you look at Transnet's policy on hedging, it 
actually does say the objective is to eliminate the currency risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So essentially Transnet wants to be certain 
today what it will have to pay in rand terms in the future be it a year, 
two years, three years and so forth. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it's not to have any uncertainty. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It's very different from a forecast.  A forecast 
would be an estimate.  Different entities different bodies, the World 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 199 of 235 
 
Bank, the IMF would give what is essentially a forecast.  But in this 
instance- 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, that's fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  On that basis I will change 
a figure and let's see what happens.  I'm good at guessing figures.  
12.2 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  For which year advocate? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Make your pick, sir. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  That's an increase.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That's an increase, yeah. 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So you expect the price to- okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: Yes.  And the idea- you wanted to demonstrate 
to us how that exchange rate, the anticipated exchange rate if it 
changes how it impacts the 38.6 billion approved ETC. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: So and you had asked the Chair for a figure, 
I'm offering you one. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  So I'll use 12 and I'll use that in the year 
2015 tax year 2016.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And if we go back to the main control sheet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  You can see there it's actually gone up to 39 
billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just zoom in to your screen again.  That 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 200 of 235 
 
estimated KPAX of 39.152. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Originally before you tempered with the 
number and introduced my 12 that stood at 38.6. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And now it's gone up to 39 billion obviously 
because your rand- you expect your rand to depreciate by more than 
projected on the curve. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So and the same principle would apply 
10 
trough all the seven-year period.  Should those numbers begin to 
change, this ETC will automatically change? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It will. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In line with the changes that are effected on 
that Forex fluctuation. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct.  So it's quite an internally consistent 
model as you can see the MPV also changed this since it came down.  
So your cost went up your profitability, your profit position actually 
worsened.  It came down to 2.5 billion.  So we can do this with any 
number and you can you will see the difference.  You reduce that the 
20 
red going forward, you can expect the price to also come down from 38 
billion to a different figure and the MPV to increase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I'll now go back to the presentation that... 
[intervention] 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 201 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely.  And we were at your page 13 
when you had that demonstration for us. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thanks.  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay Chair, so it's not enough to show that 
because a change in those rates results in the change in ETC that you 
essentially had hedging include in there.  It essentially shows that, tells 
us that those numbers were numbers going forward that had an impact 
on the price.  The argument could be well all well and good, you have 
that numbers but are they hedged rates?  Okay, so what we then did is 
10 
we approached a number of entities.  We pulled out the Forex forward 
curve from a terminal called Bloomberg and that's accessible to.  It's 
wide it's an international porthole that's accessible to banks asset 
managers, any entity.  It is the formula used to determine what the 
forward curve is on any currency is objective.  So it does not matter 
where you are in the world, if you want to get a forward curve at a 
particular point in time for the rand against the dollar it will be the 
same regardless where you pull it in the world and who pulls it out.  So 
it's quite and objective number.  We approached a few banks as well to 
understand what they were charged to actually offer that guarantee to 
20 
anybody willing to enter into an agreement on the currency.  And this is 
essentially what we got.  So what you have on that slide essentially is 
what Transnet used in its modelling at the time and what we obtained 
from the market at the time.  So as at 18 April 2013 on the day if you 
had to go and hedge all this cash flow from the business case, that's 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 202 of 235 
 
what the market would have given to you at.  And you can see there's 
actually not much difference between the two 9.5 99.59 2014 10.04 
10.05 in 2015.  So you would expect price differences depending on 
who actually gives you gets the contract with you at 10.5 to compared 
to 10.53 and so forth.  The biggest variants come in 2020 at 12.55 
compared to 12.42.  However just remember that this the delivery sheet 
was up in 2019.  So the 2020 forward rate had no impact on the 
business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now if we look at your graph and we look 
at the blue starting from 2014 right through to 2020.  The numbers 
10 
indicated in respect of each, do those correspond with the numbers you 
showed us on the Excel what which you said was the workbook for the 
computation of the 38.6 billion. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Yes, they do.  We can go back and check that if. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So you extracted those numbers, put 
them on a chart?  And then you introduced the red or pink columns 
whatever that colour may be which are the figures you obtained from 
Bloomberg? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you are comparing on an annual basis 
20 
and you reach a conclusion that the difference in any given year is 
insignificant. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what must the Chair draw from that 
exercise? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 203 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  That the 38.6 billion included hedging and we 
have demonstrated that the figures here were actually forward curve 
foreign currency hedged rates. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the Chair had asked whether it will not be 
said they were mere estimates.  Does this help clarify the issue in any 
manner? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Well, what we have following that essentially is 
what we've just looked at on the spreadsheet which were the rates 
Transnet used at the time for the currency hedge.  In the same 
spreadsheet one of the 49 sheets has forecast rates and those are 
10 
used to model maintenance costs.  And just maintenance costs in the 
model and that's what you have there in they will obtain from global 
insight.  You can see there's quite a marked difference between the 
hedged rate and the forecast rate.  Okay, so 9.59 compared to 8.62, 
10.04 compared to 8.89 and so forth all the way.  In fact that variance 
increases as you go out into the years. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And so slide 15 the red indications are the 
forecast rates. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Forecasted rates, yes yeah. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The blue is the hedged rates? 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Yeah. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what we should understand from this 
slide is Transnet from your analysis, Transnet and the development of 
the business case used the actual hedged rates not the forecast rates. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And we've actually seen that because as we 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 204 of 235 
 
changed the rates the hedged rates, we saw a change in the ETC.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then addressing the question of hedging, 
Transnet used the correct figures to work out their Forex curve? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It did. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So there is no doubt foreign currency was 
included.  I guess the argument would have been then were those 
foreign currency assumptions going forward hedged rates or just or 
mere assumptions mere forecasts.  And I think we have demonstrated 
that they were not mere forecasts they were hedged rates. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  We now deal with the escalation bit, I think there 
was also a question not that I think I know.  There was a question 
around whether escalation costs were included.  We can the same way 
we've demonstrated with the foreign currency hedge show that 
escalation was also included.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then if we go back to your slide 6, sorry 
not 6, apologies.  I'm looking for slide 13.  13 please, yes.  So in slide 
13 provides for Forex hedging costs at 3.3 billion.  This are real and 
properly hedged for hedging cost of the Forex. 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Indeed, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And equally so you suggest when we do a 
similar exercise for escalation and we look at the figures appearing as 
against SA PPI and US CPI of 1.8 billion and 713 million respectively.  
That those two are properly calculated, their real escalation rates and 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 205 of 235 
 
it's just not mere guess work, if I can put it that way. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It isn't, yes.  So the assumption of local PPI I 
already mentioned was in the original 5.5%.  Okay, 5.3 going to 5.9% 
and on the US side was 2.3% going into the future. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then on that understanding you may 
proceed with escalation costs at slide 16, that's where we were. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay, so I'm not sure if you want me to actually 
go and demonstrate this.  I could.  Okay.  I think I will need your 
assistance again in this regard download.  Okay, it should come up.  
Alright, I'll just reset that and get back to 38.6 billion. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which means I must go correct my 12. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Indeed.  Okay, so there we are.  We're back to 
the original assumptions.  What we will then look at here now is the 
main control input sheet and the sheet in which the cost of the diesel 
and locomotives were completed.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And that's under total cost of ownership locals 
capital expenditure. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  As we go down you can see the forward rates up 
20 
here and there as well going forward, that you can see. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mm-hmm. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  What you have beneath that are your PPI and 
CPI, SA PPI and US CPI assumptions.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You might want to enlarge your screen a bit. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 206 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  There we go.  Shall we try a figure, advocate? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, I know it works.  I know the system works, 
so it's good this way.  So from that worksheet you seek to demonstrate 
that both the SA PPI and US inflation were taken into account once 
again over the period of seven years? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that it is and those were the actual rates 
of inflation anticipated what? 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   Expected at the time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Expected rates of inflation going forward. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:   Going forward. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They are then factored into the calculation 
and they give us certain numbers which we then reflect on our page 13 
under both inflations? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is to demonstrate that they are taken 
into consideration in the computation of the 38.6 billion? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct.  So essentially if you had to change this 
20 
numbers, you should see a changing at 38.6 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Once again as we did with the Forex? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  With the Forex, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Understood, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 207 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, we may proceed. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  For the demonstration or?  Okay, I will pick a 
number.  I'll just zeroise the first and zeroise the second. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So we expect no inflation in 2014 and 2015. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mm-hmm. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  If you look at the main control input sheet you 
can see your costs have actually changed there.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It's gone up to 37. 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It's actually changed to 37.269 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Zeroised, remember here I'm sure you're ask 
yourself why is it going down and not up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You are a mind reader Mr Chabi. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay alright.  So if you have a local content 
component and not a foreign component in this instance, your cost of 
hedging would have gone up and so would your foreign inflation in this 
instance.  So as you can see there is actually change as a result. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if we retain the percentages as we had 
20 
and we change in the second row.  What would happen then?  Would 
that ETC go up or down?  What should we expect? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  Actually, just a second, advocate.  It 
actually comes on slight to 38.008 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It goes up again? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 208 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  No, it comes down.  38 comes down to? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh from 38.6 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  6 billion comes down to 38 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of course. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And your MPV goes up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So those costs were allowed for. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, so and the MVP has changed now from 
2.7 billion to 2.9? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  I think the demonstration is clear at 
least for me.  You may proceed. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  So Chair, we have seen a escalation was 
included okay.  Not just on the local sub but also on the foreign side 
and we've just demonstrated that if you change the figures the numbers 
as well changes the results. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And we know one if you zeroise it actually comes 
down because you're assuming there's no inflation going forward.  The 
same way if you had increased inflation amounts, it would have gone up 
20 
in costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, as we saw it happen. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  As the drop from 38.6 billion to the figures that 
we had seen. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 209 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  You can say  in concluding that as I've already 
mentioned escalation was included, Forex was include and the 38.6 
billion was a reasonable and acceptable estimate after total cost of 
acquiring the locomotives at the time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Inclusive of escalation and Forex. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And Forex hedging, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay, so the next part of the presentation takes 
us to the increase in the ETC from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion, the 15.9 
billion spoken of.  And our mandate there was of course to determine 
10 
whether that 15.9 billion was a reasonable increase in the ETC or not.  
The former JSE is slightly different because of the- well, we could not 
put the opinion upfront and then give the detail later because looking at 
the three aspect following they are interlinked.  So what we'll do is 
we'll then turn to the memorandum and take you through that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And for the record if your BBHB has 
got a tab, I won't give it a colour because the colours may differ.  But 
what's original on the tab is volume 145 4352 to 4370.  Chair it is in 
BBHB. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It's here?   
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, it's the document after the tab. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chairs bundle has got a tab like that.  
Yeah, yours is green. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yeah, okay. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 210 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the green, Chair is marked volume 14 352 
to 4370. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the memo that Mr Chabi would like us 
to consider. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what's region on the tab is just for 
reference purposes where that document was extracted from in the 
record.  This is just for ease of reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a document that was supposed to be here or?  
10 
There's volume 14352 to 4370. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then after that there is part C.  And then there is 
a document which is, that's the next document... [intervenes] 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, then thereafter then it's the Transnet 
document headed Memorandum.  That's the correct document Chair.  If 
I may just confirm it has at the top.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, headed Memorandum. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To transport board of Directors from Brian Molefe. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That's a document you'd like us to have 
regard to know.   
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 211 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Thanks [inaudible]  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are at that document. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  So just to highlight what our men did here 
was I think in the words of the Chairman from MNS.  His words were, 
we want to deconstruct the memorandum and look at every component 
cost and tell us if each of those costs make sense.  And if where they 
don't, give us what you think is a reasonable cost.  Okay, now this was 
a memo of course presented [inaudible] 23rd of May 2014 by the then 
JSE group of executive of Transnet. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Just to find the increase in ETC.  What you have 
before you under the excerpt two summery, bullet point number two are 
the reasons we put forward for the increase in ETC. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you do that for the record at 4353, the 
document states the purpose of the document and states as follows.  
The purpose of this memo is firstly for the BOD to note the reasons for 
the increase in ETC.  B to request that the BOD approve an increase in 
the estimated total cost ETC for the accusation of 10 64 locomotives for 
the general freight business of Transnet Freight Rail from 38.6 billion 
20 
to 54.5 billion.  And before you deal with the content, I will then refer 
us to the last page of that document which would be at 4370 and it is 
signed by Mr Arnold Singh, recommended by Mr Arnold Singh, 
recommended by Mr Siyabonga Gama and recommended by Mr Brian 
Molefe.  Mr Molefe on the 14th of May- no on the 23rd of May 2014.  Mr 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 212 of 235 
 
Gama on the 21st of May 2014 and Mr Singh on the 22nd of May 2014.  
So that's when the memo was generated and I have stated its purpose.  
You now wanted to deal with the Executive summery.  So you may 
proceed. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Thank you.  Okay, so what I've put before you 
are the reasons essentially table two on the slide.  What you have in 
red of course are the memo values and what you have in blue are the 
recalculated values.  So let me just explain each of those reasons that 
he put forward in the memo.  So there's an [inaudible app link] for the 
business case.  After business case four updated economic factors.  
10 
That's how it reads, update of business case four, updated economic 
factors.  Now we will understand what that means essentially when we 
get to table two where he starts off with a locomotive price but 
essentially it's a backward looking adjustment for inflation and the 
depreciation in the rand.  Okay, from March 2014 going back to what he 
terms the close of tender date which we believe to be 30 April 2018.  In 
certain instances he goes back two years where he should have gone 
back one year.  But we'll touch on the actual numbers a bit later.  5.4 
billion compared to 4.4 billion so we felt it was a 1 billion rand over 
estimation in that regard.  He then talks about risk mitigation and that's 
20 
for Forex and inflation going forward.  Okay and he pecks that at 9.5 
billion.  We have come to a cost of 6.2 billion over that period.  Okay, 
that's along the foreign currency hedging going forward as well as the 
escalation going forward.  At Transnet Engineering and Scope is also 
introduced in the increase.  Now in the business case no allowance was 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 213 of 235 
 
made for TE Scope.  There was however as you'd have noticed on the 
slides at 2% localisation premium.  We have asked the engineers what 
that was for and the financial team what that was for and they said it 
had nothing to do with TE Scope, it was an assumption around the 
premium you would have expected to pay if you had to obtain certain 
services locally.  He talks about contingencies as well, perk that are 
10% off the total cost which are 49.5 billion.  In fact in the 4.95 billion 
to the 49.5 you get the 54.5 billion.  And then if you look at the table on 
the memorandum, it's actually not showing there.  The last entry is 
lower capital acquisition cost of the locomotive obtained through the 
10 
competitive tender and negotiation process, latch the best price 
adjustment of 2.7 billion.  And he claims a 6.5 billion rand saving.  We 
will speak to that as well a bit later.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI: 
 
Okay 
but 
essentially 
we 
felt 
that 
the 
contingencies were quite high at 4.95 billion.  We had it at 2.8 billion.  
We will get into that shortly.  The bench pricing at 2.7 billion.  We felt it 
was a cost that was not reasonable and we pack that at zero as you 
can see there.  Following that we have a – and a slide 20 a more 
detailed breakdown of those risks – I mean – of those reasons put 
20 
forward.  Now the update of the business case for updated economic 
factors – sorry – what you have in red Chair are what we took exception 
to and what you have in blue is what we are comfortable with, okay.  So 
we were not comfortable with the escalation from the tender closing – 
close date all the way to March 2014.  We were also not comfortable 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 214 of 235 
 
with the bench price.  I have just – I have just spoken to that and the 
cost of fixed escalation going forward.  We were not comfortable with 
those costs either but just to tie in what you are seeing on this slide to 
the table on the executive summary under bullet point two that we have 
just spoken to.  So your update … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry – Mr Chabi before we go into the detail.  
You have listed there the various elements and except for the BAFO 
after each you have denoted with an alphabet in brackets. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So help us understand  
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Understand what those are.  Okay, so … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The logic, ja. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Sure advocate.  So the BAFO is there.  It is the 
first bullet … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Best And Final Offer prices. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  This essentially if you turn to Table 2 in the 
memorandum … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that Chair will be at that bundle page 48.  
20 
For the moment please ignore the reference bundle.  Just the bundle 
number.  Please use the bold double digit page numbering.  It is for 
purposes of this.  Now at 48 that is Table 2.  However we do 
acknowledge that it is completely unreadable Chair.  If you go overleaf 
we have reproduced it and printed on landscape hoping that it will 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 215 of 235 
 
become more readable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  We are there Mr Chabi. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Thank you.  So the alphabets simply mirror what 
the GCE put in the memorandum and you can see from that table that 
he labels escalation up to signature date which is March 2014 as A.  
The original T as B.  You will see B appearing there twice on the slide 
and in the memorandum okay and those two relate to Transnet’s 
Engineering Scope. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  We carry down all the way to contingencies 
labelled G. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So if we are looking we wonder what C 
is we know it is for forex adjustment from April 2013 to March 2014 and 
it will be listed as such in our page 48 and Table 2. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It is for ease of reference when you look at Table 
2. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now secondly before we unpack the detail you 
20 
have some listed in red and some in blue – not black – blue. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  In blue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On your slide.  Can you talk us through that? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  So I was still going through the time 
(indistinct) the reasons he put forward in the summary … 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 216 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes sir. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And explaining the – the breakdown.  So as 
mentioned it is a more detailed breakdown of the reasons he put if you 
look at Table 2.  It is basically about four reasons barring the saving 
that has been claimed.  The bench pricing is included in the last bullet 
there.  If you – update of business case for updated economic factors 
is essentially the backward looking adjustment and looks at escalation 
from the close of tender to March 2014 and it also includes the forex 
adjustment from the close of tender all the way to March 2014.  Okay.  
So that is the update that the memorandum is speaking to – backward 
10 
looking.  Okay, so forex and escalation.  Risk mitigation the same – the 
same items the same factors.  However forward looking and as you can 
see there it is broken down into cost of fixed escalation to the end of 
the contract and the cost of hedging to the other contract. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  You do not have TE Scope and that is just 
the addition of the original Transnet TE Scope and the additional TE 
Scope.  It is just the sum of those two items there and you have got 
hedging and you have got bench pricing of course. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  We will discuss this particular table a little later 
in the slide.  What we have done on the slide to follow is we have 
actually put the numbers from the memorandum we have juxtaposed 
thereto our calculation and to the business case.  Okay, just for ease of 
comparison. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 217 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So what you have at slide 21 but for the 
numbers under business case and under assed value that is a reflection 
of Table 2 of the memorandum? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The May 2014 memorandum? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Agreed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So in order to do a comparison you remind us 
what the business case had budgeted for in respect of each item and 
then you introduce the assessed value which is the result of your 
calculations? 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may then lead us through it. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  Thank you advocate.  Okay.  So as 
mentioned we have put the numbers right next to the list that we have 
just discussed, okay and as you can see just going back to the 
business as we try to break it down just to show you how those costs 
actually come in.  Starts with the locomotive price.  You will remember 
it was sitting at 30.476 billion when discussed it initially on the earlier 
slide.  When we broke down the ETC of 38.6 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  That by the way includes a 2 percent localisation 
premium.  So I think if you remove that you are looking at about 29.8 
billion thereabout.  Now there is no backward escalation on that, okay.  
In other words I adjust them because remember this business case was 
actually developed at the time when the tenders were closed, okay.  So 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 218 of 235 
 
everything from that point is actually forward looking.  There is no 
backward adjustment.  The prices then reflect the prices that you will 
pay for locomotives at that time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So that is left blank.  There is no TE Scope as 
mentioned.  The financial team that developed the model said to us that 
they did not allow for Transnet Engineering Scope in the modelling of 
the business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  (Indistinct) however you have in there because 
10 
the weight used was the forward rate one year later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  Assuming that you were actually going to 
acquire the locomotives in Dollars at that forward rate and not at the 
support weight of 9.1285. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  So the weight used to actually convert 
from US Dollars to Rands was 9.5854 as you looked at – as we saw 
earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  There was no bench price adjustment in 
that scenario.  I suppose for obvious reasons, okay.  Additional TE 
Scope no TE Scope.  However … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Sorry. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 219 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we do that let us take bench pricing as 
an – bench price adjustment as an example.  Under business case you 
say it was not catered for. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it was not … 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It was not catered for in the business case. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The memorandum suggests that it is going to 
cost 2.7 billion? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if we look at the assess value which is 
10 
your recalculation you say there should not be a provision for bench 
pricing? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  For bench pricing correct.  I suppose we will get 
to the … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  No, no. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Detail at a later time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just we follow the logic of – of this table. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  There was forward escalation and there 
was forward hedging as mentioned you are looking ahead.  So 
everything is forward looking. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And contingence is there.  We have already 
spoken to that 2.2 billion … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And that made up 6 percent of all the costs we 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 220 of 235 
 
see before or 8 percent of the locomotive costs depending on how you 
want to look at it, okay.  Next to that are the memorandum figures and 
in this instance you can see how the GCE at the time takes us from the 
29 billion all the way to the 54 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  You can see the numbers reflected there.  
The backward looking escalation was bagged at 2.3 billion.  We came 
to 1.3-odd billion there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No it – it will not show on – on your screen.  
Does your mouse show when you run it on the slide?  No it does not. 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It does not. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  The numbers get to be too many and 
then we get – easy to get lost. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  You are going to get lost okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So I am trying to find a better way in which 
you can refer us to a specific number you want to speak to.  Then we 
can find it on the slide.  Then we can follow what you are saying. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  So let me get the overall conclusion at 
this point … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  And then we will go into the detail later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So essentially the 15.9 billion was a 41 percent 
increase from the business case to the memorandum. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 221 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  What we have come to and we actually do say 
allowing for TE Scope.  Now we will discuss that later.  At the time we 
felt that we did not have enough information to arrive – to draw a 
conclusion on TE Scope and MNS is still working on that and once that 
– once there is an outcome on that we will be able to reflect a figure 
here based on what they come up with. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So before you leave … 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That point the increase on the business case 
– business case in terms of the memorandum suggests a 41 percent 
10 
increase? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is what you said that 15.9 increase.  
Your calculation – on your calculation you conclude that the reasonable 
increase from the business case scenario to date or to the time that the 
increase – the approval for the increase was being sought ought to be 
6.8 billion? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which then would reflect 18 percent? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  An 18 percent increase correct allowing for TE 
20 
Scope.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Allowing for TE Scope which on your 
slide you have put an asterisk next to? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Agreed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For both TE Scope and additional TE Scope.  
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 222 of 235 
 
Now if following a further investigations or conclusion of investigations 
by MNS on the TE Scope a finding is made that TE Scope ought not to 
be costed in the manner that it is or at all would that have an impact on 
the increase that you would say is reasonable? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  You would and we show it on the next slide and 
essentially that would result in an 11 percent increase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As opposed to the current 18 percent that you 
hold? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  18 percent increase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So whereas now with the TE – taking TE into 
10 
consideration you arrive – arrive at a 6.8 billion increase as a 
reasonable increase but if you take out TE Scope both original TE and 
additional the increase out to have been 4.2 billion above 38.6? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that would be mathematically leading us –
what to 42? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  42.7 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  (Intervenes). 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  48 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  40? 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  42.8 billion rounded up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  42.8 billion. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Allowing for TE Scope has 45.4 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  We are with you. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  The next pair of slides takes us into the diesel of 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 223 of 235 
 
each of the items that we have put there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So starting with the BAFO price the base price 
for locomotive we consider that reasonable and how did the – why do 
we do that?  We looked at the last Best And Final Offer prices provided 
by the bidders at the time and that as at 14 January 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Now as you can see on the slide CNR’s BAFO 
price at the time was 28-odd million.  GE is 24. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is your … 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Row three. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  That is row  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you look at the … 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Four. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Extreme left corner at the top you – at the 
heading you identify each bidder.  Then you have a row that shows 
number of locomotives (indistinct), right? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then that is followed in the next row price per 
20 
locomotive CFET?  That is the Cross Functional Evaluation Team. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is then lastly followed by price by 
locomotive BAFO and that is the price you are talking to now – you are 
speaking to now? 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 224 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Agreed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Now we have included price per locomotive 
CFECT 
here 
just 
to 
show 
you 
what 
the 
drop 
was 
between 
December 2013 and January 2014 after BAFO letters were sent out to 
each bidder to ask for the Best And Final Offer price – to quote on the 
Best And Final Offer price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then on that understanding let us take 
CNR indicates price per locomotive at point of evaluation was 48.5 
million per locomotive? 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Per locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Their final – their BAFO price being their final 
– Best And Final Offer.  It came down to 28 million? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  That is roughly 30 percent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  30 percent discount ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then it is – we follow that logic in respect 
of all the bidders? 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So GEBT’s discount comes in the region of 5/6 
percent.  CNR’s discount was in the region of 16 percent.  So CNR and 
CSR had the largest drop between December 2013 and January 2014 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 225 of 235 
 
as you can see there.  However we are basing the calculation the BAFO 
price which is the last price they put forward to … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now … 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  (Intervenes) at the time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Proceed. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Okay.  So on that basis we considering number 
of locomotive each bidder was contracted to provide to – to deliver we 
came to a price of – a total price of 29.5 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now let us just find it on the slide. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It us under (intervenes). 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have as your last row total and in respect 
of each bidder you have a total starting with CNR at 6.5 billion and 
work our way across and your second last column is headed assessed 
value and you have 29.532 and then the memorandum you have 
29.355? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which – which 29 were you speaking to now? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So the 29.532. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 532 which is the assessed value? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  The assessed value. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is the total of all BAFOs? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  From CNR, GEBT, CSR collectively? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Combined, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 226 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  What you have in the memorandum - the starting 
price in the memorandum is 29.355 billion.  Now we consider it – we 
took the memorandum value accepted that value on the basis that the 
negotiation should have yielded – sorry – results because the price that 
we were seeing as a starting price in the memorandum is slightly lower 
than the price we arrived at – at the BAFO stage.  There were no 
documents to substantiate the 29.355 billion in the million.  So we 
accepted the price as reasonable.  It is also considered that the 
business case was in the region of 30 billion.  This is a decrease from 
what you had assumed in the business case and what you have at the 
10 
negotiation stage. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  So the starting price of 29.355 billion was a 
reasonable starting price in our view.  Had it been higher we would 
have had a contrast because then we would have meant that the 
negotiation did not yield the results they should have yielded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So whereas collectively the bidders offered a 
cost per locomotive at 30 billion the evaluation process ran its course 
and negotiations and at the end of negotiations Transnet was able to 
negotiate them collectively down to a total locomotive cost of 29.3 
20 
billion? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  29.3 billion.  That is R177 million difference. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  177 million? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 227 of 235 
 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Now we highlight this because it takes us back 
to Table 2 under the executive summary of the memorandum where a 
saving of R6.5 billion was claimed for lower capital acquisition costs.  
Now in all our assessment we could not come to that figure.  In fact we 
have reproduced that same table there overhead and I will read that 
again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  It says: 
“Lower capital acquisition costs of the locomotive 
obtained 
through 
the 
competitive 
tender 
and 
10 
negotiation process yielded a saving of 6.5 billion.” 
Now remember he actually mentions in the less the batch price 
adjustment it is unclear why we have a less the best price adjustment 
because it is one of the factors that led to the increase.  So essentially 
the saving being claimed is roughly R9.2 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you move on then please go back to 
your 23.  We just spoke on this slide and if I heard you correctly you 
said under the – at the row total under memorandum the 29.3 billion 
that you have listed there – set out there under total was the final 
negotiated position by Transnet? 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we know from previous slides that when 
the bids were first evaluated that cost was at 30-odd billion, ja. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  20 and a half billion.  The 30 comes from the 
business case. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 228 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, the business case and you indicated to 
the Chair that the difference between the total as per the bids and the 
negotiated position is 177 million? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if we are to talk of any savings it is R177 
million saving from the bid position? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Well if you talk of savings … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Per … 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  From lower capital acquisition costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Exactly. 
10 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is 177? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if you go forward to your 24 the 
memorandum suggest that there was a lower capital acquisition cost of 
locomotive that was obtained through the competitive tender and 
negotiation process and indicates that as a 6.5 billion. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  How do I reconcile the 177 million you just 
spoke of now and the 6.5 billion? 
20 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  I suppose you cannot reconcile them. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the worksheets you worked through are 
you able to determine – are you able to validate that 6.5 billion?  Have 
you been able to? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Well we … 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 229 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
From 
the 
worksheets 
and 
any 
other 
documentation provided you? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  No.  Well we know how the 6.5 billion was 
arrived yes and we can demonstrate that if need be. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
But 
my 
question 
was 
is 
there 
any 
documentation that I can turn to that will show me a 6.5 billion saving? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Not to our knowledge. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Chair I see it is 5 o’ clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. We are going to adjourn but before we adjourn I 
think that my ability to follow Mr Chabi’s very technical evidence … 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would have been enhanced if I had had a statement 
or affidavit from him telling me exactly what he would be testifying 
ahead of his evidence because then I would have looked at that in 
advance, tried to understand it before he comes to the witness stand 
rather than try to understand it while he is talking. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As he presents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So one I think it is going to be important that you 
arrange - the legal team arranges that he prepares an affidavit … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That deals with his evidence from beginning up to the 
end as you would do with an expert. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know – because … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will sir. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 230 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the need to try and understand and prepare is 
much more greater with a – with technical evidence than with factual 
evidence. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I would like you to do that before we can continue 
and finish with him. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I propose then Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Accepting that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That we stop with – it is 5 o ‘clock now.  We 
are going to stop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Chabi would have returned tomorrow 
morning to complete his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is absolutely critical that the Chair 
understands this piece of evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is very important, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I request that we then stand Mr Chabi 
20 
down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We sort out a proper expert report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To be handed in under affidavit. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 231 of 235 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we will recall Mr Chabi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He will have to go through the evidence he 
has led but then I suppose then it will be quicker because the Chair 
would have had an opportunity … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be quicker. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To consider his expert report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then we deal with the remainder of his 
10 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, no that is … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If – if that would be acceptable to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can do it that way.  Mr Chabi I am sorry about that 
but your evidence is quite technical and it would be much better if 
ahead of you coming to testify I have read it and I have identified areas 
that need clarification because in the end also we can keep you in the 
witness stand for a shorter time if you just come to clarify certain 
aspects that might need clarification. 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Understood Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so Ms Sello will liaise with you – the legal team 
will liaise with you for that affidavit to be prepared and in due course 
we will ask you to come back.  You understand? 
MR ALISTER CHABI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 232 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Chair I confirm that approach would work.  
It worked for me.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I know nothing about figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also I can just say for the benefit of members of 
the legal team in regard to witnesses that may come – you know – with 
every witness it is important that I have the statement ahead.  I know 
that in this case it might have been thought that it should be fine but I 
think it is critical to have that ahead of the witness but also with other 
witnesses.  I have already spoken to you with regard Mr Sedumedi’s 
10 
evidence and … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes we have communicated your position 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will you make arrangements. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His evidence was quite important but of course his – 
his was not technical so his could be followed easily but it would be 
convenient to have a full statement/affidavit that covers his evidence 
but certainly Mr Chabi’s one is – it is important to have it ahead of him 
giving evidence so that one can follow it after having started the 
20 
affidavit in advance. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We shall – we shall do so and reschedule 
Mr Chabi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may just point out the next witness for 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 233 of 235 
 
tomorrow … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am not leading Dr Bloom.  He comes on 
Friday.  I do not know what arrangements Mr Pretorius has made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But maybe I can communicate your views to 
him and see if he would be ready with an affidavit by then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is hearing you.  He hears you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I was not expecting him so close to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But he heard me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure he will talk to you, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The issue though I want them to address 
Chair is we had a prepared on this basis of slides. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We have the last witness tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is not a technical witness.  We are back 
now to the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Factual arena. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We request that you permit us to process in 
the same manner that Mr Sedumedi testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
29 MAY 2019 – DAY 101 
 
Page 234 of 235 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is with slides … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is not a big topic … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And he like Mr Sedumedi will subsequently 
then reduce all that testimony into an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which i will file and then Chair will determine 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Whether he would like to interrogate them any 
further.
