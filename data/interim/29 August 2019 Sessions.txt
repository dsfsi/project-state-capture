PROCEEDINGS ON 29 AUGUST 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Natasen.  Are we ready>? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there were a few procedural aspects just 
to deal with at the outset if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The first of those relate to the application that 
10 
Mr Natasen made to cross-examine Ms Tlatsana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the last hearing of Mr Natasen’s evidence 
there was an opportunity afforded to him to supplement that application 
in order to set out the grounds on which her evidence was disputed.  It 
has been supplemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so Chair it is appropriate for me to just 
place before you then the supplemented version of the cross-
examination application.  If I may beg leave to hand that up? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The second procedural aspect Chair is you will 
recall there was a confidentiality regime so to speak that we entered 
into at the commencement of Mr Natasen’s evidence last time and that 
was [intervention]. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 3 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember but [intervention]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let me if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me if I may just [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Record what was ruled there.  Mr Natasen 
raised the concern that there is a number of his banking information 
and other documents that had been supplied to the commission not all 
of which would be relevant to the investigations and mandate of the 
commission.  So Chair you gave a ruling at the commencement of last 
10 
proceedings that a process would be adopted whereby in the course of 
the evidence where reference is made to a page of such a document 
that would be highlighted and then before it was put on the website of 
the commission after Mr Natasen’s evidence is concluded the rest of 
the page would be blacked out so that we would protect the 
confidentiality and privacy interests.  I only raise it now because that 
was a ruling about Wednesday many weeks ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then secondly there have been further 
documents supplied since Mr Natasen’s last evidence and so it is my 
20 
proposal that we simply extend the confidentiality regime to all the 
documents that we traverse today.  On the last occasion Chair we 
heard his evidence on a Friday and you ruled that until the following 
Wednesday it would not be placed on the website and so my proposal 
would be that we do a similar thing.  We say after three working days 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 4 of 236 
 
from today it may only then be placed on the website. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think there will be problem with that.  Do you 
know whether Mr Natasen’s legal representative has any objection to 
that?  Is that something that has been agreed? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I certainly raised with him that I would address 
it with you today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My specific proposal of the three days I did not 
discuss with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But he is of course free to indicate if he has 
any difficulty with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay let me hear if he has anything to say? 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Nice to see you again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nice to see you. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    I have no objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have no objection? 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  The ruling to which you have 
referred that I made will therefore apply to the documents to which you 
have referred and the three days you proposed would be applicable to 
it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indebted Chair thank you. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 5 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The third aspect just at the outset Chair is that 
the legal representatives for Mr Natasen have engaged with the 
commissioning correspondence to indicate that they would like an 
opportunity to re-examine Mr Natasen.  It has been the proposal from 
the legal team to them that that take place immediately after the 
questioning of Mr Natasen concludes today.  We also in advance of 
today indicated to Mr Natasen’s lawyers that we would be happy if 
necessary to extend beyond four o’clock today so that we could with 
your leave Chair if it becomes necessary complete the evidence today 
10 
both questioning and re-examination.  So that is our proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – have they indicated if they are fine with 
that or not yet? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Again my understanding is yes but if Mr – it is 
indeed yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes he confirms.  No that is fine.  There will be an 
opportunity for Mr Natasen’s legal representative to re-examine him 
and as far as possible we will try to make sure we finish today even if it 
means we go beyond four o’clock.  But maybe when we reach four 
o’clock we can just see how far we will be to finishing and then see 
20 
whether we need to go up to five or beyond that.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we need to go beyond that we might have to just 
talk more but certainly up to five we can go. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indebted Chair. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 6 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there is one final aspect just before we 
commence with Mr Natasen’s evidence and that is a matter that has 
developed since Ms Tlatsana gave her evidence.  That it is appropriate 
to bring to the Chair’s attention.  Chair there are two aspects to it.  The 
one is that during Ms Tlatsana’s evidence you may recall that she 
testified about a case of intimidation that she had lodged with the 
Mafikeng police but in respect of which she had received no feedback 
whatever.  In the course of her testimony you requested that that be 
followed up by the commission.  That was done and so I would like to 
10 
take a moment now just to update you on that position if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair you will find the response to those 
enquiries in Mr Natasen’s bundle.  It is the second bundle so it is 
DD10b and you will find it there at page 442.25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair right at the outset I am going to make a 
general apology before we get too heavily into these papers today. That 
is that the bundle has been supplemented many times since Mr 
Natasen’s last evidence and so we go to points of points of points later 
20 
on but I – I hope to be able to navigate through that with everyone 
today.  But we start at page 442.25 Chair with the response that was 
received to the enquiries that the commissions made after Mr 
Tlatsana’s evidence.  And there are aspects of it Chair which are 
concerning and which we bring to your attention.  What was asked was 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 7 of 236 
 
for an update on the case that she lodged and what you see on page 
442.25 is that the case was lodged with a Warrant Officer at the 
Mafikeng detective service on the 4 t h January 2018.  That was 
acknowledged you will find that in the second paragraph.  And then in 
the penultimate paragraph the author of this document who is the 
Deputy Provincial Commissioner for Crime Detection in the North West 
indicates that they made investigations and upon perusing the docket 
the officers were and I am quoting “in dismay” to learn that there was 
nothing positive that the investigator did in the docket and there was no 
command and control from the commander’s side.  In the last paragraph 
10 
it goes on to say the Provincial office have since removed the said 
investigator from the investigation at the detect – Mafikeng Detective to 
the Provincial office where the case is presently investigated by 
Provincial Organised Crime. And Chair if you go over the page there is 
also an indication that disciplinary – a disciplinary investigation against 
the concerned members has been initiated.  Chair we – we give you 
that update because you specifically asked for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It appears that no investigation whatever was 
done on it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that that was of concern certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To the Provincial commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And it has been more than a year and half. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 8 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Since the complaint was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was laid. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I can also indicate to you that the 
commission’s investigators are seeking to take aspects of that 
intimidation case forward in our own investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because there is a possible link with other 
aspects of the evidence and so they are seeking to work with the police 
10 
in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No thank you.  Will you just make sure 
that Mr Natasen is made aware of this response and – and at some 
stage it would be good to hear how far the investigations are. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it does not have to be soon but at some stage it 
would be helpful. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You – you indicated Ms Natasen I take it you 
20 
meant Ms Tlatsana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no I am sorry I – 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 9 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair on the topic of Ms Tlatsana though there 
is a second update that I must bring to the Chair’s attention today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the conclusion of Ms Tlatsana’s evidence 
she was requested to provide a further affidavit to the commission in 
which she would account in full for the full R51 million that came into 
the account of Koreneka the CC which she was the member of and so 
the commission took steps after her evidence to follow up with her and 
to obtain that further affidavit.  In the course of those engagements the 
10 
commission interacted with her lawyer Mr Knight who was present 
during her evidence.  He has indicated that there were threats made 
and intimidation to Ms Tlatsana after her evidence before the 
commission the consequence of which is that in fear for her life she has 
left the Republic.  Chair his affidavit setting that out you will also find 
in Exhibit DD10b and you will pick it up at page 442.27.1.  So it is just 
about two pages on from where we were.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair you will see there that this is an affidavit 
deposed to by Julian Brett Knight who is Ms Tlatsana’s legal 
20 
representative.  If you pick it up at paragraph 2 he indicates in that 
affidavit that he was advised by his client that is Ms Tlatsana that out 
of fears for her safety after her testimony to this commission she 
decided to remove herself from the territorial limits of the Republic of 
South Africa.  The precise destination whereof is unknown to him.  He 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 10 of 236 
 
goes on to give the facts as they were relayed to him by Ms Tlatsana.  
He says at paragraph 3: 
“After having testified before the commission Ms 
Tlatsana advised that she observed suspicious 
activity around her residential property in Mafikeng 
where unknown men who did not identify themselves 
approached family members enquiring about her 
whereabouts.” 
And if you go over the page he goes on and says: 
“I am instructed that an attempt was also made to 
10 
gain entry to her residence.” 
At paragraph 5 he records: 
“As a consequence of feeling unsafe Ms Tlatsana 
decided to leave the Republic of South Africa.” 
And at paragraph 6 he records: 
“That she has advised him that she appointed an 
auditor to write up the finances of Koreneka CC 
which he understands is currently in progress.” 
That is in direct response to the further information that she was 
required to provide to the commission. Chair when the commission 
20 
received this information it took it very seriously.  We have engaged 
our own investigators particularly on aspects of security and they are 
updating us regularly on this as recently as yesterday.  But as matters 
currently stand it does appear that Ms Tlatsana is not within the 
Republic and as we have it from her lawyer this is the explanation at 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 11 of 236 
 
least that she gave him for having left the Republic after her testimony.   
CHAIRPERSON:  This is quite concerning because the impression I 
have and my recollection of everything relating to this matter is not 
perfect is that although she would have brought issues of her concerns 
of – in regard to safety and threats to the attention of the authorities 
the authorities do not seem to have done anything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she had come and given evidence and according 
to this affidavit subsequently it appeared that she was under threat and 
she left.  She did not feel it seems protected or safe. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I would like to be updated. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the matter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may then suggest that we continue 
with Mr Natasen’s evidence.  He was placed under oath on the last 
20 
occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe because of the lapse of time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can do the oath again. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 12 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Vivien Natasen. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection in making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence that you will 
give shall be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so 
raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Natasen I would like to 
10 
[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which – which bundle will you be using most of the 
time? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will start with A Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  DD10a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there will be a few other bundles 
predominantly we will be using A and B today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There will be one or two other bundles we will 
go to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But my arrangement with your Registrar is he 
will make those available to you as and when it is appropriate. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 13 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen if we can commence in 
Exhibit DD10a if we may and I would like to start at page 25 there.  
Now 25 is the part of the statement that you provided to the 
commission on the 3 r d May of this year.  That was before a meeting you 
held with the commission the following Monday on the 6 t h May.  And I 
would like to pick it up at paragraph 13 on that page because at 
paragraph 13 is where you deal with the R300 000 that was paid in 
cash to Mr Van Wyk.  Chair just to orientate ourselves you might recall 
from the last evidence there were a series of electronic transfers out of 
10 
the Neo Solutions account to an account of Batsomi Investments.  
There were four in total. But the one outlier is a R300 000 in cash that 
we had not got to in Mr Natasen’s evidence last time and that is the 
topic I would like to address with Mr Natasen now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen this was the draft that you returned 
to the commission on the 3 r d May, do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was signed by you, you can find that on the 
last page, do you recall that? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that was a version of your statement that 
you had worked on previously to produce this document we see at this 
page, do you recall that?  And that was a version of your statement that 
you had worked on previously to produce this document we see at this 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 14 of 236 
 
page, do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we look at paragraph 13 on that page 
could you indicate there what explanation you give about the R300 000 
that was paid to Mr Van Wyk? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I had explained at the time that I had a portion 
of cash with me. I do not normally obviously have cash at home.  Our 
business does not generate cash so it is not out of the business 
proceeds. So I had explained at the time that I had disposed of a 
vehicle, one of my private vehicles and the buyer had secured the 
10 
vehicle by paying me a portion in cash.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And tell us how it came that Mr Van Wyk 
wanted this R300 000 to be paid? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He requested it – a portion in cash because I 
believe at the time he wanted to secure a vehicle, a classic car that he 
wanted to buy and he asked for that portion in cash. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so if we could just unpack that a bit.  
When did this happen? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I cannot recall exactly but it was at the start of 
the year. We – he basically called me – I was out of town and he called 
20 
me and said he needed it and then I had to obviously then make 
arrangements for my brother to retrieve it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that was early in 2016, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Prior to the 4 t h January 2016, correct? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 15 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  Well on or about that day. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It could have been the 4 t h itself could it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And explain to us the communication, was it – 
how did it take place? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I assumed – well look he probably called me 
over Whatsapp.  He used to call me over Whatsapp calls because he 
used to use data. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what did he say precisely? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He first said he needed R300 000 and then I 
10 
said well I could do the transfer or tell Eugene Ruben to do the 
transfer.  Then – he then said no, no he needed it in cash.  Then I said 
okay fine I happen to have some so I then arranged for him to get it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what reason did he give for needing those 
funds on the 4 t h January 2016? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was to purchase a vehicle he said. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you make enquiries of him about why he 
needed it then? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I just knew that he collected cars so – I mean 
quite often I would also – if I buy a classic car I would buy it if it is a 
20 
small number I would generally pay cash because the sellers generally 
want cash. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why facilitate this while you were still on 
holiday? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well he said he would lose the sale if he did 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 16 of 236 
 
not do it then. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And why did you not suggest to him that he just 
go to his bank and withdraw R300 00? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well he said that the bank – well I mean that he 
wanted cash and I said well I happen to have it.  It was just that I had 
it.  I mean I was not going to use it for anything so I gave it to him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you – you did not see it as odd that he 
would not want to go and get R300 000 cash out of his own bank 
account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I just understood it to be short notice that he 
10 
needed to execute that sale quickly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he went to you rather than a bank? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well he asked me and as I happen to have it 
then I gave it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you follow up with him afterwards about 
whether he did purchase the car? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I was still on holiday.  When I got back I did 
not think anything of it.  I just obviously had told Eugene to make sure 
it comes off his – obviously of his loan to – or his account with me into 
– into – against my shareholder loan account. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us just explore that a little bit further.  
Your brother’s affidavit before this commission indicates that you and 
Mr Van Wyk held an interest in vintage cars, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No we did not have an interest in vintage cars.  
We had – interest as in shareholding or interest as in [intervention]. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 17 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No, no, no you were interested. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  We shared a passion about it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is a passion right that is probably a better 
word.  A passion for vintage cars.  Tell us a bit about that?  How did 
that develop in your relationship? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At the start when he used to attend functions he 
mentioned that he used to collect classic Rolls Royce’s.  He even 
showed me pictures at the time of some classic Rolls Royce’s that he 
had.  He had mentioned – in fact that is why that number resonated 
with me was he had mentioned previously in the year that he was 
10 
looking at buying another one and the price range he spoke about was 
the R300 000.  So it sort of resonated when he asked for R300 000 for 
the car. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the whole car would cost R300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja it is a 1984 car thereabouts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh so – so it was a specific car a 1984 car? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No when we spoke about cars it was in that 
price range for that time of period of car.  So a 1984 Rolls Royce would 
cost in the region of R300 000.  He did not have a specific car in mind 
then. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you ever look at each other’s vintage cars 
or anything? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I had never seen his.  He has never come to my 
home with one but I have never seen it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So… 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 18 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He knew that I had some as well.  I had an 
Anglia and a Chevy. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you never drove them together at any 
eventsMR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the – did he specifically mention the 1984 
car again when he spoke to you in early 2016? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to go to what you 
say further down at paragraph 13 on page 25 because there you 
account much of what you have said already that you were out of town 
10 
on that day, that you sent your brother to collect the money in the 
house and meet with the person sent by Mr Van Wyk.  And then you go 
on and say: 
“Mr Van Wyk called me later to confirm receipt.” 
And you say you can confirm that your brother would confirm this if he 
was to be called.  Of course events have developed since then.  Your 
brother gave an affidavit to the commission. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Together with your affidavit on the 12 t h July, is 
that correct? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I would like you please to read what 
follows thereafter from the sentence “at this stage”? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At this stage? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 19 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  
“I had sold one of my cars a 2009 DBS Aston Martin 
and the buyer gave me some of the fund in cash.  I 
sold the car for R1.4 million and R300 000 was paid 
in cash and the balance was paid to my account.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then carry on. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   
“And that is the reason why I had cash on hand.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you do you remember why that was 
added in your statement after the previous version that you had worked 
10 
on? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I cannot recall – I cannot recall why. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall a meeting in April with the 
commission where they probed why there would be R300 000 lying 
around at your house?  And was this the explanation you gave them? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you had a meeting on the 6 t h May with 
the commission where this aspect was probed further with you, is that 
correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you recall being asked to provide your 
bank statements in order to get further support for the version that 
appears at paragraph 13? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall having provided those bank

statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think there would have been submitted. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you recall whether they reflected a 
payment around that time of R1.4 million into your account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was not reflected at that time.  The buyer 
obviously secured the car with me but he had a delay in terms of 
obviously securing his finance so at the time when the finance went 
through I think we submitted those documents through to you of the 
agreement of sale that happened later. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the [intervention]. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But that is – that happened in 2017 I think but 
you have got the documents. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We do.  The document you submitted is a sale 
in September 2018.  So can I just be clear.  On the 4 t h January 2016 
you had R300 000 in cash at your house because of a sale of a car that 
only materialised in September 2018? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes because the buyer obviously he was 
leaving his employment and he wanted to obviously secure the car.  
Well he did not at the time have the money to be able to secure finance 
or he could not get finance for the car so he asked me to obviously wait 
20 
and that is when we finalised the sale was when he was able to do so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Two years and seven months later? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is – well look he had paid – the car is a 
special car.  It is a collector’s item so obviously he wanted to secure it.  
He paid me the R300 000 to secure it. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 21 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen do you know that your brother has 
a different account of why you had R300 000 in your house at the time? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No.  What does his affidavit saying? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Has – has he not seen that affidavit before Mr 
Natasen? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh he has it is an affidavit he produced for the 
commission. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he produced okay, okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you go in the same bundle to page 238.144.  
Well let us just orientate ourselves.  Let us go back two pages so that 
you will see the [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry 238? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  .1 – apologies.  238.142 Chair is where I would 
like to commence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the same bundle? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I might have inverted the numbers.  In the 
same bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:  2 – I have got 238.1, 238.2,  
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair you going to have to go quite a 
bit further because it is – it is a point after 238 but you have got to go 
all the way down to 238.142. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I did give the apology at the outset for 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 22 of 236 
 
these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For these dreadful numberings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the affidavit of Mr Sherwin Natasen? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct.  Do you have that page Mr Natasen? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is Mr Sherwin Natasen your brother? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And this is an affidavit that you produced to the 
commission? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was an annexure to the affidavit that you 
provided on the 12 t h July 2019 on the morning before you testified last 
time, do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you go over to page 238.144. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see at paragraph 9 at the top of the page 
your brother says there: 
“Mr Natasen with a reference to you advised him that 
20 
you had built up some cash from selling off some of 
his old cars, some sparts – parts and spares and had 
scraped up the R300 000 to give to a person that Van 
Wyk had designated to collect from the office.” 
Do you see that? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 23 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you see that that is different to the version 
you have just given? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  His understanding was that I had sold an old 
car. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No his understanding is that you had scraped 
together R300 000 by selling cars in plural, some parts and spares, do 
you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes but that is his understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So… 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I did not specifically tell him I sold my Aston 
and had a 300 000 deposit there.  His understanding was it was from 
selling of my old cars. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But he says this is what you told him.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja, but that is his understanding.  I did not say 
- I said I sold car.  So that is how he understood it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He understood I sold a car to mean you would 
scrap together pursuant to numerous car sales and sales of parts and 
spares R300 000.  Is that your testimony? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well that is his understanding of what I was - 
20 
he was told but I said I had sold my car. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is the specific Aston Martin in respect of 
which ownership only passed in September 2018 that you say you got 
R300 000 for in cash in early 2016? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  To secure the car.  The buyer needed to secure 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 24 of 236 
 
the car because obviously he wanted it and he did not want me to sell it 
elsewhere and when he got the money then or the ability to finance it 
he financed it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you tell us who that purchaser was? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I can.  It is in my - I think it is in my affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is not to my recollection. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay.  His name is Gerald Strauss. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Strauss.  So he paid you R300 000 in cash for 
a car in 2016 and you remained the owner of it for two years and seven 
months and then you got paid the balance? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we were to ask Mr Strauss about that 
would he confirm that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  You are welcome to ask him.  We can provide 
the details. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would he confirm it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He will confirm it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am - I was not sure whether - whether that 
question was - was fine but you have answered.  Whether or not he 
would confirm (intervenes). 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is up to him but ultimately I know what 
happened - what transpired.  That is my version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is what I am saying that unless you 
have recently spoken to him and asked him whether if he has called 
you would confirm that you would not know … 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 25 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay.  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether will he confirm.  All you would know is if as 
far as you are concerned if he tells the Commission what happened he 
should confirm but … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we - I think we do understand.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Thank you Chair.  Just one point of 
clarification when was the cash given to you in relation to the car? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was before I left on holiday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when was that? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It would have been during early December? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of 2015? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you not go and place it in the bank? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I was about to leave on my holiday.  So I just 
kept and sometimes I might need it to buy another car or - or jewellery 
or watches or something which I would pay cash for with that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So do you generally keep quite a bit of cash 
available? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I had already testified that I do not. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this was a rare occasion … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct, correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMYR:  Where you kept 300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in December it was your intention to keep 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 26 of 236 
 
it in cash in case you needed it for a purchase? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Either of jewellery or cars.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why did you then hand it over to Mr Van Wyk 
on 4 January 2016 if your intention was to keep it for your purchasing? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He asked for it and I was going to take it off the 
monies that I was going to give back to him or it was basically just an 
offset. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to go to your 
10 
12 July statement and we can pick that up at page 2-3-8.6-6 in the 
same bundle, A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-3-8 …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Point 6-6 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  That is not where it starts hey? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It does not start there no indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It starts a few pages back at 2-3-8.6-1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen can you confirm this is the 
20 
statement you provided to the Commission on the morning before you 
testified last time? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I am picking it up at page 66 - 2-3-8.6-6 
because I would like to look at paragraph 24 there because this is the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 27 of 236 
 
part of your 12 July statement in which you deal with the R300 000.  Do 
you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there you say similarly to the testimony 
you have given today that: 
“During or about January 2016 Van Wyk requested 
that I release the amount of 300 000 …” 
Being the transaction referred to above.  That is where you 
would itemise what payments were made and you say: 
“…in cash to him as a matter of urgency with the 
10 
advises that he needed same for an urgent personal 
purchase.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is consistent with what you have told us 
this morning.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just confirm because it maybe that 
Mr Van Wyk comes to give evidence in due course before this 
Commission.  Did he at any point in this conversation with in early 
20 
January 2016 refer to the ANC’s annual celebrations and need for cash 
in relation to that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did he make any reference to reflector 
jackets that were required for those celebrations and in respect of 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 28 of 236 
 
which he needed to pay R300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Definitely not with me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you; and Mr Natasen you then go on and 
you say: 
“In the light of the fact that I was away at the time I 
asked my brother Sherwin to attend at my house, 
open the safe and to take the amount of R300 000 
from my own personal funds in order to make 
payment to Mr Van Wyk urgently which Sherwin duly 
attended to.” 
10 
Do you see there? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr Natasen it is clear it seems to me from 
this that it was your own personal funds not the funds of Neo Solutions 
that were being used to give to Mr Van Wyk on 4 January.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it would be fair I suggest unless you 
hold a different view that it was you in your personal capacity - not Neo 
Solutions the company but you in your personal capacity - who was now 
assisting Mr Van Wyk to convert a portion of the monies that have come 
20 
into Neo Solutions into cash for his own use.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  It was personal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does that mean? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I said it is correct that you say that the funds 
were my personal funds.  However I - the transaction was processed 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 29 of 236 
 
where I took it off the monies that he had with us and that - those funds 
or that monies against my personal loan account to the company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we look at that because you do pick it up 
at paragraph 25?  At paragraph 25 you say there: 
“In light of the fact that my own personal funds had 
been used in order to repay Van Wyk as mentioned 
in paragraph 24 same would have to be repaid to 
me from Van Wyk’s funds that Neo Solutions was 
possessed of in due course.” 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would just like to explore that a little bit 
further.  You say would have to be repaid.  Were they repaid? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I deducted it from the amounts that he had with 
us. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes but you say here - remember it is your own 
personal funds.  So you had to be repaid.  Were you repaid? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No.  It is still sitting in my loan account with the 
company.  So they were not repaid to me from the company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What loan account is that? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My loan account with Neo Solutions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which bank account is that bank account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is not a bank account.  It is a - it is a journal 
entry.  It is a general ledger item. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So - sorry I am confused because we 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 30 of 236 
 
will go to it now but there is a particular entry on the bank statements 
of Neo Solutions that you have identified previously in your affidavits 
before this Commission and in your 204 Statement relating to this 
transaction.  So forgive me if I was focusing on bank statements. 
Let me just make sure that I understand your evidence.  So 
your evidence is that you personally have never been repaid that 
money.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It has never come into your personal bank 
account with Nedbank.  Correct? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we can then go to that line item 
that I was referring to in bank statements that you have previously 
provided and you will find that at page 14 of the same bundle that we 
are working in. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Page 14? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now Mr Natasen I would just like to orientate 
you as to what this document is.  It is a document that you initially 
supplied when you produced your Section 204 Statement and which you 
have subsequently provided to the Commission again as an annexure to 
20 
your 12 July statement. 
Now the way that this is described we need to go back into 
your statement just to understand.  So if we could to that.  You go back 
a few pages and you will find that at page 7 of the same bundle that is 
DD10A. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 31 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think the 300 000 is brought - brought up 
twice but you are on paragraph 6. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am at paragraph 6 where you say: 
“Van Wyk requested that an amount of 300 000 
needs to be paid to him in cash and this amount 
was paid to him on 4 January 2016.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then there is a further indication over the 
page at 11 where you say: 
10 
“Van Wyk also requested a portion of funds in cash 
i.e. an amount of 300 000 given to him in cash on 
4 January 2016.” 
Right and then as I understand the statement what is 
attached to it is then the bank statements reflecting that and the other 
amounts.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us go to page 13 if we may. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  I am at (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At page 13 those are the bank statements 
20 
showing the monies coming into Koreneka.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Monies coming into? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Nedbank from Koreneka. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From Koreneka into the Neo Solutions Nedbank 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 32 of 236 
 
account.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go over the page that is what 
you flag as the entry in the bank account on the 1 s t - 4 January 2016 
related to the 300 000 cash that was paid to Mr Van Wyk.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen when you testified last time you 
said that that entry indicates a transfer from the Neo Solutions 
Nedbank account to the Neo Solutions Standard Bank account.  Is that 
correct? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was it then identified as the entry on the 
bank statements of Neo Solutions that related to the 300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My - my understanding is the accountant at the 
time processed that transfer to reflect then that - he did the journal 
entry or ought to have done at the time.  The journal entry in the books 
to show that it goes against my loan account but this was effectively 
accounting for the fact that this money is no longer part of Van Wyk’s 
monies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would just like to leave if we may accounting 
20 
matters aside from bank statements and monies. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay, but that is my understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly.  I understand your evidence to be 
you used your own personal funds to give R300 000 in cash to 
Mr Van Wyk.  Correct? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 33 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And no suspicions were raised for you when he 
called you on 4 January and asked for cash to buy a car.  Is that 
correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you did not probe with him why he did not 
go and get it from the bank? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well I - I understood it to be short notice that 
he wanted to conclude the sale on the vehicle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would that make a journey to the bank 
10 
unavailable to him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I do not know how long it takes to secure 
300 000 cash from a bank on short notice. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you ask? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you say to him you would - the previous 
month given him seven million of the 9.9 that he had deposited with 
your company in November and so why does he not use some of that 
money? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I did not ask.  Remember I understood that to 
20 
be related to property. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then when you deposed to your 204 
Statement and when you give your affidavits to this Commission you 
highlight this transaction in the bank statement of Neo Solutions on 
4 January as being related to the 300 000 in cash that you gave 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 34 of 236 
 
Mr Van Wyk.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But this entry has nothing to do with you 
personally or Mr Van Wyk.  Does it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My understanding is when you deal - help 
prepare the statement, went and sat with the accountant.  The 
accountant had explained to him that this was to give effect to record 
on his side that the funds were no longer - they were coming off 
Van Wyk’s amount on the Nedbank account and he accounted for them 
in the Standard Bank account as then part of Neo Solutions money. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen is this statement Mr Judiel’s 
statement or your statement? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The statement - Mr Judiel assisted me in 
preparing the statement when he gave me the facts and he also in - 
interrogated the accountant at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But did you check what was being said in the 
statement and attached to the statement before you deposed to it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  We - when we sat down he - I understood 
this to be the nature of why it was reflected here.  To - to give effect to 
the fact that these monies had come off the loan account. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But why did you not say but this is not a 
payment to me and it was me who gave me R300 000 in cash.  So I 
must look for some entry that reflects that R300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Because this to me was the - to reflect that it is 
now out against my shareholder loan account and therefore it is 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 35 of 236 
 
accounted for correctly in reconciling to the full 9.9. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen you will accept though that it is 
simply a transfer between one Neo Solutions bank account to another 
Neo Solutions bank account.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That has been my testimony already. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen you also indicated that 
you made no inquiries of Mr Van Wyk afterwards about the actual 
vintage car that he urgently needed monies for.  Is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you have any knowledge of whether he 
10 
did buy a car around that time? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I - I testified that I did not have any knowledge. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies if I missed that.  So you just had no 
follow up with him about whether the urgent 300 000 was actually used 
to buy the car? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I was still away on holiday.  So I think a week 
or two had transpired when I got back and then obviously I did not think 
anything of it since. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you continue to have interactions with him 
after that point? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  He was still obviously on the farming 
venture.  There was still interaction happening. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at no point you asked him whether he 
concluded the sale that he urgently needed the monies for. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I cannot recall if we did or did not discuss it 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 36 of 236 
 
afterwards. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So would it surprise you to learn that he made 
no purchase of any vintage car around that period? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I cannot speculate on that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I am asking would it surprise you if you 
were now told Mr Van Wyk made no purchase of any vintage car around 
that time. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well given what we know of what has happened 
obviously it does not surprise me but at that point in time I know he had 
a collection of cars and he had shown me pictures.  So based on it I 
10 
assumed he would have bought one. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So do you now accept that he was asking for 
the R300 000 for something other than a purchase of a vintage car? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I cannot speculate on that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well I understood your evidence to be now 
knowing everything we know you would not be surprised that he had not 
purchased the car.  What does that mean? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well if - if the funds were used for something 
then I do not know what they were used for. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it would not surprise you that they were 
20 
used for something other than what he told you they were going to be 
used for. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have answered that already. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What was the answer?  Just remind me. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That it would not surprise me now. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 37 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen just to conclude on this 
aspect then I would like your comment on these aspects of your 
evidence.  It is clear that you paid Mr Van Wyk R300 000 in cash from 
your personal funds.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have said that already. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you thereby enabled him to convert a 
portion of the money that had been paid into the Neo Solutions bank 
account into cash.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Thereby enabled - please clarify. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So remember what happened was the 
10 
business of Koreneka through an electronic funds transfer that is 
tracked through the banking system paid 9.9 million into Neo Solutions 
bank account.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is no electronic transfer record of the 
R300 000 cash that you paid - you gave to Mr Van Wyk or facilitated 
been given to him on 4 January 2016.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The consequence of that is that funds that are 
tracked in the electronic banking system were converted to cash in a 
20 
way that will not be reflected on that system.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it would not be reflected as a payment out 
of Neo Solutions directly to Mr Van Wyk.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 38 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it would not be reflected in Mr Van Wyk’s 
own bank account if he had gone to a bank and actually withdrawn the 
300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is what I mean when I say convert monies 
that came into the account in a particular way that can be tracked by an 
electronic banking system into cash. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct and that was the basis of the creation 
of the 204 - the Section 204 affidavit was because of the cash flow. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and you identified a transaction on 
10 
4 January 2016 for this cash payment that had nothing to do with the 
cash that you gave Mr Van Wyk.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Explain. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you ask her - was there - did you give 
an answer or did you ask her to repeat? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No.  I am trying to understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I think please repeat your question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  You will recall that the line item on the 
Neo Solutions bank account - bank statements that you identified in 
20 
your 204 Statement as related to the 300 000 cash that was given to 
Mr Van Wyk on 4 January 2016 … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is the entry we saw at page 14.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct, yes. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 39 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that that bank entry is not 
reflective of the cash that you gave Mr Van Wyk on that day? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have explained that my accountant processed 
that transfer to show that that was no longer part of Van Wyk’s money 
and it then became my money through my loan account in the company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen can we leave accounts from bank 
statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I do not think you can.  I think … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  They are - they are inextricably linked into the 
10 
transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Explain to me how that is because as I 
understand what is happening as a matter of banking is Neo Solutions 
has two bank accounts.  Is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And one is with Standard Bank and one is with 
the Nedbank.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So what happens on 4 January according to 
this banking entry is that monies taken from the Nedbank Neo Solutions 
20 
account to the Standard Bank Neo Solutions account.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That has nothing to do with cash that your 
brother went and collected at your house on 4 January and gave to 
Mr Van Wyk? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 40 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I - I have clarified this already.  The Neo 
Solutions Standard Bank account is our normal transacting account.  
When we engaged with Nedbank the intention was to move our banking 
across to Nedbank overtime.  However our - our day to day transacting 
and you would have seen it from our bank statements happens in our 
Standard Bank account. 
So the transfer that our accountant at the time did was to 
reflect that these funds were no longer Van - Van Wyk’s monies.  They 
were sitting in the Nedbank account at that time which had not had 
much other accounting activity which you can see on the statement.  So 
10 
it was placed there because the intention over time was to move 
across. 
However the moment he moved this 300 000 across it was his 
way of reflecting that these funds now belonged to - via me - into Neo 
Solutions.  That was the way he processed the transaction.  So you 
cannot say that - yes I understand from your perspective.  I had given 
him cash personally. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Right.  However the way it is recorded here was 
to take it off in the way he accounted for it.  Take it off the loan account 
20 
that Brian had into the use by Neo all be repaid to me at some point in 
time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it was not repaid to you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I to date have not drawn that money out. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it sits in the Standard Bank account and did 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 41 of 236 
 
you instruct your accountant to identify this as the entry reflective of 
…? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I did not.  It - it was the way he processed it 
in - for his understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But why did you regard it then as the entry that 
would identify for a Section 204 purposes the transaction? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  When we - when he had explained it to Judiel 
remember I had first briefed - when Judiel came to me I had then 
explained to him how this thing had transpired.  He went and got the 
accounting information from the accountant and then we sat together 
10 
and we went through the affidavit.  When I explained to him this is how 
it happened he said include it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You said include it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Judiel - Jan Judiel. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you were taken his advice as to which item 
to identify as related to this? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  He had everything and then his advice was 
include more - include this in so that you can then reconcile in total to 
the understanding of the 9.9 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In January 2016 Mr Natasen did Neo Solutions 
20 
have an overdraft facility on its Standard Bank account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you sure about that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think you subpoenaed that information. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 42 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think we did in - at that point in time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well we can go to it in due course because that 
is not our understanding.  That - our understanding is that there was no 
overdraft facility available in Standard Bank at the time.  There was an 
overdraft facility available … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  (Intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In Nedbank.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think that is correct, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  That answer when you say that is correct 
10 
… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The Nedbank facility was definitely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but does it mean then … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The Standard Bank I cannot recall when we 
were shut down - when we were in the process of migration across. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No what I want to understand is whether that 
answer now means that the two of you agree that there was no 
overdraft at Standard Bank but there was at - at Nedbank? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is the position? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay, taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I am asking whether you - that is what your 
answer means. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I cannot recall the exact date that we moved 
facilities between the two banks.  I was aware there was a Nedbank 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 43 of 236 
 
facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not sure when the Standard Bank’s facility 
did - did not or cease to exist at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage there was an overdraft facility … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At Standard … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the Standard Bank account but you cannot 
remember when it was? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me assist you then if I may.  You will find 
the email in which you move across to Nedbank in EXHIBIT DD10B.  So 
we will move to the other file now Chair if we may and Mr Natasen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that DD10B? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  B and you will pick this communication with 
Standard Bank from Neo Solutions at page 4-4-2.1-3-1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  4-4-2. … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Point 1-3-1 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-3-1. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen do you see the email at the bottom 
20 
of that page?  Apologies.  I see … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is an email as I have it.  Can you tell us 
who it is from and to? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So it is from Standard Bank Pamela Lamprecht. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 44 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No apologies.  The - the one in the second half 
of the page. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay.  From Jerome Jones who is part of my 
accounting department to Isaac at Standard Bank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the date of that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is 28 July 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you read for us - just clarify were you 
copied on that email? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And just indicate to us what has been 
10 
communicated there by Mr Jones to Standard Bank. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  “That we will move our business to 
another 
bank 
with 
effect 
from 
tomorrow 
- 
29 July 2015.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So does that give you the satisfaction you need 
… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To indicate to the Chair that you and I are 
agreed that by the time of the transaction in January 2016 you did not 
have an overdraft facility at Standard Bank but you did have an 
20 
overdraft facility at Nedbank. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At Nedbank, correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Natasen.  I would 
now like to move to an aspect of your testimony last time which had to 
be conducted at the level of a hypothetical.  You might recall that 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 45 of 236 
 
because at the time we were dealing with your financial statements 
ending February 2016 and we were dealing with your evidence at the 
page of those financial statements where cash and cash equivalents in 
the business were reflected.  Do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when we looked at that number you said 
something appears wrong about it.  Do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I said yes it does not reflect the facilities on 
the overdraft. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and just in fairness to you let us get 
10 
that page Mr Natasen.  You will find it at page 2-10 if my memory 
serves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we back to …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of DD10A Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Unfortunately we are back there.  Apologies 
and it was page 2-0-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-0-7? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  You will recall there as I recall your 
testimony we looked down at the bank overdraft line item which was at 
20 
the bottom of the page and that is when you said you thought that there 
was an error.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then what we did was we had a 
hypothetical engagement about if we could get the bank statements and 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 46 of 236 
 
if they could tell us what the position was at end of February 2016 and 
if they showed that there was not an amount of 2.6 million available to 
repay Mr Van Wyk at that point then it was the case that Neo Solutions 
had made use of the funds that Mr Van Wyk had deposited with the 
company.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Hypothetically yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and your answer in fairness to you in 
the transcript at page 170 line 12 is you said: 
“Yes in theory.” 
Correct.  Mr Natasen we have … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Remember just to articulate your answers 
so the recording … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Oh.  Instead of nodding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when you nod it does not get (intervenes). 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  (Intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So Mr Natasen since your last testimony we 
have been able to establish what the position was in relation to the two 
bank accounts of Neo Solutions at the end of February 2016, I can take 
20 
you to those documents.  they actually were attached to a second 
affidavit that your erstwhile accountant provided to the Commission 
which you have been provided with, let’s go to those two bank 
statements if we may, you’ll find them in DD10A bundle and you’ll find 
them at page 238.200. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 47 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   238.200? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    238.200 Yes Chair.  Mr Natasen this is the 
record that Mr Patel indicates he used in order to establish the position 
– cash  position of the business at the end of February 2016 and what 
is relevant if the fifth line down there because that is the balance in the 
account, if you look at the date column Chair, which is the second from 
the end on the right-hand side, if you go down to the fifth item that’s 
the last reflected balance on the date of 2016-02-29 which I understand 
to be the 29 t h of February 2016, is that as you understand it Mr 
Natasen? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And will you tell us what the balance there is 
in the Standard Bank account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Okay this one has been highlighted quite a bit 
over, I think it’s R384 188.22. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right so about R380 000 was sitting in the 
Standard Bank account, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then if you go over the page in the same 
bundle that’s the position in the Nedbank account of Neo Solutions as I 
20 
have it at the end of February 2016, and you’ll find it’s the last line 
item on that page, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And what is the balance on that date? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Minus R4632 328.23. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 48 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right and just to remind ourselves there’s no 
overdraft facility in the Standard Bank account at this time correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m assuming so because of that email. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes that was your testimony so you 
had…[intervenes]. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   There was a point that the Standard Bank 
facilities were re-instated but I’m not sure when that was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right but as at February 2016 there’s only 
cash available of R384 000, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   On the Standard Bank account? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That’s – but I’m not sure if there’s an overdraft 
facility. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No we’ve just clarified that in your evidence. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   No remember we had terminated and moved 
across but Standard Bank then won our business back and we were in 
the process then of migrating back, hence the March movements where 
the transacting happened from Standard Bank.  So I’m not sure what 
those dates are but I know a Standard Bank overdraft facility was then 
re-instated at some point but I don’t know the date of that here. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If we get some information from Standard 
Bank and they indicate it wasn’t available in February 2016. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Ja then I’ll concede that but I’m not sure when, 
as I’m saying I’m not sure when it was re-instated…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If there wasn’t an overdraft…[intervenes]. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 49 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   It would have been thereabouts on that time 
because the transacting started happening from Standard Bank from 
March the next period onward, literally a month after this, so I’m not 
sure about that date is, Chair, of when the facility was re-instated with 
Standard Bank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    The facility was not re-instated on the 29 t h of 
February 2016, then the only cash you have available to you with 
Standard Bank is R384 000, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes, if that’s the case yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And in Nedbank what was your overdraft 
10 
facility at February 2016? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   At R5million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So you had used up R4.6million of that 
amount by the end of February 2016, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So the remaining available would be about 
R400 000 or a bit less because that’s R4.632million correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So it’s in the order of about R370 000 would 
have been available in the Nedbank account, correct? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So as at February 2016 you did not have 
R2.9million rands available to repay Mr Van Wyk, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   If he placed a demand on that – on us at that 
point in time, yes but our ability with the banks is obviously to request 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 50 of 236 
 
temporary facilities whenever we have project demands, so we do, do 
that as a matter of course all the time.  So had he come through and 
requested funds on short notice we would have made an application 
and got an extension against it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So the thing we’re interested in at the moment 
Mr Natasen is whether Neo Solutions, the company made use of the 
R9.9million that was deposited with it in November 2016 and what we – 
I want to put to you have established with these two bank statements is 
that by the end of February 2016 you had used, as a business, the bulk 
of the R9.9million because available to you at that stage as a level of 
10 
cash was R300 000 sitting in the Standard Bank account and about 
R370 000 sitting in the Nedbank account, do you agree with that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   We did not make use of the R9.9million 
because these funds were returned to him a month later, a bulk of the 
funds were returned to him so as at the year end balance there was an 
amount of R2.6million that still needed to be returned to him.  So as I 
said already, if he had approached us to request those funds back I 
would have been able to obviously adjust my facilities and return his 
money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen I accept what you’ve said I want 
20 
to know whether the monies were used to fund the cash flow of Neo 
Solutions between November of 2015 and the 29 t h of February 2016, 
that’s really what I’m interested in. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   The funds were not in a ring-fenced account so 
by very nature they are part of our operations, so as I said if he had 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 51 of 236 
 
approached us to say, can I have my money back tomorrow we would 
have been able to return these monies by adjusting our facilities 
accordingly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So they were used to fund the cash flow of 
the business between November 2015…[intervenes]. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   No I’m not saying that they were inside our 
operational cash flow of the business because they were not in a ring-
fenced bank account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Explain to me the difference, the funds are 
being…[intervenes]. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   You are trying to imply, with due respect, you 
are trying to imply that I used his money to run my business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That is not the case, the funds were sitting in 
our operational bank accounts, as I said I always understood that to be 
his money so if he ever approached me to return his money it would 
have been returned.  It was not a decision where we would use his 
money to keep Neo as a company alive, that was not there, and I don’t 
20 
appreciate you trying to insinuate that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen just trying to understand the 
position of your business between November 2015…[intervenes]. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I appreciate you understanding – I appreciate 
the understanding but to imply that we manipulated the situation to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 52 of 236 
 
utilise that cash flow, it’s not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Miss Hofmeyr will deal with the question the way 
she decides to deal with it but I think what she – what both of you 
accept is that at a certain time, and there was less money in the bank 
account than should have been there if – in order to meet any request 
from Mr van Wyk for that payment without having to make other 
arrangements with the bank, I think both of you accept that. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja that at a certain time there wasn’t enough money 
in the account. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Our limits are flexible, Chair, we are a projects 
business so if I land a large project I sit with the bank and I adjust my 
limits accordingly to be able to service a project. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   So if there’s any change in my facility 
requirements I sit with the bank.  If we set up facility, let’s say 
R10million then the banks about four/five years ago introduced a 
charge for unutilised portion of overdraft limits.  So we have a policy 
that we sit with them and we work out the limits at each point in time.  
So had van Wyk approached me to say, I do require my money now I 
20 
would have then gone to the bank and say, can I adjust my limit 
accordingly so that I don’t pay that fee for the unutilised portions. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, no, no I understand that and I think Miss 
Hofmeyr also understands that.  As I understand the position both of 
you accept that at a certain time the amount that was in the bank 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 53 of 236 
 
account would not have been enough to repay Mr van Wyk without you 
having to make arrangements with the bank. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Both of you accept that, both of you also accept, 
don’t you, that the money in the account had been used for the 
business of the – for the business, you both accept that, is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   They sat within the operational account, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes whatever money, you know and what you are 
saying is you didn’t put Mr van Wyk’s money aside it was mixed up so 
to speak with…[intervenes]. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct we just kept a reconciliation account. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and that mixed up money if you know what  I 
understand was used for operations of the business but I think what 
you want to say is, in using the money in the account you didn’t have in 
mind that I’m now using van Wyk’s money, what you are saying is, you 
knew that there is money that may have to be refunded to 
…[intervenes]. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   All placed into the farming venture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you took comfort in the knowledge that you 
could go to the bank anytime and if he needed his money and then be 
20 
able to pay him.  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but what I think you are not denying is that the 
mixed money was used for the operations of the business.  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Ja they sat in the operational accounts. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 54 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, I don’t know if that has helped? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It has indeed Chair, I’m indebted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen why didn’t you put in a separate 
account if you wanted to identify it as not associated with the business 
of Neo Solutions? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   The understanding at the time was that the 
funds were going to go quite quickly to the farming venture so no 
separate money market account was set up for that.  The intention was, 
it wasn’t going to last that long in the account and obviously the 
10 
venture took longer than planned and he had drawn by then, so it just 
became a comedy of errors in not achieving that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right so it was contemplated in the 
arrangement with him that it could be placed in the operational account 
of the business and would be utilised by the business in the interim and 
as and when he needed it repaid you’d make arrangements for that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well the intention was to put it to farming, the 
farming venture or the business venture.  When he started to collect or 
retrieve money back to himself that then changed that scenario but it 
was not an agreement that it would be used in Neo’s operations it was 
20 
neither discussed nor agreed it just happened. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But wouldn’t you have wanted to ensure that 
it was kept separate unless it was going to be utilised by the business? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   We had a reconciliation running either way was 
fine it was not the intention to utilise it by the business it was that we 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 55 of 236 
 
would take it we would then go into the business together he would 
transfer across and that timing was not expected to be any long period 
of time at the time when we started this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    As a matter of fact though you didn’t take 
steps to ensure that it wasn’t used by the business, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   No as I said it wasn’t contemplated. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    What was not contemplated? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That it was going to be there for any long 
period of time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, Mr Natasen I’d then like to go to 
10 
the facility agreements that you had with Nedbank at the time because 
that’s the one that applied the R5million overdraft facility and you’ll 
find that in Exhibit DD10B – Oh Chair I see we’re just before the tea 
break, it is a topic with a new document, maybe it makes sense to take 
the break now and then we can find those documents over the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we’ll take the tea adjournment and resume at 
half past eleven, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  We were going to look at the 
overdraft facility agreement with Neo Solutions and Nedbank and you 
will find that in DD10b at page 442.137.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Please repeat the page? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 56 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  442.137. 
CHAIRPERSON:  442. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  137. 
CHAIRPERSON:  137.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen can you explain what this document 
is? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is the agreement for the overdraft facility with 
Nedbank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is an agreement between which 
entities? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Neo Solutions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And Nedbank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I see a date at the top of page 442.137 
what is that date? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is February 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if you go over to the end of that document 
which you will find at 442.142 is that your signature sort of a third of 
the way down the page and then in the middle of the page? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can you confirm that this was the overdraft 
facility agreement in place between Neo Solutions and Nedbank from 
February 2015? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And if you can tell us consistent 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 57 of 236 
 
with your evidence previously at clause 3 it indicates what the amount 
of the overdraft facility is, what is that reflected there? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is R5 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen can I suggest you bring the 
microphone just a bit closer so that for record purposes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is clear.  So you indicated the overdraft 
facility was R5 million, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  R5 million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. And then if we go over the page to 
10 
.138. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I have just seen it.  I did not see at the time the 
reference to R5 million but I have just seen it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is clause 3.1.1 for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go over the page to 442.138 I would 
20 
like to look at the last clause on that page that reads other conditions.  
Can you read for us the other condition at clause 8.1? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  Okay it is: 
“Full transactional banking it is of there it is redacted 
and then Neo Solutions moves the Nedbank with a 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 58 of 236 
 
ninety days of acceptance of this offer.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that seems to accord with your previous 
testimony, is that correct?  That you had to move your transactional 
banking facilities from Standard Bank to Nedbank in accordance with 
this agreement, is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there was that email saying in July 2015 
that we looked at that we moving it across.  So did you comply with this 
requirement? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct.  Well over time we were trying to 
10 
comply but moving or changing the bank details with most of our 
government clients was very difficult so we were in constant email 
communications with Nedbank explaining where there were problems 
altering the information to change it to Nedbank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And then over the page at 442.139 
you will see there there is a clause 11.1.2, do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  11.1.2 yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is under a heading called Undertakings and if 
I may just read that clause to you?  It says: 
“The 
borrowers 
hereby 
unconditionally 
and 
20 
irrevocably undertake and then if you pick it up at 
sub 2 to furnish Nedbank with the management 
accounts of the borrower and any security provider 
on a quarterly basis as soon as they become 
available and in any event within 30 days after the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 59 of 236 
 
end of the period to which such management 
accounts relate.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I see that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you comply with that requirement? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think we were providing them instead with a 
project schedule showing what projects we were busy with, what 
income is coming from the project which they accepted instead of 
this.them instead with a project schedule showing what projects we 
were busy with, what income is coming from the project which they 
10 
accepted instead of this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is there some amendment to this 
agreement to that effect? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No it was not amended I think we had submitted 
those and whenever they requested information of what incoming cash 
flows there are we had submitted that and they accepted that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you do that on a quarterly basis?  What 
was the arrangement? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was a monthly basis that they would submit – 
that the accountants would submit that. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And would there be correspondence to that 
effect where they were satisfied that 11.1.2 was complied with albeit 
that management accounts were not provided? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not sure.  The accounting office would 
deal with the bank – the business banker and they would either meet or 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 60 of 236 
 
discuss it and they would share the schedule out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they ever complain that you had not complied with 
this condition? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No not that I am aware to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen you will recall that on 
your previous day of testimony we had to work with the hypothetical 
about what the position was at the end of February and thankfully today 
with the assistance of the bank statements we have been able to 
confirm what the actual position was because you had indicated in your 
10 
testimony that there was an error in the financials that we were working 
for – for 2016 at the time, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen there was an objection at a point in 
that evidence from your legal representative as to what the relevance 
would be if there had been use made of the funds that were received by 
Neo Solutions from Mr Van Wyk, do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to in conclusion on this aspect 
explain to you that relevance but before we do that if we can just 
20 
confirm with you given everything that you now know about the 
circumstances under which Koreneka received the funds and then Mr 
Van Wyk wanted to place them with Neo Solutions is it your view as you 
sit here today that those funds were involved in unlawful activities prior 
to them coming to Neo Solutions? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 61 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Sitting here today yes but at that point in time I 
was not aware. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed.  I am simply asking today you do 
take that view? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed you even I think took that view after 
some of this was disclosed to you by Mr Judiel and that is why I have it 
you had a conversation with Mr Van Wyk that you endeavoured to 
record at a point in the middle of 2018, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I did not endeavour I actually recorded it. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies you successfully recorded indeed but 
as I understood your evidence on that recording it was because you 
were so concerned to have learnt at that point about the unlawfulness 
of the activities that produced those funds that you were in essence 
trying to get Mr Van Wyk to confirm that you had no knowledge of that 
unlawfulness, is that a fair summary? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The way it transpired was that when I became 
aware that the funds received from Koreneka were not let us use the 
word kosher I – I then cooperated with Judiel and the authorities in 
order to provide all the information to show that we were unaware at 
20 
the time, we were not complicit at the time and we were inadvertently 
used by Van Wyk to move those monies through us.  And that is the 
basis of how the 204 came about.  There was no interaction with Van 
Wyk at the time he then called me in May of 2018 and that is when I 
chose to record the call and obviously through that him to admit that I 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 62 of 236 
 
was not aware that that was state money at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to then go to the legislation bundle 
which I dearly hope has been made available to you there. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that the Chair has a copy which could be 
handed to him. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  There is one with my transcripts. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh sorry it did come up in the break I 
requested it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we could just hand it to you.   
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Are we done with DD10? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are at the moment we will go to the 
provisions of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act.  It is a – it is a 
piece of legislation we looked at last time and you will find the relevant 
page at 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think I have not been furnished with it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are still looking for it okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I forgot that he has got some there.  But on the 
spine it would be written legislation. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He is waiting for the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I do not know if she has mentioned the page. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The page is page 17, 17. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 63 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see that this is a page within the copy 
of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act that has been placed in the 
legislation bundle.  Chair for the record that begins at page 11 but what 
we are focussing on is the provision that appears at page 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the last occasion of your evidence we 
looked both at Section 4 which dealt with money laundering and we 
looked at Section 5 which dealt with assisting another to benefit from 
the proceeds of unlawful activity.  What I would like to look at today is 
10 
Section 6 which deals with the acquisition possession or use of 
proceeds of unlawful activities.  And what I am interesting in there is 
sub B.  If I may just read that into the record and then deal with the 
questions.  Mr Natasen that section provides that  
“Any person who uses property and who knows or 
ought reasonably to have known that it is or forms 
part of the proceeds of unlawful activities shall be 
guilty of an offence.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that indicates that use of any proceeds of 
unlawful activities which ought to have been known to be lawful 
activities will constitute an offence, is that as you understand it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well as it is stated here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  And then to round up in relation to my 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 64 of 236 
 
learned friend’s concern last night – last occasion the reason for 
probing with you in fairness to you whether Neo Solutions had made 
any use of the funds that it received from Koreneka and Mr Van Wyk 
relates directly to Section 6.  Because Section 6 says: 
“Any person who uses the proceeds which they know or ought 
reasonable to have known to be the proceeds of unlawful activities will 
be guilty of an offence.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I understand the basis of you raising it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen I would then like to go 
10 
just for a moment to your 204 statement.  Because I must confess we 
had received your affidavit – your 12 July affidavit maybe forty minutes 
before the evidence started last time on the 12 July and albeit that I 
had been able to look at it very quickly I have subsequently been able 
to look at it in a bit more detail in preparation for today. And so there 
are one or two aspects that I just need to pick up on in relation to that 
statement.  You will find it right at the beginning of Exhibit DD10a.  Mr 
Natasen you gave evidence last time about how this statement came to 
be prepared and signed, do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I have your evidence and we can find it in 
the transcript if it is relevant to do so but I recall you as having said in 
your testimony that Mr Judiel obtained the bank statements from your 
accounts team and that he then prepared the draft.  He came and sat 
with you and then you said we obviously read it and I concurred with it 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 65 of 236 
 
and that is the affidavit I deposed.  You did not add to on the transcript 
but I am sure that was intended.  Is that as I recall your evidence 
correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just tell me where did you meet with Mr 
Judiel when you went through this? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He had come through to our offices. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And are those the offices in Rivonia? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you – you then said that you knew that he 
10 
was a private investigator, is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand it you had actually put Mr Van 
Wyk onto Mr Judiel at a point where he was enquiring about the 
services of a private investigator, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is not correct it was Villa who was one of 
our employees at the time who recommended Judiel. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just tell me how that came up?  How did Mr 
Van Wyk engage with you or your business at all about a private 
investigator? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No Villa Steinberg was one of the people 
working on the farming business case and [intervention]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry and is that person – can I just have the 
name again? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Villa Steinberg. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 66 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Steinberg is that person employed in Neo 
Solutions? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He was at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At the time thank you. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Specifically for the farming venture. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and how does it come about? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So when Van Wyk said that he had an issue 
with his business partner and he was looking for a private investigator 
then Steinberg – my understanding is Steinberg had recommended 
Judiel. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you know that at the time of the 
recommendation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I found out in passing.  I am not sure when they 
discussed it but I found out in passing during, on or about that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did that precede when Mr Judiel started to 
engage you about the Section 204 statement? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, no that was much earlier. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So there is already a relationship 
between Mr Van Wyk and Mr Judiel pursuant to somebody in your 
company putting them together, Correct? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at a later point you engage with Mr 
Judiel about the Section 204 statement, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  When he approached me in October of 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of 2017? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 67 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And do you recall having paid Mr 
Judiel an amount in recompense for his work on drafting the affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I was aware that he was going to invoice for 
travel expenses to come through and obviously obtain the affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So was he paid? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I believe so I mean I cannot say yes or no.  
{indistinct] but I am assuming he was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well just – just help me with that because that 
was an indication that you gave to the commission at one of your 
10 
meetings with them, is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes I said he was going to invoice for it.  I am 
not sure – if you are asking me if he was paid I cannot – I cannot say 
that yes or no here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have not confirmed that right.  Do you 
recall being asked for the confirmation of that payment? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes I think so you did ask in that – in that 
session or the commission did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes there was also a subsequent email 
requiring you to provide it.  Do you recall that? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay I think it must be there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And have you taken any steps to establish 
whether he was paid? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have not since no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it would not surprise you if he was because 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 68 of 236 
 
that was the understanding of the arrangement? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  If – that was the understanding.  He did 
indicate he wanted to be settled for his travel and disbursements. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Did that strike you as odd that a 
statement that has to be prepared under the provisions of The Criminal 
Procedure Act could be the subject matter of a payment to someone 
who would prepare it for you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was not that he was being remunerated for 
the service he was being reimbursed for his travel costs of going back 
and forth. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was simply confined to his travel. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That was my understanding. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    To Rivonia.  Did he have to travel far? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No my understanding he resides in the West 
Rand and obviously he was engaging between the DCPI in Rustenburg 
or North West Province and there.  So the amount of – I think he 
indicated around R10 000 for disbursements for travelling back and 
forth it did not look unreasonable. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  R10 000 for travelling back and forth.  
Did he do so quite a few times? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am – well I did not – I was not aware how 
many times but obviously he had to engage with the accountants to 
obtain the data so it would have been a few times that he would have to 
travel back and forth Chair.  As well as obviously head out to the North 
West or Rustenburg – I believe they were based in Rustenburg. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 69 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when you met with him on that day at your 
offices can you just take us through it.  I understood your evidence last 
time was that he had prepared the draft, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then I understood you to say you read 
through it and you satisfied yourself as to its contents, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you said you deposed to it, is that 
correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How did you depose to it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  With his attorney obviously. The las time. 
Remember the first time we had done the draft and then when he came 
through to depose then he had – he had a person on hand.  I cannot 
recall the person’s name.  It will be on the affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he brought somebody with him for the 
purposes of having you depose to the affidavit, is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right, that is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And he was in your offices when you did so? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you do not recall the name of that person? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I do not but he will be the commissioner of the 
affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so let us to go to the commissioner of 
oaths page if we can.  You will find it at 11.  Was it Johannes Marthinus 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 70 of 236 
 
Heynes? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am assuming so. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Do you recall him being introduced to 
you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No he just commissioned it for me I do not… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Mr Judiel organised for a commissioner to 
come with him. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To your offices in Rivonia for the purposes of 
deposing to the affidavit? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you depose to it in the presence of Mr 
Heynes? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And signed accordingly and then he signed, is 
that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am curious about in that regard at page 
11 Mr Natasen is why then what the commissioner of oaths indicates 
there is that the statement was sworn before him I am reading from the 
20 
third line of the commissioner’s indication there.  And the deponent’s 
signature was placed thereon in my presence at Krugersdorp on the 4 t h 
October 2017. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No it was at my offices. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why would he have filled in Krugersdorp? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 71 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think they had prefilled that section but it was 
done at my offices.  I do not know.  I actually did not see that part.  All 
I did was I signed, I passed it to him and then he had filled his. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why do you think they would have prefilled in 
Krugersdorp if it was being signed in Rivonia? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not sure.  But I am sure you can call him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am sure we can thank you.  And Mr Natasen 
in your evidence you also indicated that at that meeting when you were 
finalising all of this Mr Judiel got… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in the commissioner’s certificate Mr 
Natasen that is the same part where Ms Hofmeyr was reading from.  I 
see that the commissioner of oaths says he is the one who took the 
statement.  I certify that the above statement was taken by me.  Is that 
factually correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No it was Judiel who prepared that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he just administered the oath? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It looks like a template that they have utilised 
for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe – maybe normally it just says that or maybe 
he did not pay attention to that part.  I do not know.  I just picked it up 
that he says he is the one who took the statement. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 72 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No it was not.  I did not take the statement with 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was Judiel who assisted me in preparing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But he was in your presence in Rivonia? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That – the deposition thereof. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  And then I recall from your evidence last 
10 
time you said during that interaction somebody was put on the line an 
investigator officer, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That was the earlier interaction when he was 
explaining to me what had transpired.  It was not when we finalised 
this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was in an earlier stage that he put – I am 
assuming the investigating officer on the phone. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why do you say you assume he put the 
investigating officer on the phone? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He said he is phoning… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because your last testimony was that he put 
the investigating officer on the phone. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja well I am saying because I did not confirm it 
anything [indistinct] so I am obviously providing that clarity now to say 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 73 of 236 
 
that he put – he told me he was putting the investigating officer on the 
phone and he was obviously – he engaged with her – it was not on a 
speaker phone and they were discussing that he was preparing an 
affidavit well obviously with me and that they were – he would be 
bringing it to me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you not hear the call with the 
investigating officer? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I heard him on the call.  I heard it was a 
woman’s voice but I did not get the exact words that was being said on 
the other side.  I understood the gist of what he said on this side. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what was he saying? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He was basically explaining that he had 
obtained all the information regarding what had come through to Neo 
Solutions, how it had moved on and he was preparing an affidavit with 
me which he would bring through. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen yesterday evening we 
provided your attorneys with a further affidavit which we had received 
literally moments before from the investigating officer assigned to this 
case.  Have you seen that affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes it came through last night. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Let us go to it.  It is in the other 
bundle DD10a and it is at page 238.287.  Apologies when I said the 
other bundle I should have said the same bundle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was my error. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 74 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are in – we are still in a and it is 238.287.   
CHAIRPERSON:  .247? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  287 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  287. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is right at the back of that file that may assist 
in navigating.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that I am – Mr Natasen seems to find these 
pages much quicker than I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Maybe that he has been working on it more 
10 
recently Chair than any of us. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No it is the first time I just probably quicker in 
flipping pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we now at 238.287 and that is an affidavit 
deposed to by Ms Mokhosi and if you see at paragraph 3 she was asked 
to confirm whether she had met or had any interactions with you Mr 
Natasen in person or telephonically and she said no and she was asked 
whether anyone else from DPCI had been in contact with or met you 
and there she says not from the Mafikeng DPCI, do you see that? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Ms Mokhosi has indicated she is not had 
any interactions with you, do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct but that is consistent with what I am 
saying as well.  I deal with Mr Judiel. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 75 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and so you never engaged with her.  I had 
understood last time that there was a speaker phone, was that 
incorrect? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No he had put her on the phone and I heard the 
conversation.  Well I assumed as I said it was – the investigating 
officer but he did put someone on the phone and engaged about that he 
is securing the affidavit and he would be bringing it through to her. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  All I knew it was a woman – a female voice on 
the other side. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And Mr Judiel did you engage with 
him again before you gave evidence here on the 12 July? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes we did.  He supplied an affidavit as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would like to go to that affidavit if 
we may?  You will find it in the same bundle and it commences at page 
238.145.  Is that Mr Judiel’s affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you read it before you submitted it to the 
commission? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am aware of it yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you read it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And I understood the contents yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  If you go to 238.147.  At paragraph 123 
there Mr Judiel describes his involvement in the Section 204 statement.  
Could you read to us what he says at paragraph 13? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 76 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He says in paragraph 13: 
“It is my understanding that pursuant to my advices 
to Natasen regarding my investigations herein and 
the matter under CAZ4908/2017 Natasen prepared 
and submitted a statement in terms of Section 204 of 
The Criminal Procedure Act to the investigating 
officer.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that seems to contradict your evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was trying to see where… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is the last paragraph on 238.147. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Paragraph 13 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Page 238.147. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last paragraph? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if we can just read the relevant part 
again?  This is Mr Judiel explaining his role in the Section 204 
20 
statement and I will read it again just for the record.  
 “It is my understanding that pursuant to my advices 
to Natasen regarding my investigations herein and 
the matter under CAZ49/08/2017 Natasen prepared 
and submitted a statement in terms of Section 204 of 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 77 of 236 
 
The Criminal Procedure Act to the investigating 
officer.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That seems to be inconsistent with your 
evidence about his role, does it not? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I do not think it is inconsistent.  He was – he 
was the person who approached me.  He assisted me in preparing it 
and that is the document that went through.  I am assuming submitted 
to the investigating officer is a process but I did not physically meet 
10 
with the investigating officer if that is what you are trying to imply. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I am not implying anything Mr Natasen I am 
just looking at his words.  He says: Natasen prepared let us stop there.  
So I understand your evidence quite repeatedly to be Mr Judiel 
prepared it, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is inconsistent, right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think well if you obviously going to summons 
Mr Judiel he will come and account for what he said.  I cannot … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed I am just… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it might not necessarily be inconsistent 
because if for example you get your attorney to prepare something for 
you and you sign somebody might say you prepared even though it is 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 78 of 236 
 
your attorney who prepared so there may be room for that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair indeed I am indebted to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you may see how you … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed if I can follow that up?  Mr Natasen I 
understood your evidence previously and today to place great emphasis 
on Mr Judiel’s role in putting together that statement, is that a fair 
reflection of your evidence? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  He - he greatly assisted in putting it 
10 
together. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I - you see I do not know what - what the 
content would be required for a 204. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So he assisted me with that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Indeed and then on your version he took it 
away and made it available to the authorities.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So all that I am interested in here is that 
20 
neither of those two things does he take responsibility for in this 
paragraph.  Do you see?  He says you prepared it and you submitted it. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But like the Chair has said it - it is semantic.  I 
mean it is quite often that the document is prepared by somebody else 
physically but in the way it is worded here … 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 79 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have - I did not prepare it and - and Mr Judiel 
can easily - I am sure you can summons him … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  To come and account on exactly how it went 
down. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you also did not submit it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I did not physically submit it myself to the 
investigating officer.  He did that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There - there may be - what I said earlier on might 
10 
apply much more easier with regard to preparation but with regard to 
submission if he submitted it on your behalf one would expect him to 
make it clear that he was the one who submitted it even if it was your - 
on your behalf rather than say you submitted it.  Do you want to say 
anything on that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Point taken Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I mean obviously he - he can come and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Actually account for what … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Testify, ja. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Why he said what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but you certainly did not submit it yourself … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I definitely did not submit it myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say he submitted it. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 80 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have never met the investigating officer 
myself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And that is consistent what the investigating 
officer is saying. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Then if we can go to your 
statement of 12 July.  It is again in the same bundle and you will pick it 
up at page 2-3-8.6-7.  Mr Natasen before we look at this part of 12 July 
statement that you provided do you recall that in the 204 Statement you 
indicated that you were going to take steps to report the conduct under 
10 
Section 34 of what is called PRECCA.  Do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You did say that.  So when you deposed to it in 
October 2017 
you 
indicated 
you 
would 
take 
steps 
to 
report 
Mr Van Wyk’s conduct under that Act.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now at paragraph 30 - 3-0 - on 
page 2-3-8.6-7 you say there - now this is the affidavit or the statement 
you provided on 12 July 2019.  Can you read for us what you said 
there? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Which paragraph again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Paragraph 30 - 3-0. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  30. 
“Prior to learning of the aforementioned criminal 
investigation from Judiel I was unaware of any 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 81 of 236 
 
issues 
relating 
to 
the 
transactions 
between 
Koreneka 
and 
Neo 
Solutions 
and 
Batsamai.  
Accordingly 
upon 
learning 
of 
the 
criminal 
investigations in the alleged implication of Neo 
Solutions 
therein 
I 
candidly 
and 
voluntarily 
disclosed the extent of my knowledge and the 
involvement of Neo Solutions in the alleged criminal 
activity to the Directorate for Priority Criminal 
Investigations the DPCI and further submitted a 
statement under oath in terms of Section 204 of the 
10 
Criminal Procedure Act 56 of 1955.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you have any interactions yourself with 
the Directorate for Priority Criminal Investigations? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No.  My understanding from again engaging 
with Mr Judiel was that there is already case number in play.  So there 
was - there was no further requirement to disclose any further because 
the - the existing case number would apply over this matter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why then include in your Section 202 
Statement that you would take steps to report it under Section 34? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is - Judiel inserted that clause anyway but 
20 
when I - I mean obviously from my previous testimony and my 
subsequent follow up with Judiel he is understanding was there is 
already a case number on this exact matter and he would not then be 
opening up another case file.  (Intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you specifically engage with him about 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 82 of 236 
 
the need to … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  After I testified the last time because then - 
because I had not before then understood that I needed to do any 
further obligation.  There was already - he had already said that was all 
that needed to have been done.  That the matter was already with the 
Commercial Crimes Unit and therefore there was nothing else to be 
done past that point. 
So although yes my 204 makes reference to those further 
steps.  My understanding from Judiel was that those steps were already 
in play. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just would like to go a bit further Mr Natasen 
because I am not sure I understand it.  I understand your evidence to 
be Mr Judiel prepared the draft.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he included in the draft that you would take 
steps to report it under Section 34 of PRECCA.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If he knew there was already a case number 
and no need to report it why would he have included that in your 
statement? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not sure why he - why that is there.  All I 
am saying is then Judiel himself can come and account for why that is 
there.  All I have done is that when I asked him about it is there 
anything else I need to do he said he has engaged with the - with the 
prosecutor and there was no further steps to - to be taken by myself 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 83 of 236 
 
from it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When did you ask him that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is straight after we prepared the affidavit.  
I asked him what else and then again when - when I took the recording 
I called him again.  I said can I submit you the recording that I have got 
which is further evidence to show that I am - I am - I was not aware 
that this was State money and then he said no they have got all that 
they need and there is nothing further for myself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen I would then like to go 
to the evidence of Mr Patel who was your erstwhile accountant if we 
10 
may.  Chair Mr Patel has provided two affidavits.  He provided one just 
the day before Mr Natasen testified the last time.  Then there was a 
follow up from the Commission in relation to that affidavit and then he 
provided a second one and both of those have been provided to 
Mr Natasen.  Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is there - are they in the same bundle? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They are in the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Generally Chair the way it is arranged is when 
we are in affidavits we are in Bundle A and when we go to other 
20 
documents I will take you to B but for now we are in A which is the 
various affidavits and you will find the first affidavit at page 2-3-8.1.  
Mr Natasen just to confirm for the record you have previously been 
provided with both of these affidavits.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 84 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you have yourself provided an affidavit in 
response.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That according to my records were sent through 
on Tuesday of this week - the 27 t h.  We can go to but … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not sure when Deloitte sent it to you but 
(intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I assume that will be common cause.  If we can 
then go to your affidavit which was the response to this affidavit.  You 
will find it at page 2-3-8.2-6-4. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-3-8.2 …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  6 - three is where it begins Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three, oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2-6-3 is where it begins.  Sorry 2-3-8.2 - sorry 
2-3-8.2-6-3 Chair.  I confuse my numbers from time to time.  It is right 
towards the end - 2-3-8.2-6-3.  Mr Natasen just to orientate ourselves.  
Apologies.  This is the prior affidavit that you sent through to the 
Commission on 8 August.  It is actually not the one responding to 
Mr Patel.  The one responding to Mr Patel we will come to just now. 
It is the next affidavit in the bundle.  That is the one dated 
20 
27 August but I would like to just look at this one for a moment if we 
may.  In this affidavit if you turn over the page to 2-3-8.2-6-4 you say 
there at paragraph 6.  Well let us start at five because you providing 
some background in this affidavit.  You say: 
“On 
12 July 2019 
I 
was 
questioned 
at 
the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 85 of 236 
 
Commission in respect of inter alia certain financial 
statements and/or documents of Neo Solutions.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then at six you say: 
“Prior to such inquiry I had alerted the Commission 
to the fact that the financial statements of Neo 
Solutions in respect of the financial year ending 
February 2017 were incomplete and/or incorrect.” 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you understand that as I understand that to 
mean prior to 12 July when that inquiry took place you alerted the 
Commission to the fact that the financial statements were incomplete or 
incorrect? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am assuming so, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you point me to where that was brought to 
the Commission’s attention before you testified on 12 July? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I cannot offhand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why would have said that prior to the inquiry 
20 
you did so? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not sure.  It is here that - I obviously - I 
will have to go back into our records. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because what - what is interesting is that you 
did depose to an affidavit the very day before on the 11 t h but you did 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 86 of 236 
 
not in that affidavit draw the Commission’s attention. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that would be incorrect then what is stated 
at paragraph 6? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  In the absence of seeing anything else, 
yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and if we go to that affidavit it is at 
2-3-8.1-8-5.3. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite something.  2-3-8.1-8-5.3. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Point 1-8-5.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-3-8 … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Point 1-8-5 is where we should possibly start 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because that is the filing sheet of 11 July 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go over the page it is an 
20 
affidavit by yourself Mr Natasen.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it does not run particularly long.  It is an 
affidavit that you provided to the Commission on 11 July.  That was the 
day before you testified.  Do you see that at the end of the affidavit at 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 87 of 236 
 
2-3-8.1-8-5.5? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And our records reflect that it came through to 
the Commission just after 5 o’ clock on that day.  Do you accept that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not contesting it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen this is where you deal 
with the production of documents.  You will pick it up at 2-3-8.1-8-5.3.  
They relate to the various documents that you had been required to 
provide under a summons.  Now in this affidavit I - I have read it quite 
carefully - you say nothing in it about the discrepancies in the financial 
10 
statements.  Do you accept that; and please feel free to remind yourself 
about its contents. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  There is nothing raised here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now despite it not appearing in 
this affidavit as I understand your evidence you had been alerted to the 
discrepancies in the 2017 financials … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Already by the 11 t h.  Is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  There was a meeting with the auditors on 
the - on the 10 t h. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So just in time you met on the 10 t h 
which was the Wednesday of the week as I have it.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the auditors of which Mr Patel is the 
relevant responsible person had indicated to you in that meeting that 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 88 of 236 
 
there were discrepancies in the 2017 financials.  Do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you recall what the nature of the 
discrepancies were? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At that point we did not know the nature.  It is 
just that the - there were several balance sheet items that did not 
reconcile on the 2017 financials.  So the way it transpired was that 
when the summons was received by the auditors they contacted me.  
They asked for a copy of the financials or the management accounts 
that were sent through to the Commission which our accounts 
10 
department then sent through. 
Then they called a meeting to understand what had happened 
and in the meeting it was then established that Mr Patel then informed 
me that there was a - the 2017 financials were different.  There were 
discrepancies between the two versions.  The version he had signed or 
authorised versus the version that we had on hand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Thank you for that because that is my 
understanding of the nub of the discrepancies.  Right.  It was that and 
this is apparent from Mr Patel’s affidavit.  We can go there if necessary 
but could you just help me whether you understand his evidence in the 
20 
same way as I do. 
As I understand Mr Patel’s evidence he says he met with you 
on 10 July and in that meeting he discovered that the version of the 
2017 financials that had been provided to the Commission with a 
covering page indicating he had signed off on them were different to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 89 of 236 
 
the ones he had actually signed off on. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that your understanding of his evidence? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well he had already received the copy that we 
had sent through to the Commission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  That is the only way he can do the 
comparison.  Right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja, ja.  So he did not - it was not discovered in 
the meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He arrived at the meeting already having that 
knowledge. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So he asked you to send him the ones 
that were submitted to the Commission which include a page from his 
firm indicating that they had compiled them … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And which he signed off on and then he goes 
back to records and he discovers that the financial statements that he 
actually signed off on from 2017 differ from the ones that were 
submitted to the Commission.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the nature of the discrepancy as I 
understand it.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Prior to my testimony, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So this is - indeed and your testimony 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 90 of 236 
 
just to be clear last time Mr Natasen it only dealt with the 2016 
financials. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and we are only talking about a 
discrepancy that Mr Patel identified with the 2017 financials.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So that is the discrepancy and he - I 
understand he is concerned about it as you were.  Correct/ 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because as I understand his affidavit it had 
10 
been presented to the Commission that a set of financials that he 
signed off on were actually not the ones that he had signed off on and 
prepared.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then your evidence last time 
was that the next morning so that is 11 July Mr Patel and his firm 
resigned as the auditors of Neo Solutions.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well we received that notification via your 
office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That … 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He did not send us correspondence resigning 
directly with us.  It was actually notified via the attorneys. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry just explain that to me. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was the correspondence via the attorneys 
that notified us of resignation.  It was not directly to me. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 91 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  From whom? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  From Patel’s attorneys to - to our attorneys. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, sorry.  So it did not involve the 
Commission? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well the affidavit was also submitted to you at 
the same time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry, but just to be clear.  It was 
communicated to you through the attorneys of Mr Patel and your 
attorneys that they were resigning as your auditors? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that happened on the morning of 11 July 
the Thursday.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you; and then I would like to go to 
Mr Patel’s affidavit again if we may and you find that at 2-3-8.1 and if 
you go through - that is the start of Mr Patel’s affidavit and then if you 
go to the end of his affidavit.  You will find it at page 2-3-8.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say point five? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the last page - page of Mr Patel’s 
affidavit and I would like to pick it up at paragraph 12 on that page.  At 
paragraph 12 he says: 
“On 
the 
morning 
of 
11 July 2019 
I 
received 
WhatsApp 
messages 
from 
Mr Natasen. 
 
A 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 92 of 236 
 
screenshot of which is attached marked G and the 
contents of which speak for themselves.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if we turn over the page - well it is a 
few pages we have to go to get the WhatsApp message.  You will find 
that at 2-3-8.6-0. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-3-8.6-0? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  6-0 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Before we look at the WhatsApp message.  
Mr Natasen did you read Mr Patel’s affidavit as being concerned about 
the fact that Neo Solutions had submitted financial statements to the 
Commission purporting to have been signed off by him when they were 
not signed off by him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  There were concerns because there are 
two sets of financials also signed off by me using my signature page as 
well.  So it is concerning to both of us. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and then he attaches the WhatsApp 
message and he says the contents of which speak for themselves.  I 
20 
would like to go through that.  My proposal is that we read the full 
WhatsApp message into the record.  My proposal is that you read what 
you said and I read what Mr Patel said. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can we go through it.  It is at 2-3-8.6-0. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 93 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay.  So I am the one in white on the left. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  “Hi, please advise what is status.  My 
attorneys want to prep correspondence.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then Mr Patel on the right hand side Chair 
responds: 
“Hi, our attorney is dealing with the matter.” 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Then I said: 
“Okay are you - you just buying time or issuing 
correspondence of the difference.  I just need to 
10 
know how to prep.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then Mr Patel responds to say: 
“We will revert back to you later.” 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Okay.  Then I said: 
“Rajiv we have come a long way.  We really need 
your help here.  We have to be able to reconcile 
this else it will hurt all of us.  Let us just work 
together on fixing this please.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then Mr Natasen you were 
invited by the Commission to respond to Mr Patel’s first affidavit and 
20 
then on receipt of his second affidavit - that affidavit and that is I 
understand it is what you took up in your affidavit provided on 
27 August. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if we can go to that one which is right 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 94 of 236 
 
towards the end of this file Chair and you will find it at page 
2-3-8.2-6-7. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is not in my bundle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2-3-8.2-6-7 is not there. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It goes from 2-6-6 to 2-7-4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh that is an oversight.  Possibly we can just 
hand one up to you from my learned friend. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does Mr Natasen not have that one? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It does not appear to have been placed in his 
10 
file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is his affidavit though. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if I can beg leave just to hand up a 
duplicate so that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We can work off it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen at page 2-3-8.2-6-7 you commence 
20 
the affidavit and then over the page at 2-6-8.  I understand you in 
paragraph 5 to say you want to place the WhatsApp communication in 
context. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  In context. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that right? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 95 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct, ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Before we do the context could we just pause a 
little on its actual wording and for that purpose Chair I suggest that 
maybe we just take out the WhatsApp message where it appeared 
previously and apologies for not asking you to do that at the time.  That 
you will find at 2-3-8.6-0 and then we can deal with the context once we 
have dealt with the words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have got it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So if we look at 2-3-8.6-0 which is 
the actual WhatsApp communication.  It is early in the morning as I see 
10 
it - 09:48 and you are asking him for a status update.  Is that a fair 
description? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  There were several attempts to call him 
before that though. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which he was not answering? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So then you endeavoured to WhatsApp 
communicate with him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you say you want a status update because 
20 
your attorneys are prepping correspondence.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And his response says his attorney is dealing 
with it.  Is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 96 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you say: 
“Okay. 
 
You 
just 
buying 
time 
or 
issuing 
correspondence of the difference.  Just need to 
know how to prep.” 
Why would he be buying time Mr Natasen? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So the context was that the initial summons to 
the auditors was apparently dispatched on the 28 t h - I think - June 
similar to request from us but it never arrived to them because he had 
moved premises apparently.  So they received it on short notice.  Just 
too also contextualise the meeting that happened with the auditors 
10 
happened with their attorneys present and the second part of the 
meeting happened with our attorneys present. 
So when it came about in the meeting that there were 
discrepancies on the 2017 financials then we - we then discussed we 
needed to identify what caused these differences and if there as bad 
news that we had to correct the financials.  Then we had to do that 
jointly and approach the Commission directly with corrected financials 
and the words “buying time” referred to them exercising the right to say 
they have time to prepare a response so that we could understand what 
caused these differences in the financials and we had asked them to do 
20 
that because we felt it would make both parties look very bad to come 
here with financials that are not aligned. 
So we were wanting to work together.  They undertook - so 
when that meeting concluded they undertook to give me the very 
resource that was working on compilation engagement to actually come 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 97 of 236 
 
to the office and assist us in identifying the differences and - and that 
is why I made so many calls to him that morning was to send a 
resource through. 
So that we could understand what caused these differences 
and come and account.  So if - if whichever - we at that point did not 
know which version was correct as well from our perspective.  So we 
said we needed to be able to come in and explain the differences and 
that will restore credibility for both parties and that was the context of 
these messages. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would there be any debate as to which the 
10 
correct version was because it was clear which version had been 
signed off by Mr Patel? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  We were clear about that.  However Mr Patel 
also said that he had relied heavily on the accountant preparing the 
information and by that point in time we were also then starting to 
become aware that the accountant on our side had also not prepared 
the information correctly.  So Mr Patel could have relied on incorrect 
data in terms of his compilation engagement as well and that was 
discussed in the - in the meeting. 
So we - at that point it was - yes it was ones that he had 
20 
signed off but we also at that point of that meeting had known then that 
a lot of the information that was used to generate the financials may 
not have been correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would that have been a concern to 
Mr Patel?  He does not accept any responsibility for the documents.  It 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 98 of 236 
 
is … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Fair enough. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Provided by Neo Solutions? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Fair enough but we wanted it right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So why would he be wanting to buy time? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The buying time was to then exercise this - his 
rights to say I have only received notice of the summons which was 
given to him two days or that very day of the 10 t h is when he received 
the correspondence from the Commission asking him for that 
information and therefore we felt that he could have sent a request 
10 
back to say he needs time to be able to respond.  That was the context 
of the buying time statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is - it is an either or.  You ask him is he 
buying time or is he issuing correspondence of the difference. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  With the difference. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Because that was also discussed in the 
meeting.  He - at that meeting when it closed his attorney said they 
would consider what their version was and they would come back to us 
as to whether they were going to request the extension or whether they 
20 
would submit a - an affidavit explaining the difference. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And - so at that stage you did not know whether 
he was going to submit an affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I did not know what path he was going to take. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was it not fairly important to make known to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 99 of 236 
 
the Commission that financial statements that had been prepared and 
presented to it were incorrect? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That was the intention.  We were wanting to 
come to you jointly to explain that there were differences that we were 
not aware of in the financials that were on file.  That was the intention.  
There was no intention to actually hide from that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So he would either buy time and not 
disclose that and take more time or he would disclose … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, not - not disclose but for - to work with us 
in terms of identifying what caused these discrepancies.  So we could 
10 
come back to the Commission with one uniform response. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That was the intention of that - of that 
comment. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you say just need to know how to 
prep. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would whether he was buying time or 
bringing it to the Commission’s attention that there was a difference 
between the financials he signed off on and those submitted to the 
20 
Commission influenced your prep for your evidence? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Because obviously we needed - if he was going 
to come up with the discrepancies we would obviously need to be able 
to respond on our side.  If it was that we would then jointly make a 
statement together that the financials are incorrect and we working 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 100 of 236 
 
together on reconciling it and then we will come back to the 
Commission with a later date on the exact discrepancies and what 
caused them.  That was what we were debating. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Either way though Mr Natasen I would suggest 
to you that it was incumbent upon Neo Solutions to make that clear to 
the Commission.  Was it not? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No fair - you understand we also received it 
and we were arriving the next day.  So our statement then obviously 
would have then had to cover that as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, but … 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  We were aware that was … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the statement you produced on 11 July did 
not reflect the discrepancy at all.  Did it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well we were not - we were still trying to 
obviously identify these discrepancies on our side and we were still 
waiting for his resource to come in and assist. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen that is why … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is why we got the notice of their 
termination. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  It is just why I spent a bit of time 
20 
getting clear earlier what the discrepancy was.  The discrepancy as I 
understand it when you met on the 10 t h it was made known to you was 
that Neo Solutions had submitted financial statements to this 
Commission purporting to have been signed off by Mr Patel which were 
not signed off by Mr Patel. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 101 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why was it not incumbent upon you to make 
that known to the Commission as soon as possible? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well we - we wanted to identify what caused 
the discrepancies first so we can come with the solution and the 
problem at the same time.  That was our intention. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was not enough just to say hold on 
Commission.  You are dealing with financials purporting to have been 
signed off by the company’s auditors that were not signed off by the 
company’s auditors. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  As I said we had immediately started a process 
then to try and rebuild these differences ourselves.  I was not aware 
that you were going to get to the financials during my testimony anyway 
but it was our intention obviously to bring a - a response to you as 
soon as we had an idea ourselves as to what caused it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen why do you say it was not clear 
that I would get to the financials in that testimony? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I mean I - I did not contemplate it at that point 
but our intention was to be able to identify what caused the differences 
and then bring you a complete response around it.  Not that we bring 
20 
you or there is a problem hold but we were going to bring it as one 
complete package. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then later on he says, back at page 
238.60, 
 
“Will revert back to you later”. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 102 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then you say, 
 
“Ranju we’ve come a long way really need your help here we 
 
have to be able to reconcile this”, 
 
What had to be reconciled? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Reconciled in terms of the differences and the 
discrepancies between the two sets of financials, you’ll see he didn’t 
actually supply you with a complete WhatsApp conversation which is at 
the back of my affidavit…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well you can refer to where it is. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   It’s at 238.273. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What page again? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   238.273. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Okay so Chair, at that point we had 
established as well at that meeting, we had established that the 2016 
financials on our system on Pastel had been overwritten by 2017 data.  
So at this point in time I was still trying to reconstruct that information 
within our records and we had nothing to work from on our side.  So my 
frantic, if you can call it frantic messages to Ranju or to Mr Patel was 
20 
to try and gain some assistance from him in terms of being able to 
reconstruct the data.  So where it ends on his, 
 
“Lets work together on fixing this”, 
 
And you’ll see straight after that I messaged him to say, 
 
“Have you guys got the 2016 trial balance, the TB refers to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 103 of 236 
 
 
trial balance and then I asked was it 2017 that was with this 
 
discrepancy right and then can we chat on the phone I need to 
 
understand where I stand with you guys”. 
 
So that was again, requesting the assistance for them to send 
the resource to come and help me identify the discrepancies that 
existed or that we had only found out the day before.  So there was no 
intention to hide anything it was to be able to make sure we maintain 
credibility that when we – the moment we identified the discrepancies 
was to be able to identify what caused them and then bring them 
through to the Commission as one complete response saying, we are 
10 
aware that we gave you this we now – we have detected this issue and 
here’s the corrected version or here’s reasons for the differences 
between the two sets, that was the intention of this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen, why did you say to him – I’m 
back at page 238.6 C,  
 
“We haven’t been able to reconcile this as it will hurt all of us”. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   It’s damaging to both companies’ reputations. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen as I understand Mr Patel’s 
version, he signed off on a set of financials and when those same 
financials were provided to the State Capture Commission different 
20 
financials were placed under his accompanying letter.  Why would that 
hurt Mr Patel at all? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I think by the very fact that any company or 
person that’s mentioned coming to the Commission is automatically 
facing a reputational risk. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 104 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Not if that person, if I may, is the person who 
brings to the attention of the Commission something that is incorrect. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Fair enough but there’s also – you must also 
understand that the understanding that Mr Patel has around his 
responsibilities for compilation and what he’s saying in his affidavit is 
very different to my understanding and when I say here, that we’ve 
come a long way, Mr Patel assisted me in a dispute resolution process 
with SARS where he was, him and his team were closely involved  in 
resolving the disputes we had with SARS at that point in time in our 
2010 to 2014 financials.  So when I say I’ve come a long way here, he’s 
10 
aware of shortcomings in my own accounts department. So his 
undertaking to me when it comes to compilation of my financials is far 
more – the obligation he gave me for himself is far greater than what 
he’s purporting it to be right now.  So he had given me undertakings 
that he’s the watchdog over my accounts department to ensure that the 
financials and the management accounts are correct when he prepares 
them far beyond just what he’s saying as his responsibility ended at 
purely compilation.  He was aware of the process that we went through 
the ADR and SARS and he assisted me greatly with that and he had 
given me undertakings that he would be a better watchdog than a 
20 
conventional accountant. That is the context of this item. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And off the back of his affidavit he traversed 
none of that did he? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Exactly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    All he said in his affidavit is, 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 105 of 236 
 
 
“I signed off on a version, I’ve seen a different version 
 
presented to the State Capture Commission, that’s concerning 
 
I don’t know how that happened, I’m bringing it to your 
 
attention State Capture Commission and I’m referring you to 
 
WhatsApp communication which speaks for itself, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct and that’s not the version that is there 
we will cover it quite extensively under my re-examination. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed, at this point I’m just interested in 
what Mr Patel said to the Commission. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Ja. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Correct, and then if we go into your affidavit 
again, if we may, which is a response to this, you’ll find it at 238.268 
that’s where you start engaging the context of the WhatsApp, do you 
see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then you’ve actually traversed quite a bit 
of that already in your testimony so I’d like to go over the page 238.269 
and pick it up at paragraph 10 there you’re talking about the tasks that 
you were going to undertake to try and sort this accounting mess, for 
want of a better description.  Can you just read into the record what 
20 
you say at the beginning of paragraph 10 there? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   On paragraph 10? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes indeed. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   “I undertook the above task due to the fact – 
 
despite the fact that I verily believed that Neo Solutions is not 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 106 of 236 
 
 
obliged to prepare audited financial statements as the sole 
 
director 
and 
shareholder 
of 
Neo 
Solutions, 
I 
felt 
 
that”…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No that’s fine if we can just stop at that 
sentence if we may, you say there Neo Solutions is not obliged to 
prepare audited financial statements, is that right? I understood from 
your testimony last time you understand that because the Companies 
Act does not require it, is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Was Neo Solution ever under any legal 
10 
obligation otherwise to provide audited financial statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well we aware of now from the overdraft 
facility that there would have been a requirement to provide one there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    What do you mean, we’re aware now that the 
overdraft facility required it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well I’m saying, at that point in time as a 
private company I wasn’t aware of the obligation under the overdraft 
facility so that’s probably why I’m making this statement here now. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    When did you become aware? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well I’ve signed the overdraft facility document 
20 
but obviously in there I hadn’t recalled that there was an obligation to 
produce financial statements to the bank. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So when did you become aware? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well when you now pointed it out to me now, I 
recalled that it’s the case. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 107 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So Chair it’s probably not necessary to go 
there because Mr Natasen confirms but that overdraft facility 
agreement we were looking at earlier from Nedbank requires quarterly 
management accounts to be provided and audited financial statements 
to be provided within a period at the end of the financial year of the 
company.  So Mr Natasen I understand your evidence to be until you 
received that document a day ago from the Commission you weren’t 
aware that Neo Solutions had to provide audited financial statements to 
your bank? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   All I’m saying is the requirement from the 
10 
interaction with the banks was fairly relaxed in that we had been 
providing them with the cash flows schedule and the banks – as long as 
the churn was being shown in the bank account they didn’t put pressure 
on us for anything else. 
COMMISSIONER:    Sorry so your answer was generally speaking, 
relating to the general position? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That generally you didn’t think there was an 
obligation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did Nedbank ever ask you for audited 
financial statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   They may have asked the accounting team 
because the business banker used to interact with the accounting staff. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 108 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Would that not have been brought to your 
attention? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   You must understand Chair that I’m very 
operational in the field, I live on the projects and the team – between 
the accounting team and the outsource to many financial services the 
back office was being administered and looked after by them.  I’m very 
operational on the projects themselves, so whether they raised it with 
me or not, I’m living out in the field and generally they would attend to 
the stuff internally at the office. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen why then do you say that as a 
10 
positive fact Neo Solutions had no obligation to provide audited 
financial statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m saying that as ordinarily as a private 
company not needing for anything else, that’s our normal course of 
business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So let me just clarify for our purposes you 
weren’t aware that the R5million overdraft facility agreement you’d 
concluded with Nedbank in 2015 required your company to provide 
audited financial statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I was aware at the time of signing but I was 
20 
also aware that it was in normal flow, so all I’m saying is, I didn’t recall 
it, I didn’t treat it as a priority, the fact that the ongoing financial 
information was being sent to the bank and they were seeing churn in 
the account, it then dropped off everybody’s radar screen. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did your company produce audited financial 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 109 of 236 
 
statements in compliance with it’s obligation which you’ve just testified 
you were aware of in 2015? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   The – you mean that’s the financials that Patel 
would have produced then or the management accounts that they 
produced? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No that’s different to audited financial 
statements is it not? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   For 2015 we have not submitted anything to 
SARS yet we’re still busy with the process of – obviously we had come 
through an ADR process with them and then we were taking the opening 
10 
balances from there into reconstructing the records after that.  So the 
last official response of financial statements was given – is the 2014 
financials that is the finalised dispute resolution with SARS and Patel 
was assisting us with all of those processes with SARS.  It took a long 
time to conclude the ADR process with SARS which was only 
concluded, I think, towards the end of 2017. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   I thought earlier you’d said 2014.  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   2014 financials but the ADR process on 
finalising 2014’s results was only concluded in 2017, maybe possibly 
2018. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen you’ll forgive me I am just 
struggling to follow your version on this aspect.  I understand your 
evidence to be you knew in 2015 when you signed your facilities 
agreement that audited financial statements were required, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 110 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Why did you say in an affidavit then that Neo 
Solutions is not obliged to prepare audited financial statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   In the normal course of a small company under 
the Companies Act we weren’t. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen that is not what is said here, do 
you accept that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Fair enough I will then concede, I hadn’t 
recalled that it was an obligation under the overdraft facility agreement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes and you recalled it when the documents 
were sent to you two days ago, is that right? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen you then, at 269 continue to say 
that there was a controversy, this is at paragraph 11, you say, 
 
“Further as a businessman I was very concerned about the risk 
 
of reputational harm which could be suffered by Neo Solutions 
 
and [indistinct] in such a situation especially in light of the 
 
controversy which Neo Solutions is involuntarily involved in by 
 
being associated with certain parties”, 
 
Just help me there, what is that controversy? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m saying by the very fact of being implicated 
20 
by – with van Wyk and the SA Express saga that is what this is 
referring to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And involuntarily, what does that mean there? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Because – well we were unaware that the 
funds were State money at the time, so we wouldn’t have participated 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 111 of 236 
 
in this had we known it was State money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you and then if we go over the page 
you are dealing there with your imploring of Mr Patel assist in 
reconciling and you say there at 13, 
 
“I implored Patel to attend to reconciling the financial 
 
documentation as well to provide the relevant trial balances as 
 
a matter of urgency so that my aforementioned concerns would 
 
not materialise and hurt all of us and also because I had no 
 
idea who else had seen such incorrect financial statements”, 
 
Can I just stop there, who else could have seen the incorrect 
10 
financial statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I have no idea who – whether it was sent out to 
anyone else, those incorrect financials where under the control of 
Rueben at our accounts department, so there was no instruction from 
me to distribute it with anyone else so this is – we’ve made a generic 
statement here that we’re not sure of it’s distribution. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So would people in your employ be 
distributing the financial statements of Neo Solutions without you 
knowing? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m saying the fact that they were two different 
20 
sets of financial statements right, and we’ll deal later with the fact that 
Mr Reuben – we’ve now established that at least R740 000 was 
misappropriated from the company directly to his own bank account.  
So would there be any reason for him to take two sets of – or create 
two sets of financials, yes maybe to distract from what he was doing 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 112 of 236 
 
but if he circulated those incorrect financials somewhere else, I’m not 
sure of it, and this is what this statement is intended to…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So it’s got nothing to do with Mr Patel? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   But because his signature is on that document 
it does have an implication to him, like with my signature. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Patel as I have it has no difficulty with the 
ones he signed off on, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes I understand what you’re saying but the 
10 
fact is that there are two – there’s an implication by already being at 
the Commission so the context of this wording is exactly against that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Just explain that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   The fact than now, Mannie’s name is brought 
up at the Commission as is our name then has a reputational impact so 
we need to work together on resolving it, that was the context. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you and then you go at paragraph 17 
on that page to say – well let me go a little bit higher, you say at 16, 
 
“To affirm the aforementioned context the full WhatsApp 
 
conversation between myself and Patel is attached”, 
20 
 
And we’ve looked at that previously and then at 17, could you 
read to us what you say at 17? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I said, 
 
“The Commission’s legal team is incorrect and improperly or 
 
prematurely claiming that my messages were intended to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 113 of 236 
 
 
influence Mr Patel to give false evidence to the Commission.  
 
In fact, there’s no attempt by me of any such nature and for 
 
the Commission’s legal team to cast such aspersions is 
 
spurious”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen why do you say the legal team of 
the Commission is casting aspersions on you?  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   The insinuation that you – obviously by reading 
just this without the full context would appear – or you would try to 
create a case that I’m trying to influence Patel not to cooperate which 
is not the case at all.  All I said was we need to work together to get to 
10 
the bottom of this and then come with a cohesive response so that we 
can clarify what caused these discrepancies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen do you recall how you were asked 
or invited by the Commission to address Mr Patel’s affidavit in 
correspondence before you presented the affidavit yourself? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Do you recall that the correspondence said 
that there were certain allegations in Mr Patel’s affidavit. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And those were identified akin to a sort of 
20 
Rule 33 process, you’re familiar with that I understand because you’ve 
received a Rule 33 notice in relation to Ms Tslatsana’s evidence 
correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So it’s allegations lying in the affidavit of the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 114 of 236 
 
person that you’re alerting about the fact of the affidavit, do you accept 
that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I don’t understand the context of it 
but…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Let me explain, we can maybe go to the 
correspondence if that would help it’s at 442.34 and that’s in bundle 
DD10B Chair.  Chair the letter begins at 442.32, do you have it Mr 
Natasen? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And it’s a letter addressed to yourselves on 
10 
the 15 t h of July 2019, do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    That was the Monday after you testified on 
the Friday, wasn’t it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So this letter – have you read this letter 
before? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It’s following up on aspects of the evidence as 
I have it and then if you go over to 442.34 you’ll see at paragraph 8 on 
20 
that page the Commission writes, 
 
“Finally on 11 July 2019 you were provided with a copy of Mr 
 
Patel’s affidavit that had been provide to the Commission on 
 
even date, and it says, the affidavit makes the following 
 
allegations against Mr Natasen”, 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 115 of 236 
 
 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then they’re set out in paragraph 8.1 and 
then over the page at paragraph 8.2, do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen I just want to pause there 
because in your testimony just now the Commission is trying to make 
out a case, right, do you accept that all that’s being said here is that 
there’s certain allegations against you in the affidavit of Mr Patel? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And do you accept that at the time your 
further context was not available to the Commission? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And do you accept that you were invited to 
respond to it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And when took issue with this you were again 
invited to respond to it and provide the context is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So do you understand the circumstances in 
20 
which paragraph 8 of this affidavit and particularly over the page at 
paragraph 8.2 it was recorded that there is an allegation in Mr Patel’s 
affidavit that you, Mr Natasen had endeavoured to influence Mr Patel to 
give false evidence to the Commission? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 116 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t know whether you completed the point which I 
thought you were seeking to make Miss Hofmeyr, I understand Miss 
Hofmeyr’s last few questions in relation to this – to be meant to 
suggest to you that the Commission’s legal team might not have sought 
to make any allegations…[intervenes]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ja I understand the context it’s contained 
in…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I accept that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So when you – thank you Chair just follow 
that up because his affidavit contends to demand an immediate 
unconditional and irrevocable withdrawal of the allegation. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Chair I think we’re going to deal with this as 
well under my re-examinations so…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but deal with it now because the re-examination 
that will happen is intended to clarify what might not have been dealt 
with adequately.  So it’s better if you deal with it now and if there is 
something that your counsel wishes to clarify later on, he will do so. 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Okay, can you repeat the question? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes, so given your answer to the Chair I take 
it that you don’t, any longer demand that the Commission’s legal team 
immediately, unconditionally and irrevocably withdraw the allegations 
made? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 117 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m saying there’s a perception that we 
attempted to influence that is incorrect there is a context that we 
provided and if that perception still exists that we attempted to 
influence then we would obviously seek correction on that and we will 
deal with that there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen you accept it’s not the legal team 
of the Commission’s allegation, is it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes okay I’ll concede that for now for moving 
on. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, Mr Natasen there was a matter, 
10 
it’s a brief matter before we break and then Chair there’s only one 
matter after lunch break that I will deal with but just before that, we 
dealt with a donation last time that appeared in your 2016 
financials…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we back to the other bundle? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No we won’t even need to go to the bundle 
Chair because it relates simply to the testimony of Mr Natasen last 
time.  We were looking at a donation entry in your 2016 financials, do 
you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And I asked whether you knew what – to 
whom that donation had been made, do you recall? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then your testimony was, you didn’t recall 
but then you and I agreed if we could get the accounting records that 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 118 of 236 
 
may be disclosed, do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen we’ve been indebted to you since 
that evidence to have provided us with those accounting records which 
you’ve managed to assemble. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Ja the partial portion it’s an ongoing process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It’s an ongoing process, in fairness it sounds 
as though the accounting system in your business is in complete 
shambles, is that fair? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   We’ve technically been sabotaged, the 
10 
information has been totally removed from premises, obviously in an 
attempt to cover up the fraud.  The nature of the fraud obviously was 
he had amended beneficiary data so even where we had payments that 
appeared to be valid to suppliers, there actually had been altered bank 
accounts to be other bank accounts and then the supporting documents 
are non-existent, so the reconstruction process is a long hard haul for 
us right now.  So whatever we’ve been able to put together has 
forwarded across. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you I found no documents there dealing 
with the donation, did you come across anything? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   When we attempted to establish what caused 
these donations from what we can see it’s far less than that but we are 
busy reconstructing the records so I can’t yet answer – I know for a 
fact we’ve no way made anywhere close to those kinds of amounts as 
donations but until I reconstruct the record I cannot come back and say 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 119 of 236 
 
what that exact number was, it’s definitely not R2million though. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right so when you signed as the director of 
Neo Solutions, those February 2016 financials, did you – were you not 
aware that there was an overly exaggerated donation amount in it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   No I didn’t – as I said I relied on the fact that 
Mr Patel was checking these financials and he was the watchdog over 
the process.  So if it was put in there I didn’t even look at that number, 
I signed off. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You didn’t look at that number or any other 
part of the financial statements when you signed off confirming their 
10 
accuracy? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I would have cast my eye around the totals of 
the income, the nett income then obviously looked at the balance sheet 
that it looked reasonable and that was it but without going into 
specifics of numbers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Do you think that’s so reasonable approach 
for a chartered accountant to take when signing off on the financials of 
his business? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m not operating as a chartered accountant in 
my business. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Natasen I know that’s an aspect that you 
want to take up in relation to Mr Louventell’s affidavit and we’ll do that 
after the break, do you accept that in your testimony on the last 
occasion you accepted that you were a chartered accountant in 
business? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 120 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes I did concede it then. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You now take a different view, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m saying obviously we will be guided by Mr 
Louventell’s affidavit when we go through that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No I’m just asking whether you, now, say that 
you’re not a chartered accountant in business. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I’m saying the provisions to how a chartered 
accountant in business is measured in terms of his responsibilities to 
the company is related to what services he performs within that 
company.  I’m not operating as a chartered accountant in my company, 
10 
I’m technically a project manager. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So when you conceded that last time it was in 
error? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   It wasn’t in error it was being put on the spot 
at that point in time saying, yes I am a chartered accountant, I am one 
in business I wasn’t aware of the specific obligations and provisions 
relating to that.  I’m not operating in the accounts department of my 
own business, I’ve outsourced that activity to an internal accounting 
department as well as an external compilation engagement where they 
undertook to provide certain services to me.  So I’m allowed to rely on 
20 
those services in order to assume certain things, which I did at that 
point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So basically what you are saying is, I am an 
accountant I do have the knowledge that can be reasonable expected of 
an accountant but in the business I am not operating as an accountant, 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 121 of 236 
 
I’ve hired somebody else as an accountant to look after the business. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes Chair, internally and externally. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair and Mr Natasen when did 
you come to the realisation that you’re not a chartered accountant in 
business? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   It was on the advice of the – straight after the 
last testimony I appointed an independent chartered accountant to 
come in and obviously help me with the books because it was also 
evident that the 2016 financials were incorrect from the interrogation at 
10 
that point in time and we subsequently established that the 2015 
records were also incorrect. So there’s a process of reconstruction 
that’s been happening and then in the mandate given to the 
independent accountant that we’ve appointed was also to guide me on 
the rights and obligations and a chartered accountant in business and 
whether my understanding of my role is within the context of what 
Advocate Hofmeyr purported at that point in time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, Chair my proposal is, with your 
leave to take the break now and then we will move to Mr Louventell’s 
affidavit after the break. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s fine, we’ll take the lunch adjournment and 
we’ll resume at two o’clock. We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS

Page 122 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I indicated before the 
break that we would dealing with an affidavit of Mr Lowenthal   You will 
find that in Exhibit DD10a right at the end and it commences at page 
238.274.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and Mr Natasen do you have it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am there yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen this was an affidavit that was 
forwarded to the commission yesterday evening, is that correct? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And please explain to us who Mr Lowenthal is? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He is an independent expert that I appointed 
straight after the testimony that I gave in July to come in and assist us 
with firstly with the books, the reconstruction of the books as well as 
advising me in terms of my obligations as a chartered accountant in 
business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did his brief include preparing this affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So has he been remunerated for preparing this 
20 
affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you just confirm he indicates at 
paragraph 1 that he is an adult male chartered accountant.  He does 
not indicate any legal training, are you aware of him being a lawyer? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 123 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I am not aware that he is a lawyer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And can I just clarify he talks in 
this affidavit about a number of facts related to what has gone on in 
Neo Solutions can we assume that he learnt of those facts through 
you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes through me and obviously engaging with 
the team now assisting with the reconstruction of the books. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we go over the page to page 
238.275.  You will see at the top of that page paragraph 5 Mr Lowenthal 
says: 
10 
“Mr Natasen informed me that it had recently come to 
his attention that the signed unaudited annual 
financial statements of Neo Solutions that had been 
handed by staff member Jerome Jones to the 
commission were on closer inspection materially 
incorrect or incomplete and that he advised the 
commission that he would arrange to reconcile the 
accounting records and recompile the unaudited 
annual financial statements of Neo Solutions for the 
financial periods ending but not limited to the 
20 
periods ending 2016 and 2017” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you confirm that that is what you informed 
him? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 124 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is what I told him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When you say there then I am going to deal 
with what you said to him that the annual financial statements had been 
handed by staff member Jerome Jones to the commission. Why – why 
did you indicate to him who presented them to the commission? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think when we gave him the brief I explained 
that when I was requested to provide the accounting statements that I 
informed Jerome and Jerome is the one who then sent the email 
across. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sent the email across to whom? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  If it was requested by the obviously to the 
lawyers but it is not that relevant here.  He just brought it up because 
that was the brief that I gave him at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I understand… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think it is completeness. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just – I want to… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But there is no – there is no intention as to why 
Jerome specifically. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because you would take responsibility no doubt 
for the financial statements of your company that were provided to the 
20 
commission. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes but that is a different context.  What I am – 
what he is saying here is not whether I am taking responsibility or not it 
was in the brief?  He has captured his brief into his statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I understand so I am just clarifying with 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 125 of 236 
 
you. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja I am not – I am not… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is no attempt here to distance yourself 
from the responsibility. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not distancing myself from my role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay one at a time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair.  Just to be clear the 2017 
financial statements that were provided to the commission were 
provided pursuant to a summons, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it was a summons to you, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you are responsible for the financial 
statements that were then forwarded to the commission by your 
attorneys? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The ones that were submitted by Jerome to the 
attor – ja I am not – at this point in time are you trying to establish 
whether I am trying to abdicate any responsibility as the person as the 
director of the company?  The answer is no I am not trying to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen further down on page 7 
20 
Mr Lowenthal defines monies.  I just want us to understand what he 
means by that because he tracks it through his affidavit and the 
definition of monies comes at paragraph 7.3, do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he says part of his brief as I read this was 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 126 of 236 
 
to investigate how the R9.9 million and then he defines that as the 
monies had flowed into and out of Neo Solutions, is that accurate? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when we talk about monies I just want to get 
clarity that you and I understand this affidavit in the same way it means 
the R9.9 million that this commission is interested in, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  In this context yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to progress 
through the affidavit really to the conclusion of the work that Mr 
Lowenthal did and you will find that at page 238.278.  And this sort of 
10 
conclusory paragraph there is paragraph 12. But maybe you can assist 
us before we get there in just describing what it was that Mr Lowenthal 
did and what it is that he uncovered? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So his objective around accounting for the 
monies on the R9.9 million specifically was to establish that what was 
received was traced through the bank statements.  As part of the 
reconstruction of records process his brief with the accounting 
personnel now was to ensure that it was correctly posted as it should 
have been to the suspense account called Koreneka so in the 
reconstructed books that have been now prepared or are in the process 
20 
of being prepared there is now a suspense account that correctly 
reflects how it ought to have been at that point in time.  But the – in 
accounting for the monies he traced the monies coming in and he 
traced the monies going out obviously save for the R300 000 issue. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did he specifically raise the concern about the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 127 of 236 
 
R300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  What do you mean by concern? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You said he – he has accounted for everything 
except the R300 000. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He is unable to verify past the point of my 
management – my representation that he was paid the cash obviously 
so that is the only point that he was – obviously the journal entry 
around the R300 000 is the journal entry in the suspense account 
moving from Koreneka the amount which would have been R2.9 on the 
4 January comes down by R300 000 so at year end it was R2.6 million 
10 
and that R300 000 is in my shareholder loan account or director’s loan 
account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did he raise any concerns around the 
R300 000? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Not concern.  All he said was he cannot verify 
my statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Then if we pick it up at 12 this is as I 
understand it is his concluding paragraph in relation to the work that 
was done.  And he says there: 
“Accordingly I confirm that I am satisfied that the 
20 
relevant accounting records of Neo Solution as 
reconstructed 
now 
more 
accurately 
reflect 
the 
monies flow through Neo Solutions for the affected 
period ended February 2016 and April 2017.” 
Do you see that? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 128 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I read that it tends to suggest that they have 
now been reconstructed, is that right? 
MR 
VIVIEN 
NATASEN: 
 
Those 
specific 
accounts 
have 
been 
reconstructed.  There are still other suspense accounts that have been 
created which we busy resolving.  So until we – it sits in suspense until 
we identify the exact transaction then it moves either to the correct 
income statement item or balance sheet item.  But he had to focus 
specifically on these due to urgency of coming back to the commission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What does he mean when he says now more 
10 
accurately reflect, do you know? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  You will have to ask him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  You were not… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He has been hired as an expert so he will have 
to come and explain that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you involved with him in the compilation 
of this affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I saw this affidavit when it was already 
submitted to the lawyers. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the – maybe the question should be what is 
your own understanding of what he means there because whatever he 
was doing he was doing for your company and you needed to be 
satisfied that he has done it properly and obviously you need to 
understand what he has put together. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 129 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Chair I mean I am – at the risk of speculating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did you not understand it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It – I mean in an accountants speak I think that 
is how they would say it is that more accurately means it is accurate 
but there might be something they might not know that is how they 
normally semi-disclaim something but I cannot speculate on his behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  More accurately can I just interrogate with you 
suggest that they were previously accurate and now they are more 
accurate, do you agree with that? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I do not know.  I – to me they were definitely 
not accurate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And I think he starts off by saying they were not 
accurate.  Because they were not posted to a suspense account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So when he says more accurately it if definitely 
coming from the [indistinct] that is was not accurate in the first place.  
Yes the bank statements are accurate because they reflect that the 
money has flowed but anything past that on the journalising was not 
20 
accurate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  So if you were giving your concluding 
remarks here can I take it that you would say the previous manner in 
which they were captured was not accurate? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have already testified to say that. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 130 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And now they are now accurately reflected? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  In the current versions yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And so the commission has not yet 
received these reconstructed financials has it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No as I said there are still several suspense 
account items.  We are having to go back to suppliers from 3 – 4 years 
ago to obtain invoices so that we can correctly post these transactions.  
So there is quite a long process underway to get that right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And can you just help me is it usually – is he 
engaged on a compilation basis? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, no, no.  We will have a separate accounting 
team that will be appointed for the compilation.  He is appointed on a 
factual findings basis with the specific mandate to address these 
issues. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So was he specifically asked to satisfy himself 
as to the accuracy of the treatment that is now been given to the 
monies? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes as part of this scope yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to go to how he 
has treated it in the reconstructed financials and you will find that 
20 
starting to be described at paragraph 13 on that page 278.  Just remind 
us previously how was it accounted for? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was posted to my loan account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you and he have agreed that was 
incorrect? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 131 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes he from the start had said this [indistinct] 
should have been in the suspense account. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well he says here the way that he has treated 
it if you go over the page to 238.279 at paragraph 14 it is really his 
concluding paragraph again as I have it.  He says 
“Accordingly I instructed the accounting staff of Neo 
Solutions to reflect monies that is the ones we are 
interested in as funds held in an interest free loan 
account from Van Wyk or his nominee Koreneka and 
to be recorded as a liability and a loan ledger 
10 
account.” 
Do you see that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So do you and he agree that that is the correct 
treatment? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen if Neo Solutions had got a loan 
from a bank and would be very fortunate if it was able to achieve the 
loan that I am going to describe an interest free loan from a bank that 
was payable on demand.  Would it receive the same accounting 
20 
treatment? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Repeat the question/ 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if Neo Solutions went to a very kind bank 
and received an interest free loan repayable on demand would it also 
be recorded as a liability in a loan ledger account in its financials? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 132 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Definitely not I do not know if a bank will give 
you an interest free loa. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  In the first place so it is very hypothetical what 
you are saying. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No indeed let us work with the hypothetical.  If 
Neo Solutions got an interest free loan from a bank repayable on 
demand would it be reflected in the accounting records as a liability in 
the loan ledger account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It – well there is no such situation.  A bank any 
10 
formal institution whose revenue would be based on lending money 
would always charge interest.  If say let us another institution.  If I 
went and borrowed the money from any other person. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Than the bank let us say that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Super. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Then that would work that yes I would then 
reflect it as a liability in the same way. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us think another third party then I can see 
your difficulty with it being a bank. 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So another third party loans money to Neo 
Solutions interest free repayable on demand you would reflect it as a 
liability in the loan ledger account, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 133 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  We have already traversed in your 
evidence that the monies that were received from Koreneka were not 
ring fenced, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And they were used to fund the cash flow of the 
business in the period between November and February, correct/And 
they were used to fund the cash flow of the business in the period 
between November and February, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I did not say that I said they were in our 
operation bank accounts. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes sorry you did have an engagement with the 
Chair about that.  As I have your evidence you agreed that it was used 
in the operations. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of Neo Solutions. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But not used to fund my cash flow as if there 
was an intent for it to be used to fund my cash flow.  That was not a 
admission I made.  The admission was it was sitting in our operational 
accounts of the business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And used. 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At that point. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the operations of the business between 
November 2015 and the end of February 2016, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that suggests to me that it is quite 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 134 of 236 
 
accurately a loan then to Neo Solutions is it not 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No not at all. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why is it being reflected as a liability in the 
loan ledger account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is reflected as a liability because where else 
would you post that suspense account?  It is a suspense account that is 
in credit therefore – and like I said from the start no matter what 
happened I would owe Brian that money back if he ever came to 
demand it.  So therefore it is in the right place but it is – to use the 
word loan as if he lent us the money is not correct to make that 
10 
statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was monies that was placed in the accounting 
treatment of it was to create a suspense account called Koreneka and 
in the final version, the accurate version of the trial balance and the 
financials that were being produced it will sit as a liability. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But to call it a loan in the context that he lent 
us the money as a loan is not correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How does it differ from the hypothetical that we 
20 
engaged in a moment ago?  Can I just explain what I mean by that?  
We postulated another third party company that lent Neo Solutions an 
amount of money interest free repayable on demand that was used in 
the operations of the business would that be a loan? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  If you engaged on it being a loan in the first 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 135 of 236 
 
place and the money was lent in the first place then I agree with you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But this money was not in our books in that 
way.  This was in a suspense account and the correct placement of this 
in the suspense account – of the suspense account in our financials 
will be sitting as a liability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your point this that you would accept it as a 
loan if when it came it came on the basis that it was a loan? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it did not come on that basis then you would not 
10 
take it as a loan? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The exact wording Chair on our trial balance 
right now is it is called suspense account Koreneka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I am trying to make sure that I understand 
you correctly.  The fact that you do not take it as a loan in 
circumstances where it did not come to you as a loan in the first place 
does not – does not mean that it is not a liability? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your part towards the person who brought it. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja Chair I think our learned friend is implying 
20 
that a loan and a liability are the same thing.  Right a liability is an 
obligation to repay somebody.  A loan is where you have borrowed 
money.  And we have not borrowed the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So had I understood you correctly? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct yes. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 136 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen when you take money from another 
person to – when you – let me clear.  When a company like Neo 
Solutions takes money from another entity to use in  its business which 
is repayable on demand and which attracts no interest is that not a 
loan? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  We did not take the money to use in our 
business. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As a matter of fact you did use it though? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was not… 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair sorry.  Could I please maybe add some 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Some clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja come forward. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you.  I think my learned colleague from 
the commission’s legal team is confusing the accounting principles 
here.  As Mr Natasen and yourself have said okay really what it boils 
down to is the intention and the nature of the monies that were 
provided to Neo Solutions.  If one looks at Mr Van Wyk’s intention in 
20 
making the payment albeit channelled through Koreneka the intention 
was the monies be invested for the purposes of a farming venture.  It 
was not a loan in the strict sense that my learned colleague is referring 
to that would attract interest in the ordinary course.  Okay.  Earlier in 
the testimony this morning it became clear to everyone that my learned 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 137 of 236 
 
colleague was confusing the aspect of loan account and banking 
account.  She asked the question, what account with the bank is that 
particular loan account?  A loan account is a liability created in the 
company’s books of account indicating its indebtedness to a third party. 
That third party could be a director, a shareholder or a bank.  So the 
nature of the monies here is all … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no I … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Important then I think Mr Hofmeyr is confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think so far I certainly understand what Mr Natasen 
is saying. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr she might still have some question but I 
do understand what Mr Natasen says.  The distinction that he is putting 
forward but I will hear – we will hear if Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Still has some questions. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Natasen did you discuss at all 
with Mr Van Wyk that you would use the funds that he was giving you in 
the operations of the business? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have already testified on the basis that the 
funds were never intended to be with us for any long period of time.  It 
was going to go straight into the farming venture.  The fact that it never 
materialised on time then gave rise to a situation it was kept in the 
operations. And I have already said several times that should he have 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 138 of 236 
 
approached us to say return the money or the farming venture would 
have turned on his funds would have then been deployed.  So the 
portions that he utilised back for himself would have had to come back 
into the farming operation as well as any monies we would have been 
sitting with at that point in time.  So I think again through you Chair 
there was never an intention or a discussion that we would utilise these 
funds in our operation.  It was an unintended consequence of the fact 
that it did not move in and out as soon as it was supposed to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What do you mean by unintended? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The fact that it sat there that long meant that it 
10 
stayed in our books that long.  So it would have moved in and out even 
before our financial year end had the farming operation turned on in the 
time lines that we were working to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen your previous testimony was that 
that farming venture was on a long term trajectory do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I recall my testimony as the intention was that 
we would get it going quickly and then we realised that the owner was 
haggling over prices.  There was a far more detailed investigation that 
ended up happening.  But the initial investigation was it it was going to 
happen very quickly. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when it did not happen quickly did you 
then engage with him and explain to him that it was being used in the 
operations of Neo Solutions? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No we did not that it was being in the operation 
no. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 139 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And your evidence then is that 
there was no loan agreement ever with Mr Van Wyk, is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No because as I said it was going to be put to 
the farming venture as soon as possible. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that did not ever happen, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That – well by then he had withdrawn all his 
money any way by the time we got to the farming venture closure of the 
project. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we go over the page to page 238.280.  Mr 
Natasen there is a heading there called Benefit Derived.  Before I get 
10 
the benefit of your understanding of what Mr Lowenthal is saying here 
we would just like to pick up on an aspect that is relevant to the 
question of benefit from your testimony this morning. As I understood 
your testimony you made it clear that even though you did not have the 
R2.6 million available at the end of February sitting as cash in the Neo 
Solutions. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Available funds. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Bank accounts had there been a call for it you 
would have taken steps to get other facilities, is that accurate? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  To extend our facilities yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Those facilities would not come free 
would they? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  They would come at a cost correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  As I have it from your Nedbank facility 
agreement there is at least an activation fee of R50 000, do you recall 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 140 of 236 
 
that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is on the original agreement but not for 
further extensions they would not – they do not charge it on extensions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There would be some cost associated with the 
extension though? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well at least an interest cost. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  So that the fact that you did not have 
to acquire those additional facilities was a benefit in the hands of Neo 
Solutions, was it not? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  We – I think when we deal with this here we 
10 
come up with the discussion around benefit derived Chair.  I think post 
my earlier testimony we obviously applied our minds to this and from 
the advice of Mr Lowenthal and from a discussion with my own legal 
team and from the history of what we have seen other entities that find 
out later that they were unknowingly involved in obviously state funds 
that have flowed through is then we came up with let us tender.  If 
there has been an unintended benefit that has been derived now 
through the interest saving or in terms of the facilities costs or in a 
positive balance if the facility moved to a positive balance then we 
would be tendering that we will offer to pay the affected institution the 
20 
interest component back.  And that is the benefit – that is the basis of 
this clause in his affidavit. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I did not understand Mr Lowenthal 
to be postulating the need for further facilities to have been obtained, 
did you understand him to be dealing with further facilities in these 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 141 of 236 
 
paragraphs? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, no. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  That is why I was asking before we 
got to what he had derived as the benefit.  A question about if you had 
had to get further facilities. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you accepted that that would come at a 
cost to Neo Solutions, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And your saving of that cost was an additional 
10 
benefit, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us now go to what Mr Lowenthal did do.  
Explain to us what benefit he concluded was received by Neo 
Solutions? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So he has [indistinct] an amount of 
R217 494.00 as the interest saving by us on the – on the overdraft 
facilities.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I have it you have tendered to return 
that to the appropriate beneficial owner should that ever be required? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would that be Mr Van Wyk or would that be 
Koreneka? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It would be the effected state entity that lost 
these funds.  From my understanding. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 142 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And at paragraph 19 on that page 238.280 Mr 
Natasen Mr Lowenthal there says: 
“Owing to the fact that neither Mr Natasen nor Neo 
Solutions made specific use of the monies.” 
Then he goes on to say: 
“There was no intent to benefit either Mr Natasen or 
Neo Solutions as the total monies were received by 
Neo Solutions were paid out by Neo Solutions within 
a few months of receipt.” 
Can I just ask where does he get those facts from owing to the fact that 
10 
neither Mr Natasen nor Neo Solution made specific use of the monies? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is from his – obviously from our 
representations and his interrogation of the accounting team now that 
is there now.  But you will have to ask him this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you – you cannot help us on why he says 
there that Neo Solutions made no specific use? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  You will have to ask him that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I understood you to say he would have got 
that information from you or your accounting team, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  We gave him the facts as we saw it and he was 
20 
appointed to then evaluate those facts and make a obviously produce 
this report. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So – because he would not know those facts, 
would he? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well he was appointed to an investigation.  So 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 143 of 236 
 
through that he would gain whatever facts he could and then draw 
inferences from that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And at 20 he goes on and he says: 
“However there was a consequential unintended benefit that accrued to 
Neo Solutions due to the fact that the monies while in the overdrawn 
bank accounts of Neo Solutions reduced the overdraft amounts owing 
by Neo Solutions to the banks.  I just want to understand the plural 
there.  Why is he talking about overdrawn bank accounts, overdraft 
amounts and banks? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think you will have to ask him those wording.  
10 
He again produced the report. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I am just – he is working on the information 
you give him about your company, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And whatever facts he could gain from the 
books and records that he was able to detect. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we must not or on the back of your 
evidence today read this to suggest that there were other overdraft 
facilities relevant because we have confirmed already there was only 
one bank with an overdraft facility? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja so you will have to ask him this. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No I am asking a factual question now. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  There were no – as I said at the start of today I 
was not sure when the Standard Bank facilities were reinstated.  So 
you – obviously from the records you have you saying it was not at that 
point in time.  They would have been reinstated during March and some 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 144 of 236 
 
of the payments happened during the period of March of the next year 
or the next financial year so therefore that might be but I cannot 
speculate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  And why does he call them an 
unintended benefit?  Did you give him that word? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No that is from his report. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  How does he make a conclusion about what the 
intention was behind the benefit without engaging you about it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  From my explanations there was never an 
intention for us to utilise the funds for our business there was never a 
10 
loan so by inference he would assume then it is unintended. If we never 
intended it – the intended use of the funds was to move to the farming 
venture.  So anything different to that was not what the intention was. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  You conveyed that information to 
him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I explained the transaction history to him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we then go over the page to 
238.281.  I would like to pick up the topic of unaudited annual financial 
statements of Neo Solutions.  And I would like to pick it up at 
paragraph 24 there if we may because Mr Lowenthal as I read this 
20 
paragraph makes some comments about whether your signature on 
certain documents resulted in things becoming binding and enforceable 
against Neo Solutions.  Did you ask him particularly to comment on this 
aspect? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I asked him to look at our obligations or my 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 145 of 236 
 
obligations in terms of the fact that there were signed documents that 
were out there that were inaccurate.  And he was then required to 
respond to that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So these I am assuming is in response to that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Do you accept that whether 
something is binding or enforceable or not is a legal question? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  From an accounting perspective as and he is – 
from my understanding of what Mr Lowenthal has done his brief was to 
look at as well apparently from what I understand he does testify a lot 
10 
on matters like this and from that basis he looked at it not just purely 
from an accounting but an obligation from an accounting perspective in 
terms of the act not as a lawyer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But again you will have to call him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When he says at paragraph 24 maybe you can 
just read paragraph 24 for us. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So he states here that: 
“Neo Solutions is not statutorily required to have 
audited financial statements and Mr - Mr Natasen’s 
20 
signature electronic or handwritten on the compiled 
unaudited annual financial statements does not in 
my opinion result in same becoming binding or 
enforceable 
against 
Neo 
Solutions 
and/or 
Mr Natasen 
unless 
specifically 
having 
being 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 146 of 236 
 
compiled for reliance upon by a stated known third 
party for a particular need.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen earlier in your evidence today we 
traversed the requirement of audited financial statements in your 
Nedbank facility agreement.  Do you recall that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you make that known to Mr Lowenthal 
before he deposed to this affidavit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I am not sure if he has access to the agreement 
with Nedbank at that point in time. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My question was did you make it - bring it … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To his attention? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  As I stated in my testimony I was only reminded 
of it now when obviously … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  A day or so ago … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When the Commission provided you with that … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Agreement?  So his conclusion here as I 
20 
understand it is that: 
“There is no obligation for as long as no third party 
creditor is being asked to place reliance on the 
financial statements.” 
Do you read it in the same way? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 147 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And insofar as we have now confirmed because 
your memory was refreshed two days ago that there was a legal 
obligation to provide those audited financial statements.  I assume you 
would then differ from the conclusion he draws here. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  You can ask him that but … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen the question was do you differ from 
the conclusion he draws here. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  If - if the obligation to report to Nedbank was 
made aware to him then I - I agree. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure what the value of his opinion is in 
paragraph 24. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is not a lawyer. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Insofar - Chair and the only reason for 
exploring it if I may is insofar as there is any respect in which an 
expert accountant might be able to shed light on in accounting practice 
20 
what the requirements of audited financial statements are.  That is the 
only reason for probing it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we have Mr Natasen’s evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 148 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On that.  Mr Natasen the next topic on that 
page is “Chartered Accountant in Business” and we have traversed that 
already in your evidence.  I - what do you understand Mr Lowenthal to 
say about the position of a Chartered Accountant in Business and its 
application to you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My - my understanding from him is my role with 
the company is operational.  I serve more role on projects.  I have 
outsourced 
the 
accounting 
activities 
to an 
internal 
accounting 
department as well as an externalised accounting practice.  So I am not 
serving in my capacity as a Chartered Accountant in the operations of 
10 
Neo Solutions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept as a Chartered Accountant 
though the general obligations that apply under the Code would still 
apply to you given - even though you are not a Chartered Accountant in 
Business? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I do not agree with that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the ethics of the profession of accounting … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The ethics do apply.  I have never said that that 
does not.  In terms of the obligations of looking into detail on the books 
and results of the operations I outsource that activity. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Agreed.  We might have been at cross 
purposes.  So I can just be clear.  You accept I have it from your 
evidence that the ethics of the profession continue to apply to you.  Is 
that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 149 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you also comply with the obligation to 
provide annual CPD Declarations given your registration as a Chartered 
Accountant? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What do those involve? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It - it involves submitting your timesheets in 
terms of the work you do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I think it relates to ongoing development.  
Is that right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and have you done so with SAICA? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well we submit the timesheets and they 
obviously look at it and see whether it qualifies. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and just in terms of those ethical 
obligations do you regard it as one of the ethical obligations of an 
accountant not to bring the profession into disrepute? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And do you regard a Chartered Accountant who 
signs off on financial statements as accurately reflecting the affairs of 
the business where that is not so could be involved in bringing the 
20 
profession into disrepute? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have not signed those financials in any 
capacity as a Chartered Accountant.  So I do not believe it is relevant. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh.  So sorry.  So if on the page where you 
signed them you somewhere put next to your name Chartered 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 150 of 236 
 
Accountant would then the obligation arise? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I am saying my capacity in the operations of 
Neo Solutions I am a Director … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And obviously I am the person - the shareholder 
of the business but in the capacity as Director and Chief Executive I 
sign those financials there but not purporting that I have examined the 
books and records as any CA would as a service. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Natasen we understand each other entirely.  
Let me just be clear on my question.  My question did not suggest that 
10 
you played the role of a Chartered Accountant in Business because I 
have read what Mr Lowenthal has said and not that it should be 
relevant for the present determination but I do not see a basis on which 
to refute what he says. 
That is why the questions have progressed.  I am talking 
about the general ethical obligations of a Chartered Accountant 
wherever they find themselves and even if they are not conducting the 
activities of a Chartered Accountant in Business.  Do you understand 
where we are … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the question? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand your evidence to be it is part of 
the ethical obligations of a Chartered Accountant not to bring the 
profession into disrepute.  Correct? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 151 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I then asked whether a Director of a company 
who is a Chartered Accountant who signs off on financial statements 
indicating with his signature that they correctly reflect the financial 
position of the company in circumstances where they do not.  Do you 
regard that as bringing the profession into disrepute? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I have signed those financials on the basis that 
my internal accounting team as well as the external accounting team 
have done their homework and satisfied themselves that this was 
correct.  Even on the matter of Garth vs Epherus (?) that - those 
10 
financials were prepared by Mannie (?) Financial Services. 
So yes you - in the previous testimony you put me on the spot 
in terms of saying there should have been an inference and I should 
have known better but the person who is being remunerated to actually 
prepare those financials should have known better.  Right.  I made a 
reasonable assumption that the financials brought through to me after 
Mannie has been through them are reasonably correct and I signed 
them on that basis. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Does that mean you did not read the page 
where you signature appears? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I understand what it is saying there but I am 
saying we satisfied.  I understand this obligation is placed back on me 
as a Director of the company.  I understand those.  I am not derogating 
from that but it also says I must put in reasonable steps within the 
operation to make sure that they are correct. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 152 of 236 
 
The undertaking that Many (?) Financial Services have given 
me was that they were the vetting agent to make sure that those were 
correct which they are now shielding themselves from but ultimately 
after the SARS audit process they had undertaken to - to do those 
steps for me.  So I relied on the fact that those steps were being 
performed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair those conclude our questions 
in relation to Mr Natasen’s evidence and Mr Lowenthal’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  Then we can start with 
re-examination. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may just take a moment Chair to clear up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To clear up. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that there is space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Before I start Chair I would just like to go back 
to an issue raised by my learned colleague this morning with regards to 
Ms Tlatsana’s recent absence from the Republic of South Africa.  My 
client mentioned to me during the break that he was quite taken aback 
20 
by the fact that it was mentioned during the course of these 
proceedings specifically and at the beginning of the testimony today 
because again it creates a negative impression and one draws a 
negative inference that my client or Neo Solutions was somehow 
complacent in the threats or intimidatory tactics levelled against 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 153 of 236 
 
Ms Tlatsana. 
So I just wanted to place on record that and I will agree with 
me that there was no association created by the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not - not that I have heard of.  My understanding is - 
my impression is that the threats maybe related to threats or 
intimidation that Ms Tlatsana had given evidence about previously.  
Now they may or may not be related to her departure from the Republic 
- may or may not be connected with those about which she gave 
evidence but certainly I know nothing and I have heard nothing that 
would necessarily connect her disappearance to your client. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair just to be clear I - I understand 
Mr Natasen to be quite concerned about the reference to it this morning 
as though there is any link to his evidence.  I think it is of benefit to the 
Chair just to explain why it was raised this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair today we place before the full cross-
examination application of Mr Natasen … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To cross-examine Ms Tlatsana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may be permitted to ask Mr Natasen 
whether he does not agree that the fact that she might be out of the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 154 of 236 
 
Republic is relevant to the - your request to cross-examine her.  Do you 
accept that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It does affect our ability to cross-examine here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No, I think … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Just to clarify why I raise it with my attorney … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I think maybe let me hear your counsel 
first.  He might say you - you … 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He might cover me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He would like you to - to explain. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Well I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just wanted to clarify it? 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  No, no Ms Hofmeyr actually pre-empted my 
second point which was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Her absence now makes cross-examination 
difficult if not impossible.  Simply because as I understand the direction 
given to us by the Commission in making our application to 
20 
cross-examine Ms Tlatsana our application was given to her and the 
request was made to her by the Commission to submit a further 
affidavit in reply and based on that the Commission would then 
determine whether or not cross-examination was necessary and to what 
extent. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 155 of 236 
 
So it - it does bring about a question as to how and if and 
when we are going to be given the opportunity to cross-examine her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No it does raise that question.  As things stand 
on the basis of what we know and I certainly only heard this morning 
that apparently she is out of the country.  On what we know now we do 
not know if and when she may come back to make herself available but 
as Ms Hofmeyr indicated I think the Commission’s investigators are 
looking into the issue. 
At some stage in the future it ought to be possible to reach a 
conclusion whether she will come back or not and obviously that 
10 
information would be shared with you. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you Chair.  I am going to get straight 
into the re-examination or cross-examination of Mr Natasen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I am not going to belabour the Commission 
with detailed references to specific documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Save for one or two that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That we need to deal with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Because I obviously want to summarise the 
examination in chief of my learned colleague and based on that 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 156 of 236 
 
summary I will then address Mr Natasen on various points. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I will try and keep it as concise as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen I would like to start with the issue 
of Chartered Accountant in Business because it is something that was 
raised on 12 July - beginning of the testimony and a lot of emphasis 
was placed on it by the Commission’s legal team and you were asked to 
10 
make certain concessions.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And you made those concessions.  You 
conceded that you were a Chartered Accountant in Business? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes I do. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You conceded that you had read the Code of 
Good Practice of Chartered Accountants? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You conceded that you understood and 
appreciated the contents of that Code? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  You agreed today given the advises 
that you have received subsequent to 12 July as also your own 
investigations into the matter as also Mr Lowenthal’s advises to you 
that those concessions were incorrect? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 157 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Those were incorrect. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct.  Now much has been made today 
specifically about the fact that Mr Lowenthal is not an attorney.  You 
are not an attorney.  Mr Judiel is not an attorney.  No one is an 
attorney but the one person that is an attorney is my colleague 
Ms Hofmeyr and she was the one who raised the issue initially and 
brought the Code to your attention.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay and the - the intention behind bringing 
the Code to your attention was to say to you Mr Natasen you are not 
10 
just a Director of Neo Financial Services.  You are not just the sole 
shareholder.  You are a Chartered Accountant in Business and therefore 
you are held to a higher standard than an ordinary Director.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is Neo Solutions not … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Neo Solutions. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair just at the outset I - I think it 
is important to indicate that it is our submission that the scope of 
re-examination requires non-leading questions to be put to a witness 
and my concern at this point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 158 of 236 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to put it on record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that the nature of the questions being put to 
Mr Natasen at the moment are leading questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Counsel for Mr Natasen. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That is not my understanding of the rules but I 
accept what Ms …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Hofmeyr is saying.  So I will try and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You will try … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Limit my line of questioning to questions which 
do not lead the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen I am going to read you a section 
of the Code and I would like your comment on it.  It says: 
“A professional accountant - Chartered Accountant 
20 
in Business might be an employee, contractor, 
partner, Director, owner, manager or volunteer of an 
employing organisation.  The legal from of the 
relationship with the professional accountant with 
the employing organisation has no bearing on the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 159 of 236 
 
ethical responsibilities placed on the professional 
accountant.” 
Okay.  You have read that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  I am going to read you Section 260.11 
A1 of the Professional Code and it says that and I am going to go to 
the relevant portion of the paragraph.  It says: 
“There is a greater expectation for financial, 
technological, physical and intangible resources on 
such 
individuals 
to 
take 
whatever 
action 
is 
10 
appropriate from the public interest to respond to 
non-compliance or expected non-compliance other 
than professional accountants with the employing 
organisation. 
 
This 
is 
because 
of 
senior 
professional accountants’ roles, positions, spheres 
of influence within the employing organisation.” 
Right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do you under - what do you understand from 
those two provisions read together in the context of Ms Hofmeyr’s line 
20 
of questioning and her assertions to you that you were a Chartered 
Accountant in Business as opposed to simply a sole Director and 
shareholder of Neo? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I believe I have - I have not been through - 
sorry again through you Chair.  I have not been operating in the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 160 of 236 
 
capacity as a Chartered Accountant.  I had to my mind put in checks 
and balances in the accounts department and with the external entity in 
order to provide me the comfort that the books and records are correct 
and being correctly prepared. 
So when I signed these financials there was no inclining at 
that point in time that I am signing them off as a Chartered Accountant.  
The definition of Chartered Accountant in Business there is something I 
have now been drawn attention to, to give it a focus on post the earlier 
testimony but from my recollection I have - I have got checks and 
balances. 
10 
I had - my understanding was that I had at that point in time 
in the company and I made reasonable assumptions that the books and 
records were accurate as I was signing them off with adequate controls 
in place. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So you would disagree then if I said to you, 
you are held to a higher standard signing off those financials than you 
would ordinarily be held to if you were the Chartered Accountant 
preparing those financials? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I - yes, I disagree. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You disagree, okay and would you agree that 
20 
in your capacity as Director and sole shareholder of Neo that you are 
not engaged by Neo as an employee organisation as defined within the 
Code? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I confirm that I am not. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So therefore strictly speaking those 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 161 of 236 
 
provisions of the Code dealing with professional accountants and 
Chartered Accountants in Business have no application to you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct based on reading it like that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the last two were - were leading but I will - I will 
let go.  Let us proceed. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair I disagree with you.  I have read the 
Rules very carefully about leading questions and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed.  It is okay. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Let us just proceed … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed, ja. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Because we need to get through this and I am 
entitled to re-examine the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  These are questions that have been put to the 
witness by the Commission’s legal team and there I - I believe I am 
entitled to (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you - you must proceed. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was just indicating you have undertaken to - to try 
20 
and … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I am trying to keep it as concise as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I accept that.  I accept that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So Mr Natasen following on that okay if you 
are not a Chartered Accountant in Business and you were presented 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 162 of 236 
 
with the financials which were prepared by your accountants in 
conjunction with your accounting staff and representations were made 
to you regarding the accuracy of those financial documents. 
Do you see any problem with you being able to sign those 
documents without having any reference whatsoever to the original 
books of prime entry, the source documentation, the ledgers, previous 
financials any other financial information of the company that would be 
relevant to the financials that have been drafted and prepared and put 
before you for signature? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My understanding is that Many (?) Financial 
10 
Services would have done those steps before I received the - the 
financials to sign. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Good.  In fact it is obligation of the company 
to hand over the books of prime entry, the source documents and the 
like … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  To the accountants who then compile the 
financial information. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  In an accurate way based on the 
20 
correct reporting standards and then at a later stage the auditors would 
come in if … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  If auditors. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  If auditors are necessary and warrant it in 
terms of the - the relevant legislation and they would then do sampling 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 163 of 236 
 
in order to determine whether or not the accounts that have been 
prepared were correct.  Is that your …? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is my understanding. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So do we - do we both - I certainly 
accept but do you accept that based on the representations of your 
accountants and your internal accounting staff when those financials 
were put before you, you felt comfortable that they were accurate and 
that you could sign them. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct as well in the context of Patel 
had given me assurance that he was the watchdog checking over the 
10 
work of - of Ruben. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Yes.  You said so.  Okay.  I am going to leave 
the professional Chartered Accountant in Business issue there.  Simply 
because I do not believe it warrants any further attention.  It is not 
applicable.  Let us just go for a moment to the obligation - statutory 
obligation that rests on the company for the purposes of the production 
and dispatch to third parties of audited financial statements.  Are you 
familiar with Section 30 of the Companies Act Mr Natasen? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Are you familiar with the regulations to the 
20 
Companies Act? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Are you aware that based on the 
turnover of Neo that it has a status as either a small, medium or large 
organisation … 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 164 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Within the regulations? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Are you - if I ask this question let me change it 
because I know that Chair is going to take an issue.  Where does Neo 
rank in that status? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Our current turnovers - turnovers over the 
periods the last four/five years have been below 50 million. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Below 50 million.  So then having regard to 
Section 30 of the Companies Act Regulation 27 thereof it would - Neo 
10 
would qualify as a small enterprise.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Small to medium, ja. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Small to medium. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is below 50, ja. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And then the circumstances there is no 
obligation on the company to produce audited financial statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So the questions that were led by my 
learned colleague on 12 July relating to your obligation in terms of the 
Companies Act to produce audited financial statements was incorrect? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Mr Natasen much - much has been 
made during the examination in chief of the fact that your various 
statements furnished to the Commission over the period since the 
Commission first engaged with you have been by and large inconsistent 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 165 of 236 
 
and inaccurate.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  In fact one of the terms most frequently 
used by my learned colleague has been Mr Natasen I refer to your 
previous testimony.  Okay.  That is the lead in to I refer you to your 
previous testimony and I now refer you to a specific statement and 
there are inaccuracies and discrepancies.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  I will give you some examples of some 
of the discrepancies that have been raised by my learned colleague and 
10 
these come straight from the EXHIBIT DD10A which is the transcription 
from the last hearing on 12 July.  Ms Hofmeyr says you misled the 
Commission in your prior submission in that there actually were three 
meetings held with Judiel and not two.  You had previously signed 
witness statements. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may just request a reference.  So that we 
can follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Page 63 line 15 page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr wants to say something. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 166 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair I was just requesting our learned friend 
to give us a reference in the transcript when he refers to it.  Just so 
that we can pick it up.  Chair you also have a copy of the transcript as 
well.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I was - I am not sure that I - I knew that - oh for 
12 July? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair as I said to you I do not want to 
10 
belabour the Commission with us having to reference specific 
documentation in specific files again.  I think what - a better approach 
would 
be 
for 
Ms Hofmeyr 
if 
she 
verily 
believes 
that 
I 
am 
misrepresenting the assertions made by her when I reference them in 
the transcription.  I think she should just say so and then we can go to 
those specific … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think her request was for you to mention where 
in the t 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where in the transcript. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I am more than happy to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It is page 63 line 15.  Page 67 line 21.  Page 
69 line 20.  Page 80 line 2 and these are just examples … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 167 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR: 
 
Of 
the 
alleged 
inconsistencies 
that 
consistently feature in Mr Natasen’s statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  There was no meeting scheduled for 10 May 
between yourself and the Commission.  You were made aware of your 
right to legal representation and there appeared to be multiple versions 
submitted by you through your engagements with the Commission.  So 
those are just some of the examples of the alleged inconsistencies and 
I do not think my - my learned colleague can dispute the fact that she 
has on several occasions said to you with reference to one or more 
10 
documents that there are inconsistencies but the fact of the matter is 
that these inconsistences or what as lawyers would refer to (indistinct) 
there is nothing material that turns on them. 
Okay.  They are for example the - the issue of the three 
meetings versus two.  Mr Natasen explained that yes he was incorrect 
in - in the second statement and that.  He had actually forgotten about 
the previous meeting but the question is what relevance and what - why 
is it material?  Why is that missing meeting material to what the 
Commission is investigating and what the allegations are that 
Ms Hofmeyr is putting forward. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What - what you may wish to do is see what you wish 
to put to him for him to say something and see what you might wish to 
reserve for when submissions are made when you can say no reliance 
should be placed on this or that or that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Ja.  I am not making a specific submission or 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 168 of 236 
 
a specific statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I am making a general submission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  As regards to the fact that there have been 
multiple inconsistencies alleged in various statements submitted by 
Mr Natasen and I do not think anybody here would disagree with me.  I 
think that - that is common course.  I am getting to the point that I - 
that I intend raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen earlier on today you questioned 
me - it was actually during the lunch - and you asked me where it was - 
where - where the line of questioning that was being led by the 
Commission’s legal team was - was going.  What - what the purpose of 
it was? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja, I did ask that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    And I explained to you that because you 
couldn’t understand and I’m just relaying what – you couldn’t 
20 
understand why time after time inconsistencies had been brought to 
your attention and as you quite rightly said these were of no 
consequence, these are immaterial inconsistencies, where is the 
Commission going with its questions, and I explained to you that the 
Commission’s investigations have a two-prong approach, the first is the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 169 of 236 
 
204 statement that you gave, okay, and in that regard the Commission’s 
assertions, obviously Ms Hofmeyr hasn’t said it expressly, but that’s 
where her line of questioning is going, is that because there are 
inconsistencies in the statements, and I making a put to you, I want you 
to either agree or disagree, because there are inconsistencies in your 
statements the effect of that is in terms of Section 204 of the Criminal 
Procedure Act is that we haven’t given honest and frank testimony, so 
that’s the first part of the 204 attack for use of a better word, the 
second is the POCA legislation that my learned colleague referred you 
to,  and specifically Section 6 thereof, which – and I will just read it to 
10 
you again quickly just so that you – to jog your memory, Section 6 
deals with acquisitions, possessions, or use of proceeds of unlawful 
activities, and basically what it says is that if you have possession of 
property and you know or ought reasonably to have known that if one is 
part of the proceeds of unlawful activities you’re guilty of a criminal 
offence, right? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Yes I recall that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay, so the second prong of the attack of 
204 is to try and convince on the evidence, to try and convince 
potentially the authorities that you are guilty not only of the 
20 
inconsistencies,  the misrepresentation, the lack of frankness and 
honesty in your evidence but you’re also guilty of having used proceeds 
that you ought to have known or you knew were the proceeds of 
unlawful activities, so that’s the – I’m answering your question now 
because I’m getting to the very point that we need to touch on. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 170 of 236 
 
 
The last prong of the attack is that the 204 statement, and I 
see that my colleague was belabouring the point this morning, the 204 
statement itself hasn’t been validly taken and therefore it’s legally 
unenforceable, okay.   
 
So we have effectively a three-prong approach.  We’ve got the 
lack 
of 
frankness 
and 
honesty, 
because 
of 
your 
inconsistent 
statements, we’ve got the fact that the 204 is not a legally viable 
document because it wasn’t taken by a properly authorised person in 
the correct manner, and lastly you’re in violation of the POCA 
legislation because you had use of the 9.9million and therefore you are 
10 
guilty of a criminal offence. 
 
So we have to deal with these in cross-examination because 
they are obviously very material issues and obviously affect how this 
matter proceeds.  Mr Natasen let’s just deal with the inconsistencies as 
a starting point.  Would you agree with the submission that the 
inconsistencies to date that have been raised with you are immaterial 
and irrelevant to the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite leading. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Chair this is the third time we’ve touched on 
the issue of the leading questions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    I’m asking Mr Natasen whether he believes in 
his opinion, I’m not asking for a qualified – I’m asking for his subjective 
opinion whether he believes that the inconsistencies that had been 
raised by my learned colleague in his various statements are of a 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 171 of 236 
 
material nature or not.  It’s a very simple question, it’s not a legal 
question, it’s not a question that requires a chartered accountant in 
business to answer, it’s a simple question based on subjectivity.  I don’t 
think it’s a leading question. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Maybe I can respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     When I was first contacted by  the 
Commission I went in using the 204 which was already issued in 
October of 2017, so when  i was contacted I actually went to them with 
the evidence, at that point in time.  The further evidence I had was the 
10 
recording which the DCPI Hawks did not have, so when I took the 
recording I contacted Yudeel and said do you want this recording 
because it actually proves totally clearly that I was not aware that this 
was S A Express’ money and they said no they had what they needed 
and he doesn’t believe they needed it, if they wanted it they will ask for 
it, so in March of this year when I was contacted by the Commission I 
went to them, the investigating team with exactly that, thinking that 
okay this is already a matter that is sitting at the Hawks, they are 
probably needing the evidence to go into the State Capture process to 
see whether it can flow any further. 
20 
 
That was my understanding when I started the process.   Then 
more and more questions started to come.  Now remember at the time 
when I was brought, when this was brought to my attention by Yudeel 
then I said here’s all the information, then he assisted me in preparing 
the affidavit.  If the affidavit is scant or doesn’t reflect every single 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 172 of 236 
 
point my understanding now as the Commission’s investigators pick up 
more and more they’re looking for more clarity, so everything that has 
been provided to date is to provide that clarity that has been sought at 
each point in time, so to me yes, if there’s something I had not known 
at that point in time that I pick up now that the information is different, 
as I pick it up I shared that, so it’s not – the inconsistency should not 
be considered as misrepresentations, the inconsistencies are because 
it appears that the Commission is requiring a much further level of 
detail than we had three years ago when this matter came about and 
that’s really how it’s evolved from there. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Thanks Mr Natasen, I think that quite 
succinctly answers the majority of that question, but the fact of the 
matter is that your various statements are very consistent throughout, 
the thread of the statements is by and large identical throughout all the 
statements, the only thing that differs is the additional information 
that’s provided and as you just quite rightly said that happens through 
specific context where specific information is sought and in effect you 
then supplement the statements as you go along, but supplementation 
doesn’t equate to inconsistency, would you agree with that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That’s correct. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay, Mr Natasen insofar as – we’re going to 
go into this in a lot more detail, but insofar as your knowledge as 
regards the unlawfulness of the funds that you had in your account, 
that you had in your account that flowed from Koroneka into Neo 
Solutions account, you’ve already testified, I’m just confirming this, 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 173 of 236 
 
that you had no knowledge as to the unlawfulness of the source of 
those funds, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     At the time definitely not. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    At the time definitely not, and in the 
circumstances and in terms of the requisite legislation, specifically 
POCA to which my learned colleague referred there has to be intent, 
you had to have known of the unlawfulness in order to to violate that 
legislative provision is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay.  And because you had no knowledge 
10 
there was no violation correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     That’s my understanding. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Correct, okay.  Mr Natasen let’s just deal 
with the 204 affidavit, you gave testimony this morning that the affidavit 
was prepared by Mr Yudeel and that he presented it to you and that he 
in effect did that with Ms Magotsi on the phone and that pursuant to 
that statement having been prepared you then deposed to it and it was 
submitted, is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That’s correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay.  The 204 itself Mr Natasen as you 
20 
quite rightly pointed out earlier is a standard form affidavit save for the 
content that you include or incorporate is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Ja, I think so. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    It’s a reference to the specific sections of the 
Act and your obligation to lodge criminal complaints is something that 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 174 of 236 
 
and I know you said you weren’t familiar with 204’s but would you 
appreciate that that’s part of the legislation and has to be incorporated 
...(intervention)  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   As a standard clause. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    By implication into that affidavit. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Correct ja. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    So when my learned colleague questioned 
you on that and asked you whether or not you had read that provision 
and whether or not you had taken unnecessary steps how will you 
respond to that, just to be clear? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well as I said at the time I had spoken to 
Yudeel and Yudeel said that the matter was already under a case 
number at the Commercial Crime Unit so therefore there was no need 
to do any further reporting, all they would do is append it to their 
existing case file, that was my understanding from Mr Yudeel at the 
time. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay so as far as you are concerned the 
affidavit, the 204 was taken legally, given the fact that Mr Yudeel 
represented that he was a private investigator, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Yes. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    And that he was working with the DPCI. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That’s correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    And that he had been tasked by the relevant 
person, Ms Magotsi in securing the 204 affidavit and you then were 
privy to a conversation although you didn’t hear the exact exchange, 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 175 of 236 
 
you were privy to the conversation, I understood from that that Ms 
Magotsi had directed Mr Yudeel to take the 204 affidavit under oath 
from you. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     That’s correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    So as far as you were concerned at the time 
in giving the 204 the 204 was taken by a legally authorised person. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That was my understanding at the time. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    And that the 204 was binding on you. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     That’s correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    And the contents of the 204 would in your 
10 
submission, and let’s take into account the allegations by my learned 
colleague that there are inconsistencies, would you say that the 204 
accords with the various other statements that you submitted to the 
Commission to date. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   It still does. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    It still does. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     In my view it still does. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Is there any respect in which you believe it 
digresses or diverges from those statements? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well I don’t believe there’s inaccuracies, the 
20 
monies that were received were validly paid back to him, the 
accounting for the R300 000 is what Advocate Hofmeyr has disputed 
but I have explained that, it was placed in there to account for the full 
9.9million. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay, so I think we will leave it there, my 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 176 of 236 
 
point was simply that as far as you were concerned you verily believed 
that the 204 subpoena was being taken by a legally authorised 
representative, that it contained the necessary legislative prerequisites 
and that it was legally binding on you. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     That’s correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Would you submit that to date from inception 
of this matter, in other words when the Commission first contacted you, 
till today, that you have given frank and honest testimony to this 
Commission? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Is there any aspect of your testimony to date 
save for where you have belaboured under the misconception for 
example with the chartered accountant and business that you were 
obligated to comply with the code which you weren’t, is there any other 
instance where you believe that your testimony has not been frank and 
honest. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    So you believe that you have complied with 
the provisions of Section 204 of the Criminal Procedure Act? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Do you believe that the protection afforded 
by 204 should be afforded to you under the circumstances? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay, is there any reason you believe that 
the 204 protection shouldn’t be afforded to you? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 177 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Mr Natasen let’s then move on to – we have 
dealt with your knowledge as regards the unlawfulness of the funds, we 
have dealt with the validity and enforceability of the 204, and we have 
dealt with the inconsistencies and your honest and frank testimony, 
okay, which is as I said earlier the thrust of the attack or approach 
taken by the Commission in its line of questioning, that’s where they 
were attempting to get.  The problem for the Commission thus far 
though, if I may submit, and I am not going to make it your submission, 
is that there isn’t any hard and fast evidence which makes you 
10 
complicit in any of the alleged criminal activities of which you are 
accused, right.   
 
You were unwittingly the victim, or Neo was unwittingly the 
victim of money laundering activities, would you agree with that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     With what we know now yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    I don’t want to put words into your mouth but 
this is the testimony that has been given today.  You will agree with 
that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay at the time of receiving the funds you 
20 
had no knowledge that the funds were unlawful or that they come from 
a State organisation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Definitely not. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:   Had you known what would you have done?  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I wouldn’t followed through on any of that 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 178 of 236 
 
transaction had I known that it was from a State Enterprise. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Would you have brought it to Mr van Wyk’s 
attention immediately? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay were you surprised by Ms Tlatsana’s 
original affidavit implicating you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well I was aware of the 204 already so at that 
point in time – at the point of the 204 is when I was aware that the 
funds were not from a – well that it came from a Government 
department. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Were you surprised that Ms Tlatsana had 
come on record and accused you of being involved in these activities? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Well I wasn’t aware of Tlatsana’s name until 
Yudeel approached me for the 204, before that I was just aware that 
van Wyk had a partner and I was aware that there was a dispute with 
the partner that he was going to retrieve the control of the bank 
accounts. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    For the record you had no direct dealings 
with Tlatsana? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   I never heard the name Tlatsana until much 
20 
later. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    And for the record there was no invoicing 
activities between Koroneka and Neo? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Definitely not. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay, had there been invoices I think would 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 179 of 236 
 
your internal accounting staff have raised it with you? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well Brian worked closely with them but from 
what I understand there should not have been any invoices, because 
this was not related to an invoice based transaction. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    So you stand by your advices in the 204? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    And just to go back to your point on the 
supplementation of the statements as things progressed through to 
where they are now, at each and every stage all of your affidavits were 
deposed to on the basis that information contained in those statements 
10 
was to the best of your knowledge and belief at the time of making 
those statements correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That’s right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay.  What do you understand by to the 
best of your knowledge and belief at the time? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     It is what I know as either the facts or what I 
can draw inferences on as existing at that point in time. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Does that knowledge and belief change at all 
at any time? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   No, not around the source of funds definitely 
20 
not. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    No but I’m saying in the context of the 
various statements as they progressed your knowledge and belief, I’m 
assuming it changed as circumstances ...(intervention)  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:     Well as more information comes to light we 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 180 of 236 
 
then obviously supplemented the documentation. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    So if there were investigations conducted, if 
meetings transpired, if conversations were had with third parties, like 
Mr Yudeel, with the Commission with your legal representatives based 
on those interactions your statements could have changed over time? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   That’s correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:    Okay so where one says when one deposes 
to an affidavit on the basis that to the best of your knowledge and 
belief the facts therein contained are correct, true and correct. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That’s right. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Is it correct that your understanding is based 
on your knowledge and belief at that time of making a statement, what’s 
in that statement is correct, but that it can change over time. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Mr Natasen if we can move on to the 
receipt of these funds from Mr van Wyk and the due diligence that was 
conducted by you.  Now I suspect, but I am not going to make it my 
personal submission, but I suspect that part of the chartered 
accountants and business relates to the high standard that was 
expected of you by the Commission when accepting these funds from 
20 
Mr van Wyk because much was made of the fact that your due 
diligence, if I can put it that way, on Mr van Wyk was less than would 
have been expected by the Commission and there was argument made 
or questions that were put to you regarding the fact that Mr van Wyk 
mentioned that he did not wish to have a lifestyle audit and in fact the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 181 of 236 
 
inquiry actually went around in circles for quite some time on this very 
point, and I just want to clarify it because it’s obviously highly material 
to whether you ought to have known as the POCA legislation requires 
that the proceeds were from an unlawful source.   
 
So let’s just, as my colleague likes to say, let’s just unpack 
this a little.  Let’s start with the requirement for lifestyle audits.  Are 
lifestyle audits a regular occurrence in the public sector? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My understanding is that they are, especially on 
State Owned Entities. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And what would you believe the reason for 
10 
that to be? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is to identify whether there’s sources of 
income that are – that obviously from State monies that may have 
ended up in the hands of officials. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So it is not untoward for a State official in any 
capacity to have a lifestyle audit conducted? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No it is not unusual, I saw them as a regular 
occurrence. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And there doesn’t have to be suspicion of any 
unlawfulness, it’s often done on the basis that it is practice. 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And Mr Natasen in terms of SARS you 
mentioned earlier ADR and money and the fact that you have had to 
deal with SARS on various occasions, as far as you are aware does 
SARS conduct lifestyle audits? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 182 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My understanding is that they do look at your 
asset base and your lifestyle against the income you’re declaring. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Isn’t it almost common practice for lifestyle 
audits to be conducted every time there is an audit of a taxpayer? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think they reconcile the assets, or the 
movement in assets to ...(intervention)  
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So why then do you believe that the 
Commission is so focused on the issue of lifestyle audit when you 
mention in passing Mr van Wyk had said he didn’t really want a lifestyle 
audit, why do you think that the Commission’s legal team focused on 
10 
that issue so much? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My understanding at the time was that 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no, I don’t think that is helpful, you need to 
ask him a question will focus on clarifying whatever answer he may 
have given, in regard to that question. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you Chair.  Do you believe that it was 
your obligation as a business man, not a chartered accountant, 
because you weren’t conducting yourself as a chartered accountant in 
business or otherwise within Neo, you were simply a director and a 
20 
shareholder and as you said quite heavily involved in projects and a 
business opportunity had arisen with Mr van Wyk do you think you were 
obligated in the circumstances to interrogate him on his comment in 
passing regarding lifestyle audit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I felt it was a regular occurrence so he 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 183 of 236 
 
mentioned it in passing, that’s why I didn’t take it further, it wasn’t a 
specific forensic audit that was being conducted against him from my 
understanding. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And am I correct if I remember your testimony 
the lifestyle audit comment made in passing was in relation to the fact 
that the reason for him wanting to pay the funds to Neo was that he 
didn’t want a lifestyle audit on his personal accounts and affairs, is that 
correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My understanding was they would – if there was 
a regular lifestyle audit then this was income that he was deriving from 
10 
private business and he was already planning to leave S A Express 
anyway so he felt  he didn’t want it accruing to him at that point in 
time. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So you saw untoward about the comment that 
he made in passing? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  With regards to the lifestyle audit. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, I relied on the undertakings that he gave 
me that it was definitely not State money. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Yes, would it be correct submission to say that 
20 
no one wants a lifestyle audit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja, that’s a fair comment. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Why do you think it’s a fair comment? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Everyone believes that a lifestyle audit of some 
sort will look to find to find something at some point in time, so by 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 184 of 236 
 
nature it is a negative thing, it’s like having to collect on insurance or 
pay insurance. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct, okay and given the fact that the 
amount that was going to be transferred.  Did you believe that that in 
itself warranted further investigation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Not at all, I mean the founding deal was going 
to be obviously much bigger than that and he was actually showing 
credibility, he always purported he was a successful businessman 
before he went to S A Express, that he came from private sector first, 
so I had no question that he had the money and the assets to be able 
10 
to come up with his share of the money to invest in the farming 
enterprise. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen is Neo a accountable institution? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  In terms of the relevant legislation, FICA 
legislation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No definitely not. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Are you an accountable person in terms of that 
legislation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No definitely not. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Are you an accountable person in terms of that 
legislation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen I am going to put a number of 
requirements to you, not really requirements, I am going to run off a list 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 185 of 236 
 
of accountable organisations or institutions per the legislation and I am 
going to ask whether Neo or yourself, because it refers to person or 
organisation, falls within any of these categories, and I just want you to 
say yes or no.  A practitioner who practices as defined in Section 1 of 
the Attorneys Act? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay, a Board of Executors or trust company 
or other person that invests, keeps in safe in custody, controls or 
administers trust property within the meaning of the Trust Property 
Control Act. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  An Estate Agent as defined in the Estate 
Agents (indistinct)  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  An authorised user of exchange as defined in 
the Security Services Act? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A manager registered in terms of the 
Collective Investment Schemes Control Act? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A person who carries on the business of a 
bank as defined in the Banks Act? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A mutual bank as defined in the Mutual Banks 
Act? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 186 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A person who carries on long-term insurance 
business defined as Long-term Insurance Act? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A person who carries on the business of

MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A person who carries on the business of

MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A person who issues, sells or redeems 
travellers cheques?

ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  The Ithaba Development Finance Corportion

Page 187 of 236 
 
Limited? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  A person who carries on the business of a 
money remitter? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay, so you don’t as either a person or 
organisation, Neo being an organisation, fall within the ambit of the Act 
as accountable institution, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So is there any obligation you know of that 
10 
requires you as a business person entering into a business related 
transaction with a third party at arm’s length to identify and verify the 
transaction? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No that I am aware of. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay, so I mean would you agree that no 
business in this country could really be conducted if every single time 
money exchanged hands for purposes of a potential business 
transaction if there was a requirement to identify and verify and 
effectively FICA the party you were dealing with, would you agree with 
that?  
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja, I think it would be a ...(intervention)  
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  In the context of that do you believe that you 
took reasonable steps in your due diligence, investigation of Mr van 
Wyk? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At that point in time I believe I did. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 188 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  At that point in time you did.  He was a friend 
of yours? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay, you were aware of his background 
based on what he had informed you of? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You trusted him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes he was as I said he was – I dropped my 
guard before he was a friend. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Yes, did you have any reason not to trust him 
10 
Mr Natasen? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No there was nothing that came across that 
would lead me to question that he has done anything wrong. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  No third party said something to you about Mr 
van Wyk and said you’ve got to be careful of this man? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  No, any circumstances that occurred that gave 
rise to any concern whatsoever on your part? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  The fact that he was involved in State 
20 
employment, the fact that he was an employee of the State? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That’s why my concern came about for him to 
give undertakings that it was not money from the State. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That was the only concern you had? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That was the only concern. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 189 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And just again tell us why that was a concern 
of yours? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Obviously if it was State related I would have 
no part of it, so from my perspective he gave undertakings it was 
private, he was wanting to come into farming venture, he was obviously 
wanting to leave S A Express, he told us June 2016 was the date that 
he was going to leave, and that’s what I worked off. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So you had no reason whatsoever to believe 
that there was anything untoward with regards to Mr van Wyk or his 
proposition that he enter into a farming venture with you and that he 
10 
capitalise Neo Solutions for that purpose? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  There was none at the time. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And when I say Neo I mean obviously there 
was going to be an incorporated entity called the Stal that was going to 
be set u for the venture once it materialised as I understood your 
testimony, but until then it was capitalisation. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That’s right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And there was mass confusion about this 
morning about the application of the 300 000 and how it had been dealt 
with in the banking accounts, and let’s just revisit that quickly because 
20 
it really isn’t complicated, so I just want to set the record straight.  You 
had sold the vehicle 1.4million if I recall correctly, was financed and 
the other 300 was paid in cash? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You were sitting with R300 000 in your safe at 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 190 of 236 
 
home, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And that Mr van Wyk had asked for those 
monies to be paid out to him, you had them available, you paid them 
out? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That’s right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Why weren’t you concerned by his request for 
the payment of the R300 000 given the fact that he had, as Ms Hofmeyr 
put it, requested repayments of certain other funds which he had 
received why were you not concerned about the R300 000 cash 
10 
request? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  We had known about his passion for the cars 
and he had indicated previously he was intending to buy a 1984 I recall 
at the time earlier, so I assumed when he called me that he was trying 
to purchase or an equivalent vehicle, so the R300 000 sort of resonated 
in my head, from earlier discussions. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Does it matter whether it was for a vehicle or 
not, if he asked you for R300 000 and you were will to (indistinct) and 
does it matter what the underlying causa was. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No not at all.  He was a friend as well. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I do not believe it does. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So I assumed he was wanting to buy it and he 
would obviously – I was sitting with funds of his anyway that he was 
entitlted to. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Ja I guess the only reason that my learned 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 191 of 236 
 
colleague raised issue with the R300 000 was because it formed part of 
the R9.9 million ultimately. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That flowed into Neo, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  If I did not have the R300 000 I would have 
then said I would EFT another R300 000 and he would have to make a 
plan to purchase the vehicle himself. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Yes. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  But because it was on hand it was given to him. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And because R300 000 was still outstanding to 
him. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Or his nominated entity in respect of the 
repayment of the R9.9? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  And much has been made about the 
overdraft facilities and the fact that – and let me just divert for a 
second the fact that there was a provision and overdraft facility 
20 
contract dealing with the obligation to provide audited financial 
statements we have dealt with that.  You said that the bank never 
asked for it.  It was not the bank’s practice and now we know in terms 
of the relevant legislation that it was not even necessary.  So let us 
leave that aside. And even if the bank had asked for it you could say to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 192 of 236 
 
the bank actually let me qualify no obligation is – no obligation exists 
on me in legislation to provide the audited financial statements.  And 
whilst it might be a provision of this contract I could take legitimate 
issue with it.  Let us just leave that for a second.  I want to go back to 
the overdraft facility.  Much has been made about the R300 000 and 
how Mr Ruben accounted for it in the books of account at Neo Solutions 
and the fact that there is a notation on the banking account that says 
Neo Solution loan.  Let us just delve into that again because it really is 
not complicated but there seems to be mass confusion between loan, 
the word loan, the concept of a liability in the financial sense and the 
10 
concept of a loan account in the financial sense.  Do you understand 
that a loan account is not actually a banking account Mr Natasen? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You understand that. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is a general ledger [indistinct]. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It is actually a financial obligation raised in 
the books of account of the company. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay and that it could either be a debit loan 
account or a credit loan account? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja either two are from the account. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And you understand that the reason that Mr 
Ruben in his wisdom which we now know was actually fraudulent 
conduct in his wisdom decided to apply it in a way he did was because 
in his mind he was accounting for the money that was… 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 193 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He was keeping track of that record. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  He was keeping track and he wanted to make 
sure that whatever money was indebted to Van Wyk or his nominees 
was repaid in full? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So do you – we see any inconsistency 
in the statement and reference to the R300 000, is there anything that 
sparks inconsistency in your mind? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Nothing.  Okay.  Mr Natasen before we leave 
10 
the issue of the R300 000 let us just delve into it a bit further.  Just for 
the sake of my colleague.  Because it was as Mr Lowenthal when we 
get to his affidavit a bit later it was an interest free loan.  This is how it 
was corrected because it was the provision was… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The entire R9.9 million. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Sorry? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  No, no we talking about the – ja we talking – 
sorry we talking about the money that the – the money that was – that 
is still to be paid intended to the relevant party in respect of the benefit 
20 
received.  That was applied as an interest free loan but the reason I 
mention it now is because if we dealing with an overdraft facility, the 
loan accounts, the issue of a loan as a liability.  We are just trying to 
distinguish these concepts so that there is no confusion on the part of 
the commission’s legal team.  But this is how we got back into it Ms 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 194 of 236 
 
Hofmeyr said but she was using the analogy of a loan from the bank. 
And she said but no bank would charge – would give you an interest 
free loan and you conceded that right.  And you said but that was very 
different because that is a liability, that is an actual loan and then I 
actually jumped up and I said well actually it depends on the intention 
with which the monies are advanced and the nature of the monies so 
advanced.  That determines how you deal with it from an accounting 
perspective, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  We will get to Mr Lowenthal’s affidavit 
10 
shortly and I will just take you through those provisions again and we 
will decide what – whether or not the accounting for those monies has 
been done correctly because I know that was in the last part of the 
examination in chief that was a large part of the discrepancy that was 
raised.  So we dealt with the R300 000.  Again the causa for the 
R300 000 really is of no consequence.  Mr Van Wyk asked you for the 
R300 000.  Monies were still due to him and you paid it out of your 
personal funds and …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please, please do not make a speech to the witness 
put questions to the witness. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair I am entitled with all due respect.  I am 
entitled… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not entitled to make a speech. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  No, no, no Mr Chair I am not making a speech 
I am entitled…. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 195 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please put questions to the witness. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair I am entitled to reiterate the evidence 
that was given this morning leading to a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are entitled to… 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  No, no I am entitled to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are entitled to do that – you are entitled to do 
that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I am sorry I disagree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are entitled to do that but … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I disagree with you I am not making a speech.  
10 
Trust me if I make a speech you will know I am not making a speech. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please –okay let us try again.  Continue. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Let us try again Mr Natasen.  Okay I am sorry 
I was reiterating the evidence already given.  I apologise.  Mr Natasen 
the issue of the R300 000 because I really just do not understand the 
issue with the R300 000.  Am I correct in saying that R300 000 was still 
owing to Mr Van Wyk pursuant to the repayment of the R9.9? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Still owing to Van Wyk no. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  After advance of the other monies? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So we had – he had been paid 7 back during 
20 
December so there was still on – in January there was still R2.9. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay so there was still money owing to him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  There was still money yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So when you advanced the R300 000 it 
was your understanding as you said this morning but I will not reiterate 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 196 of 236 
 
this morning’s testimony that money was still owing to him.  You would 
advance it personally from the money that you had in your safe and that 
the company would then account for it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Is there anything untoward regarding a 
transaction of that nature in your? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  in my mind no because the contra entry in the 
books of account went through my shareholder loan account.  So it was 
taken off what was owing to Van Wyk and put it into my side. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I mean I often pay for expenses on behalf of 
10 
my firm and it goes straight to my loan accounts so I do not understand 
the issue with it.  But maybe I am just incorrect.  Mr Natasen the 
accounting of that money at the time was done by whom? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  By … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  The accounting for that money? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was done by Ruben. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  By Ruben and who was Mr Ruben?  Let us just 
understand who exactly he was? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He was the internal accountant at the office. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  He was an accountant? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Was he a contractor or an employee? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He was an employee. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  He was an employee so he was under your 
direct control and supervision? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 197 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Did you direct and control how he 
administered the accounts? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No he was working with the external 
accountants in terms of the chart of accounts, how the trial balance 
was laid out.  Because of previous errors during the SARS process the 
entire chart of accounts for 2015 onwards was to be remapped to be 
able to give effect to better bookkeeping.  So he was working with them 
in terms of putting that together and accounting for the interest. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  But my question to you was – my question to 
10 
you was did he perform his duties under your direct control and 
supervision? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes he reported to me in the company. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  But did you give him instruction on how his 
accounting function should be rendered? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, no. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So you did not tell him R300 000 was 
paid by me in cash to Mr Van Wyk’s driver or to Mr Van Wyk and I want 
you to account for it in the books of account of Neo in the following 
way? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No I said to him please make sure you make a 
note of it so that we do not overpay him from the 9.9 back. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  He must take a note that this R300 000. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So you were not giving specific direction as to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 198 of 236 
 
how accounting entries were made in the books of accounts of Neo? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, no, no. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Mr Natasen the issue of benefit has 
been bandied about backwards and forwards since this inquiry started.  
And I have explained in the simplest of terms why benefit is so 
important to the commission because they can show that you have 
benefitted it would be a use in terms of the Poka legislation if you have 
use of these illicit funds and you knew or you ought to have known that 
they were from an unlawful source then you are immediately guilty of 
an offence, correct? 
10 
 MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
 ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay so a lot has been made about you 
having utilised the funds that you have received and another 
misconception that arose this morning was the fact that because the 
funds were integrated for use of a better word into the overdraft funds 
that the company in effect had use of those funds. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That is the submission that has been made.  
Mr Natasen to be clear on that point we again went back to the 
concepts and which are critical in this issue well of unlawful proceeds 
20 
or unlawful funds, source of funds.  Intention versus nature.  Okay.  Did 
you intend for the funds to be utilised as part of your cash flow? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Did you intend for those funds to 
support the business operations of Neo Solutions? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 199 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Did you intend for the funding to be 
specifically incorporated into the overdraft funds as supposed to being 
ring fenced in a separate account? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Was it your intention to have any use or 
benefit from those funds? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do you – you have conceded to the 
commission’s legal team that and you have conceded it in your most 
10 
recent statements that you in fact did derive benefit from the funds that 
were received? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  And who advised you that you had 
received benefits? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think post the earlier testimony when we saw 
that the discussion of benefit was coming about then we sat with our – 
between our own legal team and obviously the external advisor 
Lowenthal is when we established that there is an inadvertent benefit 
that had been derived.  
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  An indirect benefit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  An indirect benefit. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So in other words it was not intended it was 
something that arose… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was definitely not intended. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 200 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So the funds were received, they were 
meant to be capitalised into the company for the purposes of the 
farming venture, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Into a separate company yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Into a separate company ultimately but initially 
they went into Neo? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  And they were – there was [indistinct] 
with the funds in the overdraft facility, everything was intertwined and 
intermingled and as a result the interest that would have been – would 
10 
have accrued to the overdraft facility... 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That would have been incurred ja. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Was less than it would have been had those 
funds not been intermingled or intertwined with the funds in the 
overdraft facility? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Is my understanding correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And that is the benefit that was derived? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The indirect benfit. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Besides the benefits there was another benefit 
that my learned colleague raised this morning I think regarding 
transactional charges and... 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And a setup fee. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Setup fees that is correct.  Okay but those 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 201 of 236 
 
were all you would agree unintended benefits? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And unintended usage? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  When you – when you took the money from Mr 
Van Wyk did you ever contemplate that you would use those for funding 
the operations of Neo? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  For the transactional charges on the account. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  For any benefit whatsoever to Neo Solutions 
save for the ultimate onward capital investment in Distell and the 
farming operations? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The intention was to move it to Distell for the 
farming. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So in accepting the funds you saw no 
benefit at the time save for the fact that it was an agreement between 
you and Mr Van Wyk that those funds would be paid over? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Let us just deal with – we have got – 
20 
we have – obviously there has been substantive amount of testimony 
regarding how the funds were paid over, the way they were channelled, 
conduit through Koreneka, the repayment to Batsomi it is all a matter of 
record and I do not again want to [indistinct] the commission.  But let 
us just focus quickly on and I am going to get to the repayment of the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 202 of 236 
 
funds because it is quite important.  But let us just focus on again 
before we leave this point behind.  The knowledge you had with regards 
to the source of the funds and the fact that they were illegal you 
testified this morning that during May you had a conversation with Mr 
Van Wyk he had phoned you and… 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  In May 2018. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  May 2018 sorry and you had recorded the 
conversation is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You are entitled to record the conversation in 
10 
terms of the Riga Legislation yes, no. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes I felt I did it was to corroborate that the 
fact that I did not ... 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You were a party to the conversation? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Therefore in terms of Section 5 of the Rika 
legislation you are entitled to record it, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So there is nothing untoward about that.  And 
why did you record it just for the sake of completeness? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I had not engaged with Van Wyk since late or 
mid to late 2017 so – and by then I had already issued the Section 204 
through Judiel so the fact that he called me out of the blue I had just 
landed back in Johannesburg from a trip.  He called me as I was on the 
bus being ferried from the plane to the terminal so I told him I would 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 203 of 236 
 
call him back from the car.  When I got into the car I recorded the 
conversation from my second phone whilst the conversation was on my 
speaker phone. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair we did discuss this morning the 
possibility of playing the recording that Mr Natasen took of his 
conversation with Mr Van Wyk it is critical.  It is critical to whether or 
not Mr Natasen had knowledge of the unlawfulness of the funds or the 
source of the funds.  So if you would indulge me Chair. We have 
already made arrangements with your – with your visual staff to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long is it – duration? 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It is ten minutes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  Ms Hofmeyr you know about it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a full transcript of it in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a transcript? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I understand Mr Pienaar to want to play it 
and I have no objection if he takes ten minutes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no then that is in order. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  There is certain nuances that are lost if one 
just reads the transcription. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It is so much better to actually listen to it. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 204 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – do you propose that we listen to it until it 
finishes or do you propose to stop in between? 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair should we listen until it is finished and 
then maybe take a break? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine.  Ja.  Ja that is fine. 
[RECORDING BEING PLAYED] 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Chair it is five to four. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  If you indulge me for five more minutes I can 
finish this aspect off? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes if you – if you will be able to finish that aspect. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Just a few questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine let us finish that aspect. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen if I go to the transcript of that 
conversation that we have just heard with Mr Van Wyk and yourself 
which appears at VN238.174 and we go to and you will see there is 
paragraph numbering on the side and we go to paragraph 10.  You say: 
20 
Then he said he wanted a statement from me because otherwise they 
were going to charge me.  So I said but ja everything – sorry but I did 
everything cleanly and I was told by you that it was [indistinct] clean.  
Okay so you say that.   
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes I did. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 205 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Again at paragraph on the next page, 
continuation of paragraph 20.  So let us just read from the bottom.  But 
this transaction was not related to SA Express was it? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That is what you say.  Mr Van Wyk responds 
no, no, no, no, no. But let me tell you what the problem is now. Then he 
goes on to say your name might be appearing in an article.  Then again 
at paragraph 20 on the same page.  I thought it was a North West 
project it was not a SA Express Project right?  Mr Van Wyk:  No I do not 
– I do not know what Jan and this woman have cooked up.  So Mr 
10 
Natasen this is evidence in the strongest sense corroborating your 
assertions that at all times you were fully aware the – fully unaware of 
the illegality of these funds that you were receiving from Mr Brian Van 
Wyk that had been routed through Koreneka, correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja he had made obviously before this at the 
time he had made several undertakings that it was definitely not 
government money and this goes back towards – obviously in this 
conversation I had to get him to admit that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Was this a solicited phone call? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No not at all.  He had called me actually. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Was this planned in any way? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Had you discussed the scripting of this 
particular discussion? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Definitely not. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 206 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It does not appear so because it was very poor 
scripting if it is but – so you – he phoned you, you answered the call 
you said I will phone you back.  You recorded the conversation. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Phone you back when I am in the car. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And this is a transcript of what transpired. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And from this transcript it is abundantly 
evident that you had no knowledge of the fact that the source – the 
source of the funds was either SA Express or that the funds had any 
illegal source whatsoever. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Chair I think I am going to leave it 
there and then we can get onto the rest of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay are you able to give some indication of how 
much more time you need? 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  The only other thing I really want to deal with 
Chair is the affidavit of Mr Lowenthal and then very briefly just the two 
affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  By the two employees. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And Mr Natasen but that will be very brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So I would say I am hoping to do it in the next 
hour. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 207 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  Let us take the – an 
adjournment of ten minutes.  We will resume at ten past four.  We 
adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us proceed. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Sorry Chair.  I would just like to refer 
Mr Natasen to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can put on yours as well Mr Natasen, ja. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  I would just like to refer Mr Natasen to the 
affidavit of Howard Andrew Lowenthal (?).  It is VN 2-3-8.2-7-4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which - which bundle again? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Bundle A. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is A. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:   
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is the affidavit bundle.  It is right at the back 
of A. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is EXHIBIT (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  At the back of A, okay.  Yes, thank you. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen you testified earlier that Neo had 
ex post facto the last attendance at the Commission of Inquiry 
appointed Mr Lowenthal.  Just take us through that appointment. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So he was - he is an independent expert that 
was recommended by the legal team.  I have had no interaction with 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 208 of 236 
 
him before.  He is no a friend, an associate in other way.  He is a truly 
independent person that has been brought on-board just to help me 
firstly with the reconstruction and secondly with the mandate around 
accounting for the monies and thirdly relating to the issue of my role as 
a Chartered Accountant in Business. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen much has been made of the fact 
that certain persons with whom you have had dealings with had been 
remunerated for their services such as Mr Judiel for his travel 
expenditure and ancillary expenditure and Mr Lowenthal for the 
production of this expert report.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  What inference do you draw by that line 
of questioning? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I - I assume they are questioning the 
independence of the parties that were involved at this point as 
independent experts. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That is how I understood it as well.  Do you 
believe that Mr Lowenthal is completely independent? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I believe he is. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Do you believe that he is skilled and 
20 
experienced enough to handle the mandate that was given to him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  From the credentials presented to me yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And from your dealings with him? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  From my dealings he has been professional and 
he seems to be getting to the grips of the issues very quickly. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 209 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Is he very knowledgeable … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  He is knowledgeable … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  As an accountant? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  In the reactions I have had he appears 
knowledgeable. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  What was the mandate that was given 
to Mr Lowenthal? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Once again to inter - assist with the 
reconstruction of the books.  We further - initially it was just over the 
years effected by these transactions but we found that in order to 
10 
reconstruct the books we had to go all the way back to the end of 2014 
which is the last SARS audited year and rebuild from then onward.  So 
his - his scope has been increased to cover 2015 - year end 2015/2016 
and 2017. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Did Mr Lowenthal have difficulties in fulfilling 
his mandate? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Not that I am aware of.  Obviously the collation 
of data and securing of documents is obviously an issue but it is part of 
his findings really. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  But what were the real issues there? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Hm. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Just take us through them. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It appears when we - firstly the - in terms of the 
financial records of 2016 they had to be totally rebuilt from scratch 
because Pastel had been overwritten.  So we - we have been 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 210 of 236 
 
recapturing - so what he did at the start of his mandate was he actually 
opened up new Pastel ledgers and then guided the accounting team 
now on the chart of accounts that was to be created as well as the 
capturing process. 
Where there is uncertainty they post to a suspense account 
and then he reviews the suspense account when the documents come 
and then allocates that to the appropriate account in the reconstruction 
process. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen if I can refer you specifically to 
paragraph 
7 
where 
Mr Lowenthal confirms 
his 
mandate 
- 
7.3 
10 
specifically.  It is on page 2 … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Of his affidavit.  You can just read that. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  “To investigate how 9.9 million had 
flown in into two separate tranches of five million 
and 4.9 million on the 11 t h and 12 November from a 
company Koreneka Trading and Projects to Neo 
Solutions Nedbank account and subsequently paid 
out in five tranches four million, three million with 
respective dates and a further 1.4 million and 1.2 
20 
million which paid out in March 2016.” 
He goes on further: 
“To reflect the payments to Batsamai Investment 
Holding were accounted for in the accounting 
records of Neo Solutions and to reallocate such 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 211 of 236 
 
flows if appropriate to correctly nominated ledger 
accounts and to account for them for the further 
fifth tranche being a further R300 000 that was paid 
out in cash according to Mr Natasen to a driver of 
Van Wyk.” 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So besides the fact that he had to 
undertake a reconstruction of Neo’s financials several years backdating 
2018.  In addition to that more specifically he was tasked with an 
inquiry into the receipt of the 9.9 million from Koreneka and how that 
was dealt with in the books of account at Neo and then he as further 
10 
tasked if I understand correctly and you can correct me if any of this is 
wrong. 
He was further tasked with the correction of those entries to 
the extent that they were incorrect.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well we need to create financial records how to 
submit to SARS because obviously those financial years now need to 
be put in.  So that is part of his scope and mandate is to (intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That is part of it but specifically he was asked 
because obviously you were interrogated in … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Examination in chief on the 9.9 and how it was 
accounted for on the books of account at Neo? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay and - and much was made on 12 July of 
the fact that there were various inconsistencies in the financials as 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 212 of 236 
 
well.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And - and you did say on several occasions 
that the - it appeared that the books of account were incorrect? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  The financials were incorrect? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct.  Especially around the donation. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR: 
 
Especially 
around 
the 
donations 
and 
notwithstanding our vociferous pleas that no further examination should 
take place on the financials the inquiry continued.  Did it not? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay and it was for that reason that you felt it 
incumbent to appoint Mr Lowenthal to attend to the reconstruction, the 
identification of the various source documents, the application of those 
source documents to the - the books of prime entry, the reconciliations 
that were needed, the adjustments that may have been needed etcetera 
to bring the books of account into - into order? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Do you think he fulfilled his mandate? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well the reconstruction is still underway but in 
20 
terms of accounting for the monies he has done that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  He has done that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And where he says it is mostly accurate would 
you agree with that submission by him? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 213 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And how do you understand mostly accurate? 
What is your understanding?  I know you have dealt with this before 
today but if I can just get you to revisit that. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well my understanding is that specifically on 
the - on the flow of monies those are accurately recorded now but in 
terms of obviously the 300 000 he has relied on my representation that 
he was paid. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay but he can - he can - he does not have 
actual proof that it was paid because it was a cash transaction … 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  But he relies on the fact that you … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is my assertion. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Ja, your assertion.  You paid those monies 
back … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And he is posted the journal according to … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And they post - he has posted the journal into 
the Neo accounts.  Okay.  Just on that score let us jump forward and go 
to the relevant paragraph where he deals with the application of the 
300 000.  My apologies.  I am just struggling to find it.  This clean copy 
20 
was given to me by my legal team and I had scratched and marked on 
mine. 
I am now struggling to find the provision - specific provision.  
Anyway I can - I can from memory put to you that the way it was dealt 
with that it was dealt with as an interest loan in the loan account of - of 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 214 of 236 
 
yourself and Neo Solutions (intervenes). 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Is it Clause 14 (intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  You are looking for Clause 14? 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Is it 14? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  His findings relating to the money. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Yes, sorry.  You are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  That is - Chair that is page 6 of 11 and it is 
paragraph 14. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  2-3-8.2-7-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That is paginated page 2-3-8.2-7.9? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It says: 
“Accordingly I instructed the accounting staff of Neo 
Solutions to reflect the monies being the 9.9 funds 
held on interest free loan account from Van Wyk 
and being recorded as a liability in the loan ledger 
20 
account due to the fact that the monies do not 
belong to Neo Solutions.” 
So what Mr Lowenthal was doing there he was accounting for 
the 9.9 in the books of account of Neo Solutions because if I 
understand correctly and just correct me if I am wrong please when the 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 215 of 236 
 
monies were capitalised into Neo which were intended for the 
(indistinct) ultimately and the - and the capitalisation of that company 
for the purposes of the farming venture. 
It was not properly recorded in the books of account of Neo is 
that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It was posted to my shareholder loan account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And you understand why that is wrong and that 
is … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  At least something that you raised on the 12 t h.  
You said you were not sure why it had been posted to your loan 
account. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR: 
 
Okay 
but 
now 
we 
understand 
that 
Mr Lowenthal is an independent Chartered Accountant has assessed 
the books of account.  He has assessed that particular receipting of 
funds.  He has looked at the intent of those funds - sorry the intent with 
which those funds were paid over as well as the nature of those funds 
and he is concluded that the application of those funds should be dealt 
20 
with in the following way. 
Namely interest free loan account and recorders liability in 
the loan ledger.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  You also testified on the 12 t h and in all 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 216 of 236 
 
your statements and I want to deal with this in an allegation of 
inconsistency as well that you received no - Neo Solutions received 
absolutely no benefit whatsoever from the receipt of those - those 
funds from Mr Van Wyk which were conduited through Koreneka. 
In retrospect given that your testimony was that you had 
received no benefit.  Is that still correct?  That submission. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well we - we obviously now have found that 
there was an indirect benefit through the interest saving against the 
overdraft.  So that is the response where we have now tendered to 
obviously pay such interest back to the affected state institution. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So once - once you are told who that 
money should be paid back to you are willing to pay that money back? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And once that money has paid back do you 
believe that you have received any benefit of any nature whatsoever 
save for maybe charges on the account that were unintended.  Do you 
believe that you have received any benefit? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  None whatsoever? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is even stated in the recording we did not 
20 
dispute. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That we did not benefit. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So if you have received no benefit and 
you were not aware of the unlawful source of the funds why would you 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 217 of 236 
 
have participated in this transaction in the first place? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The intention was to go into business and the 
farming venture specifically.  So we only participated to - to the extent 
that this was his share of the monies to come into - invest into the 
farming venture. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Right and the farming venture was a real 
transaction? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  There is - there is business plans.  There 
is an email emanating from him where he reviewed the business plans. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct.  Can we (intervenes)? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  So he was directly - I was not even on the 
project specifically myself.  He worked with that - with Villa and the rest 
of the team in developing that business plan to give effect to the 
company. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Correct and there is a record which we have 
given the Commission of all the - all the documentation surrounding the 
farming venture? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct.  The marketing valuations, the 
business plans and so on have been submitted as part of the 
(intervenes). 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So this was a legitimate venture that 
existed.  This was not a fabrication of your imagination.  This was a 
legitimate venture. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR: 
 
That 
you 
intended 
investing 
in 
with 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 218 of 236 
 
Mr Van Wyk? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And the 9.9 was his financial contribution to 
that transaction? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well - well it was 10 million each that had to go 
(intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Initially but there would have been more - 
there would have been more (intervenes). 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Then there was the loan to be secured yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Mr Natasen in furtherance of the legitimacy of 
10 
that transaction.  I am going to refer you to the affidavits of 
Kumla (?) Caddesi (?) and Jerome Jones are two employees that work 
for you.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  What capacity are they employed in? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Kumla is my P - personal assistant and Jerome 
is in the accounting unit. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And how long have they worked for you 
respectively? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Kumla since - I think - 2006 or seven.  Jerome 
20 
since 2011. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay and they salaried employees? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Mr Natasen tell me in their affidavits - I 
do not want to sit and read the whole affidavit but effectively they 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 219 of 236 
 
mention the farming business transaction and they mention that they 
have various interactions with Mr Van Wyk around that transaction. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes that is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think Chair just to give context.  I am very 
rarely at the office.  I am normally out in the field on projects.  So the 
interactions between Van Wyk, the accounting unit, the team on hand if 
he needed a vehicle to go and inspect the farm and so he would get it 
issued from the company and they would just get approval for it in 
accordance with our policy. 
10 
So a lot of the interaction on the day to day basis if he was in 
the office it would have been via the personnel that was on hand. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And you asked them to confirm by way of 
deposing two affidavits in respect of those interactions? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct, yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So is there any reason for these two 
employees to lie? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No not at all. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Any reason for them to fabricate the whole 
transaction or the farming venture and Mr Van Wyk’s investment and 
20 
…? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No not at all. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So I mean for all intents and purposes 
Mr Natasen this was a legitimate transaction that you intended 
investing in and Mr Van Wyk indicated that he had some interest.  That 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 220 of 236 
 
he would like to invest as well and that he had funds that were due to 
him from some or other transaction which you skirtingly inquired. 
You asked as many questions as you thought were relevant 
and necessary in the circumstances and he then paid that money over 
as you understood as part of him investing in this transaction with you.  
Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay and that is what your staff believed.  
That is what you believed.  Okay.  That is what the documentation 
shows. 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  All the documentation supports that.  Okay.  
So there is no reason to believe that this was as is the case in many 
corrupt 
activities 
involving 
money 
laundering, 
corruption, 
maladministration, utilising state funds, state capture.  Most of those 
transactions entities and businesses are set up as a front.  Okay.  Is 
that one of these cases? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Definitely not and I did indicate in - on - in my 
previous testimony I also took comfort from the fact that he did not ask 
for the money back straightaway.  There was a full month that lapsed 
20 
before he requested the funds for and it sounded like a genuine thing.  
He had mentioned to me previously that he was trying to secure a 
property in Blue Valley and this - when he mentioned that he wanted 
the funds for that. 
I did not see anything wrong with it but from what we have 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 221 of 236 
 
seen so far even on the Koreneka transactions the money flows 
happened almost immediately to other conduits and it was given back 
to him as quickly as possible.  This was not the case with us. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Let us just leave that point for the 
moment and just quickly go to paragraph 15 and we - there is a 
discussion in Mr Lowenthal’s affidavit or the content in that affidavit 
dealing with Ruben who was as you have testified.  He was your 
internal accountant.  He was a salaried employee. 
He was tasked with the handling of the internal accounts 
under your overall direction and control but that you would not advise 
10 
him as to how the specific accounting entries would take place.  Is that 
correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You gave him control of the accounts and he 
would oversee your accounts staff.  Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right because I was rarely in the office 
he would - he would manage of them. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Mr Lowenthal at paragraph 15 says: 
“Further to the above during the reconstruction of 
the accounting records and perusal of the source 
20 
documentation of Neo Solutions it came to my 
attention 
that 
Ruben 
had 
apparently 
misappropriated funds belong to Neo Solutions 
which the bookkeeper of Neo Solutions and myself 
calculated it to be in the amount of approximately 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 222 of 236 
 
R746 689-and some cents.” 
Is that correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  This the current number.  Chair we 
identified this from where he had altered the beneficiary payee details 
to his own bank account.  So the report that came from the bank was all 
payments made to that specific bank account because it is difficult in 
the standard reporting system we have to be able to draw out the 
payee. 
It is only listed as the payee details but not the actual bank 
account.  So there was a special report that came from the bank where 
10 
we identified so far these.  We are still now searching for where he has 
altered or could have altered to pay to other beneficiary bank account 
details.  That might then increase this number. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Ja.  Mr Natasen it is not unsurprising then that 
the accounts were in a state of disarray. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes, yes.  I think from what we see now 
(intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do - do you suspect that Mr Ruben had 
manipulated the accounts in order to potentially hide his fraud? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think from - from looking at the accounting 
20 
records and the lack or the missing documents that are there we have 
clearly been sabotaged by him to cover up all these - these 
misappropriations. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do you intend taking legal action against 
Mr Ruben? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 223 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  We - we obviously have got this document 
with all - with all the direct ones where he has changed it himself.  As 
we identify more - but we are obviously instituting a - a criminal case 
now. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Ja.  23 and 24 of Mr Lowenthal’s affidavit very 
quickly. 
“In light of the fact that Neo Solutions is a private 
company the unaudited annual financial statements 
are drafted mainly for the attention and use of the 
sole Director and sole shareholder both Mr Natasen 
10 
and are not intended to be relied upon by third 
parties such as creditors.  Accordingly the annual 
financial statements are not audited and are 
compiled 
and 
used 
to 
reflect 
the 
inaccurate 
financial position and result of operations of Neo 
Solutions internally periodically.” 
Much was made again of the fact that you had signed the 
financial statements and that you were a Chartered Accountant in 
Business and how could you have signed them without knowing 
unequivocally that every figure stated in those financials - financial 
20 
statements were correct.  Correct? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct, yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  You said you relied on Mannie as the accounts 
firm that you had appointed for the production of these accounting 
statements.  Correct? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 224 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is right. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  What was your mandate to Mannie? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  The mandate as I said had - it had been raised 
on what happened with the SARS process on the ADR where he had 
given me undertakings that he would be the watchdog of ensuring that 
the books are correct going forward especially with regard to further 
SARS submissions in the new financial years. 
So clearly in the way he is now put his affidavit together he is 
now reneging on that - on that responsibility he took on.  So it was far 
more than just taking the numbers that Eugene or Ruben had given him 
10 
and just putting it into a set of financials. He was to interrogate the 
books much deeper than that and he did not do that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And he did not do that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  And he did not do that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So he - Mannie actually breached its mandate 
to Neo? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Evidence has been led regarding the 
affidavits filed or the statements filed by Mr Patel on behalf of Mannie 
dealing with the Annexure G which is your text message.  We have 
20 
dealt with that this morning.  I do not intend revisiting it.  I think you 
gave it the necessary context and interpretation which was required but 
the fact remains that Mannie breached their mandate to Neo. 
Then at the 11 t h hour after receiving a summons from the 
Commission which terminated their mandate.  Is that correct? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 225 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Did they give you reasons for 
terminating the mandate? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  No.  Did they engage with you in potentially 
reinvigorating the relationship and coming to your assistance to rectify 
the - the issues? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  They did try.  They currently perform for other 
mandates for other entities that I am a shareholder and Director of.  So 
they approached us via the - that entity to ask if they could obviously 
10 
guide us in terms of responding and they undertook then to give a 
confirmatory affidavit to us to support what exactly transpired at the 
meeting when we met on 10 July and they renegade on that 
commitment literally this week. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So do I understand correctly that if they got 
further work through Neo or its … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think they were concerned that they would 
obviously lose their … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Lose the … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Appointments at the other which is significant 
20 
revenue to them (intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And on what basis …? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Terminating on one they would have to 
terminate on all. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And on that basis they were trying to 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 226 of 236 
 
backpedal … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And come to the party? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  That - that does not sound like a 
professional organisation.  That sounds like a - a firm of accountants 
that have breached their mandate and are only concerned about the 
financial 
implications 
to 
themselves 
as 
opposed 
to 
financial 
implications to Neo. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do you see an issue with that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  They obviously now - it is - it is clearly 
indicating that they backtracked then and they have realised they made 
a mistake.  Now they are not sure where they stand but obviously all 
the appointments with us or any entity I am associated with would be 
terminated. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Just to clarify the issue of the signature 
on the financial statements.  So those financials despite what my 
learned colleague has - tried to assert are only meant for internal 
purposes.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  They were not submitted to SARS? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  These financials definitely not.  The last with 
SARS is 2014. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Were any submitted to any third parties? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 227 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Not that I am aware of. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Was that ever the intention? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No, no. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  So they were for internal purposes 
more than anything else? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  (Intervenes). 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  (Intervenes) the banks had an obligation or 
there is a contractual requirement there.  The banks get a schedule 
from us and that schedule shows all our incoming revenue per project 
10 
and they actually rely on that in terms of our overdraft facilities and 
that goes to them monthly. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Is there any aspect of Mr Lowenthal’s affidavit 
which you disagree with? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  No. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do you think the steps that Mr Lowenthal has 
taken in the reconstruction of the financials - in your opinion either as 
a lay person in business alternatively as a Chartered Accountant - you 
think the steps are reasonable? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do you think they are the correct steps that 
had to be taken? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  I think they keep us focused on ensuring that 
the transactions are being posted correctly … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Hm. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 228 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  For those periods. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Yes.  Were - were the steps explained to you 
before they were taken?  Did Mr Lowenthal say I - this is what I believe 
the issue is, this is what I think the solution is? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Ja.  He clarified his scope before … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  He clarified? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At the start of his appointment. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  So but - but for the main issues that needed to 
be rectified he explained what - what form that rectification would take? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And why it was necessary and you agreed with 
that? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  I am not going to get into the 
independent Chartered Accountant in Business issue again because I 
just do not think it warrants any further dealing or attention with.  
Mr Natasen before I end off - oh.  Do you believe Mannie - Mannie 
Financial Solutions … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Financial Services. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Sorry.  Financial Solutions, ja Mannie 
20 
Financial Solutions.  That is how it is … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Oh. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It is termed.  Do you believe that they were 
negligent in giving effect to their mandate? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  My understanding from that when they 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 229 of 236 
 
approached me with their interaction now and the confirmatory was they 
relied on an Excel spreadsheet from Ruben in order to compile the 
financials and that does not make sense to me because that was 
definitely not their mandate or the agreement and undertaking that they 
had given me. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And they were being remunerated for those 
services? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  They were being remunerated for that. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Before I end off and I am almost there, 
thank you Chair.  I would just like to ask you some questions generally 
10 
regarding this inquiry and I would like to know what your subjective 
opinion is.  I am not asking you in your capacity as Director of Neo, 
shareholder, Chartered Accountant.  I am just saying subjectively what 
is your opinion? 
Why do you believe that Ms Tlatsana implicated you in this 
transaction given the recording that we have heard - your discussion 
with Mr Van Wyk, given the fact that the farming venture was a 
legitimate transaction, given the fact that you were unaware of the 
source - the illegality of the source of the funds. 
Given that the money was repaid in full and that you have 
20 
tendered any benefit that you have received.  Why do you think you 
specifically - I know there were other people - why do you think you 
specifically were implicated by Ms Tlatsana? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well we - we received the funds.  So by virtue 
of us receiving those funds from Koreneka we were implicate.  However 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 230 of 236 
 
we were the one party. So if Koreneka has received 51 million which is 
Ms Tlatsana’s testimony.  We received 9.9 of that but through Judiel 
she was already in possession of the fact that the 9.9 had been paid 
back. 
Yes, bar the 300 000 issue but it was paid to Batsamai and 
they had already confirmed that Batsamai was Brian Van Wyk’s partner.  
So we were the one entity that had already cooperated to showing that 
the funds received had been returned to Van Wyk.  Where the 
remaining parties the 28 million or so that she is sitting with has not 
been accounted for it. 
10 
The nine million was literally laundered into cash and 
delivered by SPV to Brian’s doorstep.  The other parties no mention 
has been made of where those funds have been - gone and to me I 
cannot understand why as an entity that has proven at the start when 
the Commission started with us we had given them the audio recording 
which confirmed that I was unaware of the source of funds. 
So to me two days of the Commission’s time has been spent 
on trying to prove I am not a good accountant as opposed to actually 
getting to the crux of where these funds have really gone from a state 
capture perspective.  So I - I fail to understand why so much effort is 
20 
trying to prove whether I reasonably ought to have known when I can 
prove that I did not know and I acted on the basis that these funds 
came from a dividend source that was going to be utilised in a venture 
with us. 
There has been no cover up from my side.  This is valid 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 231 of 236 
 
monies that - at the time I thought it was valid monies and I was going 
into business with Van Wyk.  I was not trying to mislead or hide or do 
anything untoward with these funds.  When he started drawing his 
money back we had given him back. 
So yes there was an indirect benefit derived by us having 
held those funds which we are now tendering to say we will reimburse 
the state for those that we have enjoyed the benefit of but there has 
been no intention or knowledge that the funds were not - that they not 
from a reputable source when we got them. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Did you say Ms Tlatsana still has 20 …? 
10 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Yes.  From what I recall it is in the region of 28 
million that she is … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  28 million … 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  At the point where she sees the called back 
there was - there should have been 28 million somewhat from the 
testimony and the recon that is there.  There is 28 million still 
unaccounted for by herself. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Do you think that the fact that she was a 
willing participant the fact that she ought - she ought to have known 
better given the nature of the transaction that she was dealing with and 
20 
the fact that there - there are monies that she still has in anyway is 
connected or correlated with the fact that she has now left the 
Republic? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well I mean I cannot speculate on that.  All I 
can say is that … 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 232 of 236 
 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  (Intervenes). 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  It is a matter of record that 28 million is still 
unaccounted for and she has refused to account on it and I am being 
called to account on whether I am a good accountant or not. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And as far as you are aware has Mr Van Wyk 
being subpoenaed or summoned to this inquiry? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  As far as I am aware - well I do not know of any 
knowledge of that.  So I am assuming not yet. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Okay.  Do you believe he should be here? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  Well through my - my evidence and Tlatsana’s 
10 
evidence he has been implicated.  So I think he should be here to 
account for his side … 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Ja. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:  As to what he has done with the money 
(intervenes). 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  He is the common denominator so to speak. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Why do you think the Commission has focused 
so vigorously on your testimony, why do you think ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that’s not re-examination. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  It is, I need to ask ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that doesn’t really arise from anything that was 
led earlier on. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  But Chair I don’t understand it myself and 
...(intervention)  
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 233 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but re-examination as we both know is there to 
clarify evidence that has been dealt with earlier. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  As the Chair pleases.  Do you still wish to 
cross-examine Ms Tlatsana, if given the opportunity.  
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  If we returns to the Republic. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Correct. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And if the Commission obviously  allows for it. 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And what do you want to examine her on, what 
10 
specifically do you want to ask Ms Tlatsana? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Well specifically how she accounted for the 
transaction, I have been asked to account right down to my financial 
statements as to how the transactions were accounted for in my books, 
so we need to deal with how it was accounted for on her side, whether 
she had ever interacted with me at any point in time during the flow of 
funds, because I had never met or spoken or didn’t know of her 
existence at any point until Yudeel brought it to my attention in October 
of 2017, so it’s obviously to confirm that I was not complicit or party to 
any of the State Capture  that occurred here. 
20 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Did you read the transcription of Ms Tlatsana’s 
evidence? 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Yes. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Was she interrogated on her financial 
standing, her financials of Koroneka? 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 234 of 236 
 
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Not that I can see no. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  One moment Chair.  Chair I think I am going to 
leave it there, thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  Thank you for your indulgence, I apologise if I 
pushed the envelope in terms of the questions that I was asking and 
leading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no thank you. 
ADV ANDRE PIENAAR:  And I apologise if I may have unintendedly 
cast my esteemed colleague in bad light, it is not my intention and I 
10 
apologise, and I am going to leave it there.  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair, if I may just one or two 
concluding aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there is in our submission a fundamental 
reason why lawyers representing their clients do not ask leading 
questions of their clients when they examine them.  There is also a 
fundamental reason why lawyers do not generally speak to their clients 
after they are called and before they are re-examined.  The Chair the 
20 
underlying reason is because it diminishes the  credibility of the 
witness’s evidence and the reason for that is because the adjudicator 
or decision maker is then not left with clarity as to whether the answers 
given by the witness are the witnesses answers or they are the 
sculpted answers of a lawyer. 
29 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 152 
 
Page 235 of 236 
 
 
Chair at the commencement of Mr Pienaar’s questions I raised 
the concern about the leading questions.  I raised it simply because it 
is not simply that it is a rule of ethics, it is because it undermines the 
evidence of the witness and I draw it to your attention Chair because in 
due course we will submit to you that you should take that impact of the 
type of questioning and the type of engagement into account when you 
weigh Mr Natasen’s evidence today. 
 
Thank you Chair. 
 
Chair one last thing, just Mr Natasen recently gave evidence 
about Ms Katslana refusing to submit an account of her financials, 
10 
Chair you will recall in her evidence she undertook to do so and in the 
explanation I gave this morning, the evidence of her attorney, which I 
read out to the hearing indicated that she had appointed an auditor to 
do so, so it is not clear to me where Mr Natasen obtained the 
information that she had refused to account for those funds.  It was a 
matter that we did ask her and you specifically indicated you would 
want after her testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, thank you.  Thank you very much Mr 
20 
Natasen we have come to the end of your evidence, should a need 
arise in the future and I don’t know if it will arise for the Commission to 
request you to come back you will be requested but for now you are 
excused.   
MR VIVIEN NATASEN:   Thank you Chair.
