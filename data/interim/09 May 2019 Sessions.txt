PROCEEDINGS ON 9 MAY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are ready to proceed.  Mr Chair the 
next witness that we will be calling is Mr Peter Volmink from Transnet.  
In order to meaningfully canvass the issues arising from his testimony 
Chair we will be referring  to four arch lever files and a supplementary 
statement which is contained in a separate folder.  You will see Chair 
that we have taken the liberty of marking those files as Exhibit BB2.1A 
10 
that will be the first file and the second file is Exhibit BB2.1B a nd the 
third file is marked Exhibit BB2.1C, the fourth file it is marked Exhibit 
BB2.1D.  There must be a separate folder Chair it is a supplementary 
witness statement contained in a separate blue folder.  That will be the 
supplementary witness statement o f Mr Volmink.  In his supplementary 
statement all that he does is to correct some of the errors that he 
picked up in his original statement and he is also including a few 
annexures which he inadvertently omitted in the first witness statement.  
It does not change any complexion of any other contents of the 
statement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Those files or lever arch files that you 
have indicated will be marked Exhibits BB2.1A, BB2.1B, BB2.1C, 
BB2.1D respectively. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the separate file will be marked Exhibit BB?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91

ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  2.2 
CHAIRPERSON:  2.2. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair the evidence of Mr Volmink set the 
scene for the evidence which will be led in this stream when we are 
focussing our attention on the issues relevant to Transnet.  He will 
educate us about the procurement structures and procedures within 
Transnet.  He will also assist us to understand the delegations of 
authority and the role of a unit called governance function which is 
10 
critical in the supply chain management of Transnet.  He will then 
comment of specific transactions which might have been eluded to by 
the Chairperson and also by Mr Pretorius during his op ening.  He will 
give flesh to those specific transaction and comment on those 
transactions.  Even though Chair his evidence will be mainly focussing 
on the procurement structures and procedures it is so fundamental 
because it dovetails with the evidence of  other witnesses who are going 
to be called to testify on the specific transactions.  It will be at that 
point when we now understand the importance of his evidence and to 
appreciate how the prescripts pertaining to procurement were either 
20 
undermined, abused or not attended to Mr Chair.  Mr Chair in as far as 
the evidence of Mr Volmink implicates persons we have complied with 
the Rule 3.3. Notices.  We have Mr – we have Advocate Brown SC and 
Mr Ngubane who are in attendance on behalf of one of the implicate d 
party Mr Tau Morwe.  Maybe I should afford them an opportunity to 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91

ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now before we canvas your 
evidence in any details could you please tell us y our qualifications? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I hold the – the degrees are

09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 10 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And before you joined Transnet what did 
you do? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Before I joined Transnet I – I was a 
Deputy Director of Public Prosecution in the Asset Forfeiture Unit and 
later I became the Regional – one of the Regional Heads of the Asset 
Forfeiture Unit. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And when did you join Transnet?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I joined Transnet in 2007 ori ginally 
as General Manager for Legal Services.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now could you please share with us your 
10 
employment history within Transnet itself?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair as I have indicated I started 
out as the General Manager of Legal Se rvices based at the corporate 
centre in Johannesburg.  After a while I developed quite a strong 
interest in procurement law specifically and that then led me to join the 
supply chain management unit firstly as a legal specialist in the area of 
procurement law and secondly as executive manager Governance and I 
still hold that position. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now in your current position what are 
your responsibilities and functions?  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that Mr Volmink you said your current 
position is executive manager Governance, is that right?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Executive Manager Governance?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Governance yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 11 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And your functions  in that capacity? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  There are broadly four functions, four 
areas that the Governance function has to address.  I am required to 
manage of course the function overall.  The four functions that I have 
referred to are basically polic ies and procedures, secondly providing 
transactional advice, thirdly training and development and fourthly 
compliance and monitoring. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And we will deal with them in much 
more full details in due course.  Now in order for us to  appreciate you 
10 
know the structures of procurement structures within Transnet you have 
also prepared a presentation, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair that presentation is contained for 
your reference from the same exhibit that you are dealing with it starts 
from page 95.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Volmink you will see the document 
that I have referred the Chair to as page 95 could you please simply 
identify it for the record? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair this is a presentation dealing 
with the evolution of Transnet’s procurement processes.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now could you please turn to slide 
number 1.  Chair for the purposes it would be on page 97.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page number? 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 12 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  97. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You can take us also through the – that 
slide number 1. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair this deals with the contents of 
the presentation and it in dicates that I will be addressing the 
Regulatory Framework applicable to supply chain.  Secondly what are 
the key governance check points in the supply chain management 
process within Transnet?  Thirdly the structure of what is referred to as 
the PPM which is an abbreviation for Procurement Procedures Manual.  
10 
The next point will deal with Transnet’s evaluation methodology from 
2012 to present.  The next bullet point relates to current remedial plans 
that are underway.  Then there is a bullet point dealing with 
recommendations for process control improvements and finally there is 
a list of various acronyms and abbreviations that appear in the 
presentation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Can you then turn to slide number 
3 it is on page 99 Chair?  And if you may Mr Volmink then take us 
through what is on slide number 3?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Thank you Chair.  What this slide 
20 
depicts is a pyramid which shows the various regulatory requirements.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Can I request that slide number  3 
be shown?  Yes proceed. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It shows a pyramid Chair of the 
various regulatory requirements which impacts supply chain and these 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 13 of 208 
 
are all the requirements which Transnet as a state owned company and 
as an organ of state needs to ad here to.  Right at the apex of the 
pyramid is Section 217 of course of the Constitution.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I mention Section 217 but of course 
that is not the only provision in the constitution which impacts 
procurement Section 33 dealing with just administrative action.  Section 
195 dealing with the broad values which are to animate the 
administration that is also of course covered.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Then the next layer Chair dea ls with 
the various pieces of primary legislation which impacts supply chain as 
well.  Most notably of course the PFMA Public Finance Management 
Act, the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, PAJA 
Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, PAYA and various other 
primary pieces of legislation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And all of them they are central in the 
procurement policies of Transnet and they must be adhered to, am I 
correct? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The next layer then depicts various 
pieces of secondary legislation.  There are various national treasury 
regulations which must be adhered to.  Various PPPFA regulations, 
standards for uniformity.  Various national treasury instructions which 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 14 of 208 
 
have been issued and all of these must be adhered to.  The next layer 
then depicts various policies and guidelines which are issued by 
various government entities from time to time.  Most notably the 
national treasury’s own imple mentation guides. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR 
PETER 
STEPHEN 
VOLMINK : 
 
The 
competitive 
supplier 
development 
programme 
issued 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Public 
Enterprises.  The black industrialist’s policy, new growth path and 
various other pieces of legisla tion which must be taken into account.  
Then the layer at the bottom reflects Transnet’s own internal policies 
10 
and procedures because all of these rules have to be captured Chair in 
a set of policies and procedures which are implementable and can be 
applied on a day to day basis in our various transactions.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now when we interrogate specific 
transactions later on definitely one would want to see whether in the 
procurement of services and goods whether this pyramid that you are 
setting out here whether those levels of prescripts were adhered to or 
not. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now can you please turn to slide 5 
20 
because … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair before we turn to slide 5 co uld 
I just mention one other thing. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  On this slide and it is about what this 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 15 of 208 
 
framework seeks to achieve. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And Chair what – what the framework 
seeks to achieve is to give effect to a constitutional vision as to how 
procurement was – is supposed to be done in this country.  And starting 
from Section 217 I think that there are two critical principles in 217 
which I think I just need to mention if y ou would permit me? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, yes proceed. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The first relates to fair treatment and 
cost effectiveness and other related principles.  And the second deals 
10 
with preferencing and other measures designed to promot e historically 
disadvantaged individuals.  And those two principles are quite 
fundamental because my reading of the provision is that there is no 
contradiction in the constitution between a system that respects the 
rule of law, that promotes fair treatment  of bidders and integrity in the 
process on the one hand and a system that is designed to promote 
social and economic inclusion on the other.  Of course the other points 
that are mentioned there is also quite important they – the framework 
requires us to drive greater fiscal discipline, to promote legality and to 
apply objectivity and uniformity in our decision making.  I thought I 
20 
should perhaps just mention some of those items.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes that is key.  Now we can turn to 
slide number 4.  In slide number 4 Mr Volmink even though you have 
identified those relevant pieces of legislation on slide number 3 you 
then deal with the key challenges.  Can you please take us through 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 16 of 208 
 
them? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair what I…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Mokoena.  I am sorry Mr 
Volmink.  The one we have dealt with was that slide number 3?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  3 yes now we are going to slide number 
4 which is on page 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh did you do 1 And 2 or not really? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there is – they are there.  1 and 2?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Slides 1 and 2 is it…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We – the – they depict nothing of 
significance Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  For instance… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you go to slide number 2 you will just 
find a beautiful train. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Carrying nothing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  I think the problem was I was trying 
to see whether on my pages there is a reference to slide number 3 of 2 
so it is – is slide number 4 the one immediately after the one we have 
just dealt with? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair.  What we will do also during 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 17 of 208 
 
the adjournment we will try to at least not only rely on the numbers as 
per pagination but also to indicate the slide number.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You will see that the slide number has 
been – just been written over by the you k now the paginated number 
there.  There is a number but you will not see it, it is in red.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja and it does not say it is [indistinct].  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It does not – exactly.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But what we will do we will just make 
10 
sure that we depict them correctly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja that will help with the reference.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And that we can be able to trace them 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay so slide number 4 – we are not at slide 
number 4? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Slide number 4 Chair  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  At 100? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is exactly – on page 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As I mentioned the slide number I will 
also carry with me and mention the relevant page number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja that will help ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 18 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So you were just about to deal with the 
key challenges as you identified them from slide number 4.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair.  You will see that it is 
the same pyramid that is displayed on slide 4 but it focusses now on 
some of the key challenges which the regulatory framework poses and I 
mention a few in the – in the block on the right hand sid e.  Chair the 
first challenge is that of fragmentation.  That there is not one single 
piece of legislation governing procurement in South Africa.  There is a 
report which I think Treasury brought out in 2015 that identified at least 
80 pieces of legislatio n governing procurement.  So I think the first 
10 
difficulty is that one has to trawl through various pieces of legislation 
to get a comprehensive picture and a proper understanding of what the 
regulatory requirements are meant to be.  The second challenge – sorry 
before I move onto the second challenge Chair I think that there has 
been mention made of a procurement bill which is to be passed and it is 
meant to somehow synchronise and unify the procurement regime but I 
think it was first mentioned in 2015 but there is no sight of the 
procurement bill as yet.  The second challenge Chair relates to – to 
misalignment particularly between police expectations and what the 
legislation requires.  So I have indicated that there are various policies 
20 
which should require us to take measures to advance historically 
disadvantaged individuals and promote social inclusion and economic 
inclusion.  But that must be done in accordance with a regulatory 
framework.  And one of our – one of the challenges is that the 
regulatory framework does not enable the effective application of some 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 19 of 208 
 
of the policies which have been issued.  The third challenge Chair 
relates to the mandatory nature of the – of the system.  It allows for 
almost little to no discretion.  I think the underlying inten t is to 
introduce a system where discretion is kept to a minimum for fear that 
discretion is very often abused in the supply chain framework.  But 
even a system that allows for little or no discretion can itself be abused 
where we find that suppliers can b e eliminated for sometimes 
immaterial non-compliance of some or other provision that has been set 
out in the – in the various procurement documents.  Chair I also 
mention ambiguity.  The fact that the rules are not well written in many 
10 
instances that they are sometimes quite opaque that one has to engage 
with the authors of the rule and sometimes you get more than one 
interpretation from the authors of the rules.  And I also mention that the 
– the procurement environment has a strong punitive character wher e 
any misstep can often result in – well it does result in irregular 
expenditure and of course disciplinary processes that goes with that.  
Now here is no difficulty with taking strenuous measures against people 
who abuse the – the system but the – the atmosphere – the punitive 
atmosphere is something that I am quite concerned about because it is 
creating an environment where people are reluctant firstly to join the 
20 
supply chain community and secondly to take decisions.  One finds an 
avoidance of decision making an avoidance of responsibility and I am 
concerned about the – the impact operationally that this growing 
climate of fear is creating within the organs of state.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  I am sure Mr Volmink that the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 20 of 208 
 
Chair when he formulates his  recommendations he will definitely take 
cognisance of these challenges and see how best they can be tailored 
in order to ensure that procurement rules are synchronised in the 
manner that you have actually articulated.  May I then refer you …?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you proceed Mr  Mokoena of course it is 
very important that he legislative framework be clear …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as far as possible certain so that everybody 
knows what falls outside the framework – legislative framework and 
policies and what fall – what falls within because then if you have that 
10 
kind of certainty then nobody can say I did not know.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everyone who does something that falls foul of the 
legislation or the pr escripts knows that they are doing something that is 
in breach of the law.  Of course you always have this tension between 
certainty and flexibility because if you have certainty you are likely to 
have a certain amount of rigidity and – and sometimes that maybe – 
that maybe fair but sometimes it may produce unfair results that rigidity 
and then you want fairness on the other side.  Now fairness cannot 
work with rigidity. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Fairness needs to take into account differe nt 
circumstances for different cases and I guess that with any legislation 
relate and policies relating to procurement those issues are always 
here but there can be no doubt that there should as far as possible no 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 21 of 208 
 
be 80 pieces of legislation dealing with t his – with the same subject.  
So probably there is a need to try and bring it down.  I do not know if it 
can be one piece of legislation.  Probably not maybe two or three but 
80 is certainly too much too many.  So – so all of those things would be 
– would need to be looked at but to the extent that what we are 
concerned with is acts of corruption and state capture.  Mostly what 
one would be dealing with there are not people who – who are going to 
go outside the legislation because they are confused by the m ultiplicity 
of pieces of legislation but one is dealing with people who do not want 
to comply with any legislation or who want to create the impression that 
10 
they comply when they actually know that they do not comply.  You – 
you may or may not know because of your job maybe you do know to 
what extent problems of procurement related to people who genuinely 
do not understand the legislative requirements and policies as opposed 
to people who – who know what the position is or who do not care what 
the position is but simply want to achieve illegal objectives.  I am - I 
am - if you know you can tell me.  If you do not know I will understand.  
Namely at a practical level maybe within the context of Transnet how 
much is the problem one of people not understanding p olicies and 
legislation when it comes to procurement irregularities that may – that 
20 
are found? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Thank you Chair.  I think there is a 
good mixture of both scenarios that you have referred to.  One the one 
hand there are ordinary hardworking officials – buyers - at ground level 
so to speak – who – who battle to understand all the procurement 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 22 of 208 
 
requirements that are imposed on them and very often we find that 
deviation from the regulatory requirements is as a result of 
administrative bungling – for lack of a better term.  Individuals who just 
do not have a proper understanding of the multiplicity of – of 
requirements.  It is another category of people who – perhaps I will use 
the term wilful ignorance - where it is not that they did not understand.  
They do not want to understand what the requirements are or to put it 
differently they do not want to be bound by what the requirements are 
unless it is a convenient rule which they do not mind complying with.  
So I think Chair the – there is a number of instances where have seen 
10 
irregular expenditure occurring in Transnet that comes about as a result 
of bungling but the big ticket items - especially those that originate 
from the levels of the Board and the Exco - it is very difficult for me to  
believe that people at that level just simply did not know what the – 
what the rules are especially if one looks at the nature of the breaches 
which have occurred.  It is hardly a complex rule which was not 
followed.  Sometimes it is just changing an eval uation criteria in the 
middle of an evaluation process.  So – so I think that there is certainly 
both of those scenarios. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Volmink can you now turn to 
slide five and take us through – and you can do that in a summary form 
because you are still going to deal with it much more comprehensively 
at a later stage.  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is page 101? 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 23 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 101 Mr Chair. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair this just shows the regulatory - 
how the regulatory or legislative landscape has changed for Transnet 
and other major SOCs over time.  So on the far left hand side of the 
slide it shows the position before 20 – well ja – before 2011 and at that 
point the PPPFA and its various regulations did not apply to Transnet.  
Transnet was at liberty to determine its own procurement systems and 
methodologies of course in compliance with the PFMA and the 
Constitution and the like. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The significant change happened in 
2011 when the PPPFA Regulations were applied to Transnet and at that 
point the Minister of Finance had indicated that Schedule 2 entities had 
to comply but he exempted …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Transnet. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The Schedule 2 entities for a period 
of – I think – one year from 7 December 2011 until 7 December 2012.  
There were some provisions which applied immediately such as local 
content and the provisions governing tax compliance – I think – applied 
immediately but the SOCs major Schedule 2 SOCs were exempted for a 
20 
period of time.  Then in 2015/2016 we saw a significant number of 
instructions being rolled out and applied to the Schedule 2’s which did 
not apply before and I just mention some of the m such as the use of an 
e-tender publication portal, a central supply database, rules on 
construction procurement – so called SIPDM – the rules around the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 24 of 208 
 
restriction of suppliers, use of emergencies, contract variations, 
deviations from the competitive bi dding process.  These all applied in a 
number of instructions that were issued.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And they were issued by National 
Treasury? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  By National Treasury. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And then the last column on the far 
right hand side shows the current position.  Of course these 
instructions still apply but in addition the National Treasury issued new 
10 
regulations under the PPPFA in 2017 and they cover things like the use 
of prequalification criteria to advance various designated groups.  Also 
it relates to the importance of prices that must be market related and 
you cannot award a bid that is not market related and various other 
provisions are dealt with in the 2017 regulations.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes but as and when those instructions 
are being issued it would mean that Transnet must also confirm with 
those instructions and make sure that their SCM Policies are in line 
with those instructions?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair.  Unless 
20 
Transnet applies for a specific exemption it is bound by the – these 
instructions as well. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now slide six Chair page 102 it 
also talks about the same issues that you are conversing.  Am I 
correct? 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 25 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and slide seven so that the Chair 
must not say that I have skipped any slide.  It is just a beautiful good 
screen.  I am not sure what it is carrying.  Slide …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think it is just meant to depict the 
next – the next heading of the presentation.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Which is Governance Checkpoints. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now let us go to slide eight and please 
take us through the bodies responsible to ensure governance – good 
10 
governance of the processes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So Chair when the policies and 
procedures are written various bodies are created who are meant to 
perform – let us call it - watchdog or checkpoint function s throughout 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Kind of oversight? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the first body is referred to as 
the Cross Functional Sourcing Team or CFST for short and the 
20 
responsibility of that body is to ensure that when specifications …  
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair if you go to page 124. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I also had the same difficulties of 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 26 of 208 
 
understanding these acronyms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And I requested that there must be a full 
list … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Explaining these names in full. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And if you go to page 124 you will be 
able to find …  
CHAIRPERSON:  To find the full names? 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Full names of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So I was saying Chair that the 
responsibility of this Cross Functional Sourcing Team …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK: 
 
Is 
to write 
specifications 
and 
20 
evaluation methodologies in a way that ensures that the criteria is 
objective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That they are unbiased. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 27 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That they are fit for purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It starts there.  How is the 
procurement document written …?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And that is the first checkpoint …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In the governance process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  If you have a badly written RFP …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is riddled with ambiguity, 
vagueness …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Or worse infected by bias …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Then it affects the legality of 
whatever follows thereafter.  So that is the first body.  The …  
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to it is what would happen at a practical 
level this that somebody in some department at Transnet would 
20 
formulate for example specification but before it can be sent out it 
should come to this body for them to check whether it is okay or do 
they check that afterwards or how does it happen …?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  This is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or are the ones who do the drafting?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 28 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So every – every specification or request for 
proposals that goes out they would take responsibility – so to speak – 
they would have done that?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The drafting of it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Originates with the Cross Functional 
Sourcing Team…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But it then has to go through various 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Approval levels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So there are various individuals …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Or bodies  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  With delegation of authority …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Which I will come to in a little bit 
later on …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To give the clearance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 29 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That we are now …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Good to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That this tender can be issued to – to 
market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So they start the process of drafting but they 
are not the final word?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  hey are not the final word …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  On whether it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Should be released or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But I – I refer to them Chair because 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They also bear responsibility for – for 
good governance.  The way they write that document.  They cannot say 
no someone else – it is someone’s responsibility to approve its release 
20 
to the market.  They are the individuals who must take responsibility for 
ensuring that it is unambiguous, fair and objective in terms of the 
criteria that are listed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 30 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You may proceed to another one. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the – the next body that I 
mention and as I have indicated earlier I will talk a little bit later about 
the bodies who also have to approve these things but I mention the 
Cross Functional Evaluation Team of CFET for short and what the CFET 
does is they must now evaluate the tender.  It has been written by the 
CFS Team.  It has been issued to the market.  Bids have been received 
and now it must come to this body – the Cross Functional Evaluation 
Team.  They are the ones …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who are responsible for ensuring 
that the evaluation of the tender must be in accordance with the RFP.  
They cannot stray … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  From the terms of the RFP.  They 
must ensure that scoring is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Followed fairly, rationally and – and 
so on and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well Mr Mokoena I do not know whether it is 
20 
your plan or Mr Volmink’s one I would prefer to hear about the bodies 
to which – for example – request for proposal goes to after the CFS 
Team has done it before I hear about a body such as CFET which …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Looks at it after it has gone out and come back.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 31 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Sure, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That for me would make it easier. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja.  I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes, I am happy to do that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Please proceed to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can do that that would – that would …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Then we will come back to slide eight.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But it will give the Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just want to follow in sequence . 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  An appreciation, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So Chair after the tender document 
has been written by the CFST …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The tender document would be of 
course the – the RFP itself …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But also the procurement strategy …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That informs the – the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would draft everything relating to the tender …?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 32 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That must be – that must be in place before the 
request for proposals goes out?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Before it goes out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They have to set out the record what 
does Transnet require. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  What is the evaluation methodology?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  How will the price preference  be 
applied? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  A range of things must …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Be dealt with in these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To just deal with your questio n Chair 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As to the approval bodies …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There are various levels …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Of approval …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 33 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Depending on the value of the 
tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So for example if the tender is under 
- and it is quite a high amount but under 500 million …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The Chief Procurement Officer who is 
the Head of Procurement in the various operating divisions …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Must sign to say that he or she is 
satisfied that the requirements of the tender are clearly spelt out …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPH EN VOLMINK:  That the requirements are fair, 
unbiased and fit for purpose.  Also Chair the Head of the – what we call 
the End User Department – the Engineering Department …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Or whoever it is that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Required the specifications or rather 
20 
who required the goods and services …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They are often the ones who help to 
write the specifications … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 34 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And the Head of that department …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Must sign off before it can be 
released …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To say that these specifications are 
not biased and it will meet the needs of the org anisation etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be any tender any request for proposals 
would relate to a particular unit or department - whatever you call them 
– within Transnet.  Is that right?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there would be a unit of division or some section 
of Transnet to which it relates?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But whatever the unit, whatever the department, 
whatever the section is the only body that can draft at first instance the 
specifications and the request for proposals would be this CFST that 
you told me about. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you say from there it does not go out – the 
request for proposals.  It goes to various approving levels and bodies 
and only when it – it has been approved by all of them or the final one 
that has the final say does it then go out?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 35 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is precisely …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you have mentioned to at this stage after 
the CFST has drafted one is – if I understand you correctly – the 
Chief… 
ADV PILLIP MOKOENA SC:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say Chief Procurement Officer – would it be 
of the section or unit where the tender is needed?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where work or goods are required?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  It would be the Chief 
Procurement Officer of the operating division like Transnet Freight Rail 
has its own Chief Procurement Officer.  There may be various units 
within … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh underneath. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Within TFR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so it would be the operating – the Chief 
Procurement Officers of the operating unit under which the operating 
vehicle – company or whatever – under which the particular section that 
20 
needs the work or goods the services or goods falls?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  We refer to them as End User…  
CHAIRPERSON:  End User. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 36 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  End User Departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So it could be engineering …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  HR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It could be legal.  A range of units …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who operate within that operating 
division. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  When they require goods and 
services they would typically provide people who can help to write the 
specifications.  They sit on the CFS Team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But they have to take it to a 
delegated body …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To approve its release to the mar ket 
and this was introduced precisely because we had experienced in the 
20 
past that tenders were issued to the market without proper oversight …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Without anyone checking and then …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The difficulties are picked up …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 37 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  After it has been (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So from the Chief Procurement Officer of the 
End User Department they go to the Head of the End User Department.   
Is that right? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The request of proposals or not yet?  I thought you 
mentioned the Head as well. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No, no, no.  There are two …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And maybe let me just …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Take us through this again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So the Chief Procurement Officer …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is the one who is going to sign off on 
the RFP as a whole. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To say I am happy …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That this RFP …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Can be released to the market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 38 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There is the Head of the End User 
Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  What that person must do is to 
confirm in writing …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK: 
 
That 
the 
specifications 
– 
the 
technical specifications … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is listed in the RFP …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK: 
 
That 
he 
confirms 
that 
those 
specifications are unbiased and it is fit for purpose etcetera …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And the – that was introduced with a 
very specific purpose in mind.  It very often happened that RFPs were 
issued to the market and then later the End User Department says but 
no these specifications …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Do not suit our needs. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  You must cancel and you must start 
again etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Which is why require firstly the End 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 39 of 208 
 
User – the Head of the End User Department signs off on those 
specifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The specifications gets incorporated 
into the RFP …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And the RFP is then taken to the 
CPO … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Under a certain v alue … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  For the CPO to say he or she is 
happy for the RFP to be issued to the market.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the CPO being – I am no looking at page 124.  
The full – full name or title – CPO? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The Chief Procurement Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  That one now is it the one for 
the whole of Transnet or only – or the one you referred to earlier?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  For the operating division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, for the operating. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does the Head sign after the CPO has signed or 
the CPO signs first then the Head?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the Head first or the CPO?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 40 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well the Head of the End User 
Department signs off first to say that the specifications are in order …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And after that of course as I said the 
specifications get incorporated into the RFP document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And then it gets taken to the CPO.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To say this is now the complete …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  RFP … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Either say yay or nay that you are 
happy with this (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then if he or she is happy what is the next step?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The next step is that the tender is 
then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Released or set out? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Released – advertised … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And made available on the e-tender 
portal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And it then becomes a public – a 
public document. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 41 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the steps are not many in ter ms of once after 
the CF – CFST.  It is the Head of the End User Department and the 
CPO? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And then it gets – and then it gets 
released. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It gets to the CPO first? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  After it gets it to the CPO … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And CPO approves it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It will be released …  
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be released yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  After that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those – those steps do they change depending on the 
amount of the value? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So for a higher value …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Tenders the entity who has to 
approve the – say between 500 and 700 million …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  CPO will not give the ultimate 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 42 of 208 
 
approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  CPO will recommend … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To an Exco member …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And the Exco member is then the 
entity who will sign off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  For yet higher values …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Say between 700 and a billion …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Again it follows the same…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Process – CPO… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Drafts, it goes to the Exco member …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Then it serves before – what is 
20 
known as a Procurement Committee which is the – a Sub Committee of 
Exco … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who has to approve between 700 
million and a billion …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 43 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And then any tender above a billion 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The tender document itself …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Follows all of those processes but 
ultimately … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It has to be approved by – by Exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In terms of – of the – our most …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Delegations of authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that - that is very helpful. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we can talk about what happens when the – 
after the request for proposals has gone out to the market and then so 
on.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Prior to that Chair it will be also 
important for us to appreciate what is contained in slide eight because 
those relevant bodies become also critical …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When we deal with specific transactions 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 44 of 208 
 
and also they dovetail with the evidence of other witnesses that we 
scheduled for this session. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If I may refer you back to slide eight.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You have comprehensively taken the 
Chair through the CFST and the CFET.  Now there is this creature that 
is normally referred to as the Acquisition Council.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Please tell the Chair about it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry I interrupted him while – when he was 
beginning to talk about CFET.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not know whether there is much to say other 
than what is written there. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think the point is simply that this is 
the body that must ensure… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That the evaluation of a tender …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is done in accordance with the – 
what is set out in the tender document …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And of course with the PPM as a 
whole. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 45 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do they carry out the actual evaluation or is it 
somebody else who carries out the evaluation and they must just check 
whether the evaluation has been don e properly? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   No they are the actual evaluators.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Evaluators. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   The cross-function evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   We can move on Mr Volmink to the 
10 
Acquisition Council. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Yes, Chair then we have a body 
referred to as the Acquisition Council, I think in the rest of the public 
sector it is referred to as the Bid Adjudication Committee.  I think in 
previous years it was called a Tender Board, and this is the Body who 
is responsible for ensuring that the award of the tender is fair and 
legally compliant, so it is typically made up of fairly senior people 
within the operating division.  There will be an Acquisition Council in 
each of the operating divisions and they are typically constituted of the 
senior managers, or general managers within that department or rather 
20 
within the Operating Division and it is their responsibility to ensure that 
before a tender is awarded that they are sa tisfied that the process is 
compliant with the regulatory framework and that the selection of the 
successful tenderer that it followed a fair and equitable process.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So there would be a number of Acquisition Council 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 46 of 208 
 
within Transnet because e ach Operating Division has its own 
Acquisition Council, is that right?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that principle apply to CFET’s and CFST’s as 
well or are those Transnet wide bodies?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :    No Chair they also apply in each 
Operating Division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:   So there isn’t, there wouldn’t be a 
standing Transnet wide committee. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     But it is constituted in the various 
operating divisions as the need arises.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so when I look at this slide I must just bear in 
mind that what it represents is in relation to each Operating Division.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  To each Operating Division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not in relation to ...(intervention)  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Overarching. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...Transnet as a whole. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes Mr Volmink you can proceed to 
explain the next important committee. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair then the next committee, I have 
referred to earlier already, it is a sub-committee of Exco, it is referred 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 47 of 208 
 
to as the Procurement Committee, and it was established recently with 
our recent delegations of authority framework.  They typically have 
delegation to adjudicate on very high value tenders, I mentioned earlier 
between R700million and a Billion and they are empowered to award 
tenders, they are empowered to approve the release of RFP’s to  the 
market for that value and various other delegations are given to this 
Procurement Committee as well. 
 
Chair then ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, can I take you back to the Acquisition 
Council on this slide, you see when the slide says resp onsible for 
10 
ensuring that the award of a tender is fair and legally compliant, it 
gives the impression that somebody else does the actual awarding but 
they must just check that that has been done correctly, whether as what 
you are saying is they are the on es who do the actual awarding, but 
obviously in doing that that they must make sure that they comply with 
all the legislation and policies and so on?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Yes I understand what you are 
saying ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That meaning that I’m attaching to it. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I understand, Chair we use the word 
20 
ensuring somewhat deliberately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.     
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Because the Acquisition Councils 
they are the first group of people who must e nsure that when a tender 
gets awarded that it complied with the legislative requirements and it’s 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 48 of 208 
 
fair etcetera.  There may be other bodies such as the High Value 
Tender Review Committee which I will touch on a little bit later on, who 
will do independent assurance and I refer to them sort of at the bottom 
of the slide I will come to them, but when I say that the Acquisition 
Council must ensure that the award of tender is fair we say that 
because we want to impress upon them that it their responsibility fir st 
and foremost to make sure that the process followed is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  (Inaudible – microphone off) 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   No I do understand Chair, they will 
become even much more clearer when we deal with other slides 
10 
because yes, I understa nd the questions, they are relevant.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Mr Volmink the Procurement Committee, 
you were still dealing with it. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:   Yes I was saying Chair that their 
delegation is for  higher value tenders, ty pically between R700million 
and a Billion and they have responsibility firstly to approve that 
Transnet can issue a tender to the market, also to adjudicate on 
tenders which fall within their delegation R700million to a Billion, ie 
they for lack of a bette r word Chair they are the Acquisition Council for 
20 
those mega transactions, R700million and above.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Is this where one would locate those 
transactions such as the locomotives?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Chair the – this is a very recent 
creation, so this Procurement Committee was established under the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 49 of 208 
 
...(intervention)   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Post to those transactions. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Post the transactions.  So this 
Committee would not have existed at that time.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, and then the next one?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   The next one the letters are FIC, 
this is the Finance and Investment Committee, they are a sub -
committee this is a sub-committee of the Board, Chair they do not 
perform actual ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    It’s page 104 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Page 104. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I was there but I wasn’t sure that I was on the 
right page yes, yes you may continue.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMIN K:   Yes, I was referring to the Finance 
and Investment Committee which is a sub-committee of the Board.  Now 
Chair this Body plays really an assurance role for all transactions that 
are meant to be migrated to Exco, so I will tell you in a moment that 
Exco has delegation to approve tenders above a Billion, but the FIC or 
the Finance and Investment Committee really is an assurance body, 
20 
they  would want to be given the assurance that for those very big 
tenders above a billion that everything is done as it i s supposed to be 
and they would want to have that comfort to say that before this goes to 
Exco that is going to be the point in the process where the FIC 
expresses its satisfaction or its comfort that the process was done 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 50 of 208 
 
correctly, it is an important checkpoint in the process for the award of 
the mega tenders.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   The next committee that we’re dealing 
with? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   The next one Chair relates to Exco 
and as I have indicated Exco is the for lack of a better word the  
Acquisition Council now for those tenders that are above a billion, they 
will approve the approach to market, ie they will approve that the 
tender can be released to the market, they will also adjudicate on 
transactions and they will conclude contracts wi th the winning bidder 
10 
for tenders that fall into that bracket and then of course the Board, the 
Board doesn’t, under the new delegations of authority the Board will not 
exercise any delegation to award tenders or to award the – or to 
approve the release of tenders to the market, but of course being the 
Board they assume final accountability for whatever happens within the 
organisation.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes.  And from slide number nine, page 
105 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you get to that on that slide number 
eight there is that arrow between the Acquisition Council and the 
20 
Procurement Committee. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK : Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It suggests that things that have come before the 
Acquisition 
Committee 
from 
there 
move 
onto 
the 
Procurement 
Committee, is that correct?      
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 51 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   It is not ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not correct?   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I don’t think that is meant to depict 
necessarily a process flow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.    
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:   I think it just shows the various 
bodies that are appointed within Transnet to perform functions at 
various levels, but it doesn’t always happen that an award first has to 
go 
through 
the 
Acquisition 
Council 
before 
i t 
comes 
to 
the 
...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think that would cause confusion because when 
you see an arrow you say – it tells you where to go, and if there’s 
another arrow you follow the arrows.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I understood that in regard to maybe they  
shouldn’t be there, I don’t know, because also from CFST things don’t 
go to CFET straight, but CFET is there for when a request for proposal 
has gone out to the market and there are responses to it as I 
understand the position.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That’s correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we might have to just reflect what needs to be 
done to make sure that one doesn’t get confused.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   What I will propose to Mr Volmink we 
can remove the arrows Chair because when you go to slide number 14 
it will tell you properly about the Procurement cycle and also give – 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 52 of 208 
 
slide number 15 it will give about the procurement process, with the 
relevant arrows showing where does one go from -  what different 
stages does a tender have to go up until approval.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   So here she was merely depicting those 
committees without having to suggest that Chair must follow the 
arrows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so maybe if you remove the arrows  then what one 
sees is different bodies. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Bodies yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what happens about those bodies and what they 
are, and what their functions are one looks at your evidence, whereas if 
the arrows are there one says they aren’t there to decorate things, they 
are there for some meaning, they are there to say something moves 
from one point to the next point but that’s not what you meant.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :    Point taken yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKO ENA SC:    We will adjust it accordingly.  Mr 
Volmink on slide number nine you are dealing with issues that you have 
superficially touched on when you were debating these issues or when 
20 
you’re clarifying your evidence to the Chair, can you please elaborate  
on those delegations of authority?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair so what we see on slide nine 
are the there are three areas within Supply Chain that are addressed in 
the delegation of authority framework, it tells us firstly who are the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 53 of 208 
 
persons or committees that must approve that a tender can be 
released, we call it approval to approach the market.  I have dealt with 
that at some length earlier, and the delegations of everyone from the 
CPO, Exco members, Procurement Committee and Exco they are all 
outlined in the Delegations of Authority Framework.   
 
The next section in the Delegation of Authority Framework 
covering Supply Chain Management relates to bid adjudication or who 
is empowered to award a tender.  I have mentioned that the Acquisition 
Councils have authority  up to a certain level, then above that we have 
the Procurement Committee and above those – above the Procurement 
10 
Committee you have Exco to adjudicate on tenders above a billion.  The 
third aspect of the Delegation of Authority Framework d eals with who 
has power to sign off a contract, so it has gone through the process, it 
has been adjudicated and awarded but not anyone can sign the 
contract, so again it stipulates for example the General Manager of an 
end user function has delegations say  up to R300million, Exco member 
between R300 and R700, Procurement Committee members higher 
delegations and even Exco members above a billion.  
 
Now Chair I want to perhaps mention under this section 
dealing with contract award and sign off, although we giv e delegations 
20 
for individuals to sign off a contract they can’t jump the gun, they must 
wait for a tender process to be completed to run its course and it may 
sound like an obvious point but I will tell you Chair at a later stage in 
my evidence that for ex ample with McKinsey contract, or certain of the 
McKinsey contracts that contracts or letters of award were issued and 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 54 of 208 
 
yet the tender process was still underway, and that is a clear breach 
and so it is quite important that even though people with delegation  to 
sign off contracts that they are vested with that delegation that it is 
important that they only exercise that delegation after adjudication has 
happened.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we – I guess we will deal more with that kind of 
situation when you give evidence about it, but it seems unlikely that a 
person whose role in a tender is the signing off, of the contract 
wouldn’t know that the process hasn’t reached him or her because I 
10 
guess that he or she would know that things co me to me when they 
have been to A, B, C, D and all of those people have done what they 
are supposed to do then I come in.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:    Chair that is exactly right, whoever 
exercises delegation of authority to conclude a contract they normal ly 
first receive a resolution from the Adjudication Committee to say we 
have awarded the contract, awarded the tender, you can now proceed 
to conclude the contract, so it is a clear breach to simply jump the gun.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   I will deal with them in detail in due 
20 
course.  If you go to slide number 10 you are giving a very fundamental 
comparison between 2016 Transnet SCM and the DOA’s as compared to 
the 2019 and could you please take us through them because they are 
quite important and relevant to the issues to be canvassed later.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Thank you Chair.  What I say on this 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 55 of 208 
 
slide as I draw a comparison between what the current DOA’s require 
and what the previous DOA’s ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  These acronyms, I have to go to page 124 to check.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Oh my apologies, no, no Chair it 
stands for Delegation of Authority.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I have checked. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  My apologies, Transnet is full of 
acronyms and please just remind me if you hear something that I say 
that you’re not familiar with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  124, I will go to page 124, unless it’s not there, okay 
10 
you may proceed, DOA’s are Delegations of Authority  yes.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   That’s correct.  So Chair what it 
indicates is that the – how things have changed between 2016 and 
2019, I don’t deal with all aspects of the DOA’s, but I highlight a few.  
The first is that the Board and a sub-committee of the Board called the 
ADC, which stands for the Adjudication and Disposal Committee, it was 
previously called the BADC Board Acquisition and Disposal Committee.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, Acquisition and Disposal 
Committee. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Yes, the B got dropped at a certain 
20 
point and it was simply called the ADC, but in 2016 the Board and the 
ADC had delegation to make various procurement decisions, so they 
were given delegation to approve confinements, to approve the award 
of tenders, to assign contracts etcetera, and I make the point  that 
under the 2019 delegations the current Board is not involved in 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 56 of 208 
 
procurement decisions per se ie making tender awards.  I have 
indicated Chair that those functions have now been delegated to either 
a sub-committee of the Board called the Procurement C ommittee, or for 
tenders above a billion to Exco with FIC being the sub -committee 
performing that oversight or assurance role.  
ADV PHILLIP 
MOKOENA 
SC : 
 
 
 
Why 
was 
it 
necessary 
to 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Mokoena we started at nine, so I  don’t 
think we should wait until quarter past eleven for the tea break, maybe 
we should take the tea break at quarter to eleven, from quarter to 
10 
eleven to eleven o’clock.  Does that sound fine, okay thank you.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   I wanted to know, y ou mentioned about 
this, you referred to these changes why was it critical or crucial for 
Transnet to effect these changes, if you look at 2016 and 2019 
delegations of authority, whereby now when you look at 2019 the Board 
it’s not longer involved in procu rement decisions.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Yes, Chair I think that the Board 
would probably be able to explain the underlying rationale in more 
detail, but in essence there have been pronouncements made at 
various levels, particular in the State of the  Nation Address and also 
20 
the speeches made by the Minister of Finance and so on, that the 
Boards of SOC should not be playing a role in procurement decisions, I 
have no doubt that that influenced the decision to delegate those 
critical procurement roles to management with the Board performing 
that important oversight role. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 57 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am sure that that’s the reason, it’s management 
which must make these decisions and the Board must play the 
oversight role because they can’t play oversight role over themselves.  
They are the ones who must make decisions.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Take us through other changes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Chair then what we saw in 2016 and 
even in earlier delegations is what I can only refer to as something of 
an aberration, there were certain individuals who were granted the 
power to award tenders.  Now Chair a tender is supposed to be 
10 
awarded by an Acquisition Council, it’s a multi -disciplinary body made 
up of legal, complianc e, commercial, finance, risk and compliance 
etcetera, but the way these delegations read in 2016 and even earlier 
is that – well if you look at the 2015, the 2016 delegations these 
acquisition councils had delegation up to R50million.  Then above 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 15 or 50? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     That’s 50. 
CHAIRPERSON:  50, okay R50million. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   R50million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair then the Chief Supply Chain 
Officer was given the power of an Acquisition Council up to R500million 
so it did not serve before an Acquisition Council to approve the award 
of the tender, it went to a Chief Supply Chain Officer, then Chair for 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 58 of 208 
 
higher values we ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But that’s quite strange, maybe that’s why you said it 
was an aberration for a tender whose value is R50million you needed a 
number of people to sit in an Acquisition Council to make the decision, 
but for a tender that is R500million, much more, you need only one 
person to make a decision?    
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair it gets stranger than that, for 
up to R750million that could go to the Chief Operating Officer, or the – 
some other individuals, they were mentioned in the delegation of 
authority framework, for up to a billion it could be the Chief Financial 
10 
Officer.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Making the decision alone?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Yes, acting as the Acquisition 
Council. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Inaudible – microphone off) 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Chair your mic is off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I’m sorry, the one who was given authority to 
make decisions in relation to a tender that was above R50million but 
not above R500million was the Chief – did you say Chief Financial?  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:    Chief Supply Chain Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Supply Chain Officer.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then if it was above that it went to whom?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:   Then it went to the Chief Operating 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 59 of 208 
 
Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The COO?   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Up to 750. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to 750. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK : Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there too it was just him or her alone making the 
decision? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In terms of the Delegation of 
10 
Authority that person was the Adjudication Committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that person in the delegations said to be so to 
speak making those decisions as the Acquisition Council or it – the 
delegation simply said he or she was the one to make the decisions, 
when you refer to – when you say he or she was the Acquisition Council 
that’s what you say because he or she was performing the duties 
similar to those of an Acquisition Council, so in other words I’m askin g 
whether one can find somewhere, a document that was saying 
something like for purposes of a tender that is between R500million and 
R700 or up to R750million the person occupying this position shall be 
20 
deemed to be the Acquisition Council?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the way it was written is it is 
under the heading in the delegation of authority framework which I will 
be happy to make available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 60 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is under the heading called 
process approval.  I mentioned earlier Chair that the delegations deal 
with approaching the market, bid adjudication and contract award.  This 
concept of process approval falls under bid adjudication because it is 
in the process of bid adjudication that the person with delegation  must 
say I am happy with the process that was followed, and I’ve got no 
difficulty so when you turn to the section in the DOA framework dealing 
with process approval it tells us that the first level is the Acquisition 
Councils but they only have R50million and then it mentions all the 
others, and I think there’s a footnote at the bottom which explains what 
10 
this function entails. 
 
Chair there’s no doubt in my mind that the functions of an – of 
tender adjudication or tender award were delegated to individual s 
rather than to proper – properly constituted acquisition councils.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But what – what that – but what that means is simply 
that the higher the value the less the number of people involved in 
making the decisions. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That I think would be the implication.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that would be the …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Until it got to – under the 2016 
20 
delegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I think when the values were above 3 
billion it would serve before the ADC the subcommittee of the board 
and I think above 3 billion to the board itself.  So there would be point 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 61 of 208 
 
when the highest values  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Would serve before committees but 
there is a whole range of values of tenders between 50 and up to 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Billion. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Billion which serves where the 
adjudicatory process could be carried out by individuals.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Now Chair I should perhaps add  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That what we sought to do to avoid 
the huge risk involved entrusting tender adjudication to an individual is 
we wrote certain rules in the – what is called the PPM the Procurement 
Procedures Manual which sought to mitigate this – the situation and  - 
and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say we who?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Well the governance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unit oh yes okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.  So we stated there that before 
a tender can serves before what we refe r to as the one man or one 
20 
person acquisition councils they had to serve before the main 
acquisition council of whatever operating division it comes from.  So 
even though they only have power up to 50 to award we said they have 
got to look at the transaction and recommend if they are happy with it.  
Once it passes that main acquisition council it then must serve before 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 62 of 208 
 
the head of risk – the head of legal governance.  So in effect we 
constituted a sort of a virtual acquisition council to check on the 
transactions before it served before these individuals.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But were those rules always followed?  I 
mean there might be the rules and you know as a matter of fact Mr 
Volmink that there are contracts which were awarded without 
governance. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Council being involved. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair now again what is written and 
10 
what is followed are not always the same thing and we will deal with 
that later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the rules that you have just told me about that 
came from your unit, the governance unit were they a reaction to these 
delegations that you have talked about which you said appeared to be 
apparitions or would they come – were they there when these 
delegations were made? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No – Chair they were as a result of 
these delegations because…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The unit was deeply  
CHAIRPERSON:  Concerned. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And uncomfortable. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 63 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is – it is unheard of in public 
sector procurement.  Where you have a three committee system, a bid 
specification committee, a bid evaluation committee and a bid 
adjudication committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And as I say this was not something 
which sat well with the unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the bodies that you have talked – you have told 
me about the including the acquisition council and the procureme nt and 
10 
the CFET and CFST are those bodies provided for in policies and 
procedures manuals – policies and procedure manuals relating to 
procurement within Transnet or are they contained in something of a 
higher legal status than that such as regulations und er some legislation 
relating to Transnet?  What kind of instrument establishes those 
bodies? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair within the – within the Transnet 
environment that is dealt with in terms of the internal policies which 
Transnet has put in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  National Treasury has of course 
issued  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Certain prescripts or guidelines  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 64 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Which applies largely in the public 
sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The state departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Government departments and so on 
and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And we certainly draw from that but 
the detail of how these committees the CFST, the CFET, the Acquisition 
10 
Council and so on how those committees are to be conducted that is 
dealt with in our internal  
CHAIRPERSON:  Policies and documents?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But when you –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But when you refer to the three stage 
process of the bid evaluation specification and adjudication those are 
not merely rules but those are dealt with in terms  of the legislation, am 
20 
I correct? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That – that is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Despite that but you still had those 
single individuals with authority to – can grant tenders of that particular 
[indistinct] within Transnet?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 65 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the delegations that you told us about a few 
minutes ago they came from the board or  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they come from [indistinct].  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  No, no they come from the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the board. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair the last thing I want to mention 
10 
on this slide unless there is anything  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  No slide number 10. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Slide number 10 yes.  Is that there 
was also provision made in the 2016 delegations for – well for 
confinements but then also for what was referred to as confidential 
confinements.  Now…  
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  A confinement in itself is a deviation 
from an open bidding process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But a confidential confinement is 
something that could go straight to the GCE without any other person 
or body reviewing the confinement. Now a normal confinement Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Would require multiple levels of 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 66 of 208 
 
review within Transnet.  So if you …  
CHAIRPERSON:  So a normal confinement is subject to transparency?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  But a confidential confinement seems 
not to have been subject to the same transparency, is that right?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is – that is absolutely correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And you then have…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And not subject to various checks and – checks by 
different people to see if it is fine, it just goes straight.  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The normal confinement.  Yes.  The 
normal confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  You have to go to the acquisition 
council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Firstly it must come from the 
operating division itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Group or the corporate centr e cannot 
20 
decide we going to – we need a confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  If it does not come from the end user 
function or the operating division.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 67 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Even there it must pass the CPO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It must pass the ODC CEO.  It must 
serve before the acquisition committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who must say that they are satisfied 
with it before it comes to group where it gets reviewed by the CPO and 
various other – the group chief supplier chain officer and various other 
bodies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And that is to ensure that the 
confinements are not abused.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course one way in which those va rious stages 
and various steps protect proper procurement process even with a 
confinement you know is that if one person makes a mistake and does 
not pick up something wrong it is likely that somebody else will pick it 
up?  And also it means that if somebo dy corrupts one person that might 
not work because others who are not corrupted will pick things up.  But 
if you have only one person making the decision if he or she makes the 
mistakes that is it.  If he or she is corrupted that is it.  Is that right?  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair that is exactly right.  The – to 
put it in laymen’s terms we wanted as many pairs of eyes on any 
confinement as we could get quite frankly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And – but if you call it a confidential 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 68 of 208 
 
confinement  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Then it sails straight from the OD 
CEO straight to the GCE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There is no review that takes place 
and I – the reason I mention this Chair is that I will tell you in the 
course of my evidence that certain of the McKinsey confinements were 
approved as confidential confinements.  They did not go through the 
normal confinement process that one would expect.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this concept of confidential – of a confidential 
confinement was that first put in policies before it was implemented or 
did that just come from some delegations?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  No it was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where did it come from?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It was contained in the  – it was 
contained in the delegation of authority frame.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was never part of any policy?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It was then – then had to be brought 
into policy as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But its origin is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the delegation. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is that it was in the delegation of 
authority frames. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 69 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the delegation was talking about something that 
was unknown to the policies of Transnet at the time the delegation was 
made? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  At the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And then it had to be incorporated.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then expos facto  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was put in the policies. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But the point I wanted to make is that 
10 
under the 2019 delegation there is no  
CHAIRPERSON:  Such things. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Such thing as a confidential 
confinement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes if you go – you allow me Mr Volmink 
you can pass through slide 11, 12 and 13 because those will be 
repeating almost the evidence that you have already canvassed with me 
this morning.  We can move straight to slide number 14 on page 110.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.  Chair what this slide depicts is 
20 
the procurement – the typical procurement cycle that gets followed 
within Transnet and I would imagine any other public entity as well.  
The – this is a slide that deals with how the – the PPM is structured 
and I make the point in  my statement that the PPM follows these 
various stages in the procurement cycle.  So perhaps we could just go 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 70 of 208 
 
through it briefly. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And if need be…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Later on we will deal with the deals. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  We will deal with it in more detail.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So it depicts Chair that there are 
really just three stages to the procurement process.  The first is a 
planning stage which we call stage 1 on the slide.  The second is the 
actual procurement stage where we have got to go out and buy and the 
10 
third is the implementation stage where the contract is now in place 
and the contract must be implemented.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The planning stage I am sorry would take place in the 
end user department? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Typically yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair so in the planning stage we 
say that the process usually starts with what is called demand planning  
and management.  This is where business requirements are articulated, 
it must be assessed, it must be validated, it must be checked against 
20 
budget and so on and so forth and once it passes that stage it reaches 
what is called the procurement strategy and procurement mechanism.  I 
referred earlier to the CFST that group of people who have to sit and 
write the procurement strategy and write the – and write the RFP which 
of course is step 3 which is bid preparation essentially writing the RFP.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 71 of 208 
 
Then we reach the procurement stage where we have bids.  This is 
where bids are issued and received and opened.  We then get to the 
stage of bid evaluation, step 5.  Shortlisting and negotiation, 
adjudication 
of 
bids, contract award 
and 
then 
we 
reach 
the 
implementation stage which is contract management, continuous 
improvement and lessons learned.  So I mention that because the PPM 
is largely structured around the typical procurement cycle.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now there is a slide that – which 
you are going to spend much more time on it is slide number 16.  Chair 
I see that it is two minutes before the proposed tea adjournment could 
10 
we – is it appropriate to take it at this stage?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us take the tea adjournment and we will 
resume at eleven o’clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Volmink just before the tea 
adjournment we were just about to deal with slide 16 on page 112 
Chair. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You may proceed to take us through the 
slide. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair this slide deals with the 
common problems that are encountered in the three stages of the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 72 of 208 
 
procurement process that I referred to earlier been the planning stage, 
the procurement stage and the implementation stage and I would just 
like to take you through some of the key issues that are experienced at 
each one of these stages.  Chair under the planning phase the 
problems that are often encountered is that there are inadequate needs 
assessment.  So business would say our need is X and a tender gets 
drafted on the basis that the need is X and the tender gets awarded on 
the basis that the need is X but shortly after the award of the tender 
the need becomes Y and the need increases.  So either that is 
deliberate or it is as a result of just bad planning and inadequate needs 
10 
assessment of course is linked to the next point I mentioned which is 
that specifications are poorly develope d or biased and the consequence 
of that is often that tenderers do not know precisely what is required of 
them and the whole process gets infected with vagueness and 
ambiguity.  Chair there is also the difficulty of – of under budgeting.  So 
the expectation would be that a commodity would cost so much and 
then as the contract gets implemented when the full scope is then 
realised this has a knock on effect in terms of the value of what this 
would cost.  Chair I mentioned that there is also deviation from the  
open bidding process.  Now remember we are dealing with a planning 
20 
stage.  At this stage of the process procurement should as a default 
say we are going open tender.  That is the default position.  One would 
expect that in 95 percent plus of cases we woul d go the open tender 
route but we have seen in the past how at the planning stage already 
there is a motivation for a confinement.  Even if all the grounds for 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 73 of 208 
 
confinement for grounds are not met.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But is part of what you are saying about the planning 
stage or the people involved at the planning stage that it is – it is not 
one of the things they should be dealing with whether or not the 
services of goods must be procured by way of a confinement or open 
tender?  In other words are you saying wh en they mention that they are 
encroaching on something that does not fall within their responsibility 
or are you not saying that?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No.  Chair what I am saying is that 
that group I referred to earlier – the Cross Functional Sourcin g Team … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  When they sit down and write the 
strategy and all the specifications for the tender…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  One of the questions they must ask 
themselves at that stage … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Should we go open tender …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Or is this something that should be 
20 
confined to one or a limited number of tenderers…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And I am saying that very often - 
perhaps less so now than before – but there used to be a practice of 
saying well deviate and go the confinement route …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 74 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Even if there is no justification of 
valid grounds for the confinement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So it does happen at that CFST stage 
already … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  When the procurement strategy gets 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But does that stage fall under planning?  That is what 
10 
I am … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words you have no problem with the planning 
stage including consideration whether it should be open tender or 
confinement?  You have … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I have no problem with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do have? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you do not. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I am saying I do not have a problem.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh you just have a concern where a 
recommendation or motivation is made that t here should be a 
confinement even where there are no proper grounds for a confinement.  
That is where your concern is?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is my concern Chair. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 75 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I also mention that it is at this 
stage in the process where we have seen an inappropriate use of 
emergency procedures.  So we do make allowance for emergencies to – 
the emergency route to be used.  Typically it arises when there is an 
unforeseen crisis that must be responded t o.  Normally an immediate 
threat to life or to property or serious business interruption or a threat 
to the environment which there is no time to follow a normal tender 
process.  That is allowed for but we find that what gets regarded as an 
emergency does not always meet those stringent requirements and an 
10 
emergency is not an emergency just because business really needs this 
thing urgently or because an Executive has called it an emergency.  It 
must meet that narrow strict definition of what an emergency is . 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And it cannot be an emergency if it is 
before – if it is as a result of poor planning?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  If it is result of? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Of poor planning. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Of poor planning – no absolutely not.  
It must be completely unforeseen and no as a result of poor planning.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is that – is that accurate?  If there was poor 
20 
planning and it is genuine poor planning and at a certain stage it is 
realised that if you went – if the company went the open tender there 
will be time and yet the company needs this thing within – for example 
– a week but you look at all the documentation and you say but this 
thing should have been foreseen three months ago that if A, B, C, D 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 76 of 208 
 
was not done this is where it – where it would come to.  Now it is poor 
planning but you do not suspect criminality, corruption and so on.  You 
just say you have some incompetent Manager somewhere along the line 
or a few Managers who are incompetent.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  He did not do his job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but the company does need these goods within a 
week.  You cannot say – can you – because of poor planning the 
company should rather not have these goods within a week?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I follow – I follow what you are 
saying.  When I look at the National Treasury Instruction on 
10 
emergencies I think there is a specific provision there that the 
emergency can be triggered if it is an unexpected event and I am pretty 
sure they say specifically that it should not be as a result of poor 
planning.  So Treasury seems to say if your - if you have a self-created 
emergency then you cannot rely on your poor planning as a reason not 
to follow tender processes and I think we are somewhat constrained - I 
am appreciative of – of the point that you are making because business 
may well need this commodity despite the poor planning.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see there would be – well I do not know 
how wide the ambit would be of self-created emergency – you know – 
20 
but one form of self-created emergency is somebody who has got some 
other agenda – you know - and basically manipulates – you know – the 
processes to make sure that this is no dealt with by so and so before 
that time because if it is dealt with that – and there is still time – that 
person will say it must go to open tender and I do not want it to go to 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 77 of 208 
 
open tender.  So he must or she must see it when there is no time – 
you know – that is one situation but even with that situation there it is 
an individual.  It might be an individual who puts the company in that 
situation and – and maybe those goods are very critical and if the 
company were not to secure those goods within a week there would be 
dire consequences for the company financially.  So – so – but I am sure 
that the – you know – all of those things would be taken into account in 
terms of what would be the consequences if we insist on open tender 
when there is no time really left and what would be the consequences if 
we – we deviate even though some individ ual maybe responsible for 
10 
this situation.  Obviously such an individual needs to be dealt with …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In whatever way but you also do not want the 
company as a whole to actually suffer because of that individual.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair practically if I were to be 
confronted with a situation like that my advice would be as follows.  
Firstly we cannot ignore the National Treasury Prescript that says if it 
as – if it is as a result of bad planning do not call i t an emergency and 
do not trigger your own emergency processes but having said that to 
use your example this commodity is needed desperately and if we do 
20 
not have it there will be far reaching ramifications for the organisation.  
I would then approach National Treasury and say I need some sort of 
deviation or I need some accommodation of this scenario and where we 
put forward a proper case and it is well motivated Treasury is likely to 
be responsive to that.  I do not think Treasury would allow the company 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 78 of 208 
 
to implode just because of a – of their prescripts.  I think that they 
would accommodate the situation such as that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair the mic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Would deviation – would deviation be all 
encompassing in the sense that confinement would fall under deviation, 
emergency would fall under deviation or in the sense that in an 
emergency situation you are saying we are allowed not to use open 
tender and in a confinement situation you say we are not o bliged to use 
open tender and then there may be other instances of deviation.  In 
10 
other words is deviation like an umbrella under which different 
situations fall or does emergency and confinement …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do they constitute their own separate exceptions to 
be to the open tender requirements?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Thank you for that Chair.  There is an 
instruction note 3/2015/2016 issued by Treasury where they say you as 
an organ of State you can deviate without approaching us for prior 
permission only in two instances.  The first instance is when one is 
dealing with what is called a sole source supply.  There is no one else 
20 
who can provide this commodity except that individual or that company.  
That is the first instance where I do not need to go to Treasury.  
Treasury gives Transnet the authority to deviate from an open bidding 
process provided it can show empirically that there is no one else who 
can provide this particular service.  The second scenario i s where we 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 79 of 208 
 
are dealing with a genuine emergency i.e. as I have explained before 
there is an immediate threat to life or the environment or to property – 
did not arise as a result of bad planning and so on and so forth.  Then 
if it is a true emergency I do not need to go to Treasury.  I am dealing 
with a crisis and Treasury would require me to take whatever steps I 
require to deal with that crisis that I am confronted with.  All other 
deviations maybe it is an “emergency” but it does not quite fit that 
scenario which I have mentioned or it is confinement not based on sole 
supplier but I prefer this entity’s methodology to another entity.  For all 
other deviations Treasury says come to us for prior approval before you 
10 
can deviate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So deviation would be like wide but with 
certain specifics accommodated but still leaving enough room for a 
situation that nobody has thought about to be dealt with as well?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Exactly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And as I say if we put forward a 
proper case Treasury is likely to grant deviation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  From – from the open bidding 
20 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you might help me with one of the things that I 
have - always have difficulty understanding which you have mentioned 
which comes from Treasury.  Namely that if there is only one person 
who – to your knowledge – provides that or can provide a particular 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 80 of 208 
 
service or certain goods then you do not have to go open tender.  Now I 
can understand that where the ground for justification is urgency or is 
an emergency but I do not understand it when there is nothing about 
urgency but you say it is one because what harm would it do to 
anybody to put it to open tender because if they are the on ly ones - 
they are the only ones who will put in a bid but just in case you are 
wrong. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There may be somebody who says no I actually can – 
can also provide this.  I have never understood why that should be a 
10 
ground not to go to open tender.  Do I miss something?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I think the – the ground for 
deviation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Based on sole supplier is tha t there 
is only one supplier who is uniquely positioned to meet whatever their 
specific need is of the organ of State.  Let me give an example.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no an example I will understand. What I do not 
20 
understand is why must you – why must reliance be on your knowledge 
when you could be mistaken that there is somebody else out there 
because it is only if you put it out to the public – to the market – that 
you can be sure.  You see if you put it out to the market …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 81 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  A request for proposals goes all over and there is 
only one who – who puts in a bid because there is no other person or 
business then you are sure and were not relying on your own 
knowledge.  You are sure that we have to give it to one because tha t is 
the only one who responded but if we rely on your knowledge …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say as far as I know there is only one.  What if 
you are wrong? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is somebody else and if you had put 
10 
the request for proposals out to the public somebody else could have 
come up.  That is my concern because one if you – if you are mistaken 
there may be prejudice to the company because then it is subjected to 
one – you know – supplier when actually there could be another one 
maybe who might have provided a better service or better goods or I 
mean maybe a better price but if you say well there is no emergency we 
have three months let us put the request for proposal out to the public.  
Within 30 days they must come back and if there is only one that is 
fine.  We are where we would have been anyway if we had not put it out 
because that is the one we knew but just in case we are wrong 
20 
somebody else will come up. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No I - I appreciate those – those 
comments and Chair we have seen a misapplication of this deviation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Based on sole source …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 82 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  When in fact there – we have picked 
up that there were other suppliers.  So it is – it is a rule which has 
been issued by Treasury but it is a wide open to – to abuse.  The 
example I was going to use which I think would illustrate that it can 
actually be used correctly is where we have acquired a  piece of 
machinery – say – from an OEM.  An Original Equipment Manufacturer 
and no one else makes the spare parts for that machine except the 
OEM who built the machine.  So – and perhaps the OEM also comes 
with certain warranties and says to us if you dev iate and get any other 
10 
spare parts and put it into this machine you will forfeit your warrantees.  
So that would be a typical example of where I say there is only one 
entity who can provide me with the spare parts for the machine they 
built and that is that entity and they are uniquely positioned to meet the 
needs of the organ of State but the way it ought to be applied is it 
should be applied very sparingly and only when there is absolute clarity 
and certainty not based on a quick desktop analysis but on t horough 
market research that there is really no one else who can provide this 
particular entity – that particular product. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  Ja. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Volmink just to conclude on this 
stage of planning - should we understand your evidence that you are 
raising these concerns of the concept such as emergency deviation 
which were used from time to time flow from your experience that they 
were abused on a number of occasions?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 83 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair that is why I am mentioning 
these things.  State capture I think happens through a process that – 
that is designed to override controls and when we talk about deviation 
from the opening bidding process - I will talk about a number of others 
in a short while – it just helps to facilitate capture.  It enables those 
who have all sorts of nefarious motivates to do what they – what they 
wish to do and it is for that reason that I thought that I should highlight 
some of these … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Difficulties here.  Perhaps Chair if I 
10 
can move onto the …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Procurement leg – I have already 
mentioned the problem being unclear specifications and evaluation 
criteria.  I do not think I am going to (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You can move to the second one. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The second one deals with short time 
for bidders to respond.  The requirements are that bidders should be 
given at least 21 days in a normal tender to resp ond to the tender but 
often we find that bidders are given a very short time to respond and 
20 
either that means that they cannot give a proper response and they 
may fail certain dates as a result of having given a rushed bid 
submission or they do no submit b ecause they say look I cannot make 
your – your stringent timelines.  So I think that is one of the difficulties 
which we have experienced. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 84 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  May I ask whether in relation to that particular item of 
possible abuses whether there were also such a buses in regard to 
some of the tenders or contracts that we will be dealing with in – in 
regard to Transnet.  I raise that simply because in regard to Bosasa I 
heard evidence where for example - according to one of the witnesses 
– a short time was given to  bidders because there was collusion 
between the company that was to be given the bid and a short time was 
designed to make sure that it was unlikely that anybody would be able 
to put in a bid other than this company which had long known that there 
was to be this … 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Request for proposals.  Would there have been such 
situations a Transnet or this is just generally speaking what you have 
put here? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair we have come across …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Practical instances … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Of this in – in actual tenders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That specific one does no feature in 
the five transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay but …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Which I will be addressing …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 85 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But other …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Of the problems which I will mention 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Most certainly do feature ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In those transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I - I speak about changing criteria 
10 
during bid evaluation and bid adjudication where a tenderer bids on 10 
criteria – say – and when he is evaluated or at the adjudication stage 
other extraneous factors which ought to have played on role in the 
decision making then features quite prominently and I call it evaluation 
by ambush.  It is like you are ambushin g a bidder with criteria that he 
had no idea he was going to be measured against.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And it may give the impression also to somebody 
looking at this that at the beginning certain – a certain set of criteria 
was required and then later on when di fferent bids have been put in it 
may – it looks like the particular bidder is not going to be able to get 
20 
this because somebody else has put in a better bid and therefore you 
now change the criteria to suit the bidder that you want …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They preferred. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To ultimately get the – the tender. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is exactly – that is the …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 86 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The danger.  I mention also in 
consistent application of disqualification.  Bidd ers A, B and C all three 
of them fail to meet a certain prequalification criteria yet bidder A is 
allowed through and bidders B and C are disqualified on the very same 
grounds and even very recently Chair I have seen this in a – a huge 
tender that had gone plain sailing through all the reviewing structures 
where a bidder was allowed through who should have been disqualified 
right at the get go.  Fortunately it has been picked up and that matter 
will be addressed and reversed in due course but this is a cons tant 
10 
challenge.  I will just mention a few others.  If I can maybe just go 
down to where it says:  “Recommendation of the Evaluation Team 
Overruled” where an evaluation team made up of experts in the field - 
very often – who have considered the bid scored the bidder 
appropriately, made a recommendation as to who the selected or 
successful bidder should be and it then serves before one or other 
person or body with delegation to do the tender award and it is at that 
stage that the person says no I disagree.  I do not like who you have – 
I do not support your reasons or whatever the case maybe and we have 
put in certain rules as to how that is to be dealt with.  We make it clear 
20 
that the person with adjudicatory powers has no authority to override 
the – the recommendation that comes from Evaluation Team.  Where 
there is a disagreement it must be escalated further up to either the 
Chief Executive or Board to resolve the matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is quite important because where the one 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 87 of 208 
 
body is mean to – where its authority or powers are limited to making a 
recommendation and another body given the authority or power to make 
the decision on the one hand you do not want to give recommendations 
the status of a decision de facto.  You want recommendations to rem ain 
what they are namely recommendations because if the intention is that 
the recommendation – those who recommend should make the decision 
then you should give them the power to decide.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know – so if the – if the prescripts say they must 
make a recommendation then that is what they must make.  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the prescripts say somebody else must make a 
decision that person must make that decision and that person mustn’t 
necessarily have a situation where what he or she gets is supposed to 
be a decision when it’s recommendations and he or she – it mustn’t be 
like he or she is supposed to rubber stamp.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Sure, sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want each one to do their job the way they should 
do it, but at the same time you don’t want the person who makes the 
decision to treat the recommendations as of no value, you want them to 
20 
give, apply their mind and give proper weight to the recommendations 
but at the same time be able to say I don’t agree where they genuinely 
don’t agree, but then maybe what you say you have recommended 
namely that they should not overrule but then that you should bring in 
somebody else, you should escalate to somebody else might be a go od 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 88 of 208 
 
way to bring a balance between the two.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Exactly, so the rationale is this 
Chair, that it is the SFET as I said made up of the body of experts 
whose going to look at the matter, point taken that they’re not the final 
decision makers, they are the recommenders.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:    That serves before the decision 
makers.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     But where the decision maker, 
10 
being the Adjudication Committee has a different view to what is being 
placed before them, we have said that the default position should be to 
refer the matter back for proper – or for re-consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes in the light of the grounds for reservations by 
the deciding...(intervention). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     By the recommending body rather 
than 
just 
substituting 
its 
own 
decision 
for 
that 
of 
the 
primary...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    That might create a good balance because it gives 
the recommending body an opportunity to look at the grounds of the 
20 
reservations of the deciding body just in case they missed something.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But once they’ve looked at it, they might say, you’re 
actually right we overlooked this even if they are experts o r they might 
say, no actually we did consider this, it’s not good enough, they stick to 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 89 of 208 
 
their recommendation.  Then in that event it’s more important to really 
look at everything properly but that might be a good check and balance.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMIN K:     Exactly and if that stand -off 
continues between the CFED and Adjudication body then it gets 
escalated to a higher body. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Who makes a final decision.    
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    But you also address instances, Mr 
Volmink not only where you are dealing with two bodies that might be 
10 
having expertise, there are instances when you’re dealing with specific 
transactions whereby you might have that evaluation team with expert s 
recommendation – its recommendation being overruled by one person 
who has been given power to do that.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Correct ja and that takes me to the 
next point Chair and that is that we – and maybe just a few points down 
actually, we talk about – one of the difficulties is the opportunistic use 
of risk factors as a reason to overlook the top ranked bidder.  So a 
recommendation would be made, the bidder meets all the criteria, it 
now serves before the Board or the Adjudication Committee , the ADC or 
20 
whichever adjudicatory body this and it is at that point that this body 
raises all kinds of risk factors and says, no but that recommended 
company poses this risk and that risk, very often risks that were taken 
into account during the function ality stage, the evaluation stage but 
now gets revisited as a reason to overlook the tenderer and I mention 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 90 of 208 
 
that because I will come back to this when I deal with the award of the 
Data Services tender to T-System when Gitjima was in fact the 
recommended body but Gitjima was overlooked based on certain 
identified risks which were adequately dealt with and also in the award 
to T-Systems, when Neotel was the recommended body and Neotel was 
overlooked based on certain alleged risks that were identified, so that  
is a key card. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes any other thing that you wish to 
highlight under the procurement stage?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Perhaps not – no I don’t under the 
10 
procurement leg, perhaps just under the implementation leg, I’ll be very  
brief on that...(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    But can I take you to the last bullet 
point under procurement for you to comment and to prefer a far more 
much clarity on that issue where you say that, “award not made by 
delegated official”, wha t instances do you have in mind?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     Chair what we have picked up is 
that we have decisions made by officials who act outside of their 
delegated authority, I’ve mentioned earlier that we have a delegation of 
authority framework that says who has authority to approach the 
20 
market, who has authority to do tender adjudication, who has authority 
to contract with suppliers and we have instances where officials act 
outside of that delegation, either in the sense that they act – they 
award tenders for much higher value than what they are entitled to or 
they do not wait for their turn in the process.  You can’t trigger your 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 91 of 208 
 
delegation until an earlier body has done their job and made their 
decision that gives you the necessary standing or yo u are then 
empowered to trigger your delegation and I mentioned earlier examples 
of where contracts were already awarded and yet the tender process 
was still under way. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Exactly, now if you look also at the fifth 
bullet point from the bottom where you’re talking about the multiple 
repetitive awards, the same supplier, I think that’s also relevant, can 
you take the Chair through that one and explain it, why was it a 
concern? 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     Chair I think it is a concer n, not in 
the sense that the procurement prescripts don’t allow for more than one 
award.  So if we all run a race and it is a fair race but one of us wins 
the race more than once, that doesn’t render the process unfair but 
where we have multiple, repetitiv e awards to the same supplier and it is 
not clear why that supplier specifically was chosen when there were 
other equally competent alternatives then it becomes a red flag.  I’m 
not saying that, that in itself renders the process void or invalid but 
where we do have these multiple awards it does raise a red flag to us.  
CHAIRPERSON:    And they should be looked into to check whether 
20 
everything was done fairly and transparently.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:    And we will return to this, I think, 
with McKinsey. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And when this multiple awards are 
made to the same supplier under confinement what do you say?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 92 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Well then it becomes even more 
problematic, and that is exactly the McKinsey scenario where you have, 
I think it was eight confinements totalling either 1.6 or 1.9billion rand in 
value awarded to one entity.  Now if we are dealing with this 
phenomenon of multiple awards and it is in the context of a 
confinement, well that takes it to a whole different level of seriousness. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: I’m sorry Mr Mokoena, well you can deal with this 
later if you plan to deal with it later but I’m keen to try and understand 
the justification that was provided by the Board in g iving this delegated 
10 
authority providing for confinement.  So if they are going to be dealt 
with later on I’m happy to wait. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Mr Chair, maybe you should wait. 
CHAIRPERSON: I will allow you to say I must wait Mr Mokoena.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    It is a very rare moment that I can do 
it, to tell the Chair to wait. 
CHAIRPERSON: You must just promise to cover it.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    It will be covered Chair because it’s 
quite important and it deals with specific awards of dif ferent suppliers.  
Now I know that you want to move to the implementation block but 
20 
before you go there, there are other things that I think that you are 
simply skipping that are very crucial to the evidence – to your 
testimony that you will be adducing be fore this Commission.  Now if you 
go to the second bullet point from the bottom you talk about “pressure 
from above”. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 93 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Yes, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    If you can explain and elaborate to the 
Chair what are you are attempti ng to convey by saying that. 
MR 
PETER 
STEPHEN 
VOLMINK : 
 
 
 
 
Pressure 
from 
the 
above...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: And the above is in inverted commas.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   It is in inverted commas yes.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :     Chair what this relates to is 
pressure that gets brought to bear on procurement officials from vary 
senior people within the organisation, it could be at the level of the 
10 
Board, it could be at the level of Exco or possibly the GCE or CFO 
etcetera and this often takes the form of saying to officials that there is 
no time for a long process that we have got to bring this process to an 
end and you’ve got to speed up the process etcetera and very often 
these junior officials are fearful. They don’t have the seniority or the 
assurance – the self assurance to say to whoever, that this is not the 
way it is going to be done and this is in essence when we refer to about 
“pressure from above” where we have undue influence, really, brought 
to bear on officials in the course of their wor k. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: And that pressure from above could be genuine or not 
genuine I imagine, it could be genuine but mistaken or it could be not 
genuine and intended to serve illegal purposes.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     Ja exactly so not all pressure is 
necessarily bad. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 94 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Although wearing the process hat I 
have strongly advised the Executives not to interfere simply because 
they think that the process is taking longer than they would p refer and 
evaluation of a tender often is a time consuming process and if it is to 
be done correctly time and effort and resources must be invested in 
that exercise.  I’m not suggesting for a moment that we should allow 
tenders to take as long as they do b efore they get awarded, some of it 
is unacceptably long but we do have interference in the sense that 
people want to get to the result quickly without any corrupt motive.  I 
10 
have less of a problem with that, I have more of a problem when there 
is a specific outcome in mind and there’s being pressure being brought 
to bear on the recommending team and I will come to that in the context 
of the award to Neotel where the initial 
– the CFET made 
recommendations to say let us award to Neotel, T-Systems is not the 
one we want to award to and the Board constantly rejected that and 
eventually the recommendation changed and it came back as, let us 
then make this award to T-Systems.  So I think that is a good example 
of pressure from above.     
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You can now move on to the 
20 
implementation and just be brief on it.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     I’ll be brief Chair I’ll mention – if 
there’s any bullet points that I skip and counsel, please, if there’s 
anything that you want me to deal with in more deta il, please do so but 
I will cherry-pick perhaps...(intervention).  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 95 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     A few of the points I wanted to 
mention.  I think the first is just poor contract management where we 
are now in the contract s tage – we are in the implementation stage, the 
contract is supposed to be properly managed but we find that penalty 
clauses, breach clauses are not enforced despite the fact that we have 
sub-standard service being provided and undertakings that are made 
that are not adhered to but because of poor contract management there 
is no energy put into enforcing these breach clauses.  We also have 
suppliers who made price very differently to the pricing that they gave 
10 
us in the tender phase. So we get overcharged, o verpriced – goods are 
overpriced and I think because of poor contract management, 
sometimes, our organs of State are seen as cash cows and we pay far 
more than we ought to, had there been a focused and diligent effort to 
manage contracts.  The second perta ins to abuse of variation 
procedures, I’ve mentioned this earlier where a contract gets awarded 
for X rand and before you know it this contract has been increased in 
value.  Sometimes the amounts, when compared to the original amount 
are quite staggering and Chair even recently in the context of provision 
of legal services we have seen how a contract awarded to a firm to 
20 
provide X service grows in scope and in value which is a very troubling 
matter for me but that is one of the issues which I think is of gr eat 
concern...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: But in those cases where the price changes or the 
scope increases, there would have had to be somebody within the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 96 of 208 
 
company who is the one who must agree to – or the expansion of the 
scope or the increase of the price because the service provider, 
whether it’s a law firm or any other service provider would have no right 
to unilaterally increase the price or the scope isn’t it?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     That is correct, a contract – a 
process of contract variation  is meant to follow – there’s an ordered – 
an orderly process that is supposed to be followed.  If you want to add 
on a certain value to a contract it must be approved before that 
amendment is made by the person with delegated authority for contract 
amendment that I spoke – for contract award that I spoke about earlier.  
10 
Then treasury says, if your variation exceeds 15% or 15million of the 
original contract value then you as Transnet can’t make this decision by 
yourself, it must then be escalated to treasur y for prior written approval 
before you can proceed and my concern is that in the instance that I 
have in mind, I haven’t seen evidence of that.  
CHAIRPERSON: Because I would imagine that absent an agreement 
from anybody from the company to the expansion of  the scope or the 
increase of the price, the company would not be obliged to pay for the 
expanded part of the scope or to pay the price that falls outside the 
agreed price. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:   Chair that is correct, I mean, there 
has to be a legal process for that contract amendment to be properly 
enforced.  The situation that I had in mind is when payment has to 
happen and let’s say the supplier charged us R10.00 a unit in his RFP 
document he sites R10.00 a unit but when the invoice comes it is 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 97 of 208 
 
perhaps at say R12.00 a unit and because of our inadequate contract 
management processes we don’t always pick up that price variation.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so that could be a situation where there are just 
genuine weaknesses within your system or you could be dealing with a 
situation where somebody within the system has corrupt motives.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   Again, both of those scenarios 
apply, it could just be poor but innocent practices.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     Or mistakes but very often there’s 
a darker motive that leads to this.  Chair and maybe the last item I’ll 
10 
mention, the second last perhaps is, unexplained sessions to third 
parties.  There’s nothing inherently wrong with a session but when a 
tender gets awarded to A) you expect A) to be providing this service, 
yet often we see that A) cedes that contract or part of the contract to 
B), now it has to be with Transnet’s prior knowledge and approval but 
company B) is not the company that went through the rigorous tende r 
process and I think there needs to be a higher level of vigilance before 
agreeing to a session that goes from the winning tenderer to some 
other entity that hasn’t gone through that evaluation process.  
CHAIRPERSON: I wonder – I wonder whether a session such as the 
20 
one you’re talking about is compatible with the whole nature of a 
tender, is it compatible with the whole nature and purpose of a tender 
because what’s the point of selecting from let say 10 bidders – a 
particular bidder if that bidder can subse quently ensure that, that job is 
done by somebody – somebody else and not by it and somebody was 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 98 of 208 
 
not even among the 10 who had put in bids.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     Yes and it’s a very interesting 
question that you raise and I must say I’m not aware o ff-hand of any 
case law that has specifically addressed whether a session is 
compatible with a fair tendering process.  I know that when these RFP’s 
are issued to the market it comes with standard terms and conditions 
and usually a draft contract which con tains a clause which says that 
with Transnet’s prior approval that the tenderer could cede or that 
session would be permitted subject to Transnet’s prior approval which 
is a fairly common practice I suppose in the commercial world but I 
10 
think the question you are raising is if I followed a tender process to 
select company A) and company A) has met all the requirements but 
now company A) cedes that contract to company B) who I have not 
evaluated, is that still a fair tender process, I think what would be 
required is that if we were to agree to this cedent stepping in that there 
would have to be a robust and thorough evaluation of all the criteria 
that applied when we awarded to company A).  So there can’t just be a 
quick, very superficial assessment of the ca pacity of the cedent.  
CHAIRPERSON: And it certainly could open an avenue for abuse, 
certainly in certain circumstances, maybe not in all but certainly in 
20 
certain circumstances could open an avenue for abuse that could 
undermine the whole tender process.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     And also collusion Chair, because 
company A) may well have a back-to-back agreement with company B) 
to say, if I win the tender I will just open the door for you to come in.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 99 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:    I thing session, while it is not an 
uncommon practice, I think if there isn’t a sufficient level of vigilance 
we can open ourselves up to very abusive practices in this regard.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, Mr Volmink I’m now going to short-
circuit your evidence, there are certain slides I will take the liberty of 
not taking you through because I feel that the issues might have 
already been thoroughly interrogated by itself, can I take you through 
slide number 18 and you can give us a summary of what you are 
conveying in that slide. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:     Chair what I’m conveying in this 
slide is the evaluation methodology that was followed in Transnet 
before the PPPFA applied to Transnet.  I mentioned that on the 7 t h of 
December 2011 already the Mi nister of Finance indicated that the 
Preferential Procurement Framework Act and its regulations would 
apply to Transnet but exempted Transnet for a period of 1 year until 7 
December 2012.  So what the – what this slide depicts is the 
methodology that was followed in Transnet around about 2012 and 
prior.  Chair you will see that there are two methods, it’s referred to as 
method 1 and method 2.  Method 1 was the default method and it 
20 
follows the classic 2 phase methodology of the public sector.  Phase 1 
being that you must clear certain thresholds and phase 2 being you’ll 
now be evaluated on price and preference, that’s the typical 2 stage 
process but because Transnet was not bound by PPPFA there were 
certain variances that were introduced on that classic 2 st age 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 100 of 208 
 
methodology.  So if you look at method 1 Chair, there is a first 
threshold which is marked in red and the word – and the letters LC 
appear next to it.  LC simply stands for local content and where local 
content was required, for example with certain de signated sectors, 
treasury gave a long list of designated sectors where a bidder had to 
commit at a certain percentage of its bid price would be spent in RSA 
and only those bidders who met that minimum would then pass to the 
second gate.  The second threshold Chair, was made up of a 
combination of what is referred to as SD which stands for supplier 
development and the BEE score card.  So under supplier development a 
10 
bidder would be asked to indicate how many – let’s say how many new 
jobs they would create as a result of the award of the tender.  How 
many jobs would be preserved, how many artisans would be trained, 
how many local suppliers would be used.  There was a whole bucket of 
indicators which fell under the heading supplier development and then 
points were given for that as well as the BEE score cards.  So if you 
got – if you were a level 1 you would get your full points and that would 
form a combined number of points.  You would be told for example as a 
bidder you need to meet 40% based on a combinatio n of SDBEE and 
only those bidders who then passed would get to the – to being 
20 
assessed on functionality or quality.  This is the typical technical 
requirements.  When bidders passed all those gates they would then 
get to the second phase of the tender wher e price was scored.  As well 
as SD and preference would be scored at phase 2. In phase 1 it is 
simply a disqualifier.  You need to meet a minimum threshold.  In phase 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 101 of 208 
 
2 the idea was to differentiate between bidders who give a superior SD 
offering and those who just met, met the basics.  That was the 
underlying rationale.  And under preference points would be given 
based on the scorecard as well as terms which I think are probably 
unique Transnet terms at that point.  We said in addition to the 
scorecard.  Points would be given for what was called FRC current and 
FRC simply means Further Recognition Criteria.  The idea was to say 
we see your BEE scorecard but your BEE scorecard could have been 
issued up until a year ago.  Because a BEE scorecard is valid for a 
year.  So if I evaluate the scorecard today it may depict your situation a 
10 
year ago or up to a year ago.  But the idea with FRC current was to say 
tell us what is your current black ownership or your current 
management control or employment equity.  And to the extent that you 
exceeded certain minimum targets that were set you could earn a few 
extra let us just call it bonus points for lack of a better word.  That was 
referred to as Further Recognition Criteria current and then also there 
was something called FRC future Further Recognition Criteria future.  
This would apply where a bidder may have a very low BEE score at the 
moment but he says over the course of this contract period in future by 
the end of this contract I give an undertaking which you can i ncorporate 
20 
into the contract with me I give an undertaking to improve my black 
ownership, black management to certain levels.  That was I think the 
concept around method 1.  Method 2 I will not really deal with that.  
That is really where quality was broug ht into operation again in phase 
2.  That was very seldom if ever applied.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 102 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But that is basically the methodology 
which applied. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And slide 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before that.. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  You said 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before that in slide 18 you do have 
reference to quality both under method 1 and method 2.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.  So, so I think with method 1 we 
test quality once.  It is by way of a threshold. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the threshold oh okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes if you make that.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything under method 1 is for threshold, basic 
requirements? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct.  So quality would be by way 
of one threshold.  You must make that threshold being 70%.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  With method 2 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There were certain instances w here 
we said we want to not to just check who meets the basic  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you want to see how much above the basic  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The basic exactly  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 103 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You go. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Exactly and certain points  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Were then allocated under phase 2.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Now because we were excepted from 
PPPFA I think the courts at one stage had said you cannot revisit this  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Quality again but we were not 
subject to PPPFA so there was a degree of flexibility.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Around that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We can now go to slide 21. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Did you say 21? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes 21. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  21 yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  On page 117. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair this is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry on what page?  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  117, page 117. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now you are dealing with the situation 
around 2013/2015. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  2013/2015 Chair.   
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 104 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  This is now when PPPFA applied to 
us so we cannot ignore PPPFA.  And what this simply depicts is a 
series of steps which is now more aligned to PPPFA.  What we show is 
that bidders first had to move through a prequalification or a 
responsiveness test. So you had to provide all your relevant 
documents, meet minimum prequalification criteria before you could 
enter now phase 1 being the threshold phase.  And phase 1 would 
consist again of local content and functionality or technical criteria.  
We 
were 
– 
we 
engaged senior counsel 
on 
whether supplier 
10 
development could also be incorporated as a threshold at that phase 1 
and based on counsel’s interpretation of the legislation they felt that it 
would not be incompatible to allow for that threshold to be applied in 
phase 1 so SD was brought in in phase 1.  And then in phase 2 Chair it 
was more classic PPPFA where we awarded simply on price and BEE. 
No FRC or anything like that was then taken into account because that 
was not compatible with the legislation.  We would then invite bidders 
to provide us with w hat is called bafo’s or best and final offers.  And 
then a final evaluation based on either 80/20 or 90/10 and that is when 
the – the award would be made.   
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  May I now refer you to your slide 
24 when you talking about the Tran snet current remedial action plans?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.  Chair I think what I simply 
mention on this slide is that there have been various remedial…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the one on page 120?  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 105 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It is 120 Chair. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  120. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  120. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The – there have been various 
remedial steps that have been taken by the current board and 
management to address the issues within Transnet.  I will mentio n only 
a few of them.  In the fourth bullet point I talk about the fact that this 
sub-committee of the board, the acquisition and disposals committee 
that was delegated to award tenders that that committee has been 
10 
dissolved.  In the next bullet point I me ntioned the establishment of the 
finance and investment committee with a mandate to include oversight 
of processes for high value tenders.  The next bullet point talks about 
an integrated assurance plan where assurance needs to be provided by 
a number of role players within supply chain. Not just one particular 
role.  So management must understand what is its assurance role?  
What can it assure when a tender passes say the CPO?  Then the CPO 
says this tender we can issue this tender to the market, what is t he 
assurance that must be provided?  What is the role of legal risk and 
compliance and how do they all work in this integrated way?  That is 
20 
what the integrated assurance plan talks about.  I also mention that the 
delegations 
of 
authority 
have 
been 
revised  
to 
identify 
those 
weaknesses that have been exploited in the past as well and maybe the 
last bullet point the implementation of a lifestyle audit policy which has 
been applied recently.  Chair the last slide – sorry Mr Mokoene I am not 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 106 of 208 
 
sure if you are there. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  The last slide the one where you are 
dealing with your recommendations.  It is slide 26 Chair it is page 122.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair so on this slide I make a 
couple of recommendations because I have been observing th is for a 
while.  And the first recommendation that I make is that supply chain 
needs to be elevated to the level of the EXCO.  At the moment supply 
chain is represented by the Chief Financial Officer at EXCO.  And I 
think the Chief Financial Officer will d o his best to articulate whatever 
the concerns are of supply chain.  But supply chain needs a voice at 
10 
the highest level of the organisation which is the board well apart from 
– and I – which is the EXCO apart from the board of course.  And it is 
at that level where I think we need to ensure that there is 
representation.  The second bullet point Chair that I recommend is that 
the boards and the EXCO’s must receive in -depth supply chain 
management training.  We have seen that…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Volmink can we go back to your first 
recommendation. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a practical level how should that happen namely 
20 
providing representation at – of SCM at EXCO level? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I think practically Chair there is a 
position that is referred to as the Group Supply Chain Officer.  This is 
the CPO for lack who has broad oversight over the other CPO’s and 
this is a position currently at the corporate level.  And I am suggesting 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 107 of 208 
 
that that individual who occupies that position should in fact be part of 
the EXCO team.  Supply chain is not a back office function.  If we get 
supply chain wrong it has far reaching ramifications for the 
organisation and I think it would appropriate for supply chain to be 
represented at the EXCO level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe there could be one of two possible – there 
could be two possible scenarios.  Maybe one would be representation 
of SCM at EXCO level in the sense that one of the EXCO members 
must be an SCM person which may be what you are having in mind.  
But another one may well be that there need not be that kind of 
10 
representation at EXCO level but that whenever EXCO has to deal with 
SCM matters they should be in such a meeting somebody with SCM 
expertise.  Are you – are you married to any particular one of that kind 
of voice at EXCO level SCM voice or not necessarily but you might 
prefer one or the other or either should be adequate.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  H’m.  I think that both – both models 
are acceptable.  I am more inclined to th e first model where there is a 
permanent presence of SCM at the EXCO level.  When if a particular 
matter gets raised by Executive X the SCM person can alert the EXCO 
to certain supply chain implications or ramifications rather than saying 
20 
we will call in that person as and when there is an item on SCM’s 
specifically to be discussed.  Very often decisions that are made have 
supply chain ramifications.  It may not be under the heading on the 
agenda that says supply chain but if there is a permanent presence o n 
EXCO it is probably more likely that EXCO could be alerted to supply 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 108 of 208 
 
chain ramifications or implications of its decisions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well one thought which comes to mind is that while a 
permanent SCM representation at EXCO might be good but one 
argument against it might be that there may be other streams, units 
within the entire company which also feel that they should be 
represented at EXCO level and – and the concern would arise how big 
will this EXCO end up being if it is going to do that?  Whereas  if you 
say even if we are not talking about permanent representation but in 
regard to certain matters that fall under these EXCO must bring in an 
SCM person to – to be part of that discussion so that whatever decision 
10 
is taken they have the benefit of tha t input.  Then you do not have that 
other argument in that case. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I hear you Chair.  Of course the 
difference with SCM 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is that it poses such a – a critical 
risk 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  To the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Perhaps unlike all the other 
functions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They could potentially want to be 
there as well. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 109 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja it may w ell be that it is the right way to 
go. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just putting possible arguments for reflection.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And I think that both ought to be 
considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I was making the point of course that 
in the second bullet point that it is really at the level of board and 
EXCO that we have seen the most spectacular breaches of governance 
10 
processes happens there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At Transnet? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is where the most breaches or the most 
serious breaches as far as you are aware were happening?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And I am not saying that it does not  
happen at the official levels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Certainly officials have made their 
fair share of contribution to  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To this but the most spectacular 
examples have happened there . 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 110 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And it is at that level  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Where almost no input, no training, 
no awareness of supply chain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And it is the multiplicity of rules 
governing supply chain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Is not – is not brought to the 
10 
attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I mention of course transparency.  
Now we have laws governing transparency but treas ury has recently 
indicated in one of the instruction notes that they actually reserve the 
right to invite the public to a bid adjudication committee and it may well 
be something which should take on greater momentum as we – as we 
go forward.  I make the point that the regulatory framework needs to be 
fixed Chair.  I have indicated that we just need far greater coherence 
and far greater clarity on this ocean of regulatory requirements which 
20 
governs supply chain.  We need a lot more – we need the whole 
process to be rationalised a lot more.  I also mentioned this notion of 
addressing the bullying culture.  I have spoken earlier about pressure 
from above.  What I am really talking about is bullying where 
employees are bullied to comply with things that they kno w to be 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 111 of 208 
 
wrong.  And I have even suggested that it – that the legislature should 
perhaps consider that it should be a dismissible offence for a – for a 
senior executive or anyone else to bring undue pressure to bear on 
officials to do things which are contr ary to the regulatory requirements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But that must be a dismissible thing without any…  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Probably without. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Legislature. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I mean obviously if the undue p ressure well I 
do not know if it would be undue but if the pressure is based on 
10 
legitimate considerations and there really is nothing nefarious about 
that. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be taken as legitimate pressure on 
subordinates for example to not to delay certain things.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without saying they must not comply with procedural 
requirements.   But once you have pressure that is being put on 
subordinates for illegitimate reasons, for nefariou s reasons that must 
be dismissible. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja.  I fully agree so I mean even at 
the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It would not assist someone charged 
with this sort of bullying. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 112 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To say no but there is no – there is 
no legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That covers it.  What I am saying is 
to make it – to make it clearer and to send a clear message at the 
executive level even if it is in the form of  a national treasury instruction 
or something that we can say this is the expectation of you.  You will 
not bring your seniority to bear to get supply chain people to do things 
which are contrary to the prescripts. I think it would help to focus the 
10 
mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well part of what is important is to make sure 
that at the top you have the right people.  People who have integrity.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if you have the right people at the top and 
somebody below tries to do something wrong a subordinate will know 
that if I report to the top what this one is doing to me, putting undue 
pressure they will deal with this properly.  But if the subordinate knows 
that if I go to the top they are – they are not people of integrity then 
the employee, the subordinate does not have the incentive to – to 
20 
report this.  So – but it may be that it is a combination of things that 
needs to be looked at. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Combination.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And no particular one is an answer to all problems. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes precisely.  I maybe just mention 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 113 of 208 
 
one more and that is there should perhaps be some independent body 
that is created to review procurement decisions particularly when there 
are complaints which co mes from unsuccessful bidders.  At the moment 
suppliers must run to – to court for review.  We do have an internal 
ombud function where complaints are referred to external attorneys for 
review and consideration but if there is an official body which could 
serve as some sort of adjudicatory body with decision powers I think it 
would – it would give greater confidence to suppliers to bring their 
complaints forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that – that might be quite helpful because when 
10 
these matters go to courts they take long to be resolved. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the court system takes long and – and in the 
meantime you might have a community that is entitled or expects a 
certain service to be rendered and that service cannot be ren dered for 
x number of years because there is still a dispute going through the 
courts.  But of course – well I happen to know that the leadership of the 
judiciary, the heads of the superior courts, the high courts, the appeal 
courts and the constitutional court did take a decision a few years ago 
to say to the effect that heads of court must be able to expedite certain 
20 
matters and I think some of those matters are tender matters if I am not 
mistaken so that they should not have followed the long route and 
maybe lawyers do not use that or are not aware of that because the 
attempt is to try and make sure that you know these tender disputes do 
not take too long before they are resolved.   
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 114 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And Chair I think that we would 
always want to ensure that there is access to the courts of course that 
an aggrieved bidder knows that it is his ultimate refuge but the internal 
processes can be – can be speeded up but if there is – before we even 
get to courts if there is an alternative mechanism in place a credible 
mechanism hopefully even with statutory powers I think it would help 
aggrieved bidders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course while that might be helpful what will have 
10 
to borne in mind is that you c ould well end up with even a longer 
waiting period because what you would be saying is if you are 
dissatisfied with the decision to award a tender to X before you go to 
court you must go to this body and this body takes a certain time makes 
a decision and maybe you are still dissatisfied so you must still go to 
court anyway so you have made the process much longer.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but all of them needs to – need to be considered 
to see how best to take your various interests. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja. 
20 
ADV 
PHILLIP 
MOKOENA 
SC : 
 
Take 
us 
through 
your 
next 
recommendation. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I think the only remaining ones I will 
mention is the importance of continuous assessment of competencies 
and ensuring continuous training and development.  Chair I think that 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 115 of 208 
 
the ordinary supply chain buyer wants to be developed.  They want to 
do the right thing but very often they – training and development does 
not happen as frequently as is required and I think there needs to b e 
possibly full time capacity built into the SOC’s to ensure that there is 
ongoing assessment of competencies and an enhancement of skill.  I 
mentioned earlier that whilst many of our problems are due to nefarious 
motives and corruption a good chunk of our  problems is as a result of 
innocent bungling and administrative mistakes.  And I think if we can 
lessen that by heightening the level of skills and awareness I think we 
would do well.  Perhaps I will stop on this point.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you to Exhibit 
BB2.1A the very same document but please go to page 4.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I am on page 4. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You will see…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Mokoene I cannot help but say that it feels 
like after we have gone that far like going back to square one.  Yes.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It will be – if you go to page 4 Mr 
Volmink you will see that through the slides you have covered quite a 
great deal of your evidence. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are not going to repeat those things 
that you have said under governance and you can then go to page 8 
just for completeness to give us the structure of the governance 
function. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the – on page 8 I simply 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 116 of 208 
 
highlight how the governance function is structured.  I make the point 
that the governance function reports into the chief supply chain officer 
and at the moment at the corporate centre it consists of a very small 
team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry my – my copy is not very c lear in terms of what 
is at the top.  There is it CSCO?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  C – it is CSCO which stands for 
Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chief. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Supply Chain Officer. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Governance reports into the Chief 
Supply Chain Officer and there are various managers who report into 
my function one for policy and standards, one for risk and compliance, 
one for transactional advice and so on.  Chair I should also point out 
that at the operating that at the level of the operating divisions there 
are also governance capacity or people who will perform governance 
functions at the operating division level.  My – the two concerns I 
highlight on – in paragraph 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPH EN VOLMINK:  Is that firstly many of the – the staff 
are relatively junior.  I mean I would be the first to say that at the 
operating division level there are some very good people a – who 
perform governance functions but many are relatively junior and the y 
are more susceptible to being …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 117 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To pressures? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To pressures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bullying? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The second is that they report into 
the Chief Procurement Officer who is the very end or that is the very 
function that – where the governance individuals are supposed to 
perform a watchdog or some sort of oversight body.  So those are the 
two weaknesses that I have identified.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and if you turn to page 9 you will 
see that from paragraph 22 you are dealing with the delegations of 
authority framework.  We have already canvassed that …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  We have. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  At length. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr – you do not need to go back there. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And if you go to page 11 as well you will 
see that you have already canvassed with the Chair the procurement 
20 
process.  We even dealt with the procurement circle.  Am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now go to page 13 … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  From paragraph 35 you are also 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 118 of 208 
 
addressing the issues relevant to the bid evaluation process.  Those 
have been comprehensively dealt with unless there is something that 
you which to highlight.  We can pass through them.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair there is nothing further that I 
want – it really deals with the evaluation process as I discussed earlier.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Where I want to take you Mr  Volmink it is 
page 15 – 1-5. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Because there you are raising serious 
issues and addressing areas of concern.  If you can please take us 
through those concerns in relation to the experiences that you 
encountered at Transnet. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  Chair so what this section of 
my statement deals with are  the concerns which we had and which we 
sought to address in our procurement manual being the Procurement 
Procedures Manual or the PPM.  The first concern is mentioned at the 
bottom of page 15 and that is in paragraph 45.1 …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And that relates to the applicability 
of the procurement rules.  I make the point or the PPM then makes it 
clear that procurement rules apply to all acquisitions regardless of 
value.  Now that and again may seem self -evident but this was written 
at the time when the Board had begun to assume key decision making 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 119 of 208 
 
powers for procurement and we thought it was necessary to make it 
clear that procurement rules applies from the lowest value to the 
highest value transaction within the orga nisation and that is one of the 
– the issues that is dealt with.  Chair the second concern deals with the 
so called One Person Acquisition Council.  I have dealt with that earlier 
in my evidence but that is referred to in paragraphs 45.2 and following 
and I made the observation that this is not best practice at all.  That it 
needs to be a multidisciplinary body and what steps were taken to 
ensure that by the time it gets to this One Person Acquisition Council 
that it has gone through various individuals and  – and bodies who have 
10 
– would could review it. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I could move onto the next one 
Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The next one yes – the confinement. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK: 
 
The 
next 
one 
deals 
with 
confinements and here Chair I make the point that the – the default rule 
is supposed to be open tender processes.  I make the point here that 
confinements are a deviation and the point I want to emphasise is a 
section in the PPM that warns against the abuse of confinement as it 
20 
would have the effect of entrenching monopolies.  If I give multiple 
awards through a confinement process to one particular entity I am 
entrenching monopolies and the PPM in fact specifically said that you 
need to be vigilant about confinements because if it is abused it 
creates a monopolistic situation. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 120 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess this is the time when you must tell me 
what justification is put forward for confinements because I cannot 
understand your complaint or concern about its abuse if I do not know 
the justification that is being put forward.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  So Chair I think that the 
justification for confinement - firstly let me say that confinement is not 
unknown even universally.  So if I look at the – the UN’s model law on 
confinement they allow for what is called restricted bidding under 
certain narrowly defined circumstances.  Treasury of course as well but 
in the Transnet environment …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – but maybe let us – let us start with the 
definition of confinement.  You – it is not the same as the one source 
exception or is it the same?  Is it simply – is it simply that it is a tender 
but not an open tender?  It is a restricted tender in the sense that only 
a few bidders are allowed?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair it is – it is the latter.  So it is – 
it is a – it is a deviation from the open bidding process.  It is allowed to 
permit only a few or possibly only one bidder to participate.  One of the 
grounds may well be that it is the sole sup plier situation.  Another – 
another scenario could be that we are – are dealing with an extremely 
20 
urgent matter that needs to be dealt with quickly and in fact Chair the 
grounds for confinement are dealt with on page 18.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you go to – Chair if you go to 
paragraph 45.4 but where you see the footnote 11 I think that is where 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 121 of 208 
 
you start defining confinements.  Am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Sorry.  Just the reference again 
(intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you go to page 17, 1 -7 … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You will see that from paragraph 45.4 – 
if you go to the last sentence – are you there? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  After the word Transnet – then starting 
from where it says confinements were thus (indistinct).  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is where you want to take the 
Chair? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You can proceed then to ventilate 
those issues. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So Chair the – the grounds for 
confinement that prevailed in Transnet for – for a number of years 
covers these areas.  So - firstly if there is genuine urgency as I 
mentioned and business – it is not as a result of bad planning and 
20 
something needs to be acquired urgently that was recognised as one of 
the grounds for deviation from the open bidding process.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You spoke earlier on about an emergency and that is 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 122 of 208 
 
where we talked about self-created emergency and poor planning.  So 
why do we have a different term now confinement?  Why do we not 
stick to emergency? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  No, no I understand what you 
are saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not blaming you.  I am trying to understand the 
distinctions. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When do you call this confinement?  When do you call 
it an emergency? 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  An emergency, yes – and an 
emergency is I think a term that gets used to refer to the most extreme 
forms of – of urgency.  Typically where there is a threat to life or to 
property or serious business disruption or whatever it is.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  So – so then you have another scenario 
where – which may not fit in with – within the ambit of emergency but 
nevertheless is urgent?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is urgent …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  For – and it must not of course result 
20 
from bad planning and all of those things …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But that was then recognised as …  
CHAIRPERSON:  That would then fall under confinement?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 123 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct.  The – the other ground is 
where there is limited supplier source.  I cannot – let us say it is a 
particular commodity that only one or a few entities are able to provide.  
That was recognised as one ground for confinement – a second ground.  
A third ground related to standardisation.  If – if the company has 
standardised through a particular model or a particular way of – of 
doing things.  Then if I needed services that needed to interface with 
this model I would confine it to those who services are compatible.  
Otherwise you could have issues where what we acquire is not – it does 
10 
not interface easily with what is already there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course – and I may be going back to the issue that 
I raised about the one source – one supplier … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Clause – if you talk about standardisation where you 
need a supplier who can provide you with something that meets your 
particular standard or a particular standardisation that you have in your 
company then of course if there is no urgency again I would see no 
reason why you cannot put up to the mark and – and say this is what I 
want and if it is that particular supplier who is the only one who 
20 
responds or those – those two or three that is fine but what if you are 
closing – you are excluding somebody by not putting out – putting the 
tender out to the market excluding somebody that you might not know 
… 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 124 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who might be able to give you exactly what you want 
… 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a cheaper price maybe. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes and Chair it is exactly for that 
reason … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That we said a confinement cannot 
just go straight to the GCE for approval.  It needs  to go through these 
various levels of review …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So that the questions that you are 
raise … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  If it is not asked by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  One individual or one body …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It could be asked by the next one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Different people, ja. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So that confinement is not simply 
there for the asking … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And it just gets – but there may well 
be instances. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 125 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Let us take – I will just use an 
example perhaps off the top of my head.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It may not be the best exampl e … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But let us take a brake block …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  On a train … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Where we have standardised through 
a particular type of train and a part icular type of brake block. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So if I need more brake blocks I 
cannot issue necessarily an open tender for …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Any other kind of brake block. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It will be in compatible with that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Model of train. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So that may well be an example of 
where standardisation … 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 126 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Would justify a decision to say only 
those suppliers that meet that requirement we are going to go to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No - I think as long as one you – you make it 
open to whoever can give you what you want.  Then that  is fine.  I think 
the problem arises when you confine it to maybe one or two but if you 
were to make it open – if the position is only those two can give you 
what you want then those are the only two who would respond.  
Therefore you would be fine but just in case … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There are others. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is somebody who can actually give you the 
same or even better if you make it open you might actually get better 
value. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And I think that is why Treasury has 
now said you can decide your confinements only on …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The ground that there is only one …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  A sole supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  If there is any other … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Open it. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  You must come to…  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 127 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Either to Treasury … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To approve … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That you can confine or  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Issue an open tender …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And I think that the other ground was 
10 
where goods and services are highly specialised and largely identical 
to those that were previously procured from the supplier.  So let us say 
I just want a continuation of a particular service and it is a highly 
complex nature.  I want to add on a certain component then I can 
confine to the entity to whom I have given the initial contract.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes but for you to go on confinement you 
have to ensure that this specific standards or criteria exist before you 
can even decide whether or not to go on confin ement? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is absolutely correct Chair.  The 
grounds for confinement had to exist and they had to be properly 
20 
scrutinised before they would be approved precisely because of all the 
warnings in the PPM about its potential for abu se and the creation of 
monopolies etcetera.  These grounds had to be met.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now some of the concerns that you 
are raising Mr Volmink you have already also canvassed them.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 128 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you go to page 19. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You have spoken about the contract 
variation.  Am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct.  We have dealt with that.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You do not have to deal with  it.  That is 
the reason why we had to take much more time …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With the slides and if you go to page 20 
10 
preferential procurement and supply development.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  I think I have dealt with that as 
well. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We have dealt with that yes.  Page 21 
paragraph 45.8 you have also dealt with that.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  45.8 yes again we talk about FRC 
and all the things I dealt with in my presentation.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and page 22 – 45.9 we have dealt 
with all those issues. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  All of those have been dealt with.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Up until you go to page 24. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You have addressed the Chair with the – 
on the issues of the risk factors …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 129 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And we have also dealt with the changes 
– you know – of the PPM …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is that on pages 25 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  25. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And following? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We have addressed those issues. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  We have addressed those issues 
Chair. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Through the slides Chair we have 
done that and page 28 we have done the same …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes we have covered. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And you have also dealt with your 
observations and recommendations - page 31. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Where I want to take you it is the 
Part 2 of your statement - from page 34 Chair - where we are now 
dealing with specific contracts. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now the first transaction that you are 
dealing with here is in relation to the Neotel Network Service Contract.  
Am I correct? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And what type of services were required 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 130 of 208 
 
from Neotel? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well I think network services would 
cover a range of IT related services largely ensuring that the network 
capabilities within Transnet can meet its operational requirements.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And when these services wer e required 
were you consulted or was governance involved in this?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In this particular tender Chair 
governance was required to make input on this.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Can you take us through the input 
or the involvement of governance? 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So Chair the RFP was issued in 2013 
for various network services.  A number of bidders responded to this 
tender but at an early stage in the tender evaluation process there 
were two concerns that were raised and wh ere governance in put was 
required.  I will take you through what those concerns were and what 
the governance view is on it …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But this is the tender that eventually 
was awarded to Neotel but then overturned by the Group Chief 
Executive and awarded to T-Systems and I will deal with that aspect at 
20 
length in a while. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Let us now address – you know – 
the address … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The first … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Issues that you – you say that there 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 131 of 208 
 
were issues of concern.  The first one being the conflict of interest.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  The first issue I deal with in 
paragraphs 82 and following and this related to a conflict of interest 
between T-Systems South Africa (Pty) Ltd which was the bidder that 
responded to this tender of 2013 and another company called Datacon 
International.  They shared a common parent company – T-Systems.  
The German based company and I summarise what the issues were as 
follows Chair.  I point out that T-Systems International was the majority 
shareholder - of course of this South African bidding company called T-
Systems South Africa and it is all – it was also the shareholder of 
10 
Datacon.  Now before this tender was issued during 2012 Transnet 
issued 
another 
tender 
for 
a 
service 
provider 
to 
conduct 
a 
comprehensive due diligence exercise on its network services and the 
outcome of that due diligence – I think informed this tender – and 
Datacon won that particular tender for th e due diligence exercise.  The 
RFP which Datacon responded to and where they won the tender that 
contained the clause that said and I quote it at the end of page 34.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 82.1 Chair. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  82.1 – the clause that Datacon – the 
clause in the RFP that Datacon responded to there was a clause which 
20 
advised bidders as follows.  It said:  
“Should they be successful with regards to this RFP 
for due diligence they will then be excluded from 
tendering, partnering or advising bidders for the 
main network services tender.”  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 132 of 208 
 
The tender that was then to follow and as I mentioned Datacon was 
awarded this due diligence tender.  Chair the – there difficulty here is 
that the letter of intent that was then issued to Dataco n - when it won 
the tender – it went much further than the terms of the RFP.  The RFP 
said if you as the bidder – if you win this tender you cannot participate 
in the network services tender that is coming because you are doing 
the due diligence but the le tter of intent went further and stated that 
the service provider and/or its affiliates agrees to being excluded.  Now 
remember T-Systems was not a respondent on the due diligence tender 
Datacon was but Transnet and Datacon – when Transnet issued an LOI 
10 
or Letter of Award to Datacon a clause was added that you and your 
affiliates are not allowed to participate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the ultimate tender? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In the ultimate tender … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That was to come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which would – which should mean T-Systems because 
of the parental …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Because of the common …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Parental connection? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Because of the common parent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, should not be able to tender … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the ultimate tender. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct, correct Chair … 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 133 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And in fact the high value tender is a 
team of – of external – an external audit firm …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who does reviews on some of the 
high value tenders.  They also felt that T-Systems ought to have been 
eliminated because of their affiliation with – with Datacon. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair you do not have to go there.  For 
reference purposes that report of the high tender value team is 
contained in EXHIBIT BBC – BB 2.1C on – from page 840 but 
10 
Mr Volmink has already summarised its …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Findings and so it is not necessary for 
us to go through them.  You may proceed from paragraph 82.4 …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Where you identify the two risks. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes.  So I think that there – this 
issue was extensively debated and for – from a governance perspective 
I think that there were two risks that had to be accommodated or 
addressed.  The first was that if T-Systems was to be disqualified 
20 
based on the fact that it was an affiliate of Datacon there was a 
concern that they might well have had some reason to challenge its 
disqualification on the following grounds and I list those grounds in 
83.4.1 and following.  It could have been argued that the terms of the 
LOI were invalid to the exte nt that they purported to incorporate 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 134 of 208 
 
obligations that were not contemplated in the RFP to which Datacon 
had responded and as I had stated there was concern that whilst the 
due diligence RFP prohibited only the successful bidder from 
participating the LOI now went further and also disqualified affiliates.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So I think that was the one – the one 
concern but the second concern that we had Chair is that this 
disqualification …  
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am – I am just not sure – I am just thinking 
about that the concern about that disqualification.  Would not – is the 
10 
position not that the rationale behind the prohibition that if you have 
done due diligence you should not avail yourself for the ultimate 
tender? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that through due diligence you would gain certain 
advantage … 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would be privy to certain information?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if you are going to be privy to certain information 
20 
your – and your sibling if you want – your sibling is going to be allowed 
to – to put in a bid there is a risk that you share that confidential 
information with your sibling because you have one parent.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And I think that was - that was 
exactly one of the concerns which – which we were troubled by …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 135 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and if… 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that – if that – if that is the rationale for saying if 
you have done the due diligence you cannot tender for the ultimate 
tender then it must follow that if anybody connected with you should not 
be able to – to tender for the ultimate tender.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  With or without an expanded letter of intent. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I – I am with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think there was an additional 
concern though … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And that is that the RFP to which 
T-Systems had responded – the main – the main network services – it 
did not contain a similar disqualifying condition.  Now R – T-Systems is 
responding yes its sister company did respond to the due diligence  but 
now it as a company T-Systems is responding and it reads this RFP and 
20 
there is no provision in that RFP that disqualifies it on the basis of its 
affiliation or it does not say any entity that responded to that bid or any 
entity which is affiliated to a company which responded will be similarly 
disqualified and Chair I think that that was one of the – we were 
concerned … 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 136 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK: 
 
About 
the 
fairness 
of 
the 
disqualification …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And we had (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was factors that were weighing upon your team?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It did – it did weigh upon us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Eventually I think that T-Systems was 
asked to go on affidavit … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To indicate under oath … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Whether they had received any kind 
of information …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And they provided an affidavit …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To the effect that that was not the 
case. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And on page 37 paragraph 83 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it looks like it is the right time to …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is the right time to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take the break 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 137 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We will deal with that after the lunch 
adjournment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   It is 1 o’ clock.  Let us take the lunch break 
and we will return at 2 o’ clock.  We adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Mokoena. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Volmink just 
before the lunch adjournment we are just about to deal with the second 
10 
predicament that you are facing, you identify th at from page 37, 
paragraph 83 of your witness statement, could you please take the 
Chair through that? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Thank you.  Chair what this issue 
relates to is a further concern regarding the evaluation of T-Systems’ 
bid.  The first issue was the conflict of interest which I dealt with 
before lunch and the second issue pertains to the rounding off of 
scores that T-Systems were given for functionality.  Now I should point 
out that there was a threshold for technical compliance which was set  
at 70%, sometimes referred to as the functionality threshold and T-
20 
Systems had missed that threshold by a fraction.  T-Systems had 
scored 69.93% and not 70.  We then had regard to the – what the 
regulations said about this and we saw that the 2011 regulat ions had a 
provisions dealing with how scores are to be rounded off.  It is 
contained 
in 
regulation 
11.4 
of 
the 
PPPFA 
regulations 
of 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 138 of 208 
 
2011...(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    May I refer you to Exhibit BP 2.1 C it 
will be a different file. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is file B is it? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    BP 2.1 C and then if you may turn to 
page 874. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes I am there. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Is that the regulation that you are 
referring the Chair to?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And then may you turn then to page 
885 with particular reference to paragraph 11.4, you may read it into 
the record and confirm whether that does that accord with your 
evidence? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the regulation reads as 
follows...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry, what regulation and what paragraph.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   We’re at page 885 with particular 
reference to 11.4.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh regulation 11 sub regulation 4? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair the regulation reads as follows, 
it says: 
 
“Points scored must be rounded off to the nearest two decimal 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 139 of 208 
 
places”. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    So this is what you are referring to that 
raised serious concern with the scoring the T-System? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair, because even if 
you round off 69.93% to the nearest two decimal places, regardless of 
what that third decimal would have been, if you round it off T-Systems 
still doesn’t make the functionality threshold.  
CHAIRPERSON:    What does rounding it off to the nearest two decimal 
places – what does that mean? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Well if you look at this example here 
10 
Chair, if you look at someone who scores 69.93% to round it off to the 
nearest two decimal places, my understanding is, one would have to 
look at what the third decimal is, so let’s say the third decimal was 6, 
so it is 69.936 because that 6 is higher than a 5 it wo uld have changed 
the 3 to a 4 but that still would not have had a knock -on effect to 
change the overall score from 69.93 to 70.  
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry what do you understand the application of 
that sub regulation would be if you applied it to 69.93%?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  What I understand this to be Chair is 
that to round it off to the nearest two decimal places, one would then 
20 
see, well what would that second decimal place – how do you round it 
off to that second decimal place being the...(interve ntion). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m very bad with anything mathematical, I only did 
arithmetic and a little bit of maths at school.  So remind me what we 
are talking about when you talk about a decimal or two decimals – 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 140 of 208 
 
decimal places. 
MR 
PETER 
STEPHEN 
VOLMINK : 
 
Chair 
let 
me 
try 
my 
best...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    That is if you know, I’m assuming that you know.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes so if one has to round off to the 
nearest – the intent here is to see whether this score of 69.93 can be 
rounded off to 70% because if they make 70% then they are 
through...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja but now you are talking about – of course I spoke 
about this specific example, let’s start with the general.  What is two 
10 
decimal places, what is one decimal place?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Okay so the first decimal place would 
be the decimal place after the point, so under – if you look at 69.9 the 
9 would be the first decimal...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:    The first 9 would be the first decimal after the 
point? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  After the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and then the digit that comes after 9 whatever it 
is would be the second decimal...(intervention).  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That would be the second decimal. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes so – but then if it says round it off to the 
nearest second – what second – nearest two decimal places it – what 
does it mean.  It doesn’t seem to say to me, maybe it’s because of my 
not understanding issues of decimal – it doesn’t say anything like, 
round it off to the nearest 10/10 for example.  So if it said that and it 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 141 of 208 
 
was 69.92 you would bring it back to 69.90 I would imagine, more or 
less but if it is 69.97 then you’d bring it closer – to what is closer which 
would be 70, that’s my kind of thinking, this is what I ’m looking 
for...(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Lets deal with it on practical terms, 
let’s take the score of 69.93 and then let’s say that you wanted to apply 
what the regulations be, what would the score of T-systems? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Just before I answer the question, 
the one way to round off is just to round off to the nearest whole 
number. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So if I have to round off 69 – let’s 
say 69.9 to the...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja if it – say round it off it’s clear you must go to 
70. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Exactly because that 9 is above 5 
and that has a knock-on effect which then changes 69.9 to 70, when it 
says I must round it off to the second decimal place I would – for that 
decimal place of 69.93 for that to change I’d have to look at what the 
third decimal is because if the third decimal is under 5 it stays as a 3. 
20 
If the third decimal is above 5 then the 3 becomes a 4 but even if that 3 
becomes a 4 the 4 is still below 5 s o it doesn’t have a knock -on effect 
of changing that 69.9 into a 70. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    But even fundamentally doesn’t even 
go to the functional threshold. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 142 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And it doesn’t pass the functionality 
threshold. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKO ENA SC:    But then go back to the questions of, I 
understand what you’re saying but the Chair wants to understand what 
you’re saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe you can help me if you understand.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    He has gave you the answer Chair t hat 
69.93 even if you were to apply 11.4 rationally it won’t go to the 
threshold of 70 at best it will be 69.96 or 5.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think I understand that and that’s part – that’s 
10 
part of what he has said but I’m not sure if – I mean if you talk abou t 
rounding off you could have a situation where they say round some – a 
figure off to the nearest 10, well I don’t know whether they would say 
10 but in terms of what I have in mind is that if somebody has got 12 
points and you are required to round off to  the nearest – I don’t know 
whether you’d say 10 or something else but you’d have a choice of 
rounding off and put somebody at 20 or at 10 and if they are below 15 
the nearest 10 would be to give them 10 but if they are above 15 the 
nearest 10 would be 20, if you understand what I mean. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Chair can we do without having to go to 
20 
charge you anything for arithmetic 101, can we go to this number for 
instance.  If you can write this number for me, maybe it might make a 
better example for you.  If you a number like 4. – if you can write it 
down 4.732...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody who knows maths and so on must be 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 143 of 208 
 
laughing at us, at least a me, laughing at me, yes.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   And if you want to move it two decimal 
places that number it will either round up to 4.73 or 4.74, would I be 
correct Mr Volmink? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Okay so my understanding is this, 
use your example of 4...(intervention).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes and you’ll apply it to the 69.93 very 
quickly. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes 4.732 to round off to the nearest 
two decimal places I must see what is that third decimal.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Exactly. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Now that third decimal is a 2 which is 
below 5, it has no knock-on effect so it doesn’t change that 3 into a 4 
or anything like that.  So if I must round off to the nearest two decimal 
places 7.32, to round off to the nearest two decimal places would 
remain 4.73. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    4.73 yes at best...(intervention). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It can’t become a 5 and that is 
exactly what the issue was in this particular instance 69.93.  
CHAIRPERSON:    No, no that’s fine, I think from what you are saying, 
20 
you’re saying whatever application of this regulati on, one uses it could 
never give them 70, comma 70 or rather 70.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Exactly Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    I will do my own homework about this 
but I’m sure with Google and so on, somebody has already Googled and 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 144 of 208 
 
maybe having – what a decimal is. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Mr Pretorius is trying but he’s also 
hopeless in mathematics, he’s giving me numerous numbers so I’m not 
sure whether to rely upon his examples.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Lawyers can be very bad with figures.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And I’m not exception. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No that’s fine please continue I’ll do my homework.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    The essence is what you’ve captured 
Mr Volmink that...(intervention). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The essence is that when y ou round 
10 
off to the nearest two decimal places you do not end – you can’t 
change that 69.93 into a – it doesn’t become 70 regardless of what that 
third decimal place...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:    Do you know what would – what the position would 
have been if it was 69.7 or 8 - .98 or ...(intervention). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  69.? 
CHAIRPERSON:    69.97 or 69.98 do you know whether it would make a 
difference, in your understanding of how to apply this sub regulation?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Well if it was 69.97 one would again 
would have had to look at what the third – that third decimal would 
20 
have it been and let’s say – so that 7 only changes if the third decimal 
is above 5, so let’s say that was 69...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but that’s what I’ve given you, maybe I didn’t 
make it clear. If on the number that we’ve got on your statement we 
change 3 to 7 or 8 or 9 would it make a difference, would the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 145 of 208 
 
application of this other regulation make a difference?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes what I’m saying Chair is, that it 
would only make a difference if you know what that third decimal is 
because the third decimal would have a knock -on effect, so to use your 
example 69.9 – say 69.973...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Which third decimal now?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which third decimal now, which one is the third 
decimal – which one is the third decimal that you’re talking about?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Well in the example you gave of 
10 
69.97, we only see the secon d decimal which is 7, you see the first 
decimal being .9 and then the second decimal, of course is 7.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, ja.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But to know whether that second 
decimal...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    7 in this case...(interve ntion). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  You’ve got to look at what is the next 
decimal, the third decimal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is the third decimal?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Whatever that figure is, in your 
20 
example...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you have got here – before the point you’ve got 
two digits after the point you’ve got two digits.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    69.93 that’s what you have in the statement.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 146 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you say this can’t get you to 70. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so to see whether – to see what could get you 
to 70 I try to change and say delete 3 and put 7 in the same number or 
delete 7 and put 8 or put 9, would it make a difference and I thin k 
you’re saying it would not make a difference.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It make a difference without knowing 
what the third is because it all has a knock -on effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay alright I’m sure after I’ve done homework I 
10 
will understand it better, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So that, I think, is the point that it 
wouldn’t have changed 69.93 into 70.  Chair we then looked at the –
what’s called the implementation guide which is a guide which  treasury 
issues to the PPPFA regulation and I ma ke reference to that in 
paragraph 83.2 of the statement and I think that is set out in PV11 
which is on page 891. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    891 of BP 2.1 C but the 
point...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry page 88? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    It’s 891. 
CHAIRPERSON:  891? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And Chair in particular we looked at 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 147 of 208 
 
paragraph 13.1.3 and it repeats the principle which 13.1.3 is on page 
907. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And it says again, “points scored 
must be rounded off to the nearest two decimal places” but this time 
Chair, you will see that it is dealt with under the points allocated for 
price and preference only.  There are certain points allocated fo r price 
either 80 or 90 and for preference being 20 or 10 and the 
implementation guide seems to suggest to us that to – that this 
principle of rounding off to the nearest two decimal places only applies 
10 
to that point allocation for price and preference not  for that earlier 
functionality stage which we were concerned about.  So then the 
question is, okay so how do we round off to the nearest – at the 
functionality gate, if I can round off to the nearest whole number then 
they pass because it is 69.9 which th en easily becomes 70 but if I have 
to round off to the nearest two decimal places as I earlier conversation 
indicated that wouldn’t necessarily – that wouldn’t pass then.  So to 
resolve this uncertainty we approached National Treasury to say, 
treasury we are dealing with rounding off of the score for technical not 
for price and preference...(intervention).  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    But before you approached treasury 
what was governance view about the idea of rounding off T-Systems 
score? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Governance was opposed to rounding 
off T-Systems score to the nearest whole number.  It indicated to us 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 148 of 208 
 
that you had to round off to the nearest two decimal places and our 
understanding is if that was followed then they still would not have 
passed, so governance had a concern about that.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Now when you first referred to the regulation that 
refers to this rounding off to decimal places you said something like 
that was a regulation that, I think it was for 2011 or had applied 
previously, I wanted to check whether that regulation was still 
applicable at the time that you were dealing with this matter.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair the regulation was applicable 
to this thing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, now the regulation or sub-regulation that you 
drew our attention to earlier that refers to the two place – rounding off 
to two decimal places, did it apply to the price or did it also apply to 
functionality because you have just made a comment in relation to what 
is at page 907 about it applying, I think, to price only not to 
functionality. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I want to find out whether that was the same with 
regard to the regulation as well.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes so if I look at the regulation it 
20 
doesn’t 
say 
it 
applies 
only 
to 
price 
and 
preference 
or 
functionality...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes it’s general. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There’s a general statement that 
says, points scored must be rounded off to the nearest two decimal 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 149 of 208 
 
places. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR 
PETER 
STEPHEN 
VOLMINK : 
 
But 
treasury 
issues 
an 
implementation guide which explains how those regulations are to be 
applied in practice...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes which is what 907 is about. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And it is in that context that we saw 
that, that principle of rounding off to the nearest two decimal places 
10 
applies to the context of price and preference.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes so in other words, in other words if the National 
Treasury instruction at page 907 wasn’t there, then the regulation could 
be applied even to rounding off the score on functionality.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it did not have the restrictio n that the 
instruction had.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And your difficulty was, although the regulation 
seems to be wide in the sense that it doesn’t restrict you to certain 
20 
items where you can round off a figure there is a spec ific instruction 
from treasury which does restrict you, that was your challenge and 
that’s why you referred it back to National Treasury.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  You’ve summed it up perfectly. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 150 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Now what was the advise that you 
obtained from treasury?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The advice is set out in paragraph 
83.4 which is on page 37 of my statement Chair.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Take us through it. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And it says that – well treasury firstly 
advised that the manner in which points are to be rounded off should 
ideally be set out in the RFP itself, we know in this case it wasn’t.  
They then went on to say that if, at the time of evaluation the 
evaluation committee was dealing with decimals that were not 
10 
anticipated at the bid planning – I’m quoting from what treasury has 
actually said and thus not dealt with in the RFP then it said you can 
decide, you either round off to the nearest whole number or you can 
round 
off 
to 
the 
near est 
two 
decimal 
points, 
so 
in 
essence...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see when you say rounding off to a whole 
number, it sounds simpler. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes and I think that is what treasury 
was saying to us they said, if you are dealing  with functionality and you 
have got a situation like this where you’ve got someone who misses the 
20 
margin or the threshold rather by a margin, then you decide are you 
going to round – are you going to stick to this principle of rounding off 
to the nearest two decimal places or are you going to round off to the 
nearest whole number and that being the case Transnet then took a 
decision to round off to the nearest whole number in which case 69.93 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 151 of 208 
 
rounded off to the nearest whole number became 70.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And T-System – the net effect of all 
of this is that T-Systems passed that functionality threshold.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. With this advice from National Treasury 
was your unit satisfied because before it was opposed to giving T-
Systems 70 on the basis of what the treasury instructions says.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes satisfied may be putting it a bit 
strongly but certainly we engaged the authors of this document and we 
asked the authors how one should deal with the s ituation of rounding 
10 
off at the functionality level. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And the authors then advised us that 
it was our choice and we then implemented that advice.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that’s fine.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    But Mr Volmink if you go to page 914 
Chair of Exhibit PB 2.1 C...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 91? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    914. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And then if you go to page – if you go 
to – if you look at that docu ment, that is the email which contain what 
treasury ultimately advised Transnet to do, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK : That is correct Chair.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    But I what I don’t understand from your 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 152 of 208 
 
conversation with the Chair whether you’re satisfied or not, is the fact 
that when you look at paragraph 3 treasury says that it is important to 
emphasise that nothing, and it says nothing, on regulations compels the 
bid evaluation committee to follow paragraph 2 above as it will be 
based on the discretion of the evaluation committee and on the facts 
before them but I thought that, you know, you specifically referred to a 
regulation that stipulates in express terms what should happen and you 
also referred to a subsequent communication from trea sury as to how 
this should be applied.  Now if treasury says that this does not compel 
the evaluation committee to follow that paragraph 2 I don’t understand.  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes so it’s not that treasury was 
saying to us that we were compelled to follow paragraph 2, what 
treasury was saying is that you – if you look at the two bullet points it 
gave us an option.  It says you may round off to a full number or the 
nearest whole number or you can borrow that provisions of that 
regulation in 11.4 and round off to the nearest two decimal places and 
what it says is that they are not compelling us, they’re not compelling 
the committee to follow that paragraph as it will be based on the 
discretion of the committee. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    and where does one find in the 
20 
regulations that you may round to the full number?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No that is not in the regulation.  It is 
not in the regulation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It is not in the regulation?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  No. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 153 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the answer to the question that Mr Mokoene has 
asked may mean that rounding off to the nearest whole number which 
treasury said was an option may mean that it was neither in line with 
the regulation to which refer ence has been made nor in line with the 
treasury instruction to which we have referred.  Because the regulation 
to which reference has been made did not talk about rounding off to a 
whole number. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  A whole number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It – the only reference it made of rounding off was 
10 
rounding off to two decimal places.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you round off to a whole number if that does not 
coincide with rounding off to two decimal places you are not in line with 
the regulation.  If and then it would not be in line with the national 
instruction because the national instruction talked about two decimal 
points – places.  So if you round to – to the nearest whole number 
provided rounding off to the nearest whole numbe r is not the same as 
rounding off to two nearest two decimal places then you could be in 
breach of both the national instruction and the regulation.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  The regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja.  So Chair I think the – the 
difficulty that was created. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I am just testing this because obviously you ask 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 154 of 208 
 
for advice because you wanted to do the right thing.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am just wondering whether the advic e you were 
given was correct? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja.  Which is why I said – you asked 
if the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you were satisfied?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  My unit was happy? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And I said that may be putting it a bit  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  A bit strongly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But we ultimately accepted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That this is the advice that came 
from – from treasury.  The fundamental problem is that the regulation 
read with the implementation guide deals with the question of rounding 
off only in the context of price and preference.  The implementation 
guide explains that the principle applies only in price and preference.  
20 
It does not say anything about how rounding off is supposed to happen 
at the functionality [indistinct].  So it does not say you can round off to 
the nearest whole number or you cannot it appears to be silent on it.  
And the advice of treasury  at the time is in fact I think they agreed that 
it does not – it only deal with price and preference and then they said if 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 155 of 208 
 
it – when it comes to functionality you decide – you have a discretion to 
either round off to the nearest whole number or follow the  regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well it might not – it might not ultimately be 
material but one just wonders whether if the regulations are wider you 
can restrict them by way of an instruction because regulations are 
made in terms of an act of parliament.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you issue a policy or something of a lesser legal 
status and use it to restrict the circumstances to which it applies.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it might not in the end be material – material for 
our purposes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  There are certainly far more material 
aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja you – you would know better ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But this reflects the problems that you 
have – you identified earlier on about certainty of regulations or you 
know the rules applicable to procurement where they are not clear.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  When the rules are not clear Chair 
20 
then  
CHAIRPERSON:  It does create problems. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It creates problems.  It is difficult for 
the organ of state to regulate its own conduct and regulate its own 
behaviour and to know how it is to apply the rules in a particular 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 156 of 208 
 
context and then one has to engage with the author of the regulatio n. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  In the hope that what one then 
receives is the correct advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now from paragraph 84 on page 38 
you are now dealing with the award of the tender to Neotel.   Mr 
Volmink could you please take us through that?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Thank you Chair.  Um Chair we then 
come to the stage in the tender where we see that three bidders passed 
10 
that threshold for functionality.  They are Neotel, Dimension Data and 
T-Systems.  They were the only bidders who passed the threshold.  
There was some uncertainty around the pricing that some of the bidders 
had given and there was a series of clarification sessions and 
clarification around the assumptions that were made but a fter all the 
clarifications around pricing had been obtained the final ranking of the 
bidders based on price and preference was firstly Neotel who scored 
the most points for price 90 at a price of 1.3 billion and then Di Data 
came second and T-Systems was ranked third.  That was the ranking 
after the pricing had all been clarified and all processes had gone – 
20 
had been followed.  It would appear that after pricing had been clarified 
T-Systems came and offered to reduce their price by a further R248 
million and I referred to that in page – ah sorry in paragraph 85 which 
you will find at the top of page 39 of my statement.  So what happens 
Chair is that price negotiations were conducted but then you get to a 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 157 of 208 
 
point where you invite best and final offers.  All th ose offers must be in 
a box by a closing date and time with clarifications and everything else.  
As a result of following that process this was the ranking of the 
bidders.  Neotel, Di Data and T-Systems.  With T-Systems offer after 
the best and final offers had closed with T-Systems offer to reduce by a 
further R248 million it would have placed them in second place instead 
of Di Data.  But the evaluation team I think correctly in my view felt 
that this could not be considered at that stage of the process an d they 
disregarded the further offer of the R248 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – let us just step back, one step back.  
10 
After the parties had put in their bids with their prices and the bids had 
been opened then negotiations followed, is that what you  saying? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Not immediately at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  First parties went through that – the 
functionality  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And then it got to the price and 
20 
preference stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And that is when the team who 
looked at the pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 158 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They felt that the pricing ther e was 
some ambiguity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Could be negotiated down. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And so on and bidders were invited 
to clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Their … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay their pricing?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Their pricing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then to at – at a certain stage to give their final 
10 
and best offer. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they gave that? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And they gave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMIN K:  And that was the end of that  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the pricing. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Step in the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Issues yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  After that 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  T-Systems according to the report 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That they – they offered a further 
reduction of R248 million. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 159 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In circumstances where they had not been invited to 
do so and no other party had been invited to do so.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Precisely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They unilaterally reduced their price.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Made the offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  They made the offer.  They say we 
can reduce this price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But they had not been invited. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And no other party  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Had been invited to enter yet a 
further round  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Of pricing negotiation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But as I said Chair that amount was 
not… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was disregarded. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Was disregarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it had been regarded there would have been 
number 2? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 160 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  And I will tell you in a short while 
that that offer was then later taken into account by the Group Chief 
Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Who moved T-Systems up to number 
2 and Neotel was excluded based on various risk factors but we will 
come to that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We will get there. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  At a later stage. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now you make reference  to a 
memorandum that was prepared and presented to the GCE Ms Sharla 
Pillay at the time who approached the award.  May I refer you to Exhibit 
BB2.1C Chair on page 967?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes I am there. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes could you please identify that 
document for us? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair this is the document which was 
20 
signed by the then acting Group Chief Executive Sharla Pillay in which 
she approved the award of the tender to Neotel.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And could you please read where it 
says purpose or the submission?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is found on page 967 Chair in 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 161 of 208 
 
paragraph 1.  It says: 
“The purpose of the submission is to request the 
Group Chief Executive to approve the procur ement 
process and award of business to Neotel and then to 
sign a letter of intent for the preferred bidder to also 
sign letters of regret for the four unsuccessful 
bidders and sign the letter to extend the current 
Neotel contract.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. And as you have pointed out to the 
Chair at the time Ms Sharla Pillay was the acting Group Chief 
10 
Executive, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now may I refer you to page 973.   
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And you will see that there are different 
individuals occupying different capacities that have recommended and 
ultimately approved the award, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And what be the significance of their 
signatures? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The significance Chair is that it 
would have gone through various people to review the submission.  To 
ensure that the submission correctly reflects the outcome of the 
evaluation process and then to take it to the person with delegated 
authority to approve the award. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 162 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And if you go to page 972 you will 
see that there is a heading there that says “Approvals and Delegations” 
can you take us through that paragraph? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes it says: 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And comment on it? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   
“That 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Executive 
has 
already 
provided the following approvals.  Approval of the 
request for proposal and advert to go out on the 
open tender so that the tender had already long time 
10 
ago been approved.  The Group Chief Executive has 
also approved to advertise and issue the RFP to the 
open market for services for three years with an 
option to extend for another two years an d approval 
to conduct due diligence and negotiations on the 
network services RFP.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  So – and at this time Ms Sharla 
Pillay was – was acting as a Group Chief Executive officer and clearly 
she had on the entitlement and the righ t to approve the tender as she 
did? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair.  These earlier 
approvals may have been done by the Group Chief Executive that I 
have just referred to now. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But when Ms Sharla Pillay exercised 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 163 of 208 
 
the delegation to approve the award to Neotel she did so as the Group 
Chief Executive albeit in an acting capacity.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And that decision also enjoyed the 
support of all other senior officials who ha d the relevant authority to 
deal with the tender in question and approval?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair.  The officials come 
from the Group Strategic Sourcing, the technical people, the 
Governance people, supply chain officer, the chief informa tion officer, 
the CFO, everyone had looked at it and were happy for the award to be 
made to Neotel. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  However this decision that has 
underwent all these lawful structures and received approval from all the 
levels was ultimately overturned? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you tell the Chair how it was 
overturned? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair I deal with that in – on page 39 
of my statement in paragraphs 87 and following where I make th e 
comment that on the 20 November 2013 a couple of weeks after Sharla 
Pillay had signed off on the 20 November Mr Brian Molefe then wrote a 
20 
memo to Anoj Singh, Mantsika Matooane and Gary Peter in which he 
informed them about his decision to rescind the awa rd to Neotel and he 
explained that he was going to award the tender to T-Systems instead. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  May I then refer you to  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well while Mr Mol – Mr Mokoene – sorry Mr Mokoene.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 164 of 208 
 
While Mr Mokoene is looking for the document  to which he will refer 
you tell me did the group CEO Mr Brian Molefe have power to rescind 
an award that – a tender that had been already granted?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I deal with that…  
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the policies and the…  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The prescripts procurement process.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I deal with that a little bit later on 
Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. Later on yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well tell me whether yes or no you can 
elaborate later on. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In short in the context of this tender 
no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  May I refer you to page 975. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes I am on page 975. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Could you please identify that document 
for us? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :   This is the document that Mr Brian 
20 
Molefe had put together to explain his reasons for overlooking or 
rescinding the Neotel award and awarding to T-Systems. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And if you may refer to page 981.  
Under the paragraph “Approval” and take us through those paragraphs?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  What it says under the heading 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 165 of 208 
 
“Approval” it says: 
“Based on the explanations given above I request the 
Group 
Chief 
Financial 
Offic er, 
Group 
Chief 
Information Officer and Group Chief Supply Chain 
Officer to note my decisions to award business to T-
Systems in terms of Section 20.5 of the Procurement 
Procedures 
Manual 
and 
I 
am 
overriding 
the 
recommendation made in the TEAR Report which 
stands for Tender Evaluation and Recommendation 
Report.” 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And who signs the memo?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Mr Molefe signs the memo. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now may I then refer you back to page 
39 of your statement.  Exhibit BB2 .1A.  Are you there? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Page 39 of my statement?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 39 of your statement. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Paragraph 88 take us through it?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Well I say in page 88 that Mr Molefe 
based his decision on the fact that the board had sub -delegated the 
20 
authority to approve the procurement process to him as the Group Chief 
Executive. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And I – ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I will make the point later that on a 
correct reading of the delegation the board delegation it was to 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 166 of 208 
 
whoever holds the post of Group Chief Executive at the time the 
decision is taken and not to him personally ja.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words  not to him after the incumbent or after 
an earlier incumbent had made the decision?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Precisely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he was the incumbent at the time that the decision 
was made he could have done what he did but not when somebo dy who 
had occupied the same position had already exercised the power one 
way or another that is what you say?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair if I can just add perhaps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Or clarify one thing?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Even if he was the incumbent and he 
exercised his authority at that point  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Based on the facts of the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Our view is it would still not have 
20 
been justified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To overlook Neotel and award to T-
Systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but that goes to justification.  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 167 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought earlier on you were talking about t he 
authority? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he did not have the authority to make a decision 
on a tender on which somebody occupying the position before he took 
the position had already made the decision.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Had already decided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because the one point, the latter point, goes to 
authority. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas the other point you make …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Is justification. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Goes to justification. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Let us even put context to that – to the – 
to a discussion with the Chair with reference to page 983 on Exhibit – 
yes are you there? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I am there. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And would I be correct that this was the 
delegation from the board to the GCE?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  To approve the…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  To approve? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 168 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  This is the delegation and it says 
that the board resolved to delegate authority to the GCE to approve the 
network services RFP.  It was to whoever the holder of that post …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes and an acting GCE is for all intents and purposes 
a GCE?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  The GCE. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as he or she is acting?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is exactly my point yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But let us even make the point even 
much more further.  Let me refer you to page 987.  Now we now know 
that the board did delegate the power to the GCE but with no uncertain 
terms what you see on page 987 it is a delegation, sub -delegation to 
Ms Sharla Pillay, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And could you please read on the record 
what does it say in express terms and also emphasising on the dates?  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair it says: 
“I, Brian Molefe, in my capacity as Group Chief 
Executive hereby delegate all the power of authority 
vested in me to Sharla Pillay Chief Executive 
Transnet Pipelines for the period 28 October 2013 to 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 169 of 208 
 
1 November 2013.” 
And then he just says: 
“It requires that a comprehensive report of incidents 
and occurrences be forwarded to my office on my 
return.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  While keeping that page open may 
I then refer you back to page 973.  Now if you look at the sub -
delegation on page 987 and also look at the document, the approval 
document on page 973 and you look at the signature of Ms Sharla 
Pillay at the bottom what was the date when she approved?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  On page 973? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes at the bottom. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The date is 31 October 2013. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  So it fell within the dates of the sub-
delegation in page 987, am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair on page 987 
she is delegated to act from 28 October 2013 t o 1 November 2013. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    So there is no doubt that at the time 
when she signed she had all the full capacity to do so?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now may I refer you back to page 
40 of your… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just so that I can  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Follow what the issues are.  As we go forward with 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 170 of 208 
 
the matter is there any suggestion that Mr Brian Molefe’s decision to 
rescind Ms Pillay’s decision or the dec ision that had been made 
before?  Is there any suggestion that his decision may not have been 
based on an understanding in good faith that he had the power to do 
what he did even if that understanding may be mistaken?  Is there 
suggestion of anything beyon d that? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair there is an indication of that in 
the memo itself that he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Where he intimated. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That on his reading of the PPM.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That he was entitled to override the 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So if I look only at that memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  There is a suggestion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A suggestion  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But he interpreted the applicable 
rules. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 171 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So as to allow him to rescind it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You do more than that Mr Volmink may I 
refer you to page 40 of your witness statement with particular reference 
to paragraph 90.  Are you there?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You are saying to the Chair there:  
“In my view the GCE’s reasoning was flawed in a 
number of respects.”  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   
“He lacked the authority to take the decision.  The 
decision itself was taken in a procedural unfair 
manner and irrelevant considera tions were taken into 
account when the decision was made.  I elaborate on 
these aspects below.”  
Could you please tell us and take us through your observations in 
relation to the reasoning of the GCE at the time?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes.  Chair so I – I point out in my 
statement and I have already dealt with this to some extent.  I say first 
20 
the power vested in the GCE by the board to award business to Neotel 
had already been exercised by the acting GCE Sharla Pillay and could 
not therefore be exercised again.  I make the point also in paragraph 
90.2 if I go down to the second sentence I say that:  
“I agree with the views that were expressed in a 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 172 of 208 
 
certain legal opinion that was obtained by external 
auditors.  That the board did not delegate authority 
to Brian Molefe personally but rather to the holder of 
the post and that when Sharla Pillay exercised her 
powers as the holder of the post she discharged the 
sub-delegation that was entrusted to the GCE by the 
board.” 
I think that dealt with the – that deals with the authority issue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That we were discussing earlier. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you see I am not sure but you and Mr Molefe 
would be much more familiar with this file than I am.  I am not sure how 
much value there is in looking at your criticism of the decision if the 
idea is not to say there was no good faith, misunderstanding of the 
position here.  There was something else.  So in other words if you 
accept that he may have in good faith made a mistake  there might not 
be much value in going through everything but if the idea is to say no, 
no, no when you look at all of these things there was something else 
behind this decision, then that is different.  So otherwise it becomes 
just a point of law. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja.  No, no, no Chair it is more – it is 
more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is more than that. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I did indicate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 173 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That if I look at certain paragraphs.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  In Mr Molefe’s statement 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There is a suggestion that he 
interpreted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The PPM in a way that allowed him 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To rescind …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And I have explained why that is not 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is not correct …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But Chair the – the points which I 
20 
make a little bit further on …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is if you then look at the substance 
of the decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 174 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Moving aside … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  His – his authority …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  If one considers that he basis his 
decision on certain risk …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Factors … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Pertaining to Neotel … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Which were comprehensively dealt 
with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  By management …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Then it suggests at least a level of 
irrationality or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It - it lacks a …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  A credible basis … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHENVOLMINK:  For how that decision was made …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 175 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To overlook Neotel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And go to T-Systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  What precisely motivated …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Mr Molefe I – I cannot – I am not in a 
position … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To ascribe any motives that I have no 
10 
knowledge of myself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  But looking at the substance …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And the justifiability of the decision 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It strikes me as a patently …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Irrational decision. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm - and this Mr Molefe – I apologise Mr Mokoena 
this is a matter in which there is a judgment of the High Court is it not -  
T-Systems or is that another matter?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is the other T-Systems. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 176 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  There are a few T-Systems. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is the one with (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There are a few Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is why we are interrogating the 
facts of this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  They made from the investigations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you understand where my thinking is?  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will take it into account. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Definitely Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But that is why we want to take you 
through the entire picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ultimately we leave it there up until 
maybe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  He chooses to put his version …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Or anything else but …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is important for us to interrogate these 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 177 of 208 
 
facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now you may proceed.  You were 
dealing with paragraph 90.2 (intervenes).  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes and I think we have dealt with 
(intervenes) … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With everything and I want you to …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Authority. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I want you to go to paragraph 90.3. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  90.3 Chair I – I make the point that 
10 
the decision itself was taken in a procedurally unfair manner.  Certain 
risks were identified relating to Neotel yet Neotel is not afforded a 
proper opportunity to deal with those risks and to give their side of the 
story and I attach a – a draft letter that was prepared for Neotel where 
I had indicated the importance of following a procedurally fair process 
asking them for their side of the story before a decision is made to 
disqualify them. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  May I refer you to page 990 of BB – 
EXHIBIT BB 2.1C? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes, I am on page 990. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Is that the letter that you are referring 
to? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, can you take us through the 
contents? 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 178 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The contents is that it is a letter of 
regret addressed to Neotel and it says that:  
“After 
extensive 
evaluation 
of 
all 
bids 
and 
adjudication 
we 
regret 
to 
advise 
that 
your 
company’s bid was no successful.  The following 
bidder has been afforded preferred bidder status – 
T-Systems South Africa (Pty) Ltd – and we regret 
that your company was unsuccessful on this 
occasion and would indicate that this decision was 
based primarily on the under mentioned factors and 
10 
they mention business risk consideration.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  We will deal with that as 
(indistinct) but you also - there is a handwritten inscription inside the 
(indistinct). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is correct Chair.  I – I received 
this letter - I think for review.  It was brought to me for some – for some 
purpose and I wrote this handwritten note to Mr  Edward Thomas who is 
the Chief – who was the Chief Procurement – Group Chief Procurement 
Officer at the time and I said to him:  
“Hi Eddie, please note that in terms of Section 3 of 
20 
PAJA when Transnet makes a decision which 
materially and adversely affects the rights or 
legitimate expectations of an entity it must follow a 
process which is procedurally fair.  In this instance 
it would mean that before a final decision is taken 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 179 of 208 
 
to overlook Neotel they must a, be informed of the 
risks which the company poses to Transnet b, be 
informed that Transnet proposes not to award the 
contract to them because of those risks and c, be 
invited to make any representations to Transnet 
which they wish to make.  Transnet must also 
consider such representations before making a final 
decision.” 
And I refer to certain case law which deals with the – the question of 
procedural fairness. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But fundamentally at the time when 
Mr Molefe raises a justification of risk in order to overturn the position 
this is at the stage where all the risk were dealt with by management.  
Am I correct? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now can you refer please to page 992 of 
the same EXHIBIT BB 2.1C and identify that document for the Chair?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair this is a document which the 
technical experts had prepared as a r esponse to the risks which the 
Group Chief Executive had earlier identified and they deal quite 
20 
comprehensively with why those risks had been mitigated.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And would Mr Molefe have been aware of 
this document at the time when he overturned the decision? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK: 
 
Chair 
I 
cannot 
state 
that 
categorically but he would have – he would have had seen this 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 180 of 208 
 
document at some point in the process.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and the risk …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I just want to say again that we just need to be 
careful because if you think you have got the power to rescind a 
decision that has been made by somebody below you in an institution 
… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or a body before you – you may well completely – 
you may well feel that you are entitled to attach your own weight to 
different factors that need to be taken into account.  So if – if the idea 
10 
is to – to say Mr Molefe in deciding to rescind this was motivated by 
factors that have got anything to do wit h corruption and state capture a 
strong case would have to be made.  So – so there needs to be a 
proper appreciation of that you know – because different people can 
attach different amount of weight to different factors and arrive at 
different decisions and it would not necessarily mean that that 
particular one has been motivated by corrupt intentions or – and so on 
but if of course you can have a case where there is quite a strong case 
to be made.  So I just want to say we need to be careful about that.  
Otherwise we must spend a lot of time on what is really just maybe a 
20 
nice point of law to debate but really not having much in terms of 
advancing what the Commission is about.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair we are looking with the witness 
and other witnesses at the totality of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 181 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Transactions that were concluded in a 
similar manner…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  The confinements and other things 
where – which they involved Mr  Molefe.  What we did not wan t to do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Is to leave the facts which at the time 
governance felt so strong about and to say that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  They suggested quite a pattern and they 
10 
also overlap … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOEA:  To other transactions.  This is just but one of 
them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And we understand that if we are looking 
at this one in isolation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Maybe one might come to that debate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Of whether or not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Is this maybe a genuine error that was 
made … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 182 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  By somebody who did not apply the law 
correctly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  This has an accumulative effect …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When you deal with it and analyse all 
the other transactions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And that is why we are dealing with it for 
now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On the base of Neotel and it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Takes us to other transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But we endeavour in mind… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We understand what you are saying …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And it is a point we will take in but I 
think that it is quite important that he places …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 183 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  These facts on record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And Mr Volmink also felt very strong 
about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  How this matter was dealt with and that 
is why we are interrogating it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And – correct Chair.  So …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and I just remind both of you that I have not had 
a chance to go through all …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All this because I did not find it yesterday when I 
wanted to go through.  So both of you having gone through it you – you 
might have a better appreciation of why this might not be a case of just 
an innocent error of law that was made by som ebody who might not be 
a lawyer, okay … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as long as you apply your mind - both of you are 
20 
lawyers – as long as you apply your mind that is fine.  I will – when I 
have gone through – if I think that we are not going anywhere with it …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will tell you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 184 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I have indicated earlier that I – 
I am not in position to ascribe any motive.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I do not – I cannot state that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In all honesty … 
CHAIRPERSON:  From where you are, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  As a witness to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  What I am able to do …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Is to look at the basis upon which the 
decision was made …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And to highlight my concerns …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That there was no - and in my view – 
no rational … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Basis for invoking these various risks 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And awarding to another bidder …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And that is the furthest that I can 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 185 of 208 
 
take my – myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is important to bear that in mind because you 
could having regard to all of the factors that were taken into account on 
the basis of which the decision was rescinded by Mr Brian Molefe.  You 
could say this is irrational but it might not necessarily mean there is 
corruption. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I – I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Concede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it could be completely irrational but not be 
10 
corruption but it maybe that when you look at it together with maybe 
other things that are to follow it might strengthen a view that even this 
one may have been influenced by something like that.  So I was just 
alerting you to say as we move forward  on the issue just bear that in 
mind. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We do Chair.  Yes Mr  Volmink you may 
proceed.  You have now said that in terms of the risk being a 
justification to overturn the decision that could not hold water if one 
has regard to what management has already done in order to mitigate 
20 
the risks? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You may proceed then to deal with 
paragraph 90.5 and the paragraph that follows.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 186 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is on page 41. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Page 41.  Chair in those paragraphs 
we make the point that although the PPM allows for material risk to be 
considered during an adjudication stage what it states  is that: 
“The concept of material risk must be interpreted 
restrictively and be limited to those instances where 
Transnet would be severely prejudiced by the award 
of a business to a particular bidder.”  
What we trying to avoid Chair is where risks are inv oked at the 11 t h 
hour as a reason to overlook the selected bidder when the underlying 
10 
justification does not exist and in some cases where those risks had 
already been taken into account during the earlier evaluation stage.  So 
that is the point I am make on page 96 and in what follows then in - 
sorry in paragraph 90.5 – in what follows Chair I simply question Mr – 
Mr Molefe’s interpretation of certain of the rules which he said allowed 
him to – to rescind and then I think what is most concerning is what is  
in 90.7 where in Mr Molefe’s statement – at least in his – in his 
memorandum he says that he will take that 248 – the further R248 
million discount into account as a reason to award to – to T-Systems 
and we have indicated that that should not have been th e case.  The – 
20 
that process had already closed and in fact that gave T-Systems an 
unfair advantage over other bidders who had not been afforded the 
same opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what justification did he advance for taking 
into account something that was done after the process had been 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 187 of 208 
 
closed – if he did advance any? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair perhaps it would be better if I 
referred you to his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  To his memorandum at least – my 
apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair the mic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry - in the – in his letter of 20 November 2013 at 
page 990 – in his letter to Neotel it does not seem if I see correctly – 
10 
he does not seem to make any referenc e to this reduced price that was 
offered after the process had closed.  Am I right?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  There is no reference in that letter 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is one entity that should have been told if 
that had been a factor.  Is it not ? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they were the – the bidder that had been 
successful in terms of what – of the previous decision?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in the letter to them he only tells them about  the 
business risks as the reason – am I right? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  He only mentions business risk.  He 
does not mention the issue of pricing but you ask me what the 
justification for taking it into account was …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 188 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And you will find that justification 
dealt with in his memorandum on page 980.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  From paragraph 21? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  At paragraph 21, correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You can summarise …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  In a… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Let us wait for the Chair to find the 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am there now. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  At the bottom Chair paragraph 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair what he says is: 
“Post the close of the final offers being submitted T-
Systems indicated that they unfortunately due to 
strict timelines set by Transnet only managed to get 
confirmation from their shareholder on certain 
pricing elements and that they would be in a 
position to reduc e the price submitted the week 
before by a further R248 million.”  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But to underline here he says post the 
close of the final offers. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes, post the close of the final 
offers.  Over the page he says: 
“I approve that the 248 million be taken into 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 189 of 208 
 
consideration as part of T-Systems best and final 
offer as the commitment was made in writing to 
Transnet and shortly after the best and final offers 
have closed and I do not believe any other bidders 
were prejudiced by this.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Would you agree with that reasoning?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  No I do not – I do not agree with that 
reasoning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is the point of closing the system if anybody 
who comes after can be accommodated?  
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Precisely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – and then the others are not given a 
chance to – to come up also with – to compete with or match that latest 
offer. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair it – it violates the principle of 
equal treatment …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Which is so fundamental in the 
bidding process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Everyone needs to be treated 
equally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  You are afforded an opportunity to 
give your best and final offer by a certain date …  
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 190 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And that is – that is when the 
process ends – well that is when that step in the process closes.  You 
cannot then invite one particular bidder a further bite … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Or give a particular bidder a further 
bite at the cherry.  It is just not right.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I guess that the least you can do if your internal 
processes permit is to reopen that for everybody b ut even with that you 
must check whether your internal policies and processes allow you to 
10 
do that.  If they do not allow you – you should not reopen. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Precisely Chair and there is – there 
is no provision in our policies that says  after best and final offers and 
the award is to be made now you can reopen and start the process 
afresh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because they – they had – T-Systems had the 
same amount of time as everybody before the closing of the process?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when they – when they are late to put in a reduced 
offer if you take that into account it means that you have a different 
20 
closing date for them effectively.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is exactly you shift it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are extending the closing date for them.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 191 of 208 
 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And you have moved out that closing 
date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And Chair what I can also add to what 
you have cautioned us that bear with us to lead the evidence of further 
witnesses like Mr Mohamedy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And others that are going to follow and 
10 
dealing almost with the same issues …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Same issues. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And also clarifying certain events.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no that is …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Bear with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine - that is fine ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Now… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I was going to move one. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You can – you may then proceed what 
then transpired. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair needless to say that there was 
just widespread concern amongst the legal people, governance people, 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 192 of 208 
 
procurement people, the IT Department about the GCE’s decision and 
we then thought it best to seek the opinion of counsel on the matter 
and 
during 
December 2013 
we 
arranged 
a 
consultation 
with 
Advocate Gilbert Marcus to obtain his view on the legality of the 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you tell me about his view how long had you 
been with Transnet by the time this decision was made by 
Mr Brian Molefe – yourself and maybe in terms of this particular unit in 
which you – had you been there for quite some time?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think probably about three to four 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three years. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and he – how long had he been there?  Do you 
know? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I will have to hazard a guess.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It is also a couple of years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I wanted to ask whether something like this had 
ever been done before to your knowledge.  
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair to the best of my knowledge 
before – before this I have not come across an instance …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You had never come across it. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Such as this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But obviously you would not know if it happened at 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 193 of 208 
 
Transnet anything like that this had happened before your time?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So you sought senior counsel’s 
opinion?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair what senior counsel then 
advised is that – he advised that extraneous factors were taken into 
account in making the decision – the award to T-Systems.  He advised 
that the process was procedurally unfair and not in accordance with 
Section 217 and he advised that Transnet should review its decision to 
award to T-Systems and proceed with the award to Neotel.  I am giving 
you a summary of it but that is in essence.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But there was also an external audit on 
this issue. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Sorry. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There was also an external audit. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct Chair.  Sometime late 
external audits also sought a legal opinion which I am – which I have 
also attached and the external audit legal opinion also confirmed the 
view that extraneous factors were considered.  It raised  the issue about 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 194 of 208 
 
Mr Molefe’s authority.  It raised the question of the conflict of interest 
and the rounding off and in essence it also concluded that the award 
was not correctly made. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now from page - 44 Mr Volmink – from 
paragraph 98 you deal with the - not the CJ’s – the GCE’s decision …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  To revoke T-System’s position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you retaliating? 
(Laughing) 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is that time of the (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we – before we get – we get there Mr Volmink 
my – my mind is still on the issue that in his memorandum …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On this issue of the reduced price from T-Systems 
that came after the process had been closed.  Mr  Brian Molefe says he 
was approving that it be taken into account the reduced price – reduced 
offer on the basis that he did not think there would – there was any 
prejudice to the other …  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Bidders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bidders but I am not sure that I understand that.  Who 
said they would not have reduced further if they were given a chance 
and if they knew that T-Systems were reducing further?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is precisely the difficulty Chair 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 195 of 208 
 
because he even went on to say it is not necessary to request any 
other best and final offer from vendors as all three bidders were given 
the opportunity to confirm their prices.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But they are not given the same  opportunity. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Not the same opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am just trying to think whether you need a 
lawyer to look at that in that way or whether putting aside law just 
simple - from a simple understanding that procurement mus t be fair and 
transparent to all parties. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Precisely.  Chair…  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You ought to see that you are being unfair …  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By allowing a party after the process has been closed 
to bring in their reduced offer and the other parties do not get given the 
same opportunity. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I do not think one needs to be a 
lawyer to see that there is a problem with this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  I think just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your sense of … 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  One’s basic sense of fairness  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Would suggest that there is one 
particular bidder who has been given preferential treatment to the 
prejudice of the other bidders. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 196 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  And – and I cannot see anyway how 
that could have been justified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when you say the closing date that is the 
closing date.  You must bring in your final and best offers not later than 
that date.  By implication you are saying if you bring it later it will not 
be taken into account. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  That is exactly right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Otherwise the idea of a closing date loses its 
meaning. 
10 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Precisely – precisely. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But as a follow up to the Chair ’s 
questions at that stage when Mr  Molefe overturned this decision there 
were already structures and individuals with authority that have applied 
their mind to the documentatio ns and issues of pricing pertaining to 
this tender.  Am I correct?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Correct.  So everything was taken 
into account.  Even that 248 million …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Was brought to the attention of the 
20 
evaluation team and they said we will not consider this because it is 
now after the closing date and as I testified earlier in my view that was 
absolutely the correct decision.  So it had been – that issue had been 
considered.  All pricing issues were on the table and a decision was 
made based on the pricing as at the closing date of the best and final 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 197 of 208 
 
offers. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And when he overturns this decision 
does he consult with governance or any other structures or seek clarity 
from any other body that dealt with the matter?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair I certainly – I was not 
consulted at all and I seriously doubt that any other assurance function 
within Transnet would have been consulted before this decision was 
made. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now from page 44 paragraph 98 you deal 
with the GCE’s decision to revoke the T-System position as a bidder – 
10 
preferred bidder.  How does this now happen?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair so after the external audit 
finding was made, and as I said i t was accompanied by a legal opinion 
as well the GCE then relented and he decided he was going to revoke 
T-Systems status now as the preferred bidder, and a letter was written 
to T-Systems to inform of the GCE’s decision to revoke its appointment 
as the preferred bidder. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  So firstly he overturns the decision to 
award the tender to Neotel. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Correct. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And he does that alone?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  He does that alone. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And now he revokes the decision to that 
he has made to award to T-Systems, he revokes his own decision?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes correct that is what he did. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 198 of 208 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is after he had been furnished with senior 
counsel’s opinion and other reports? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Chair he would have been furnished 
with the audit, the external audit finding, on Senior Counsel’s opinion, I 
deal with that as well in my statement, there was apparently a request 
made not to obtain the final written opinion from Senior Counsel.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so is the position that as far as you know he was 
the Senior Counsel’s opinion was not brought to his attention for 
whatever reason? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  For whatever reason Chair Senior 
10 
Counsel’s written opinion ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Was not ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Made available to him. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Was not being made available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and you will deal with the reasons there?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I deal with that also in my statement.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now can you proceed to deal with the 
confinement of the CCTV Security (indistinct) contract to Neotel, you 
are dealing ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Mokoena, so the revocation of his 
decision to award the tender to T-Systems was as far as you know 
based largely if not solely on the audit report?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  On the audit finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright, thank you. 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 199 of 208 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair maybe for completeness in relation 
to that question may I refer you to page 1051, so as at least we can 
deal with this matter on its factual basis and to see what Mr Molefe 
communicates to T-Systems.   Is that, could you identify that lette r Mr 
Volmink? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  On page 1051 it’s the letter written 
by Mr Molefe to T-Systems. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And what does he convey to them?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It says that: 
”We refer to your letter dated 20 May in response to  Transnet’s 
10 
stated intention to revoke your status as preferred bidder in 
respect of Network Services Tender.  Transnet considered your 
representations as set out in your letter and hereby wish to 
inform you of our final decision, which is that your prefer red 
bidder status has been revoked.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And nothing was being said. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Ja, nothing. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now I was referring you to page 45, now 
you’re dealing with the confinement of the CCTV.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes. 
20 
 ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you please take us through?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  This is the next transaction that I 
was asked to consider and to comment on Chair, and it relates to a 
confinement to Neotel regarding a CCTV upgrade o r the upgrade of 
CCTV cameras and equipment within the ports, and what I say in 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 200 of 208 
 
paragraph 103 following is that a confinement for the contract for CCTV 
upgrade to Neotel was submitted by Mr Tau Morwe who was the Chief 
Executive of TNPA and it was approved by the Group Chief Executive at 
the time and a copy of that confinement is then addressed.   
 
I make the point that I also don’t recall any stage where the 
governance function was asked to review the confinement and I am not 
able to find any record of the prior review. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  May I refer you to page 1066 Chair, it’s 
EXHIBIT BB2.1C.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 1066? 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  1066 Chair.  Can you please ID that 
document for us. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  This is the memorandum requesting 
confinement which was submitted to the Group Chief Executive.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes and what is the date of the memo?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The date of the memo is the 24 t h of 
April 2014. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And the subject? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  The subject relates to a request for 
approval to procure a CCTV Security Solution for TNPA across all 
20 
ports. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you please take us through the 
contents under the purpose. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So under the purpose of the 
submission it says that  the purpose is to request the Group Chief 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 201 of 208 
 
Executive to approve the award, to approve and award business for the 
procurement of CCTV cameras and related maintenance through a 
confined procurement process to the value of R142million and some 
change, from Neotel, secondly the award of business via the current 
Neotel Master Services Agreement for the installation of the CCTV and 
security 
solution 
to 
the 
value 
of 
R186million 
allowing 
sole 
accountability to Neotel fo r effective working of the solution and then to 
approve unforeseen CAPEX in the value of R252million.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now let me refer you back to your 
witness statement on page 45 and you may proceed dealing with the 
10 
contents of paragraph 104 onwards. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  So in paragraph 104 Chair I make the 
point that the memo provides a motivation for confining the 
procurement of the CCTV cameras to Neotel and for awarding business 
via the existing Neotel MSA for the installation of the ca meras and I 
make the point that the grounds for the confinement was stated, there 
were two grounds basically, firstly there was urgency and secondly 
compatibility with existing products and services and I say that I was 
asked by the Commission’s investigators to provide my comments on 
the grounds of confinement, in particular whether they were sound or 
20 
not sound. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, can you proceed dealing with that.  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Then as far as urgency is concerned 
Chair this is where I had a difficulty because the – and the main 
difficulty that I had with this is that the urgency was not unforeseen, 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 202 of 208 
 
the PPM specifically says that it must be an unforeseen urgency.  You 
can’t see the urgency coming way down the road and then at the las t 
minute you invoke urgency and I make the point in my statement in 
paragraph 1041 I say that the ground for confinement as stated in the 
PPM is that confinements will only be considered where a genuine 
urgency has arisen which should not be attributable t o a lack of proper 
planning, in such cases appropriate action must be taken against the 
individual responsible for the bad planning but you can’t use that bad 
planning as a basis for urgency, it’s the conversation that we had 
earlier, and I make the point also in paragraph 104.3 that the factors 
10 
mentioned for urgency were entirely foreseeable and a few, I think 
there’s probably about three factors that were mentioned, the first is 
that TMPA could become non-compliant with certain international 
shipping and port facilities security codes.   
 
Now if I can pause there for a moment, it is said that we could 
be blacklisted by the US Administration and it mentions various 
consequences which could arise, if the CCTV cameras were not put in 
place, and it occurred to  me Chair that one doesn’t realise now all of a 
sudden that we are non-compliant with these codes.  If we read this 
statement as a whole some of these CCTV cameras had been defective 
20 
for a very long period of time, and the urgency which now exists was 
not an unforeseeable urgency, so based purely on a cold reading of this 
document I came to the conclusion that it could not be said that this 
was an unforeseeable urgency.   
 
The second factor pertains to insurance claims, there was a 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 203 of 208 
 
concern that our insurers  may not cover us if there’s any incident which 
happens in the ports, because of our defective equipment, but once 
again that is not unforeseeable, it’s not as if we realise today that the 
insurers will not cover us for defective equipment when in fact thi s is a 
situation that has been coming on for a very long time, and the third 
reason which in my view was the weakest of all the reasons pertains to 
the fact that certain PFMA reportable items had to be remediated, I 
mention that in paragraph 104.3 and appa rently this relates to the fact 
that a company called ESS had installed this equipment at some point 
in the past, and that this had created fruitless and wasteful expenditure 
10 
or irregular expenditure and the memorandum suggests that it is urgent 
that we take remedial action to address the PFMA issues.  
 
Now I say it’s the weakest of the reasons Chair, because the 
way one has to remediate a finding of irregular expenditure or fruitless 
and wasteful expenditure is by taking disciplinary steps against the 
person or persons who are responsible for that having occurred and 
possibly instituting civil or criminal action, but I could not understand 
why those factors were put forward as a grounds for urgency.  
 
Having said that I thought that the second ground, which i s 
compatibility with existing products or services I thought that that 
20 
ground was – it was plausible, it was a credible ground, we are going to 
Neotel who has the network services contract, and the CCTV cameras  
have to interface with the network which the y have put in place, there 
needs to inter-operability between the CCTV cameras and the network 
system, so I felt in fairness that I couldn’t take issue with the second 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 204 of 208 
 
ground but I was quite concerned about the first ground.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if there was one ground with which you took no 
issue 
would 
that 
be 
good 
enough 
for 
purposes 
of 
justifying 
confinement? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  That’s an interesting question, the 
PPM certainly doesn’t say that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It doesn’t prescribe. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  It doesn’t prescribe, it says all your 
grounds must be correct, having said that I am aware of some authority 
10 
for the view that if reasons are given for a decision and one of which is 
defective it infects the validity of the decision as a whole, so that is a 
concern as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well I think I know what you’re talking about, I 
know that as well but I – I’m not sure that it’s logical and I say that not 
knowing whether I’ve ever been party  to a decision such as that.  If 
there are – if you have got three or four reasons why you say that 
something is good these reasons may have different weight, you might 
have one that may be good enough that would have been good enough 
even if you didn’t have the other three on which to base that to say this 
20 
this thing is good, you might have three or four reasons which each of 
which on its own is not good enough to sustain that view and therefore 
can only stand if you have the other reasons as well, just li ke you could 
have a reason that makes a particular decision fatally defective on its 
own it could have a reason that sustains it despite how weak the other 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 205 of 208 
 
reasons are one would think but maybe that’s – that may be a debate 
for another day so anyway but for this particular job that you were 
performing what was your view, was whether, was it whether the fact 
that on compatibility since you could not take issue with that, that 
should sustain, that should be okay, or is it something that you took no 
view on? 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Chair I was asked to express a view 
on whether the grounds for confinement were valid or invalid, I haven’t 
expressed a further view whether if one ground is found to be invalid 
whether it taints the decision as a whole, so I conf ined myself to the 
10 
task that was set for me and I commented that I thought one ground 
was invalid but the second ground was valid.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But Mr Volmink maybe ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we’ve got senior counsel here so they will 
...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  ...maybe I have read your statement five 
times more than him, even that ground that you said you may find as a 
justification when you go to paragraph 1045.5 you seem not to be 
convinced about the very sound ground of compatibility, can you please 
20 
take the Chair ...(intervention)  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  Yes perhaps I should take the Chair 
through that.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK:  So I’m saying I don’t agr ee with the 
09 MAY 2019 – DAY 91 
 
Page 206 of 208 
 
ground of urgency, I think that there was sufficient ground to confine on 
– to Neotel on the grounds of compatibility.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  But where I take issue with the – with 
what then follows in this – in the memorandum is that mention is then 
made of the fact that this CCTV equipment had to specifically be 
sourced from a company called Nice, N -i-c-e, and that Neotel had 
recommended that Nice Equipment be obtained because Nice was 
prepared to give certain guarantees  and warrantees and so on, but as I 
said the memo then also goes on to say that this very Nice Equipment 
10 
had reached the end of their useful life, that there was a 64% failure 
rate of the equipment, I understand the motivation to confine to Neotel, 
but it certainly wasn’t necessary to then say oh and Neotel will also 
obtain or procure this from this other entity which was not the subject 
matter of this confinement, I think that is the point that I’m trying to 
make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you are saying is wh atever it is that you are 
saying in 104.5 doesn’t relate to whether confinement is justified or 
not, it relates to whether Nice or whatever they are called, their 
equipment could be used, that’s where – what it relates to? 
20 
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  I raise that question, I say I don’t 
understand why we have to be talking about this Nice or Nice 
Equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that has got nothing to do with confinement?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  It’s got nothing and in any event

you’ve already said that their confinement is non-functional and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now on paragraph 1046 you also deal 
with the discoveries that you made pertaining to Neotel, could you 
please share that with the Chair?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  Yes Chair I think sometime after the 
award we discovered or it was discovered that Neotel was actually not 
registered as a security service provider with the private security 
industry regulator and the Act, the Private Security Industry Regulation 
Act requires registration before any security services can be performed 
10 
and security services includes things like the installation of CCTV 
cameras.   
 
We did write a memorandum setting out our concerns around 
the award to Neotel based on their non-registration with SIRA, 
apparently the Minister of Police exempted Neotel then from the 
requirements of SIRA and a contract was then concluded with Neotel.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But could that exemption also be 
applicable to Transnet?  
MR PETER STEPHEN VOLMINK :  No the exemption would have been 
applicable to the entity who was supposed to be registered, so the 
20 
Minister exempts Neotel from that particular requirement, not Transnet.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Mr Chair we are about to deal with 
another long topic of the T-Systems award and I see it’s 15:51 if not 
15:53, may we deal with this tomorrow and I can assure you that we will 
be able to finalise the evidence of Mr Volmink tomorrow before one

CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you don’t think we need to take – go up to half 
past four, you think there will be enough time to finish tomorrow?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There will be enough time Chair, 
definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tomorrow, okay, and if we start wha t time tomorrow? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Even if we start at ten o’clock.

before one o’clock.
