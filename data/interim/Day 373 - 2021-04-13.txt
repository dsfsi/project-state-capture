PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 13 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Seleka,, good morning 
every – Mr Seleka, good morning everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I corrected myself.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The oath you took yesterday Mr Singh 
will continue to apply. 
MR SINGH:  That is fine Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay let us proceed. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Singh thank you again 
for your availability in assisting the commission.  Yesterday 
we traversed a couple of – well quite a number of issues 
regarding the MSA and I want to conclude on that MSA.   
I was about to go to what is the legal review 
presented to Eskom by CDH and that deal specifically with 
the suspensive conditions amongst other things that you 
were – you referred to a couple of times yesterday. 
But before I do that Mr Singh I want to place on 
record Chairperson the affidavit that I read yesterday of Mr 
20 
Phakamani that that matter Eskom was the Applicant and 
Mr Phakamani was an acting Group Chief Executive of the 
Applicant when he deposed to this affidavit.  
So he was deposing to the affidavit for and on 
behalf of Eskom.  So the requirement for the National 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 4 of 249 
 
Treasury that we read about yesterday is actually Eskom’s 
position and if Eskom says there was no National Treasury 
approval that means the contract was a nullity from 
inception which means the contract never came into 
existence Mr Singh. 
And then it would not matter whether or not the 
suspensive conditions are fulfilled because it is neither 
here nor there. 
Do you follow that reasoning?  You – do you follow 
the reasoning and then you can comment on what your 
10 
view is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe Mr Seleka maybe the – there 
was a contract but it never came into operation because 
for it to get into operation there were those conditions that 
needed to be backed and therefor nothing should have 
been done under it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair I am – I remember because the 
PFMA requirement it is a legislative requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So if – if that one is not obtained at the 
20 
right – at the beginning the contract according to the PFMA 
is a nullity – is void ab initio. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the end it might not make much 
difference whether it was void from the beginning or it did 
come into being but did not come into effect. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 5 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And no – and nobody ought to have acted 
under it in circumstances  where the conditions had not 
been met. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so the Chairperson has the 
suspensive conditions in mind? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I am – I am – I think you are 
talking about or is that – was that not so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes what – okay I hear what the 
Chairperson is saying. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I may be – I may – I may have missed 
something.  The approvals were they not the suspensive 
conditions? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the suspensive conditions were 
different. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We at Clause 3.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No then that is fine. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then the PFMA was Clause 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson I am sorry to 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 6 of 249 
 
interrupt.  I – I hear what Mr Seleka says at this point but 
with the greatest of respect to him this is not the issue to 
be decided here.  This is a – you are here to interrogate 
with the greatest of respect the facts that applied at the 
time whatever position Eskom currently takes ex post facto 
is a totally different story. 
 
My understanding was always that what you need to 
do is interrogate facts that applied at the time and that 
people can assist you with and deal with because of their 
knowledge at that point. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the law as well because you know 
people are alleged to have entered or done certain things 
without contracts where they were supposed to do them 
only if there were contracts.  What – what – where you 
might have some point is the fact that Eskom states a 
section a certain factual position does not necessarily 
preclude Mr Singh from stating the factual position as he 
understood it – that part.  I think that part may be a fair 
point.  Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   Yes continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So there is that distinction then 
because as I said to you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you do so Mr Seleka always remember 
that as I understand it. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 7 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Singh is not a lawyer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course by virtue of his position he 
knows some laws you know.  He knows something about – 
so – so I am just saying as you deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just bear that in mind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – ja – okay alright. 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Especially 
the 
Public 
Finance 
Management Act Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As the Group Chief Executive Officer – 
Chief – Chief Financial Officer you should have a working 
knowledge of that Act because it falls squarely within your 
– the purviews of your duties, is it not? 
MR SINGH:  Oh so 00:07:31 so write down the question 
00:07:25. (Mr Singh is mumbling). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  The Act falls within the purviews of 
20 
your duties is it not? 
MR SINGH:  So – so (inaudible) just wanted that question 
not the first one?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will go to that. 
MR SINGH:  Or do you want me to respond to the first one 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 8 of 249 
 
as well? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no let – I think… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Singh – Mr Seleka is asking you 
whether you agree that as Chief Financial Officer of Eskom 
you 
would 
have 
been 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
working 
knowledge of the PFMA. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I would agree with that but I would 
qualify that by saying. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  That I would be expected to have a working 
knowledge of aspects that are applicable to my specific 
domain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Which is finance hence I said Section 54.2b 
for example is Capital and Procurement Capital Projects 
those are things that negate that entail us that we dealt 
with almost on a daily basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR SINGH:  In terms of procurement and all of these other 
aspects Mr Chair hence we have a very specific function 
within Eskom as well as Transnet.  We have a fully fledged 
group legal function as well as compliance – as well as a 
compliance function and they are the ones that are 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 9 of 249 
 
capacitated and accountable in terms of delegation of 
authority 00:08:40 to be able to deal with these specific 
matters and as Mr Seleka said Mr Hadebe’s affidavit does 
refer to certain individuals from those specific conditions. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson sorry Mr Singh’s 
voice is coming over very softly on this side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yesterday the sound was up 
quite high today it is quite low. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay please … 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  And it is important that we hear 
what he says this side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please – please speak up Mr Singh 
maybe you can – could repeat your answer. 
MR SINGH:  So now the technical test.  Is that better?  
Now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  Okay.  So in terms of the question as it 
relates to the PFMA being something that I should be 
particularly familiar with Mr Chair yes I do concede that it 
20 
is something that I am familiar with.  I am familiar with the 
sections of the PFMA that applied to me in my specific 
daily activities as it relates to the CFO.  Issues – broader 
issues like procurement and other aspects of the PFMA Mr 
Chair I normally left to the specialists and those are the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 10 of 249 
 
Group Legal functions as well as the Legal and Compliance 
functions within the – both the organisations certainly I will 
quote is Eskom and Transnet. 
 
They are specifically delegated those functions 
through the delegation of authority premise. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Singh.  But clearly the – 
this requirement for National Treasury approval the team of 
which you form part was aware of it.  It is clear from the 
documentation. 
MR SINGH:  By which documentation makes it? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The documentation in the bundles.  The 
Steering Committee meetings we can see that you talk 
about that approval even on the 9 t h of February 2016. 
MR SINGH:  In the Steering Committee? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Oh yes it is – it says there it has been 
obtained. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Correct, correct.   
MR SINGH:  So it comes back to this point Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say again. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Okay carry on you – I – you going to make a 
point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja this is what I want to do Mr Singh 
Chair because I do not want to waste time on this matter.  
If the – if the National Treasury approval was not obtained 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 11 of 249 
 
that is the one clause of the agreement the agreement then 
does not start off the blocks.   
 
In 
addition 
to 
that 
you 
have 
the 
suspensive 
conditions.  Those suspensive conditions if they are not 
fulfilled as CDH and I was about to go to that yesterday – 
as CDH found in their legal review to Eskom it only serves 
as an aggravating factor.  But if you say they were fulfilled 
as you do in your affidavit of yesterday it does not change 
the fact that the Treasury approval because of lack thereof 
the agreement could not have come into force.  You 
10 
understand what I am saying? 
MR SINGH:  I understand totally.  Do you want me to 
respond? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes please. 
MR SINGH:  So firstly Mr Chair as I said to you yesterday 
or as you correctly say today I am not a legal person but I 
will give you my view for what it is worth and also secondly 
Mr Chair in terms of correction to Mr Seleka as I said 
yesterday when he started with this topic these matters are 
not – were not within my personal purview at the time.  I 
20 
understood that there was something that was happening 
but they were not in my direct interactions on a daily basis.  
Even if you look at the affidavit that Mr Koko had – Mr 
Hadebe’s affidavit that Mr Seleka had taken us through it 
was Mr Koko that was dealing with this matter at a later 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 12 of 249 
 
meeting that he had called with Mr Laher, with Mr 
Mabelane and with Mr Govender.  So from that perspective 
that team was dealing.  Ultimately an individual by the 
name of Mr Ave Gorie who was from Procurement engaged 
with 
National Treasury 
to 
obtain 
the 
email 
that 
we 
obtained.  Let us just park there – there for now okay. 
 
So that is the context within which I give my 
feedback now.  So between then and now I have come 
across all of this information which I will now give you my 
view on and the reason why I give you my view Mr Chair is 
10 
because the Parliamentary Inquiry called on me to provide 
that. 
 
So that is how I come across this information.   
 
First point to make Mr Chair is that Mr Seleka is 
correct in saying that Mr Hadebe in his affidavit acts on 
behalf of Eskom and provides a view that Eskom had at 
this point in time. 
 
Similarly Mr Chair when I sit here and I provide an 
affidavit I was also an official of Eskom at the time.  So I 
provide you a version of – of the events and the facts that 
20 
existed at the time. 
 
So that was Eskom’s view at the time.  If it was 
correct at the time all well and good – if it is now proven to 
be incorrect then it is incorrect.  But it is not for me to say 
whether it was right or wrong because that is not my – as 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 13 of 249 
 
you say I am not a legal person.  
 
But all I can tell you now is I knew of the events 
that occurred leading up to and what the Eskom position 
was at the time given the information that we had at the 
time. 
 
So Mr Chair in terms of the National Treasury 
approvals Mr Chair as I said and maybe we should try and 
find this email of the 4 t h of February.  Do we have it 
somewhere in the bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The what? 
10 
MR SINGH:  The email that we received from National 
Treasury on the 4 t h of February 2016? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it is in your – it is in your affidavit 
of yesterday. 
MR SINGH:  Did we put it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You quoted it. I do not know whether 
you… 
MR SINGH:  Is the email there actually? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson it is indeed in the – 
20 
an attachment to the affidavit that we produced. 
MR SINGH:  Submitted yesterday. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Yesterday and maybe it – it is a 
good time just to make sure that the affidavit is received as 
an exhibit and you can then be referred to specifically to 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 14 of 249 
 
this annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What email is that Mr Seleka?  I am not 
sure what the two of you are talking about. 
MR SINGH:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes… 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You seem to be talking to the two of you 
between yourselves only. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair it is the email that Eskom relies on – 
that Eskom relied on at the time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to say what? 
MR SINGH:  To say that it had the required authority to 
enter into the contract relative to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had require – it had the required 
approvals? 
MR SINGH:  Approvals or authority or standing to enter 
into a risk-base contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because… 
MR SINGH:  Which is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because authority depending – authority 
20 
might be something different from approval. 
MR SINGH:  No hence – hence I am saying Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It just depends.  Approvals? 
MR SINGH:  Well you see this is where I think there is 
some level of confusion in my mind if I look at what has 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 15 of 249 
 
happened. 
 
Eskom relies or Mr Hadebe relies on I think Practice 
Note 1 okay which requires an approval for a deviation 
which is what I think Mr Koko testified to in terms of the 
document he had signed. 
 
The email that we referred to Mr Chair is relying I 
think on a different Practice Note that effectively allows for 
entities such as this one to allow to enter into risk base 
contracts without a deviation necessarily having to be 
sought from National Treasury. 
10 
 
So there is two different schools of thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are conflicting. 
MR SINGH:  Oh I – from what I can see I think that is what 
the – the problem is Mr Chair.  And one seeks to say listen 
you have the – this schedule is applicable and therefor you 
can enter into this contract.  That is the email that we refer 
to. 
 
What Mr Hadebe relies on is a schedule that 
effectively says you require to physically apply for a 
deviation which in that case you would have do something 
20 
– submit something to them, consider it and then receive 
an application for an approval or a non-approval. 
 
So in my view I think that is where the issue lies 
and I think therefor I am saying Mr Chair in order for me to 
demonstrate what the position was at the time when Eskom 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 16 of 249 
 
believed it had the requisite standing – let us call it 
standing to enter into the risk base contract this email 
provides that context. 
 
So that would be for the issue of whether the PFMA 
was complied with or not before we get to the suspensive 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Annexure AS8 attached to the 
affidavit of yesterday just to make it easy Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair just before we got there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What Mr Anoj Singh should explain to 
you Mr Anoj to the Chairperson is that there was a Practice 
Note as we read yesterday 2013/2014 of the National 
Treasury which only allowed for contracting on a fee basis 
not risk based and Eskom had adopted that Practice Note 
on their policy for procurement and hence the internal 
people were saying that you need to obtain Treasury 
approval if you want to deviate from that policy of ours first 
20 
because we have adopted that Practice Note of National 
Treasury. 
 
So that is what Mr Hadebe says, that is what Mr 
Anoj should know. 
MR SINGH:  No but… 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 17 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That that is the – that is where the 
turning point is Chair. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me just understand that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
National 
Treasury 
had 
issued 
an 
Instruction Note. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it had laid down certain requirements 
for the appointment of consultants on a fee basis. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – but they wanted that is Eskom 
wanted to appoint McKinsey on a risk basis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words the Instruction Note on 
a fee basis would not be applicable to a risk basis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In the sense that the risk base is not 
catered for in that instruction. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So – but the Instruction Note 
from 
Treasury 
was 
understood 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
appointments of consultants. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 18 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you were going to – if you wish to 
appoint consultants not on a fee basis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
on 
some 
other 
basis 
it 
was 
understood that nevertheless you must approach National 
Treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For approval. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes if – because you are deviating from 
10 
a fee basis appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You now want to do something else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Something else ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But Eskom had taken a step further.  
They had adopted that into their policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – so in other words your point is 
the appointment of consultants both in terms of National 
Treasury Instruction and in terms of Eskom policies was 
supposed to be on a fee basis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 19 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you wanted to do something 
different. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You needed – if Eskom wanted to do 
something different namely appoint consultants on a basis 
other than a fee basis they needed to approach National 
Treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For approval to do it that way. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To deviate yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To deviate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – that is the point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is the point Chair and you find that 
explicitly in the affidavit of Mr Phakamani Hadebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And I have just for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is Mr Singh’s position that his 
understanding was that the – if Eskom wanted to appoint 
consultants on a risk basis Eskom did not need to seek 
20 
approval for deviation as you understand it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes that he says they relied on that 
email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For that position. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 20 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  From somebody at National Treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From somebody at National Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is – is that the email he wanted 
to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct that is the email he wants to 
refer the Chairperson to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So far so good in terms of 
understanding where you stand Mr Singh namely if Eskom 
wanted to appoint consultants on a basis other than a fee 
basis was it your understanding that Eskom did not need to 
10 
obtain approvals from National Treasury? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think you are summarising it 
correctly but I just need to add one… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Additional point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair Mr Seleka and I think Mr Hadebe or 
Mr Hadebe and Mr Seleka is following their thumb taking a 
view of convenience to say Practice Note was clear cut and 
was applicable.  Right.  So in – from what I can understand 
20 
in the – in the documentation that we currently have now 
but this was not a clear cut Instruction Note that was black 
and white and was applicable or not.  There was some 
ambiguity as to whether it was applicable or not.   
 
Now yesterday when Mr Seleka took us through Mr 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 21 of 249 
 
Hadebe’s affidavit and maybe we should go there – what is 
it again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say again.  Eskom Bundle 14. 
MR SINGH:  Yup. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  14(d). 
MR SINGH:  14.   
CHAIRPERSON:  12(d). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  14(d). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.   
10 
MR SINGH:  Oh so sorry.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  14(d). Oh.  She says it is page 1193. 
MR SINGH:  I 00:25:27 – 11 – 1193? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Well I started reading from page 
1193 paragraph 78.1. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  So Mr Chair you will see and the – the 
paragraph that I would like you to go to is – oh so page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry first of all what are we looking 
for at page 1193? 
MR SINGH:  So that is… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are talking about. 
MR SINGH:  Yes so this is the affidavit I was talking about 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  But if you – if you move to page 119… 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 22 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And whose affidavit is this? 
MR SINGH:  This is Mr Hadebe’s affidavit Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SINGH:  If we move to page 1195 you see paragraph 
81 there Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  It says there was a meeting that was called on 
or about 27 October by Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Okay and 81.1 basically deals with the people 
10 
that were there who are basically Mr Mabelane Chief 
Procurement Officer, Mr Govender who was the Programme 
Director on this, Eskom’s then Director Group Capital, two 
representatives from Vikas – from McKinsey being Vikas 
and Dr Weiss and 81.2 deals with Mr Laher explaining the 
hold-up 
in 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
Master 
Services 
Agreement relating to National Treasury approval which 
again relates to this matter of the fixed fee versus the risk 
base fee vis-a-vis the Instruction Note that Mr Seleka 
speaks to that found its way into the Policy document. 
20 
 
81.4 Mr Chair is what is applicable to us.  81.4 
basically states: 
“Notwithstanding 
the 
fact 
the 
Mr 
Koko 
signed the Instruction Note – I mean signs 
the Eskom Policy that gave effect to the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 23 of 249 
 
Instruction Note.” 
He still then in 81.4 states: 
“Mr Koko stated that his intention was to 
obtain an external opinion on the matter.” 
Okay.   
“McKinsey 
also 
stated 
that 
they 
would 
provide their own view about whether the 
remuneration 
model 
was 
in 
line 
with 
National Treasury instructions or not.” 
Okay.  And Mr Chair from there flows two legal opinions.  
10 
One was obtained from Advocate Kennedy SC and another 
one was obtained from a legal firm Mazwai Attorneys.  
Okay. 
 
The Mazwai Attorney opinion I think was received 
by – by McKinsey and the Kennedy opinion was received 
by Eskom.  Okay. 
 
So 
the 
Eskom 
opinion 
from 
Kennedy 
– 
from 
Advocate Kennedy Mr Chair indicated that he believed at 
the 
time 
that 
the 
Instruction 
Note 
may 
have 
been 
applicable.  But he also concedes that there is ambiguity 
20 
as to whether it is applicable or not. 
 
So I think he is advise was eventually yes you know 
engage with National Treasury to understand what the 
situation is. 
 
By that time Mazwai had given an opinion and they 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 24 of 249 
 
categorically said the – you do not need to get approval.  
Okay.  So there was this ambiguity.  So what then 
happened Mr Chair subsequent to receiving Kennedy’s – 
Advocate Kennedy’s opinion as well as Mazwai’s opinion 
there was then in December if you recall Mr Mabelane 
issued the letter of acceptance to McKinsey and in there 
Mr Chair he – he actually states the nature of this issue 
and what Eskom’s position was at the time in issuing this 
letter of acceptance. 
 
And if you want to Mr Chair we can take you 
10 
through it because I think it is important for you to 
understand the chronology of events in terms of what has 
transpired on this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we have those legal opinions you are 
talking about in one of the bundles by any chance? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I do not think we incorporated them in 
the bundles Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I know that they – I think they are 
annexures or maybe they from the – what is it they call it 
20 
the Record Bundle. In that High Court application and we 
can – we can have them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 25 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But just not incorporated in the 
bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine, okay, alright.  So they 
can be – one could see them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You – Mr Singh you were – 
you then wanted to – did you want to refer us to the letter 
of acceptance? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair I would have – I would have like 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So maybe actually Mr Chair let us just use Mr 
Hadebe’s affidavit if we then move to page 1199. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1199 yes. 
MR SINGH:  Actually Mr Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it quote the letter – 00:31:00 it 
does. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  87.1. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair for – for convenience at this stage 
whatever it is worth paragraph 84 of Mr Hadebe’s affidavit 
deals with Advocate Paul Kennedy SC’s opinion and there 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 26 of 249 
 
is a – they quote a relevant extract. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  If it – if it is helpful for you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Basically the opinions are conflicting 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because one is for Eskom by one of 
my colleagues and the other is McKinsey sourcing an 
10 
opinion from a law firm and they come to a different 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh for the purposes of the letter 
of acceptance that is in Eskom Bundle 14. 
MR SINGH:  I was just going to use – I was just going to 
use Mr Hadebe’s affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Will you use that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes because it is written – it is actually 
quoted. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  But I think the Chairperson might 
want to have sight of the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what is the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 811.111 but now Chair that is a 
different Eskom Bundle. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 27 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay for what it is worth let me … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just have the acceptance letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  811.111.  And Chair as you look at it we 
did obtain the one – a copy signed by McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but the contents are the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure I understand the paragraph 
10 
in the letter of acceptance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That talks about a condition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says: 
“It is a condition of the acceptance that 
Eskom considered opinion of the National 
Treasury instruction will hold throughout the 
life of the contract.” 
I do not know what Mr Mabelane was trying to say there. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes a senior moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next sentence says: 
“In an unlikely eventuality that the said 
opinion is conclusively altered the parties 
hereby 
agree 
to 
review 
the 
contract 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 28 of 249 
 
payment 
basis 
to 
affect 
the 
revised 
opinion.” 
I cannot make head or tail what he is trying to say. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I also have not – as I said I was not 
party to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  I know nothing of this all I can say is this is 
what the position was at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So 00:35:34 December based on these two 
10 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but you have got to – how can you 
say this is what the position was at the time if you do not 
know what it says the position is? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair as I said I qualified by saying I 
was not party to it but if you want me to give you my view I 
will tell you what existed at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or what you understood it to be. 
MR SINGH:  Understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell me what you understood to mean. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair at the time as I said I was not 
party to it so I did not know what it meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SINGH:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well it does not help then. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 29 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I – maybe the – maybe he just 
formulated this paragraph inelegantly but I cannot tell what 
he is trying to say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja Chair I am not going to be able to 
help you because I am equally lost by that paragraph. But 
as I said yesterday Mr Koko cut a long story short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  But Mr Chair before we go… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Singh let Mr Seleka finish. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes he cut a long story short and I think 
he 
appreciated 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
conclusion 
of 
this 
agreement required National Treasury approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And he did not have it and he said… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He said so much here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is was wrong to conclude this 
20 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
MR SINGH:  Who? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 30 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  No that is fine but you asked me for my view 
so I am giving you my view Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I know that but you do not have a 
view. 
MR SINGH:  No I have a view.  I do not 00:36:41 I have a 
view.  I am telling you my view.  At the time Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not have a view then. 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you have a view now. 
MR SINGH:  Based on the information that I see yes Mr 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja is your view about what this paragraph 
means or is it something else? 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair I am taking you through the 
relevant information that existed and I am bringing you to a 
point that was one of the – that is one of the – how can I 
say?  Pertinent facts that you were need to be aware of 
that existed at the time in that Mr Mabelane issued this 
letter with that condition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is that ja tell me? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair the paragraph you just read in the 
letter of acceptance.  So if we then move on Mr Chair to … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Wait the Chair does not follow you.  He 
is referring to the paragraph Chair which is – which you 
just read which we cannot understand. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 31 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I have read that paragraph I do not 
understand what it means. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that you wanted to tell me what 
you think it means. 
MR SINGH:  Oh okay.  So Mr Chair I can attempt to tell 
what I think it means now.  If you look at – if we go back to 
83.1 Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  80? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
10 
MR SINGH:  Page 1197. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1197 of? 
MR SINGH:  The same. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is Bundle D, that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  14(d). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  14(d) Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is of Eskom Bundle 14(d). 
MR SINGH:  D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And page 1197. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  So we are at paragraph 83 – 83 83.1 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR SINGH:  So there you see Mr Chair on – at paragraph 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 32 of 249 
 
83 it says: 
On 
3 
December 
Mr 
Benedict 
Piri 
McKinsey’s 
associate general counsel who is their head of legal I 
would assume sent an email to Mr Govender of Eskom and 
the correspondent read as follows: 
In essence they were seeking for Eskom to – 
appealing to Eskom’s bravery and they also concede that 
this is a grey area in terms of the applicability of this 
Instruction Note and this is where I try and – Mr Chair refer 
the commission to two different instructing documents. 
10 
So 
Mr 
Seleka 
refers 
to 
a 
Practice 
Note 
of 
2013/2014 Instruction Note 1 am I correct?  And if you then 
have regard for the – oh sorry I was still explaining why 
this thing was there. Sorry Chair. 
So – so McKinsey also understands that this is a 
grey area Mr Chair.  Now this is after they have obtained 
the Mazwai opinion.  Okay that says the Instruction Note is 
now applicable.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us – let us try and shorten this if 
we can.  Is your position that you cannot say whether or 
20 
not the conclusion of this agreement was legal – was legal 
or was lawful? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair is you give me three minutes of 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 33 of 249 
 
maximum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  I will – I will try and conclude this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR SINGH:  Okay.  So my first contention Mr Chair is that 
we are comparing two different Instruction Notes.  2003 
Instruction Note 1 which is what Mr Hadebe and Mr Seleka 
relies on and to an extent now Mr Koko. 
 
But if you move to – one second Mr Chair.   If you 
move to paragraph 90 of – so page 1202. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  90 you said. 
MR SINGH:  Paragraph 90.2 on page 1202. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what paragraph? 
MR SINGH:  90.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got it. 
MR SINGH:  So you see there Mr Chair it says: 
“On 
4 
February 
2016 
Mr 
00:41:30 
responded stating that.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  It says: 
20 
“Practice Note 3 of 2003 is still applicable 
until replaced with a new Instruction after 
the 
promulgation 
of 
new 
Treasury 
regulations. 
The 
retainer 
contingency 
principles are not clearly outlined in the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 34 of 249 
 
Practice Note.  If you intend applying them 
you need to do some further work to ensure 
that they do not compromise the principles 
of 217 and other legislation.” 
 
Now this is the email I was referring to earlier Mr 
Chair.  And Mr Chitty Phango [?] Mr Chair albeit that Mr 
Hadebe basically down plays his capacity is the Chief 
Director in National Treasury responsible for governance 
and monitoring? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you proceed you have the 
10 
quotation in 90.2 what do you understand it to mean? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair firstly it tells us that there are two 
different documents that are actually being used.  Mr 
Hadebe relies on Practice Note 1 of 2013.  This basically 
refers to Practice Note 3 of 2003 and it says it is still 
applicable until replaced with a new instruction after 
promulgation of the new Treasury regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Practice Note 3 of 2003 is that the 
one that said – is that the one relating to the appointment 
of consultants on a fee basis? 
20 
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair the Practice Note that Mr Hadebe 
and Mr Seleka relies on is Practice Note 1 of 2013/14 okay.  
This is Practice Note 3 of 2013 which obviously precedes 
this Instruction Note that they refer to.  This says that 2003 
Practice Note 2003 is still applicable and you can still 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 35 of 249 
 
remunerate on a risk basis given you do some stuff.  
 
So my first point is Mr Chair is that we are 
comparing two different how can I say – enabling or 
governing documents.  So I am trying to say that at the 
date when all of this was transpiring vis-a-vis the actual 
agreement this is what National Treasury’s view was at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I go back to my question you 
remember you said in three minutes time you would have 
made the point.  Is your position that you are not able to 
10 
say whether the conclusion of this agreement without the 
approvals in terms of the PFMA was lawful or not? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair in my view given this email from 
National Treasury I believe that Eskom had the required 
standing to enter into the applicable contract – on the 
applicable basis because it is clear that the Instruction 
Note is applicable and so replaced.  And Mr Chair at the 
time Mr Chitty Phango [?] would have been fully aware of 
the Instruction Note that Mr Seleka refers to because he 
was the – he would have been the person that issued the 
20 
Instruction Note.  It would not have come from anybody 
else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your position is that as far as you are 
concerned it was lawful it was proper? 
MR SINGH:  In terms – based on this email. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 36 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Based on this ja. 
MR SINGH:  Email from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  And what Mr Singh 
should have read to you Chair is the page before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is page 1201 paragraph 90 
because they seeking this thing after they have purported 
to conclude the agreement.  Paragraph 90 say: 
“After the Master Service Agreement was 
10 
signed. And if you take the allegation that it 
was concluded in January 2016 Eskom 
made some attempt to engage with the 
National Treasury although no approval was 
ever secured.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you – did you say paragraph 
90? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  90 ja.  90. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Because Chair remember as you 
20 
read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think – I think you – the point you 
make. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you refer to this may be saying but 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 37 of 249 
 
here it is said that no approval was secured. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I understand his point to be different. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – sorry Chair yes just before that.  
That after they signed the agreement and I should add 
purported to conclude the agreement they then sought – 
they took this step. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But the contract requires them to do the 
step before they conclude the agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I appreciate that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying my understanding of what Mr 
Singh’s view is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that he is saying you can say whatever 
you want to say about approvals. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Here is an email from Treasury – 
National Treasury. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And his understanding of that email is the 
agreement could be concluded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is his point.  So that he says 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 38 of 249 
 
whoever sent the email would have known about whatever 
requirements. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who sent the email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 As 
far 
as 
Mr 
Singh 
is 
concerned 
everything was proper then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I understand his position. 
MR SINGH:  And Mr Chair in response to Mr Seleka I agree 
with you Mr Chair in terms of your proposition. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Articulation of not my proposal. 
MR SINGH:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what you are saying. 
MR SINGH:  Yes in terms of what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  But in addition to that Mr Chair the reason for 
me to highlight to you the condition in the letter of 
acceptance is particularly for this reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  It is because Eskom concluded the letter of 
20 
acceptance with the view that National Treasury instruction 
note was not approved.  The instruction note that Mr 
Hadebe and Mr Seleka relies on therefore that condition 
found its way there as ambiguous as it is.  So that 
empowered them to sign on the basis that it was not 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 39 of 249 
 
approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   To confirm that it was not applicable, they 
then engaged with Treasury, through this process that 
resulted in Mr Chevy Mfango’s response.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   And that is the position I take relating to this 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay we can move on.  That is Eskom.  
Mr Radebe’s position is Eskom’s position. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I was at Eskom at the time as 
well, at some point as well.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but we take note of the fact that 
you are relying ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   So give me a contract and I will go back to 
Eskom and then I will you my official position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again?  [laughs] 
20 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What, you want to go back to Eskom or 
what?  [laughs] 
MR SINGH:   I was just saying to you, if I go back to 
Eskom then I can give you an official position as well. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 40 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Well...  Yes.  Now, Mr Singh what 
you have said to the Chairperson, that you did not know 
these things at the time.  You are relying on them now 
when – as you see them.   
MR SINGH:   But you are now asking me a question and I 
am responding to you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Why did you terminate this 
agreement, by the way? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The MSA, why did you terminate it?  
The MSA was meant to be three years.  Ms Goodson, when 
she starts at Trillian, she is told by Mr Angel, Clive Angel 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Again, I was not – I was having a sip of 
water.  So can you repeat? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  I was asking you.  Why did you 
terminate this MSA, by the way?  Because it was meant to 
be for three years.  You terminated it hardly six months 
20 
into it.  It was meant to be for three years.  Ms Goodson 
said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
that 
hardly 
six 
months 
from 
January 2016 
or 
from 
– 
or 
October 
2016 
or 
from 
June 2016? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 41 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chair.  That is – 
because Mr Singh’s version has changed.  You know it has 
evolved 
over 
time, 
Mr 
Singh? 
 
Your 
affidavit 
says 
January 2016, is the conclusion.  Yesterday, you were 
adamant it is 31 March 2016, the conclusion.  I do not 
know on what basis.  And then we have mister – Dr Weiss 
saying he only signed in October 2016.  But assuming this 
contract was in place and you purport to terminate it in 
June 2016.  Why did you terminate it? 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, firstly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just understand.  Where you say 
why did you terminate, is that you as in Mr Singh or you as 
in Eskom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I think maybe ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He will clarify.  Okay.  Mr Singh 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let him clarify, Chair. 
MR SINGH:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let your answer, will clarify.  We will see 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 42 of 249 
 
whether you say why you are asking me.  I did not 
terminate anything.  Or whether you say, yes, I terminated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think Mr Singh knows. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They made a submission to the BTC 
with reasons to terminate.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he – the case that you know, 
Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   So, hence I was going to clarify that. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   It is the – technically incorrect to say that I 
did not terminate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not? 
MR SINGH:   I did not terminate the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not terminate the agreement? 
MR SINGH:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   I was not the delegated authority to terminate 
the agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   The original decision to enter into the 
agreement was taken by the board and the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   So the decision to terminate or otherwise, 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 43 of 249 
 
was sent back to the board... and the Board Tender 
Committee made a conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think first.  Before we go there.  I 
want to clarify that I am not too sure that Mr Seleka gets 
the changing of my version.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice goes down. 
MR SINGH:   I am saying, I want to clarify that I am not too 
sure where Mr Seleka finds that my versions have been 
changed. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MR SINGH:   Because if you go ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he said your affidavit said the 
contract was concluded in January.  And then he said, 
yesterday you said it was, what, 31 March?  That is what – 
how he sought to back up what you are saying. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, I am sorry to 
interrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   This is not what Mr Singh said 
yesterday.  He never stated categorically that it was 
terminated by the 31 s t of March but to put that proposition 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Not terminated, concluded.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 44 of 249 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Or concluded.  He never said 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   It is not what he said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   And my learned friend should 
refrain from putting statements to him that is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Singh can correct him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   He can say but I did not say that.  That 
will be ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   That is why I am saying Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you did not say that. 
MR SINGH:   I did not say that and he knows that.  I said 
in these Steering Committee meeting of...  I think it was 
the second Steering Committee.  I think there was a 
slight... at that step(?) by the 31 s t of March any contract 
should be concluded, the contract should be signed.  So I 
said between 31 March and 28 June, at some point in time, 
20 
this contract was then signed based on the Eskom version 
of the facts that were there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, Mr Singh, you have to tell the 
truth whatever the truth is, okay? 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 45 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you are able to say if having initially 
said in your affidavit the contract was concluded in 
January 2016 and later on you said it was concluded in – 
on the 31 s t of March 2016.  If that is what you said that 
version might look in a certain way.  The version you are 
putting now is – or the version now seems to be:  Yes, in 
the affidavit I said it was concluded in January 2016 but 
right now I do not know exactly when it was concluded.  
Somewhere between the beginning of 2016 and mid-2016.  
Somewhere there.  Am I right? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Well, Chairman, I have a problem with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   When I give a – when I am requested to 
comment on a document and they say here is the 
document, what do you have to say about it?  So I tell him, 
based on what I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I accept that ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No, let me finish Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   Then I get Dr Weiss that comes in December 
20 
that says, no, this thing was now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In October. 
MR SINGH:   ...in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Now I never knew that before that, as I 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 46 of 249 
 
testified.  The first time that I came to know that this 
contract was not signed at any point was when they...   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Ja.  Well, ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   So when – and even when I come here, I said 
to – I say to you the first things.  These are not things that 
were in my – they were to within my personal knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   However, if you want me to go to them, I will 
go to them with the information that I have before me 
based on what I have seen thus far. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   If you bring another piece of information to 
me tomorrow ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it might change. 
MR SINGH:   ...indicating otherwise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   I concede to the position that I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   So it is not evolving on the basis that I am 
being ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is changing information. 
MR SINGH:   It is changing information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I do not need to 
belabour the point but Mr Singh you do not need the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 47 of 249 
 
version of Dr Weiss to tell the Chairperson when your, 
according 
to 
your 
knowledge, 
the 
agreement 
was 
concluded because even with Dr Weiss’ affidavit you have 
said it was signed in January 2016.  Yesterday you said, 
because 
of 
Dr 
Weiss’ 
letter 
of 
28 
June, 
then 
this 
agreement must have been signed between March and 
June 2016. 
MR SINGH:   But Mr Chair, again, it is coming back to this 
point of what information.  As I said to you.  When I came 
in – the first time I came here and I was presented with 
10 
this.  I think Mr Seleka asked me:  When was this thing 
signed? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Right.  And I said I do not know when it this 
thing...  It was the first time that I heard of the fact that 
this thing was not signed, was when Dr Weiss was 
testifying.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   So I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, is not it a fair point to make, 
20 
Mr Singh, the one I think you made yesterday that you 
have personal knowledge of Mr Mabelane signed. 
MR SINGH:   That is fair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So you have to look at what 
information is placed there.  You were not there when he 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 48 of 249 
 
signed.  So you cannot say that is the date that he signed. 
MR SINGH:   And hence, Mr Chair, I take exception to the 
fact that Seleka says my version is constantly changing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   My version is not constantly changing 
because of the information that is placed before me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Well, the information changes, you 
look at it and say it would affect what you say. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   I mean, otherwise, I am going to sit here and 
I am going to say to you:  Oh, no it is still signed in 
January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Yet there is a letter that says it still in 
draft(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I think Mr Singh, the important 
thing is.  You did say you have no personal knowledge 
when it was signed.  So the person who can tell us when 
actually it is signed is Mr Mabelane.   
20 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Dr Weiss has said in his affidavit 
when he signed. 
MR SINGH:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We do not have an affidavit from 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 49 of 249 
 
Mr Mabelane, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have one of his ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or when he signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, we are getting one from him Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is one.  There is one on the 
issues but he does not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Deal with that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...deal with this particular issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we have approached him to address 
this issue and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay alright.  No, that is fine.  I 
think let us move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Thank you.  Mr Singh, you did not 
mention the reasons why the termination was made. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, in the- I think it was the third 
BTC, Steering Committee meeting relating to the master 
service agreement, as I said yesterday.  It was a closed 
session that was called. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, it is your voice again. 
MR SINGH:   There was a closed session that was called to 
discuss the issue of the MSA.  And they were the issues 
relating to the letter that we have discussed yesterday, the 
19 t h of February letter, that we were still...  And at that 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 50 of 249 
 
stage, there were also – that coincided with that Mr Chair, 
there was a significant amount of focus that National 
Treasury had started placing on what they called Sole 
Source Contract.   
 
And Sole Source basically means contract that 
are 
placed 
without 
an... 
 And 
there 
was 
additional 
guidance, there was additional reporting requirements, 
there was additional practise to be considered and so on.  
So with all of those matters – even, Mr Chair, the issue of 
the contact value at that stage, also became a little bit 
10 
more apparent because being a risk place contract I do not 
think this contract actually had a value that anyone 
understood.   
 
And I think Ms ...[indistinct] or Mosilo(?), I think 
eluded to the fact that there was this contract as big as ten 
billion or twelve billion or whatever the...  So all of those 
factors, Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It ultimately became one point six 
billion. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It ultimately became one point six 
billion. 
MR SINGH:   No, no.  Mr Chair, what I am talking about is 
the potential had it lasted three years would have basically 
gone to at least ten or twelve billion in terms of the – this 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 51 of 249 
 
sharing model and obviously if the benefits had been...  
Given all of these changes, as well as I think Mr Mabelane 
at the time, added an additional concern that was raised by 
the external auditors relating to the - I think it was the 
Corporate Plan contract or even this contract.  I am not – I 
think it may have been referring to this contract.   
 
That they had raised concerns regarding the 
validity of the fund(?) in terms of it potentially being 
considered irregular expenditure.  So all of those issues 
and more particularly, I think, the concerns raised by the 
10 
external auditors were factored into the decision.  And the 
recommendation was made to the Board Tender Committee 
to consider it...   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that was a long answer.  Is it not 
possible for you to say the reasons why the contract was 
terminated were A, B, C? 
MR SINGH:   Okay, Mr Chair, it was A, the issue of the 
19 t h  of February letter that was discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  What about it?  That there 
have been no compliance or what? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, there as – as I said yesterday – 
there was pretty much compliance ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...in the terms of the way they had responded 
to the letter. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 52 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   But I do not think it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You say they did not comply completely 
at some stage, you said so? 
MR SINGH:   Ja.  I think, Mr Chair, it was more around the 
substance 
of 
the 
whole programme 
because 
when I 
received this Steering Committee mandate, the concerns 
relating to the 19 t h  of February letter, it was relating to the 
programme that I... in terms of the Steer Co.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let me ask the question this way 
10 
so that we can eliminate some things.  Was any of the 
reasons, assumingly there were two or more reasons. 
MR SINGH:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Assuming – ja, assuming there were two 
or more reasons for the termination.  Was there any reason 
that was based – that related to what McKinsey had done 
wrong? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nothing? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was just Eskom’s own decision based 
on certain reasons? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay what were they? 
MR SINGH:   So, basically, Mr Chair, if we put them in 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 53 of 249 
 
order of importance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   The first one was the external auditor ’s view? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   The external auditor ’s view ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   ...on the contract itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the programme? 
MR SINGH:   On the programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And its validity and so on because if they had 
an issue with it Mr Chair, it would ultimately reflect as 
irregular expenditure in terms of the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay the external auditors had a view 
which indicated that there was a risk. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would flag it irregularity. 
MR SINGH:   Irregular expenditure. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Irregular...  Ja, okay.  That was one. 
MR SINGH:   That was one.  And that flowed, Mr Chair, 
from the increased focus that National Treasury was 
placing on...  contract.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 54 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   Right.  Which either – so they were doing it in 
two ways.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   They were doing it, firstly, in terms of 
swindling(?) the processes and procedures and grounds on 
which you could actually do sole sources into the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But National Treasury was 
questioning whether there was justification for concluding 
this contract on a sole source basis. 
MR SINGH:   No, particularly this one Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, just ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   They were issuing guidance and directives(?) 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In general? 
MR SINGH:   In general. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   That was both backward looking and forward 
looking.  So the forward looking stuff was to say:  Listen, 
we want to strengthen these sole source thing because we 
think it is an area that is being abused.  For now instead of 
20 
just complying with two requirements, we now need to 
comply with ten.  Okay.   
 
And the backward looking stuff was to say:  
Listen, we may understand that you have entered into 
contracts before on sole source basis.  Can you give us a 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 55 of 249 
 
report on these – on a periodic basis?  So it was another 
level of monitoring that was now happening.  So those two 
were the primary reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Reasons.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:   But the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the risk that the external auditors 
could flag it as an irregular expenditure. 
MR SINGH:   Irregular expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two.  That the requirements faced by 
National Treasury on the use of sole source contracts. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Both in terms of forward looking 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   As well as ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the kinds of things that they wanted 
Eskom to ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Comply with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...comply with and as far as backward 
looking, as far as things ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Monitor ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that they wanted to get reports on. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Mister ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 56 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   And then, Mr Chair, obviously the value of the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Given those two issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Also became a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  At that stage, was the value 
known? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, given these ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Requirements. 
10 
MR SINGH:   ...these developments, then we then had to 
have an answer in terms of what was this value.  Or 
certainly, I did not know the value then(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   So then the value was then – then we have – 
then 
a 
calculation 
was 
done 
and 
then 
I 
had 
an 
understanding what the value was.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   And it was in the region of the ten or twelve 
billion that has already been ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over three years? 
MR SINGH:   Over the three year period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Even that value with the two initial concerns 
that I raised because a bit concerning that we were now 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 57 of 249 
 
entering into this type of contract ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   ...those – with significant exposure, given the 
reporting 
requirements 
and 
the 
potential 
irregular 
expenditure that this thing could lead to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
MR SINGH:   So those were the primary and as a last one, 
okay, I think we then discussed the issue of the responses 
that McKinsey had given us but not in the context of 
whether McKinsey complied or not.  Because as I said 
10 
yesterday.  In principle they complied with all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   They said yes to everything.  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   The discussion was more around, how do we 
actually – if we have an objective of the 18 top engineers 
and if we have an objective of the 18 empowering 
consulting or empowered consulting companies, what is the 
best way to do that?  Is it actually to do, you know, a 
massive contract with one company?   
20 
 
Or is better to actually give it to a number of – 
select five or six or seven or whatever the number is.  And 
then try and, you know, get a broader based type of 
implementation plan for economic empowerment rather 
than having, let us say, one.   
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 58 of 249 
 
 
So that was more – the decision – the discussion 
surrounded more the – how can I say – not the – as I said, 
it was not about McKinsey whether they complied or not.  It 
was more about, how does Eskom actually see it actually 
playing a role in achieving those... whether it be through 
one big bang approach or whether it be through smaller 
initiatives.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But as with regard to compliance, while 
on the one hand, you did say yesterday by virtue of 
McKinsey’s response to your letter of the 19 t h  of February.   
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You took the view or Eskom took the 
view that they were complying or they had complied but 
you did say that later you were not satisfied or Eskom was 
not satisfied about at least one requirement if I am not 
mistaken. 
MR SINGH:   No, no Mr Chair.  My feedback to the 
Commission.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   In principle they had complied in a response 
20 
to the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   But at the subsequent Steer Co we had a 
discussion relating to the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 59 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   And the elements of the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Which is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Elements 
of 
their 
response 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   My ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of your ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No, their response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And this is the meeting that I was referring 
10 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Where we discussed the broader aspects of 
how implementation of a programme of this nature could be 
considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Given the current environment we are finding 
ourselves in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So that was discussed, not the actual 
20 
compliance or non-compliance of the issues that were 
listed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Seleka raised the point that because the 
BEE questioned of my letter ...[intervenes]  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 60 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had not been finalised. 
MR SINGH:   ...had not been finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   He then says that could never been valid(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But I thought you agreed, at some 
stage with him, that that part, namely the issue of SDL 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because McKinsey never concluded any 
agreement with a subcontractor in terms of SDL and there 
10 
was no compliance in that regard.  But you were saying 
when 
Mr 
Mabelane 
signed, 
you 
do 
not 
know 
what 
discussion may have arisen with regard to that. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which may have led to him to sign. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you had no personal knowledge, 
yourself, that the SDL requirement was met. 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the Chairperson is also correct in 
regard to the part which is, even after they had sent you a 
response to you, Mr Singh, later you met with the Steering 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 61 of 249 
 
Committee and you were not satisfied that they have met 
all your requests.  You did say that yesterday. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, let us understand this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   The issue of the 19 t h...  As you said 
yesterday, the 19 t h of February letter is going to be... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR SINGH:   I understand Mr Seleka’s point of view in 
terms of focussing on the 19 t h  of February letter but 
Mr Chair, again, it is a point that the Board Tender 
10 
Committee delegated to the Group Executive Technology 
and Commercial ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but Chair.  Can I ask Mr Singh 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No, no, no.  Let me ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me...  Mr Seleka thinks you might 
not be going towards responding to his question. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He just wants us to understand.  Yes, 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, we have put to Mr Singh 
what we remember he said yesterday. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 62 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He needs to say:  Yes, that is what I 
said or that is not what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay do you want to repeat the question 
maybe. 
MR SINGH:   That is not what I said. 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on a second.  Just repeat the 
10 
question and then you answer Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  What we remember Mr Singh is 
saying is that they did respond to him.  He wrote the letter 
with those bullet points that the signing of the proposed 
agreement is contingent upon the successful response to 
this.  They responded.  And you said, however, after the 
response, you had a Steering Committee and you were not 
satisfied that they have successfully satisfied all your 
requests.  That is what you said.   
 
And then I said:  Well, that is the one part, Mr 
20 
Singh.  The last part is what the Chairperson said to you.  
Then I went further to say:  I can even tell you there is one 
in particular which was not satisfied and that was the SDL. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, that is not what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Singh. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 63 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said your question is – seeks to get 
confirmation from him or agreement whether he said 
something or not.  What is that you want ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  Which is, Chair, that even 
after they had received the responses from McKinsey in a 
subsequent 
meeting 
of 
the 
Steering 
Committee, 
the 
Steering Committee was not completely satisfied that they 
have answered all the requests. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say that yesterday, Mr Singh? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I would ask Mr Seleka to 
clarify what he is actually asking.  In what he asked me a 
few minutes ago and what he is asking me now, there is a 
difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Just focus on the last one.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says he understood you to say 
yesterday.  Although when you had looked at McKinsey’s 
response to your letter, you had thought that McKinsey had 
satisfied the requirements. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Subsequently, in a meeting – I think you 
said ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   The Steering Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In a subsequent meeting of the Steering 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 64 of 249 
 
Committee, the matter was discussed and you, that is the 
committee, I think ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was not satisfied that McKinsey had 
not satisfied all the requirements.  So he wants you to 
confirm whether his recollection of what you said is correct 
or not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   It is correct to the extent that I was clarifying 
yesterday even the context within which this Steering 
10 
Committee discussion was happening.  And I have clarified 
that because you have allowed me an opportunity to clarify 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine.  At least that is 
clarified, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us take the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Shall we take the ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...tea-break.  I do not know whether the 
pace is fine.  I have a felling the pace is not as good as it 
should 
be 
but 
you 
know 
that 
better 
because 
you 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 65 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in terms of what still needs to be dealt 
with in terms of Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the end, we seek to strike a balance 
between doing justice to the issues and not being too slow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us take the tea-break and then 
when we resume ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...if there is something to finalise on the 
MSA, do so but we need to get to Tegeta as soon as 
possible. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we – it is twenty past.  We will 
take the tea adjournment.  We will resume at twenty-five to 
twelve. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 66 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh, let 
me – time is the enemy at this stage.  I think we are 
enjoying your evidence but we will have to approach it 
differently.  So the termination is done on 16 June – by 
letter dated 16 June 2016 for the reason that you have 
articulated.   
 
Those reasons, Chairperson, are found in the 
minutes.  Well, not the extent you have mentioned them.  
The minutes of Steer Co you have mentioned but also in 
the submission that was made to the BTC.  Those are in 
10 
the bundle, Chair.   
 
Can you explain to the Chairperson, Mr Singh?  
After the termination in June, there were – there was a 
meeting with – the meeting of the Steer Committee, at 
least in August 2016 which still included Trillian and 
McKinsey. 
 
What 
was 
the 
reason 
for 
that 
further 
engagement with them? 
MR SINGH:   I have lost you at the last bit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What was the reason for further 
engaging with Trillian and McKinsey after the termination 
20 
of 
the 
MSA 
or 
the 
purported 
termination 
on 
the 
16 t h of June 2016? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the – once the termination was 
communicated to McKinsey, there was an understanding 
that – or not an understand, an agreement – that it would 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 67 of 249 
 
make logical sense for the programmes to reach a logical 
end 
point 
on 
our 
programme’s 
initiatives 
within 
the 
programme to reach a logical conclusion, if you can call it 
that, that were already in progress.   
 
So that – they ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words, there was an 
agreement that certain work that was in progress should be 
finalised? 
MR SINGH:   Would be finalised and no new initiatives 
would be undertaken. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:   And I think that date, I think, Mr Chair, was 
around somewhere in July/August if I am not mistaken.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Ja, the last meeting as we have 
it, is the 4 t h of August 2016.  Okay.  When Ms Matshepo 
was here, she testified that when McKinsey decided to 
terminate further discussion with Trillian for the purposes 
of considering them as a subcontractor in respect of the 
MSA, you were unhappy with that termination and you 
asked them to give – you asked McKinsey to give Trillian 
20 
more time to provide them with documentation that was 
required in regard to BEE and ownership of the entity but 
McKinsey was steadfast in their position.  What is your 
comment in regard to her version that you were unhappy 
with that decision? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 68 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I – as I testified before.  I think, 
Mr Chair, the choice of a sub-contractor relates is – is the 
prerogative of the main contractor.  Eskom is a recipient of 
that outcome.  I do not recall being unhappy with 
McKinsey’s view as Dr Weiss has testified.  We requested 
that they provide us alternatives in terms of being able to 
onboard a new supplier [indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Face the Chairperson.  Ja.  Did you 
hear, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I did, ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is fine.  Recall again that your 
– that letter of the 19 February specifically mentioned the 
BEE partner (Regiments Group) and in response to that 
letter Trillian – McKinsey rather, sorry, indicated that they 
will not subcontract with Regiments but they will consider 
Trillian which was at the time under review.  Is there 
reason why – well, I know you dealt with – I think you were 
explaining 
the 
reason 
why 
you 
specified 
Regiments 
yesterday, is that right? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not know.  I was not trying to 
specify, all I was trying to do yesterday was to reference to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
opening 
paragraph 
refers 
to 
the 
Regiments Group and then the second sentence in the 
paragraph relates to incorporating or ultimately moving 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 69 of 249 
 
over to Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes but not those paragraphs, I am 
talking about your requests to Trillian – I mean, to 
McKinsey.  Number 4 was about the development of a BEE 
partner 
(Regiments 
Group) 
as 
regards 
the 
visions, 
aspirations, yes.  Do you remember that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, that is my – I am responding to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   I am saying I cannot remember why 
Regiments Group was put into paragraph 4 specifically. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you cannot remember, okay. 
MR SINGH:   But I did comment on the fact that the 
opening paragraph, the first two sentences of the opening 
paragraphs of the letter refers to Regiments Group and 
then ultimately transition to Trillian.  I think that is what 
the letter says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct, the opening statement.  I 
am just dealing with a slightly different matter and let me 
go further on that because when I read the affidavit of Dr 
Weiss and Mr Amankwah, I see something to the effect – 
20 
and I want you to comment on that, that you would have 
been the one who introduced or suggested to McKinsey to 
subcontract Regiments firstly when you were at Transnet 
and secondly when they were at Eskom.  I am going to 
read that to you, you can go to – Chair, we can go to the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 70 of 249 
 
affidavit of firstly Mr Amankwah, Eskom bundle 14(C) page 
702.10.  Assist Mr Singh there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   702.210. 
CHAIRPERSON:   702.210. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair.  Paragraph 19.1. 
MR SINGH:   19.1? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Do you have it there, Mr Singh?   
MR SINGH:   Sorry, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   19.1, Mr Amankwah: 
10 
“When the above ascribed issues and conflict 
developed with Letsema...” 
Are you there? 
“...McKinsey 
began 
looking 
for 
a 
new 
supply 
development partner for its work at Transnet.  In 
discussing potential alternatives to Letsema, Mr 
Singh of Transnet noted the fact that Regiments had 
performed well for Transnet in past work that 
Regiments had done for Transnet treasury function.  
Regiments’ 
prior 
work 
with 
Transnet 
was 
20 
documented at the time in the company profile that 
was given to McKinsey as well as in proposals 
submitted by McKinsey and Regiments to Transnet.”   
Do you have a comment on this, Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Chair. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 71 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Do you have a comment on this? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair, I am just trying to think what is 
the best way to respond to this statement.  Mr Chair, Mr 
Amankwah’s version of events is very far from reality as I 
had no such interactions with suggesting Regiments as a 
subcontractor to McKinsey at any time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Actually to be quite honest, Mr Chair, the 
transcripts of Dr Fine goes into great detail as to how 
Regiments actually ended up being a subcontractor of 
10 
McKinsey and if you want to go there, we can go there, I 
think we should got there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it is fine, that is your response. 
MR SINGH:   No, I think I am going to go there because 
this is an issue …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To Dr Fine’s transcripts? 
MR SINGH:   Or his affidavit because I am sure he is 
covering it in his affidavit as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, we do not have it here. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, this is …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you say Dr Fine’s affidavit or 
evidence says? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, Dr Fine basically goes through a 
process of explaining how Regiments was introduced to 
…[intervenes] 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 72 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:   To McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Because Mr Amankwah’s allegation is that I 
suggested to McKinsey that they should use Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Okay?  So firstly I am saying Mr Amankwah’s 
allegation is not based in fact, he does not support this 
10 
allegation with any piece of paper. 
 
Secondly I am saying that both Dr Fine and Dr 
Weiss go through some level of detail in terms of how 
Regiments became a subcontractor of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I have seen something along 
those lines. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In one of the affidavits. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   It was part of the money stream – Dr Weiss, 
Dr Fine and Mieszala were on the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Dr Weiss’ affidavit we have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We had it yesterday. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 73 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we did have it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I also have a... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, can we go to where he had done so?  
Can we go where Dr Weiss gives a background of how 
Regiments was introduced to McKinsey. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If everyone’s understanding is that he 
does do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I am on that page, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, maybe you can read it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, page, ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I need us to go there because I 
have another question. 
MR SINGH:   I have not finished with this one, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but let us go there, you will 
continue.  Let us go to that page where Dr Weiss deals 
with how Regiments was introduced to McKinsey because 
you said Dr Fine or Dr Weiss – Mr Singh, is that right?   
20 
You said both of them deal at length with how Regiments 
got to work with McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:   I think Dr Weiss does deal with some of the 
aspects relating to Transnet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 74 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   And then Dr Fine deals with it in greater 
detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is it fine if we go to whichever one 
of them or you want us to go to both? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think for present purposes maybe 
the one for Dr Fine is probably better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, do we have Dr Fine’s 
affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not that one, Chair, not in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not in any of the bundles that you have? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but it can be found somewhere? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or we do not have it at all? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, we can find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe it can be found for later 
then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, we can find it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will come to it. 
MR SINGH:   Sure, no problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, continue, Mr Seleka? 
MR SINGH:   Lastly, Mr Chair, I think in one of my 
affidavits I attach a letter that – and again, Mr Chair, 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 75 of 249 
 
forgive us but we are responding to a matter that relates to 
Transnet 
because 
this 
is 
where 
he 
is 
alleging 
this 
happened and the letter that I sent to McKinsey clearly 
states – and I think it is a 19 June letter 20-something and 
I think it is one of our affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you would have sent it while you 
were still at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   At Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   And it clearly states that Transnet accepts 
10 
Regiments as subcontractor to one of the contracts – I 
think it was a transaction adviser contract that we had 
awarded them – based on Regiments’ recommendations of 
Regiments as a subcontractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do you remember where we can 
find your letter? 
MR SINGH:   We can just check and in one of my affidavits 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, if it is not found now we 
can come back to it later when somebody has found it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will find it, Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue in the meantime, 
we will come back to it once somebody has found it. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 76 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But if you read this affidavit of Mr 
Amankwah and Mr Singh, is that not after the fact because 
when you read the affidavit there seems to be a proposal 
by you that Regiments should be McKinsey’s subcontractor 
and then a document is provided to them.  He says: 
“Regiments’ 
prior 
work 
with 
Transnet 
was 
documented at the time in the company profile that 
was given to McKinsey.” 
And I do not know – and then as a result of that, they 
would then put a proposal to Transnet – I painted a picture, 
10 
you can comment on it – then they would put a proposal to 
Transnet with Regiments as the proposer contract.  Then 
you write that letter.  Is that not how it happened? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think maybe we should introduce 
into the records the money flow session that will clarify 
these questions.  The presentation that Mr Amankwah is 
referring to, I can only believe relates to the presentation 
that was provided to Mr Sagar that then provided it to 
McKinsey and Mr Sagar would have received that from 
Regiments.  Why is being associated with me in any way, 
20 
shape or form, I do not understand, yet the money flow 
work stream has evidence on it and has received the exact 
feedback that I just gave you through an evidence leader 
of your own. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, let us go to Dr Weiss’ affidavit.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 77 of 249 
 
In the same bundle, page 693. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair, just before we move off this, 
Mr Amankwah’s affidavit, if you look at paragraph 19.3: 
“As noted by Dr Fine in his testimony before 
parliament, 
McKinsey 
conducted 
a 
basis 
due 
diligence  of Regiments prior to working with them 
in Transnet.” 
Now if you compare that to Dr Weiss’ testimony and his 
transcripts and Dr Fine’s testimony and transcripts, you 
would find that I do not think they said that they did a 
10 
basic due diligence . 
CHAIRPERSON:   They did...? 
MR SINGH:   I am saying you will find that I do not think 
they will concur that a basic due diligence on Regiments 
was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   As alluded to by Mr Amankwah in paragraph 
19.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I move on? 
20 
MR SINGH:   You can. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Dr Weiss’ affidavit, page 693, 
paragraph 44.  Are you there, Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Paragraph 44, this is Dr Weiss’ 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 78 of 249 
 
affidavit.  He says: 
“I understand from my McKinsey colleagues that Mr 
Singh 
had 
spoken 
positively 
about 
engaging 
Regiments at Eskom based on his experience with 
their work at Transnet.” 
He then goes on to say: 
“It was not unusual in my experience for executives 
to develop opinions on particular firms based on the 
work they did than to seek to engage firms that had 
performed well for subsequent projects.” 
10 
So there again seems to be the same theme, that you 
spoke 
well 
about 
– 
or 
positively 
about 
engaging 
Regiments. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, again, I am not too sure what really 
turns on this but at the end of the day, Mr Chair, I spoke 
positively of all and any firms that engaged with me that 
actually did well.  So if it was Regiments or Letsema or 
PwC or Deloittes or J P Morgan or whoever, if they set out 
to do what they were asked to do and they did it properly 
then yes, if there is a recommendation to be made, a 
20 
recommendation would be made and Mr Weiss actually 
concedes, he did not see any issues with it because it is a 
normal thing to happen.  Did I say this with a specific 
intention of them engaging Regiments or Trillian as a 
subcontractor?  No.  They of their own, Dr Weiss and Dr 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 79 of 249 
 
Fine.  Dr Fine asserts to their credentials at Transnet, Dr 
Weiss relies on those credentials that they had obtained at 
Transnet to engage with them in Eskom.   
So, Mr Chair, on their own version, on McKinsey’s 
own version, they were the ones that decided who came 
across.  I did not in any way, shape or form influence 
anybody to do anything at any stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were familiar with Regiments 
from your Transnet dates. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were familiar with Dr Eric Wood. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was quite low. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, yes, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were familiar with Mr Salim Essa. 
MR SINGH:   Not as it relates to Regiments, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not? 
MR SINGH:   Not as it relates to any relations that he may 
or may not have had with Regiments. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in what relation were you familiar 
with him? 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
Mr 
Chair, 
as 
I 
testified 
before 
the 
Commission, 
under 
the 
Transnet 
work 
stream 
I 
had 
occasion to meet Mr Essa once or twice but that was 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 80 of 249 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   While you were at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, while I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So do you remember which year 
was that? 
MR SINGH:   I think, Mr Chair, you asked me that question 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Last time. 
MR SINGH:   Also last time and I said to you I would be 
guessing if I knew but I think I gave you a date. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well I cannot remember. 
MR SINGH:   I think if memory serves I think I gave you a 
date of 2012 or 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  So between 2012/2013 or 
thereabouts until you left Transnet you had met him once 
or twice. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Is that in functions or privately or 
at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   No, no, Mr Chair, as I testified before it was 
20 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was the occasion when – was there an 
occasion when he was either your office at Transnet or 
somebody or Mr Gama’s office and …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   No, no, no, Mr …[intervenes] 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 81 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was Mr Gama’s evidence. 
MR SINGH:   That was Mr Gama’s evidence of him meeting 
Mr Essa in my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.  So that was one of the 
two? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, no, no – ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Ja, we will deal with Mr Gama’s evidence 
later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay.  But you say from 
10 
around 2012 or ’13 up to the time you left Transnet you 
had met once or twice? 
MR SINGH:   Once or twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You came to know him as the majority 
shareholder in Trillian when you were at Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   Not – I got to know that through the process 
of the McKinsey process when they became aware of the 
fact that Dr Wood was engaging with Mr Essa and Mr Essa 
was in fact the majority. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He – it has been testified here that he 
was essentially the rainmaker for Trillian.  He would get 
Trillian to be subcontract – to get a contract with an SOE 
or a state entity and he would get them a major contracting 
party for Trillian to be subcontracted to or for Regiments to 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 82 of 249 
 
be subcontracted.  Did you know that? 
MR SINGH:   No, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I go back to your one or two 
occasions with him while you were at Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were those business encounters or was 
it just… 
MR SINGH:   No, as I testified …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And were they planned or were they not 
planned? 
10 
MR SINGH:   I am not too sure, Mr Chair – well, as I said, 
it is very long time ago, so I am struggling to recall but I 
do recall that I did meet him.  But they were business-
related. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
They 
were 
business-related, 
not 
personal. 
MR SINGH:   They were business-related, I think he was 
looking for – to promote his business at the time and I 
think he introduced himself, he introduced his business 
credentials and I testified the last time, I think, he had 
20 
interest in oil and gas or something or other that time and I 
think that was the extent of our engagement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may be wrong but I seem to remember 
that last time when you talked about your encounter with 
him or one of your encounters with him it was outside 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 83 of 249 
 
Transnet, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   It was not at the office, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not at the office, ja.  On both 
occasions, if it is two or not one, or you…? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember. 
MR SINGH:   I certainly do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you know that one of them, if there 
were two encounters, one of them was not in the office.   
MR SINGH:   No, no, Mr Chair, I certainly do not recall. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Having Mr Essa or entertaining Mr Essa at my 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In your office, okay. 
MR SINGH:   For any meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   So if it was one, it was outside, if it was two, 
it was outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Commission …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  And did you say 
those were not planned meetings in the sense that maybe 
you bumped into him or it was some function and he was 
one of the people in the function? 
MR SINGH:   No, no, no. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 84 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or there was an arrangement to meet. 
MR SINGH:   No, it was a setup, it was an arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was an arrangement to meet. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And it would have been the two of 
you only or you cannot remember? 
MR SINGH:   If I recall it was only the two of us.  I did not 
recall …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Singh, his meeting with you as 
10 
the CFO of Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In these meetings? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why meeting you? 
MR SINGH:   I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you not ask him? 
MR SINGH:   Well, these meetings are set up and my office 
sets them up and they are set up then I attended to 
understand what people would like to [indistinct – dropping 
20 
voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Singh, I mean, you were a CFO 
of Transnet, a very big state owned entity, you are not 
going to just go any meeting as if you are not busy. 
MR SINGH:   No, no, I …[intervenes] 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 85 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are only going to go to a meeting if 
when you look at the reason for the meeting you think it is 
important, is it not? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, as I said, this is like stuff that 
you are asking that is eight years ago, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   I said these are meetings that ask that 
happened eight years ago.  I do not even know what the 
document was that he even brought to the meeting.  So it 
will be highly irregular of me to say well, I went to a 
10 
meeting for this specific reason.  If I met him on 15 
occasions I could tell you I met him on 15 occasions 
because there was common theme for us to meet.  But in 
this case it was an arbitrary one or two meetings, for me to 
remember why I met someone eight years ago for a single 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it may well be that if it was a 
single meeting you would remember than if it was many 
meetings but it may be that if it was many meetings but 
only one them ran through the maybe, you know?  But you 
20 
are saying you cannot remember now what the reason was 
but you accept that you must have known then. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What the reason was.  H’m.  Okay, Mr 
Seleka? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 86 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I see the screens are off, I do 
not whether the light broadcast is interrupted or... 
CHAIRPERSON:   The technicians should tell us if there is 
a problem. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Reverend is not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Reverend is not here.  I think 
somebody will tell us just now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should we proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh, prior to your secondment to 
10 
Transnet, Ms Tsholofelo Molefe was there.  She was 
approached or introduced by one of her colleagues Mr 
Colin Matjila to Mr Salim Essa who said there is a company 
Regiments that can help Eskom with cash unlocking 
initiatives in their balance sheet . 
 
Salim Essa and Mr Eric Wood through Regiments, 
they could not get what they wanted at Eskom at the time.  
We know that Ms Molefe says she suspects because of her 
resistance to their proposal it might have been the reason 
why she was suspended and ultimately terminated at 
20 
Eskom or separated from Eskom.  You have conceded that 
you in fact engaged McKinsey and Regiments for your on 
boarding at Eskom even before your official start on the 1 
August 2015, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we conceded that the on boarding 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 87 of 249 
 
was arranged and at the behest of McKinsey and Mr Chair, 
also, when we look at this context of the on boarding 
meetings happening before my appointment at Eskom, Mr 
Chair, we have included in the affidavit that we have 
submitted yesterday, the official announcement of my 
appointment at Eskom and that was done on the 16 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say beginning of July? 
MR SINGH:   16 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 16 July. 
MR SINGH:   July, 2015. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:   And that was announced by the board of 
Eskom on that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, in the context of these on 
boarding sessions, given the fact that the announcement of 
my appointment was made on the 16 July, I do not believe 
that they are actually irregular or there was anything 
untoward as Dr Weiss has testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please speak up a bit? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Oh, sorry.  As Dr Weiss has testified.  It is a 
normal thing that they did with Ms Tsholofelo Molefe as 
well at the time.  They did it to all the CEOs, they did it to 
all the CFOs, they would have done it to other Group 
Executives as well, so …[intervenes] 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 88 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Doing what? 
MR SINGH:   The on boarding, Mr Chair, the on boarding 
activities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us understand what you are 
talking about.  What do you mean when you say on 
boarding?  I mean, if you are going to – if you are being 
seconded to Eskom, your own on boarding or McKinsey’s 
on boarding?  Which one are you talking about? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, Mr Seleka refers to these meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that happened before …[intervenes] 
10 
MR SINGH:   Prior to my …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Assume duties at Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   Assumed role to Eskom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So I am just putting in context that the 
meetings happened in the context of McKinsey’s on 
boarding of myself relating to my role at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well I do not know what you and Mr 
Seleka – how you and Mr Seleka are using the term on 
boarding, if – I would understand if you talk about your 
20 
own on boarding at Eskom but then if you are talking about 
your own on boarding at Eskom, I would expect that to be 
done by Eskom officials on boarding you.  If you talk about 
McKinsey’s on boarding at Eskom, I would expect that to 
be one by Eskom officials.  It may well be that for some 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 89 of 249 
 
reason when it was known that you would be going to 
Eskom you would also be – you could be included but I am 
not sure now when both of you talk about on boarding, 
whose on boarding you are talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I just say something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Chair, I am putting it in Mr Singh’s 
inverted commas.  Insofar as he said it was his own on 
boarding, that is what I am saying to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Oh, he has used the term. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes he has used that term. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But we know that the evidence we 
received from a witness goes wider than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I am only being specific to what he 
said.  I am using his concept and he will explain to the 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe let us start here, Mr Singh.  
Insofar as you may be talking about your own on boarding 
20 
at Eskom, you have heard what my understanding would be 
if you talk about your on boarding.  Is your understanding 
different from mine? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, let us put it this way.  The 
word on boarding, I import from Dr Weiss’ transcript 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 90 of 249 
 
because he deals with what he refers to as these on 
boarding sessions, right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And does he make it – is it clear from 
his evidence who he was saying was being on boarded, 
McKinsey or yourself? 
MR SINGH:   It was – it is a McKinsey term that is used to 
– how can I say... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or are they saying they were on 
boarding you at Eskom. 
MR SINGH:   That is basically – that is basically what it is, 
10 
Mr Chair.  And that was the context of these meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no well I would expect Eskom 
officials to onboard you, you know, not McKinsey. 
MR SINGH:   No, as I explained to you previously 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is his term. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  But as I explained to you, Mr Chair, 
previously, there were also those sessions that happened 
where Eskom individuals on boarded myself while I got – 
ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But basically from my understanding, my 
recollection  of the evidence, really there was nothing 
about on boarding in those discussions as far as I - in 
terms of my own understanding of on boarding, the 
discussions seem largely to have been about this is what 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 91 of 249 
 
we have in mind for Eskom, you are going to be CFO of 
Eskom, what is your take on this and that and that and you 
gave your take. 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I think you have an incorrect 
recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   The on boarding sessions, Mr Chair, were the 
– and maybe we should put this into context, Mr Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   We have an organisation that is in crisis.  We 
alluded to the fact previously that in January of 2015, they 
were really in a deep crisis, they had load shedding, their 
energy availability factors were like at 69%.  Their coal 
prices were escalating at around 18%, when inflation was 
around 4 to 5%.  Their new-build programme was one, 
unfunded and two, being schedule and their budgets were 
uncontrollable.  They were burning diesel at a rate of a 
billion rand a month.  So, Mr Chair, that is the environment 
20 
within which I was finding myself.  So these on boarding 
sessions sought to elevate those issues, say these are the 
issues that you are going to be dealing with, these are the 
issues that we believe caused these things.  So when you 
get there, be in a position to deal with them because these 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 92 of 249 
 
are the root causes of these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  What does remain strange, of 
course, is why that should be done by an outsider and that 
is a point that I may have made last time, you know? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why that should not be done by Eskom 
officials who are already at Eskom for somebody who is at 
Transnet but who will be joining them as their colleague. 
MR SINGH:   But Mr Chair, with respect, Mr Chair, I dealt 
with that matter and Dr Weiss on his own affidavit 
10 
concedes that this is normal practice to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why is it normal for an outsider to – if 
you are – if I have a house, I have a family and somebody 
is going to join us and stay with us, why must somebody 
else not from this family prepare him to say when you stay 
with these people, with the Zondos, this is what you must 
be ready for.  Why must it not be done by me? 
MR SINGH:   Well, sometimes that is why you need family 
counselling, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, it is a strange thing.  But 
20 
anyway, you have said what those sessions were about. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Singh, it is interesting that 
the concept – you do not seem to own that concept.  So 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 93 of 249 
 
what do you call what they were doing with you in these 
sessions?  You say it is McKinsey’s concept.  Well, what do 
you say to this? 
MR SINGH:   No, I said – I did not say it is McKinsey’s 
concept, I said I imported Dr Weiss’ word which was on 
boarding sessions.  I said on boarding sessions are 
normal, I have been – I have had sessions with a number 
of people that brought new concepts that wanted to talk 
about Transnet issues in all of those things.  There was in 
some way or shape on boarding session. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but just lastly, I think your 
explanation of what they were saying to you is exactly what 
the Chairperson – how the Chairperson was explaining.  
They were pinpointing what you say there perceived to be 
challenges at Eskom and we know from Regiments, Ms 
Mothepu, that they were making proposals to you and some 
of the proposal you will not accept and you would do the 
changes and you would then say ja, this is what I want to 
focus on, correct? 
MR SINGH:   But not in July. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not in July? 
MR SINGH:   Not in July. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When? 
MR SINGH:   Whenever it happened, I do not know when it 
happened but it was certainly not implied, there was no 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 94 of 249 
 
negotiations that were happening [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But if you do not know when – if you 
do not know when, how do you deny July? 
MR SINGH:   Because the sessions in July did not have 
initiatives to say let us move this, let us move this, let us 
move this. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, sorry to interrupt.  
Maybe if …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Maybe 
if Mr Seleka knows when this happened he should put it to 
the witness.  If he is interrogating that issue, say to Mr 
Singh on this day and this day according to Ms Mosilo 
Mothepu, this is what happened.  Let him then comment on 
those dates, not speculate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we – no, no, but we do know that 
Ms Mothepu said it was either June or July? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   June, June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think she said June. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Singh would remember, Mr Singh 
said it was not June it was July. 
MR SINGH:   In terms for the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the meetings, ja. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 95 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  And then Mr Seleka put to me that Ms 
Mothepu says that I was negotiating.  So I am asking when 
was I negotiating?  When was I putting these things in or 
taking them out? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, Mr Seleka has not talking 
about negotiating now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did talk about negotiating then but all 
he is saying now, he says Ms Mothepu said in those 
meetings 
the 
McKinsey 
people 
were 
making 
certain 
10 
proposals for you to comment on and she said you were 
indicating 
those 
that 
you 
were 
not 
happy 
with 
and 
indicating what you had no problem with.  That is what Mr 
Seleka says Ms Mothepu said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that that is not true as 
far as you are concerned in terms of the July meetings? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I will repeat once again, as I have 
done before, that Ms Mothepu’s recollection is incorrect 
because if – let us for one minute suggest that Ms Mothepu 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the content of the discussion 
as opposed to the month.  You already said June is wrong. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, let us deal with June, let us 
not deal with any other point. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 96 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Because Mothepu is – if Mothepu’s evidence 
is that I was doing this in June …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, we are done with that, you did 
deny that. 
MR SINGH:   No, no, let us say July, let us deal with 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you said meetings happened in July. 
MR SINGH:   In July.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Let us deal with the content of the July 
meeting.  So am I to understand Ms Mothepu is saying that 
in July McKinsey made proposals, which I then rejected 
and I requested other things to be put in.  Is that what the 
contention is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know whether that is a 
contention. 
MR SINGH:   No, but what …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was putting to you her version. 
MR SINGH:   No, so what is her version? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exactly what you have said. 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  So in that case, Mr Chair, I deny that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is there a time when you say that 
did happen if it did not happen in July or are you saying it 
never happened even after July? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 97 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, post that – I mean, for 
example, I mean I was requested to comment in an 
affidavit – I mean, in a 3.3 notice of 10.6 notice around the 
fact that there was an email that I sent to Mr Wood 
requesting him to look at some Duvha insurance claim, for 
example.  So that was a request that I made to them.  So I 
made the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the difference therefore between 
your version and Ms Mothepu’s version in this regard apart 
from whether it was in June, whether the meetings were in 
10 
June or July, is the difference that you accept that at some 
stage in your interactions with McKinsey there was a time 
where they would make proposals and you would examine 
them, their merits and demerits, accept some of their 
proposals, reject some but you say that happened after you 
had assumed duty at Eskom and not before and to the 
extent that she says that happened before you assumed 
duty you would deny that part. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Well, I will not go to Dr Weiss 
about negotiations because you know he puts it in May, 
June, 
that 
they 
started 
around 
there 
and 
that 
was 
specifically about the negotiations.   
Mr Singh, zooming back on Mr Salim Essa, you 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 98 of 249 
 
would have seen the travel agents’ affidavits in which they 
say you were introduced to them by Mr Salim Essa in 2014.  
What is your comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   I have no recollection of that, Mr Chair, I do 
not recall Mr Essa ever introducing me to a travel agent.  I 
used a number of travel agents to travel, Travel Excellence 
was one of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Travel Excellence is one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says Travel Excellence was not one 
of them, is that right? 
10 
MR SINGH:   No, I am saying …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are saying is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say was one of them? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall how you came to do 
business with them or can you not recall how that came 
about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Mr Chair, I cannot, my PA normally 
20 
did lots of stuff for me in my personal capacity, so it may 
have been here that recommended them, I am not... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Do you have a recollection of 
when you may have started using them? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 99 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Even in terms of year you cannot 
remember?  Okay, alright.  But it would not have been 
before 2010 for example? 
MR SINGH:   Not from – no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would have been after. 
MR SINGH:   Certainly, definitely, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you have seen that they say they 
did your flight bookings from 2014, there is three flight 
bookings in 2014, three flight bookings in 20 …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to refer us to where that is? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, I can certainly do that.  
This is Eskom bundle 18(B) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, let us take seven minutes 
break, just a short adjournment.  Let us adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  The affidavit is 
found on – Eskom bundle 18[b] page 1565 point one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, there’s the affidavit of Samira 
Suleiman?    
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Samira Suleiman, an adult female 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 100 of 249 
 
employed as a travel agent working at Double Excellence 
t/a Travel Excellence, and the relevant passages in 
relation to Mr Singh are from page 1565 point 4.  Are you 
there Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I – this is - my summary was based 
on this.  Mr Essa introduced Mr Anoj Singh, paragraph 20: 
“Introduced Mr Singh to me during 2014.  I had 
never met Mr Singh before then.  From there 
onwards we had received requests from either Mr 
10 
Essa, also Mr Singh directly to book flights from 
them.  The charges were always allocated to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Seleka I think you should 
start with what she says her relationship was with Mr Salim 
Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go to where he says, she 
says Mr Essa introduced Mr Anoj Singh to her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Certainly Chair that is on page 1565 
20 
point 3, under the heading relationship with Salim Essa, 
and it starts at paragraph 15, she writes: 
“Whilst I was employed at Harvey World I was 
introduced to Mr Salim Essa, whom I then serviced 
as a client.  After a while many of the employees, 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 101 of 249 
 
including myself, were let to go from Harvey World 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think she explains earlier that 
Harvey World was also a travel agency or not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Earlier in the affidavit Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Earlier in the affidavit does she not 
explain that Harvey World was also a travel agency? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes, that is on page – the page 
before, the preceding page, 1565 point 2, at the top of the 
page,  
10 
“background to my relationship with Ms Halima 
Alana, both I and Ms Halima Alana had been 
working in the travel industry for the last 30 years.   
At a point in time both I and Ms Alana worked 
together at a travel agency called Sure Three Way 
Travel.  I later went on to join a travel agency 
named Harvey World Travel and Ms Alana left to 
start up her own travel agency.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that sufficient? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is sufficient. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then going back to page 1565 
point 3, paragraph 16 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh then just to connect everything 
properly then she says in 15: 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 102 of 249 
 
“Whilst 
I 
was 
employed 
as 
Harvey 
World ...” 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    
“...I was introduced to Mr Salim Essa, Mr Essa, 
whom I then serviced as a client.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can then take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“After a while many of the employees, including 
10 
myself were let go from Harvey World.  I then 
contacted Ms Alana and joined her at Travel 
Excellence around June 2013.  Mr Essa, being my 
client, followed me to Travel Excellence.  At Travel 
Excellence I usually dealt with Mr Essa directly.  I 
do not believe Ms Alana ever dealt with him directly, 
although both Ms Alana and I have access to each 
other ’s mailboxes to ensure that we are able to 
speedily respond to the requests from clients.  Mr 
Essa had a standing account with us, account 
20 
number 300365 ...” ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, you’ve got less zero’s than – it 
is 3000365. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
“Mr Essa would usually either send me an email or 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 103 of 249 
 
he would phone me with a request for bookings.  
Although Mr Essa frequently requested us to book 
tickets for other people we always allocated the 
transactions to his account as we considered him 
the guarantor for all such travel bookings.  Mr Essa 
usually corresponded with us being either his 
salimessa@gmail.com or salim@global.co.za email 
address.   Mr Essa’s secretary also frequently 
corresponded with us using the Salim@global.co.za 
email address.  I unfortunately cannot remember 
10 
her name.”  
And then the next heading is Travel Arrangements for Mr 
Anoj Singh, I suppose Mr Anoj Singh  will have on 
knowledge of that information I read. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, how the two of them met and what 
arrangements they had, you wouldn’t know anything about 
that, or would you? 
MR SINGH:   No sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But do you know Ms Samila Suleiman? 
MR SINGH:   I do Mr Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then travel arrangements for Mr Anoj 
Singh, paragraph 20: 
“Mr Essa introduced Mr Anoj Singh to me during 
2014.  I had never met Mr Singh before then.  From 
there onwards we had received requests from either 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 104 of 249 
 
Mr Essa or from Mr Singh directly to book flights for 
them.   The charges were always allocated to Mr 
Essa’s account number, C000365.   I set out below 
as per my records and recollection the bookings 
made for Mr Singh since 2014. 
22.1 
A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly 
from Dubai to Johannesburg on 8 June 2014.  I 
cannot recall who made the request.  Mr Singh was 
issued with ticket number 4875955176.  I do not 
know how Mr Singh flew to Dubai.  The total cost 
10 
charged was R9 100.  The invoice was addressed to 
Mr Singh although it was charged to Mr Essa’s 
account.  I cannot recall whether I spoke to Mr Essa 
or Mr Singh but one of the two gentlemen phoned 
me to tell me a driver would be dropping off money 
in cash to settle the invoice, which indeed took 
place.  I attach hereto the cash receipt dated 16 
July 2014.  I subsequently deposited the money into 
our bank account on the same day.” 
Mr Singh are you able to confirm this ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson before ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...or comment on it? 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   ...before we continue with this there 
is an issue that I would like to raise vis-a-vis the aspect of 
the – and I know you are entitled to listen to hearsay 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 105 of 249 
 
evidence, but it relates directly to the issue of what he 
says about Mr Essa, and maybe it would be appropriate to 
first deal with my learned friend from that issue before I 
place it on record, because most probably taking into 
account the way that the Commission investigators should 
operate I would assume they have done it, so if – and I 
hate to ask for two or three minutes, but let me first deal 
with Mr Seleka to try and see if it is done, and then I will 
take an instruction as to how to deal with that particular 
issue, because I think you can understand it impacts 
10 
certain issues directly relating to my client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair I think the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you are saying you would deal 
with that later, is that right? 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   No Chairperson I think – I want to 
ask my learned friend about it now, because I need to 
understand if something has been done. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would like an adjournment? 
ADV 
VAN 
HEERDEN: 
 
 
I 
would 
like 
a 
very 
brief 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, no that is fine.   Let’s take a – 
well it might affect, because I think you are saying it might 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 106 of 249 
 
affect a lot of things, okay let us take that short 
adjournment, we are at nearly quarter to one, okay let us 
take the short adjournment, give minutes. 
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we are at five to one, but maybe 
let’s do about ten minutes or so or fifteen minutes and then 
we take the lunch break. 
ADV SELEKA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA:   Ja, I accept that, we have addressed the – 
or to move forwards, if not addressed but we have agreed 
to move forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ja, I think counsel for Mr Singh 
nods.  Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Where’s my file?   Mr Singh 
I was reading from that file 18, Eskom Bundle 18[b] page 
1556 point 4, I have read paragraph 22, we have 22.1, 
which reads: 
20 
“A booking request made for Mr Singh to fly from 
Dubai to Johannesburg on 8 June 2014.  I cannot 
recall who made the request.  Mr Singh was issued 
with ticket number ...” 
And I have read that. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 107 of 249 
 
“...I do not know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you had read to 22.1 and Mr 
Singh was about to respond to it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to respond or comment Mr 
Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Singh, I think, no I am Mr Singh, but I am 
doing the same thing that I did yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, I do not know whether you are 
referring to Mr Seleka or to me. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Or myself sorry Mr Chair, I would think that in 
order for us to deal with this, Mr Chair, I would like to first 
deal 
with 
it 
holistically 
rather 
than 
deal 
with 
each 
individual item. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, you want to give a broad 
answer 
and 
then 
we 
can 
see 
whether 
we 
go 
to, 
ja…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   Yes, and then we can see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, I think that is fine. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think the first point that we need 
20 
to make is that the nexus of this affidavit of Ms Suleiman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you say the essence. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair the origins of Ms Suleiman’s 
affidavit…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 108 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   Arises from a concern that Mr Koko raised to 
the Commission via a vis the affidavit of Ms Galiema and I 
think you then directed the Commission to do further 
investigations, if I am not mistaken, which then gave rise 
to this affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that there was the discussion of 
travel agents evidence during Mr Koko’s evidence, but I 
cannot remember whether I directly said anything, ja. 
MR SINGH:   Well, anyway this basically comes about.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
10 
MR SINGH:   And one of the issues Mr Chair, that we can 
clearly see in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit is that she does 
concede that the issue of Mr Koko was in fact an error.  
There was an error. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   There was a clear error in terms of one of the 
aspects of Mr Koko’s travel documents relating to Ms 
Galiema’s affidavit.  So that is the first let us say issue 
that we have or I have with Ms Suleiman’s affidavit is that 
you will find that it is riddled with inconsistency and I 
20 
would say, errors, which I will take you through.  
And the first one I would like to point out is 
obviously Mr Koko’s admission by Ms Suleiman that the 
document 
was 
incorrect. 
 
Mr 
Chair, 
if 
we 
then 
go 
to…[intervene] 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 109 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, sorry Mr…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I would like Mr Seleka to remain in 
the driver's status as far as this but at some point you 
would be allowed to make all the points that you want to 
make.  But I think for now, insofar as there are errors in Ms 
Suleiman’s affidavit I think it may be enough for you to 
simply say, there are a number of errors that you have 
identified, or inconsistencies or contradictions or whatever 
it is in her affidavit.  And later on, you will identify them 
and say what do you make of them. 
10 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, again sorry.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   I think the reason why my client 
wishes to start there is basically - and I do not want to give 
evidence on his behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN HEERDEN:   What he is trying to say is, insofar 
as you going to rely on this affidavit and the annexures I 
have an issue with it, because there is problems with it.  
 
There is problems with the annexures, there is 
20 
problems and you cannot now ask me now to comment on 
something where there is clear problems with it or clear 
issues with it.  I want to explain to you why I say you as 
the Evidence Leader and your investigators cannot rely on 
these documents. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 110 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine, I think let us go point by 
point but if at the end, you say, having gone point by point, 
I would like to say the following broadly, that is fine.  But 
also, as we go point by point, you will feel free to make 
whatever points or if you say, well, I am listening to this, I 
am not admitting it. 
But in terms of the broad response I will be saying 
that this evidence in this affidavit should not be relied upon 
because it's got too many errors or the annexures are 
riddled with contradictions or errors.   
10 
That is fine, but I think let us go pint by point, as 
long as in the end, you will be able to make all the points 
you wish to there, okay.  Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Singh there in 
paragraph 22.1 we have asked you to comment on. 
MR SINGH:   Thank you, Mr Chair 22.1 this refers 
to…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is page 1565.4. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
That 
relates 
to 
a 
booking 
that…[intervene] 
20 
MR SINGH:   8 t h of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …she says, was for you to fly from 
Dubai to Johannesburg on 8 June 2014.  
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And she annexures annexure SS1, 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 111 of 249 
 
annexure SS2, annexure SS3 and annexure SS4.  So you 
want Mr Seleka that we go to those before he responds to 
those annexures? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I would like him to comment first 
on the content of that paragraph that there was a booking 
for you from Dubai to Johannesburg…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe then you must not ask him 
to comment on the paragraph in general you must just put 
specific questions, such as was there a booking that was 
made for you to fly from - that was made by Travel 
10 
Excellence for you to fly from Dubai to Johannesburg on 8 
June 2014?  
He might say yes there was or he says I do not 
know what they are talking about.  So if you want him to 
then maybe you just ask him specific questions based on a 
particular paragraph. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Singh that 
is the question then in regard to the factual allegation 
made, can you confirm or not that there was a booking 
made for you by Travel Excellence, to travel from Dubai to 
20 
Johannesburg on 8 June 2014? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I deny that this booking was made 
on my instruction or on my behalf. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you - from what you are saying 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 112 of 249 
 
I think you are saying they may have made a booking but 
you did not ask them to do it. 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall you travelling from Dubai 
to Johannesburg on the 8 t h of June, well…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did you fly from Johannesburg, from 
Dubai to Johannesburg on that date, irrespective of who 
had made the booking? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair, I do not recall, but I know that 
from the Transnet work stream, it would appear that I was 
on an official trip during this period of time, and I had to be 
and I was - I think the return leg was via Dubai.  So I 
would have travelled via Dubai on an official trip back to 
South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay and you say you think it would 
have been on Transnet business? 
MR SINGH:   And Mr Chair, based on the information that 
has been given to us by the Transnet stream it would 
20 
appear that it would have been official business at the 
time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   Then there would have been no need for this 
ticket. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 113 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and the bookings insofar as there 
was such a – there may have been a trip, the booking 
would have been made by - would it have been made by 
Travel Excellence? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, sir if? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the booking insofar as you may 
have travelled to Dubai on Transnet business on that day, 
as you may have travelled from Dubai to Johannesburg, 
would Travel Excellence have been involved in making your 
booking?  
10 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not have and insofar as you 
may have been travelling for Transnet business, would 
there have been a standard travel agents that Transnet 
would use? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the name of that one?  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I am not…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember. 
MR SINGH:   I cannot remember. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there would have been a standard 
travel agency. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, there would have been, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore, to the extent that if 
indeed you did travel on Transnet business, that travel 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 114 of 249 
 
agency may well have records. 
MR SINGH:   May well have records, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
MR SINGH:   And hence I am saying I do not recall making 
this request. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I think Ms Suleiman herself says 
she cannot recall who made the request but the booking 
was for you and I think that is what we seeking to confirm 
with you that the booking for a flight from Dubai to 
10 
Johannesburg was for you, on the 4 t h of June 2014. 
MR SINGH:   The 8 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On June 2014. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he has said, as far as his 
concerned, he never asked Travel Excellence, to make any 
booking for him to travel from Dubai to Johannesburg on 
that date, and I understood you to say and you must tell 
me if I am wrong Mr Singh. 
I understood you to imply that you never authorised 
20 
anybody to ask Travel Excellence to make a booking for 
your travelling on that occasion. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then they refer to the cost of that 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 115 of 249 
 
which the invoice was addressed to you although it was 
charged to Mr Essa’s account, but let us deal with the 
allegation that the invoice was addressed to you.  
Which is SS2 on page 1565.13, the air ticket is also 
on the page just before that.  So that invoice, what do you 
say about it Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I have never received this invoice 
and as you will see, Mr Chair it actually says ticket void. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where is that? 
MR SINGH:   SS2.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yeah.  
MR SINGH:   In the route, in the column saying route the 
third line, it says ticket void. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it the invoice or the ticket? 
MR SINGH:   SS2 annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the document that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   At 1565.13. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes I see where it says ticket void.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the column - you see the void there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have just seen that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So what do you say about that? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 116 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he was saying that he, as I 
understood he never asked Travel Excellence to make this 
booking and he did not ask anybody or authorise anybody 
to ask Travel Excellence to do that.  Is that right, Mr 
Singh? 
MR SINGH:   That correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you were referring to the fact 
that it says ticket void as to suggest that…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   There was never a travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was never - it was not used.  
10 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it were to be found that you did 
actually travel on the 8 t h of June 2014, from Dubai to 
Johannesburg.  Of course, the question that would arise is 
how Travel Excellence would have known about your 
travelling from Dubai to Johannesburg. 
MR SINGH:   But Mr Chair, hence, I wanted to paint the 
picture for you upfront.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But it is fine we will deal with it.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will do it, Ja but bear in mind that 
question. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, but these are in fact the inconsistencies 
that you will find, in every one of these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 117 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   I mean, for example, they allocate this thing 
to Mr Essa’s account, I did not instruct any of this to 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
MR SINGH:   I said they allocate it to Mr Essa’s account of 
C000365. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   I never issued an instruction to please charge 
my stuff to Mr Essa’s account. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but remember that on their version, 
on her version, she says Mr Salim Essa introduced you to 
Ms Suleiman, Mr Salim Essa on her version was keeping 
an account with them, was there client and whenever they 
made bookings that related to you and other people, I think 
she says, they always connected those bookings with Mr 
Salim Essa’s account because he was seen by them as the 
guarantor – she put that in quotes “guarantor”, in regard to 
those bookings.  
By which I mean, they must have been thinking 
20 
well, in case this person does not pay we will talk to Mr 
Salim Essa to say well this is somebody that you 
introduced to us so now they are not paying, so you must 
pay, that is my understanding. 
MR SINGH:   No, I agree with you Mr Chair, but let us deal 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 118 of 249 
 
with that mater, that aspect.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   That you bring up, if Ms Osmond’s version 
relating to the guarantor issue is to be correct.   Mr Essa – 
okay during this period of time, he was in the country and 
he had an account, post him leaving the country I do not 
think he still has an account with Travel Excellence and 
neither I would think that Travel Excellence continues to 
extend his guarantee status if it ever existed.  Yet, if I had 
- I booked tickets with them post this period of time and 
10 
they still allowed me to have - let us call it a deferred 
payment type of arrangement.  So who was guaranteeing 
my payments at that time, when he was not there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are saying that after Mr Salim 
Essa had left the country, you have continued to have 
dealings with them and ask them to make bookings for you.  
Is that right?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you make those bookings they 
invoice you, I assume, and you pay?  
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so you are - but your question is, 
how would Mr Salim Essa be a guarantor after? 
MR SINGH:   After. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, of course, she is dealing here with a 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 119 of 249 
 
specific time as I understand it, a specific time and I do 
not know whether once he had left, they would still say 
guarantor you know, and I do not even know whether they 
sense of guarantor is what I am thinking.  
But she says in her own affidavit, that there are 
occasions when you called to make arrangements for 
payment.  She says so in her affidavit, even during those 
times and then I think there are occasions when she says, 
Mr Salim Essa made payment in regard to your travelling, 
ja.  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me ask this question Chair and 
then maybe we can take a lunch adjournment.  Mr Singh, 
when did Mr Essa leave the country? 
MR SINGH:   I have no idea. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have no idea. 
MR SINGH:   Well it was reported in the media so that is 
when I guess we know about it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no, Mr Singh you were telling the 
Chairperson what from a factual point of view, is what you 
want to convey to him.  That after Mr Essa left the country 
20 
who would have served as the guarantor for the cost 
occasion by your flight bookings.  
Now the question is pertinent to that, when do you 
say then to the Chairperson did Mr Essa leave the country? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I was making general statement. I 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 120 of 249 
 
said I was making a general statement, Mr Chair, I do not 
know the exact date when Mr Essa left the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you would not say you made 
bookings after him, Mr Salim Essa had left.  You requested 
Travel Excellence to make bookings for you, after Mr Salim 
Essa had left, unless there was a point that you regarded 
as the point when he left.  So I think Mr Seleka is asking 
what is that point. 
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair as I said, I was making the 
comment generally, I really do not know the date on which 
10 
he left or purported to leave.  But I know that I have made 
travel bookings - I do not know how many but I have made 
table bookings with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you made travel - did you make 
travel bookings with Travel Excellence last year? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, I think maybe one, I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe one? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And 2019, do you recall did you make 
any, did you request them to make any?  
20 
MR SINGH:   Maybe, one as well, one or two maybe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe one as well, but are you saying 
that you do not have a time that you take as the time when 
Mr Salim Essa left? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 121 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because that seems on the face of 
this - of it to undermine the point you were making. 
MR SINGH:   But Mr Chair, as you were - let us say, 
moving back in terms of your timeline, in terms of saying, 
did you book one last year or did you book one the year 
before. 
I think that is the general point that I was trying to 
make, is that even as early as or as late as last year, if I 
had booked with them and if he is not here, then who was 
guarantee.  So that is the point that I was trying to make. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you regard last year as a time 
when he had left the country? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair based on media, it is common 
cause that his left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but your understanding is that he 
left roundabout when?  
MR SINGH:   Chair, I would not speculate.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say, definite last year – by last 
year he had left.  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   By beginning of last year, maybe? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would be speculating but I know, 
Mr Chair, my point that I am trying to make is, if it is that 
these guarantee facilities were what were available, I am 
saying I did not enjoy those facilities through Mr Essa. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 122 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Chair, just before we adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we will adjourn, Mr Singh, you 
then cannot - and I think you have to accept that you 
cannot use the general statement as a point of criticism in 
relation to this affidavit. 
MR SINGH:   No but if you - that is why I said - that is why 
I requested for the Chair, to allow me the indulgence of 
dealing with it holistically.  So all of these things will be 
10 
put into context, as we are going to deal with these issues 
individually and you are going to get to a point where you 
are going to ask me this question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, but you are not addressing what I 
am saying to you, you cannot use your general statement, 
which you said it is as a point of criticism in relation to this 
affidavit.  Do you accept that?  
MR SINGH:   I accept that Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair we can take a lunch 
adjournment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the lunch adjournment 
it is twenty past one, we will resume at twenty past two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 123 of 249 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson I 
was conveying to Mr Singh and my learned friend that I have 
endeavoured to obtain Mr Singh’s affidavit to the Transnet 
work stream specifically on his travels between Joburg and 
Dubai.  I have arranged that the Chairperson’s bundle on the 
same be delivered in due course I would do the comparison 
between the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What the agent is saying what Mr Singh 
10 
has responded to the Eskom work stream.  The Transnet 
work stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that last point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In due course when we have the – when 
the Chairperson’s file is here I have for Mr Singh we will 
then do the comparative specifically in the – in regard to the 
dates of travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is there an affidavit by Mr Singh 
detailing his official flights while he was at Transnet? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Those could be – and that affidavit is 
20 
submitted to the commission under the Transnet work 
stream.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just for the sake of clarity Mr Singh 
with regard to paragraph 22.1 can we – can we take it that 
you are saying you did travel from Dubai to Johannesburg on 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 124 of 249 
 
that date or around that date?  What you are denying is that 
you had asked Travel Excellence to make that booking or 
that you had asked anybody to ask Travel Excellence to 
make that booking, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So that 8 June 2014 Mr 
Singh.  Then the other aspect of the paragraph which is the 
last that is in relation to the payment.  Ms Suleiman says: 
“I cannot recall whether I spoke to Mr Essa 
10 
or Mr Singh but one of the two gentlemen 
phoned me to tell me a driver would be 
dropping off money in cash to settle the 
invoice which indeed took place.  I attach 
hereto the cash receipt dated 16 July 2014 
and that is attached as SS3 subsequently 
deposited the money into our bank account 
on the same date.” 
 
So let us go to SS3 on page 1565.14 and what we 
see there is a document she calls it a cash receipt dated 16 
20 
July 2014 your name appears there Mr Anoj Singh and the 
amount is written out in words nine thousand one hundred 
rand, invoice number, the number is given 85A587236 and 
the amount in numerics R9100.00 cash paid to Samira. 
 
Your comment on the allegations in this regard Mr 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 125 of 249 
 
Singh? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I have not – I have no recollection of 
this invoice.  I deny that this invoice was made out to me.  
There will be no reason for me to pay for this invoice.  And 
Mr Chair if you look at the – the – sorry not the invoice the 
receipt.  Mr Chair even if you look at these receipts and they 
pervasive throughout they relatively rudimentary receipts.  I 
could have got a receipt book and written this invoice myself 
I mean receipt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just repeat the point you make about 
10 
the receipts ja I think your – try and speak up a bit.   
MR SINGH:  I said Mr Chair I denied that this receipt was 
made our in my name.  I did not receive this receipt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  It does not bear any signature of mine or the 
purported driver or anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  From who this cash was purportedly received 
from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Secondly Mr Chair if I denied the fact that I 
request this booking to be made in the first place.  There is 
no reason for this receipt to be made out in my name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I – I understand that.  As I 
understand her evidence in her affidavit she does say that 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 126 of 249 
 
there were times when you would arrange with her that you 
would send a driver to give her cash to settle some of the 
invoices.  Now you have said that you know her.  You have 
said that you know Travel Excellence.  You have said that 
you did make bookings – you did ask them to make bookings 
for you at times because it may be that you also asked other 
agents at other times.  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now in regard to those occasions 
when you had requested her to make bookings for you would 
10 
you receive invoices from her?  Would she send you invoices 
and would you receive them? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think occasionally I would receive 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Via Whatsapp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  If I recall correctly but I do not recall 
(inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay but at some stage or another 
20 
you would know what you – what you owed them? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And how did you pay them?  Did your 
method of paying them ever include sending a driver to pay 
them in cash? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 127 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I certainly paid through voyager miles 
sometimes there were credit card payments that I had made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  There was cash payments that I made but I do 
not recall my driver going to settle any of these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your recollection that all payments you 
made that include – included cash payments even if there 
were – or let me ask were there some payments you made in 
cash? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I think I recall some of them but I do 
10 
not recall which ones exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Oh 
okay 
and 
would 
you 
have 
any 
recollection as to whether it was something quite usual for 
you to do namely to pay in cash even though sometimes you 
paid by other means? 
MR SINGH:  I would – I would think Mr Chair it was not 
unusual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not unusual.  Okay.  Okay alright so 
she – she says here a driver was – you know was sent to 
drop the cash.  So you are saying although you accept that 
20 
sometimes you did pay in cash but you say – you say you 
never sent a driver or are you saying you are not sure 
whether you might at some stage or another sent a driver 
with cash? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair on this particular invoice I am saying 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 128 of 249 
 
there was no need for me to pay this because I did not 
request it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I accept – I accept that that is what 
you say in regard to this invoice. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
am 
talking 
about 
those 
that 
you 
acknowledge would have been your invoices because you 
would have requested her to make the payment – to make 
the bookings for you? 
MR SINGH:  Okay Sir so the question is… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to those bookings which you had 
requested her to make for you. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you had to pay are you saying that 
there was never an occasion when you would have sent your 
driver to pay her in cash or are you saying you are not sure 
whether at some or other stage you may have sent a driver 
to pay her in cash or you say whenever I paid – you paid you 
paid her yourself even if it was in cash? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I – look – from a driver perspective I 
20 
am probably referring to our previous conversation in terms 
of the Transnet driver.  But I think in this case Mr Chair I 
think you asking the question did a third party sometimes 
pay whether it be a driver or relatives or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At your instance. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 129 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  At my instance yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Is the answer yes? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but whether it was a driver or not… 
MR SINGH:  I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure. 
MR SINGH:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall whom – who else you might 
have asked to go and pay for you in cash if it was not your 
driver? 
10 
MR SINGH:  As I said Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is it something you cannot remember? 
MR SINGH:  It might have been – it might have been a family 
relative or it may have been acquaintances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it would not be somebody from work? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Singh when you refer to 
your driver is this a personal driver? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr – Sorry Sir. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When you refer to your driver are you 
referring to your personal driver? 
MR SINGH:  No I was clarifying the Chairperson’s question 
so that the response that I gave to the Chairperson in terms 
of saying no it was not my driver. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 130 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  I was referring to the allocated driver from 
Transnet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh it an allocated driver from Transnet.  
Chairperson I believe the file is here and I think I should 
complete every section also by reference to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is Transnet’s Bundle 5(b).  We have 
a copy for Mr Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson is there copies for us 
too because we did not know that this is going to be dealt 
with today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is there a copy for Mr Singh’s 
counsel? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes there is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page  
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess you will need to have both files? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To compare. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay what page in the bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 426.  426 is a page in the 10.6 
Directive – 426 – 426.  I think it has that flag – the orange 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 131 of 249 
 
flag.  So it is (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just repeat Mr Seleka whose affidavit 
are we looking at now at the Transnet Bundle 5 at page 426? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Chairperson we are going to look at 
two documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The one is the 10.6 – Regulation 10.6 
directive issued to Mr Singh requesting him to provide 
information to the commission on certain aspects.  The page 
reference I have now given is the page in that 10.6 directive 
10 
as page 426. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will then also refer to the affidavit of 
Mr Singh responding to their request in terms of the 
directive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the first – the page I have referred to 
is 426 paragraph 113 he has been asked to provide 
information relating to local and international trips that 
appear to have coincided with trips by members of the Gupta 
20 
family and their associates inter alia for present purposes 
Chairperson 1.13.3. 
 
A return  trip to Dubai between 3 June 2014 and 8 
June 2014 that is the reason why… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry.  I thought you said 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 132 of 249 
 
1.13.3? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No 1.13.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  A return trip to Dubai between 3 
June 2014 and 8 June 2014 yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That we – we referring to 8 June 
2014 because of – it coincides with the date in the Ms 
Suleiman’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The first trip of 4 June 2014.  You 
shared a return flight with Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta on Flight 
EK763.  The following individuals were in Dubai during the 
10 
same period.  Mr Sanjay Grover, Mr Paul 00:15:24, Mr Iqbal 
Shama, Mr Selwyn Christin, Mr Zuwitley, Mr Vikas Sagar, Mr 
Rajesh Kumar Gupta, Mr [?] Edwin Sodi and Mr Kamal 
Vasram.  Now the response… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the allegation he was asked to deal 
with then allegation that he had a trip – he was not – he had 
a return trip to Dubai and back between 3 June 2014 and 9 
June 2014 and that he shared that flight with Mr Rajesh 
Kumar Gupta and the flight number is given. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that during that same period when he 
was in Dubai a number of people mentioned there were also 
in Dubai that is what the allegation says? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 133 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh’s response to that on page 480 
- 480.   
MR SINGH:  480. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  480 that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the same bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In the same bundle that is Mr Singh’s 
affidavit of the 2n d of February 2021.  480 the same bundle. 
MR SINGH:  I do not have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody must just assist Mr Singh to find 
the page.  It is your affidavit where it says At paragraph 
10 
1.18.2 at the top. 
MR SINGH:  I have until 476. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you do not have all the pages? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think Mr Singh’s file has been 
regularised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you found the right page Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So the – Mr Singh then responds 
20 
paragraph – at paragraph 1.13.2 return trip to Dubai and he 
gives the date in brackets 47 says: 
“I deny I travelled on a return trip to Dubai as 
alleged in this paragraph.” 
And then 48 he says: 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 134 of 249 
 
“Regarding the aforesaid date I wish to state 
that” 
48.1 
“I left South Africa on 3 June 2014 I only 
entered Dubai on 6 June 2014, I exited Dubai 
on 8 June 2014.” 
And then he says further: 
“Between 4 June 2014 and the 6 June 2014 I 
travelled between Frankfort and Heathrow 
airports.” 
10 
But relevant for present purposes Chair is 48.3 which is I 
existed Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  Yes 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On 8 June 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think for the sake of completeness 
Mr Singh can we take it that when you exited Dubai on 8 
June 2014 you returned to Johannesburg? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So then Mr Singh it is either a 
20 
coincidence or divination on the part of the travel agent that 
they arrange your trip from Dubai to Johannesburg on the 
same date 8 June 2014? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir I got the first part I did not hear your 
second part. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 135 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat your – what you are putting to 
him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So I am saying and you will 
comment it is either a coincidence or divination on their part 
that 
they 
arranged 
your 
return 
trip 
from 
Dubai 
to 
Johannesburg on the same date 8 June 2014.  Your 
comment? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry it is the meaning of your word in your 
second… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh divination. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh.  Ja my learned friend (inaudible – 
laughing).  Maybe she can explain what divination means. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No explain yourself Mr – do not shift the 
responsibility. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Divination that means Mr Singh they 
would have known by some supernatural powers that you 
were travelling and travelling from Dubai not from Cape Town 
to Johannesburg on this very date of 8 June 2014. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair I think for the purposes of this 
20 
discussion what is important is also paragraph 48.4 of the 
said affidavit on page 480 is that between and 4 and 8 I 
travelled between Frankfort and Heathrow.  49 says: 
“To the best of my recollection the aforesaid 
travel relates to business travels.” 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 136 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat that last sentence. 
MR SINGH:  Okay so 48.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR SINGH:  Basically says that I was travelling in June 
between the dates of 4 and 6 between Frankfort and 
Heathrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So 49 basically then says 
“To the best of my recollection the aforesaid 
travel related to business travel.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So as I originally said Mr Chair the issue is that 
I was actually travelling on business there was no need for 
me to have this.  I was not requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but Mr Seleka’s point is this.  If you 
did not ask Travel Excellence – if you did not tell them you 
were going to be travelling from Dubai to Johannesburg on 
the 8th of June 2014 and if you never asked anybody to tell 
them or to make a booking for you to travel from Dubai to 
Johannesburg on the 8 th of June 2014 how would they have 
20 
known your – how would they have known that you were 
going to be travelling from Dubai to Johannesburg on that 
date?  How would – how could they get it so right? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair I am not too sure maybe it is a 
coincidence 
for 
the 
word 
that 
you 
used 
00:24:24:07.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 137 of 249 
 
Because you – Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you think they have supernatural 
powers to know this? 
MR SINGH:  Maybe – as you will see throughout the affidavit 
Mr Chair some supernatural powers was at play.  But on her 
own version Mr Chair at her affidavit on – she actually says: 
“I cannot recall who made the request.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  This is Ms Suleiman who is saying it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja but she is saying between you and 
10 
Mr Essa she is not sure who made the request but it is one 
of you. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand what she is saying. 
MR SINGH:  Then she must state that 00:24:46 because that 
is not the way I interpret it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SINGH:  This is not the way I interpret it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let – let us see it – is that at 221 ha? 
“I cannot recall whether I spoke to Mr Essa 
20 
or Mr Singh.” 
Is that where –  
MR SINGH:  22.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I cannot recall who made the request.  
Oh okay no I was – I had in mind the latter part of the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 138 of 249 
 
affidavit. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but my understanding based on her 
affidavit is that when she says she cannot recall even when 
– where she does not mention whether it was you or Mr Essa 
my understanding is that she is talking about you and Mr 
Essa because throughout her affidavit the only person – the 
only persons who used to make requests for your travels 
were either you or Mr Essa. So in that context I understand 
her to be – when she says I cannot recall I am – I 
10 
understand her to be saying that but it may be that you are 
right we should not be thinking about those – any of those 
two maybe somebody else but she  as far as I recall she 
never anywhere else never says in her affidavit somebody 
else other than either yourself or Mr Essa would request 
that. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair it goes back to Ms Suleiman’s 
recollection of the events that took place six years ago or 
seven years ago.  Because if you then take paragraph 22.2 
and I know I am jumping ahead. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Advocate Seleka but apologies for that.  If you 
look there she says a booking was requested by Mr Singh’s 
partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 139 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  Ms 00:26:39. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so sometimes it would be somebody 
else. 
MR SINGH:  But the point is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  That request was never made by (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, no, no that is… 
MR SINGH:  And that comes back to the point of the 
recollection of events. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:  By Ms Suleiman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but let us find – let us complete our 
understanding about what your response is in regard to you.  
I think relating to the 8 th of June 2014.  Am I right to say in 
the end you saying well it must be – it must have – it must 
be a coincidence that she got that right or as you say maybe 
she had some supernatural powers because indeed you were 
– you did travel from Dubai to Johannesburg on the date that 
you did. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair based on the information that I 
20 
had it would seem like it is a coincidence because I am not 
able to say whether it is – well I do not think I can 
categorically state that Mr Essa did not request that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that sentence. 
MR SINGH:  I said I can categorically state that Mr Essa 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 140 of 249 
 
would have not requested travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your behalf? 
MR SINGH:  Not on my behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Mr… 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson sorry maybe it is 
important Mr Singh eluded to it earlier that ticket was voided 
it seems not to have been used.  And I think it is an 
important factor to take into account too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no, no, no that might be so.  At this 
stage he was dealing with my question as well as Mr 
10 
Seleka’s question of how come they – this travel agent had 
this information correct if Mr Singh was not the one who told 
them about his travelling or somebody that Mr Singh had 
asked to tell them.  That – that was what we are dealing 
with.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  And to that point 
raised we should equally look at the – the receipts of the 
R9100.00 cash payment together with that ticket.  But Chair 
part of 21 of Ms Suleiman’s affidavit it may well also be 
something you had in mind it says from – so they get 
20 
introduced Mr Anoj Singh they say gets introduced to them 
and paragraph 21 says: 
“From 
there 
onwards 
we 
had 
received 
requests from either Mr Essa or from Mr 
Singh directly to book flights for them.” 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 141 of 249 
 
So I mean it still carries the idea you had it is either from Mr 
Singh or from Mr Essa.  There is only that one incident 
where they say is Mr Singh’s partner who did the request but 
generally it seems to be the theme.  So Mr Singh paragraph 
49 of your affidavit that you submitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go there Mr Seleka ask this 
question to Mr Singh with reference to paragraph 20 of Ms 
Solomon’s affidavit.  She says Mr Essa introduced you, Mr 
Singh, to her during 2014.  She says prior to that she had 
never met him.  Now do you recall whether, in terms of 
10 
your own dealings with her, you had met her at any time 
before 2014? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
No. 
 
So 
do 
you 
know 
whether 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your recollection that it may have 
been in 2014 that the two of you met or would it have been 
after, on your recollection?  You meeting her – let us leave 
out Mr Salim Essa for now.  Just in terms of your own 
20 
dealings with her. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of...  Mr Chair, I do not recall this 
meeting of 2014, certainly by Mr Essa, as I have said.  So 
your question is? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question is.  Because you have 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 142 of 249 
 
said that you have had your own interactions with her. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you did make – ask her to make 
bookings for you and you did settle your invoices.  So I am 
asking.  In terms of your own recollection.  Are you able to 
say whether you met her for the first time or started 
dealing with her for the first time in 2014 or after 2014?  
Because you have said that it was not before 2014. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think the term dealing with her is 
probably more appropriate. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   I think it would have been probably in and 
around this time but certainly not 2012 or 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think it may have been 2014 
sometime? 
MR SINGH:   Sometime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine. Now the question 
that arises because I think you were quite emphatic and 
you must tell me if I misunderstood you.  You were quite 
emphatic that you were not introduced by Mr Essa to her.  
20 
Is that right? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Your dealings with her from the 
time you started up to now, the relationship has – the 
business relationship between you and her has been fine.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 143 of 249 
 
There had been no issues? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Do you know why she would say 
you were introduced to her by Mr Salim Essa if actually 
that was not – it is not what happened? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would be speculating.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not know? 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  I was going to 
10 
ask you, Mr Singh, about your paragraph 49 in the 
affidavit.  I see there ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is now Mr Singh’s affidavit in 
Transnet Bundle 5? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 840. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Four, eight...  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Five in Bundle B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were you say: 
“To the best of my recollection, the aforesaid 
travels related to Transnet business...” 
I am intrigued by the phrase to the best of my recollection 
which seems to suggest that you are not certain about 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 144 of 249 
 
what you are saying. 
MR SINGH:   Look, Mr Chair, I think when I – when we 
drafted this wording we had access to the official travel 
records from Transnet which we had requested from the 
Commission which indicated to us that this trip, basically, 
was a business trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your answer, therefore, yes to 
Mr Seleka’s question or is it a no?  He is asking you 
whether the reason why you said to the best of your 
recollection is the reason why you said that that you were 
10 
uncertain whether the trips were for Transnet business? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not – you are certain? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So is there a reason why...  
Sorry.  Are you saying you relied on documents from 
Transnet provided to you by the Commission? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is there a reason why you used the 
20 
words to the best of your recollection as opposed to, this 
document show that I travelled on a Transnet business 
trip? 
MR SINGH:   Well, not really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, what Mr Seleka is saying 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 145 of 249 
 
is.  He would have expected you, if you were relaying on 
the documents you are talking about, he would have 
expected you to say, according to these documents and 
you mention them, you were on Transnet business trips.   
MR SINGH:   Okay, Mr Chair, maybe a better choice of 
words would have been appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that, please. 
MR SINGH:   I said, in that case, maybe a better choice of 
words would have been appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words – you know, the point is, 
when you say to the best of your recollection, it does not 
give the impression that you are basing it on documents.   
MR SINGH:   I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is like you are basing it on your 
memory. 
MR SINGH:   Memory, h’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes-no, that is correct because if the 
documents – if – but I will find out – if the Commission 
gave you the documents that show what you are saying, 
the question is also, why would they ask you this question 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 146 of 249 
 
that you should explain the trips to Dubai between 
20 June 2014 to 8 June 2014? 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, I assume 
Mr Seleka is now speculating as to reasons why things 
were done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   The issue was about 
counting(?)...  In fact, without... my learned friend must 
look at the 10.6 and then he will understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  I think Mr Singh can deal 
10 
with the question.  Mr Singh, what do you want to say in 
response to what Mr Seleka says or do you have no 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Chair... [Speaker is not clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is saying it is strange – it will be 
strange that they asked you to explain your trip from Dubai 
or to Dubai in circumstances where the documents that 
they showed you reflected that it was a Transnet business 
trip.  That is what he is saying.  Do you want to comment 
on that? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   It is quite simple.  It says – if you look at 
48.1, it says:   
“I left South Africa on 03.  I entered Dubai on 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 147 of 249 
 
06.  I existed on 08.  Between 04 and 06, I 
travelled 
between 
Frankfurt 
and 
Heathrow 
Airports...” 
 
So from whatever the information was lost(?).  I 
do not know where they got the information from.  Indeed 
that I did travel to Dubai between these dates and I guess 
that is why they have asked me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second, Mr Singh.  Are 
you able to hear him well?   
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   I was going to say that we 
10 
cannot hear at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   He needs to move nearer to 
the microphone.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see Mr Sing.  You – there are 
two people you want to make sure they hear you.  It is me 
and your counsel. 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR SINGH:   Okay let me rearrange my ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If Mr Seleka does not hear you, you can 
deal with that.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR SINGH:   [laughs]  Okay Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must hear you and your counsel 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 148 of 249 
 
because your counsel needs to protect you.  [laughs]  And 
I need to make a finding about what you are saying. 
MR SINGH:   Okay, Mr Chair, is this better? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I think that is better, ja.  But after 
some time, you might find that you ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   No, it is because of these files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR SINGH:   So maybe I should put one on this side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just see how you – I am sorry, the 
space is very limited but just do your best. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ja, he needs both.  You see the 
counsel has to use this room and I would not need to use 
such big files.  But that is fine.  [laughs]  His space is 
limited. 
MR SINGH:   I think this will be better... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, ja.  Okay.  You remember 
the proposition? 
MR SINGH:   Oh, yes.  I was – Mr Seleka wanted to know 
why the Commission asked me ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why it would have asked you to explain 
this trip, if from the documents that they showed you, it 
was clear that it was a Transnet business trip. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, it was not – they did not show 
me the documents. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 149 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  So they put this to us in a 10.6 Notice, 
right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   In a 10.6 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Given the fact that they had put it to us, we 
then requested the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:   To understand whether these trips were either 
10 
personal or private or business or private trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but your requested the documents 
from the Commission? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So they did have the documents 
at some stage?  They provided them to you? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I think we got the 10.6.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   We then requested the information? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Whether they had it or whether they asked it 
from Transnet after our request, I am not too sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But they ultimately gave it to you? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So is the point that you 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 150 of 249 
 
are making that at the time they asked you to explain, they 
might not have had those documents?  They might have got 
those documents after you made the request? 
MR SINGH:   I do not know Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But it would seem so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, if you look – I can take you 
further, for example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR SINGH:   If you look at the sub – just go to paragraph 
54 on page 481.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that of your affidavit? 
MR SINGH:   Of my affidavit, yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   You see, they asked me to explain a return 
trip to Hong Kong on 30 June to 03 July.  Now again, in 
that – if you look at that, again it is a business trip to – 
basically the Commission had thought that I had a return 
trip to Hong Kong, relating to... return to Hong Kong.  It 
20 
was a business trip to China that was via Hong Kong.  So 
the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So the – I do not know if I am answering your 
question? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 151 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no.  I think, in effect, you are 
saying you do not know but what you do know – you do not 
know when they had the documents in their possession.  
That is the Commission.  What you do know is that they 
sent you a 10.6 directive and in that 10.6 directive, you 
were asked to explain this trip.  You requested information.  
They provided you with information. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know at what stage they were 
in possession of the information? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Or the more to be hand – asking these 
questions in the 10.6.  I was not aware of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, sorry.  I again – I 
need to again just raise my concern in the context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   You have to look, with the 
greatest of respect, at paragraph 1.30.  When these 
questions about the trips are asked, they are asked against 
20 
the following questions.  It starts off: 
“The frequency and the reasons for to the...” 
Then it goes: 
“Information relating to local and international 
trips that appear to have coincided by trips of 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 152 of 249 
 
members 
by 
the 
Gupta 
family 
and 
their 
associates inter alia...” 
So it is against that background that there is then 
questions asked about the trips.  So the proposition put 
forward by Mr Seleka is.  They knew about these trips and 
they must have known that it was official work trips.  Why 
would they ask him?  It is not a valid point.  It is asked in a 
specific context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you can re-examine on it when 
you re-examine.  Okay.  Mr Seleka, let us continue. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Singh, then let 
us go back to Ms Solomon’s(?) affidavit.  Paragraph 22.2.   
“The booking was requested by Mr Singh’s 
partner, Ms Saline Make(sic)...” 
Is that pronounced correctly? 
MR SINGH:   We will accept it for now.  Nike.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, Nike.  [laughs]  Is that your 
partner? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that your partner? 
20 
MR SINGH:   It is my current wife. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that your current wife? 
MR SINGH:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Coincidence or divination? 
MR SINGH:   Neither. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 153 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that now, Mr Seleka?  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You and Mr Singh, you are getting to talk 
about things that we are not..  [laughs]  But ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That sentence, Chair.  I was simply 
confirming with Mr Singh that Ms Salina Nike is the 
partner.  He confirms it is his current wife.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I was asking whether, is it a 
coincidence or a divination? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That they knew about that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  And what was the answer, 
Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Neither of the above? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Ms Solomon knew that Ms Nike was my 
partner. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you dealt with her? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But I did not hear you give that 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 154 of 249 
 
answer when the two of you were talking. 
MR SINGH:   No, I thought he was asking the question with 
tongue in cheek. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Oh, okay.  Maybe he was.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So. 
“Ms Salina Nike for Mr Singh and her flight 
10 
from Johannesburg on 6 August 2014 to Dubai 
and back to Johannesburg on 12 August 2014.  
Mr Singh and his partner were issued with 
ticket number...” 
And the numbers are given, two numbers. 
“...respectively.  See SS-5. 
The total cost was R 60 000,00 which was 
charged to Mr Essa’s account...” 
And it is:  See SS-6. 
“Mr Essa settled this via EFT to my Nedbank 
20 
account.  See SS-6.1. 
I 
subsequently 
transferred 
this 
from 
my 
Nedbank account to the account of Travel 
Excellence also attached here to the receipt 
issued on 6 August 2014...” 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 155 of 249 
 
Mr Singh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the first question is whether you 
and your partner undertook that trip to those destinations 
and back.   
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   I was just getting that name.  So I am going 
10 
to keep this file here but I am going to try and get close to 
the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Just do what will 
make you comfortable Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the first point to be made is that 
Ms Suleiman is mistaken in her recollection.  So Ms Nike 
did not request this 6 t h of August 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This booking? 
MR SINGH:   This booking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Ms Nike, in fact, requested a booking in 
August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   August 2015? 
MR SINGH:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not 2014? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 156 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   Not 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay? 
MR SINGH:   Which also was cancelled and not used. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was not pursued? 
MR SINGH:   It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   It was booked, it was cancelled but it was – 
so it was cancelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   We never used it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   So Ms Solomon’s recollection in terms of who 
requested this flight is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   On the 6 t h of August 2014, however, we did 
fly to Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   And I requested that flight.  So from that 
perspective, that is the state of the paragraph 22.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So is your response that, one, 
20 
Ms Solomon is mistaken in saying it was your partner who 
requested that she make that booking but that the position 
is that you asked her to make the booking, numbers 2 and 
3.  You and your partner did travel, fly from Johannesburg 
on 6 August 2014 to Dubai and back to Johannesburg on 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 157 of 249 
 
12 August 2014.  That part, you say, is correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And with regard to the 
ticket numbers, you do not dispute those even though you 
might not recall whether those are the correct numbers? 
MR SINGH:   I was just going to say, Mr Chair, if I recall, 
those ticket numbers... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry/ 
MR SINGH:   If I recall, these ticket numbers that would 
really ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You will be a genius. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR SINGH:   No, that second word that you used.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay.  So but the trip did 
happen and it was booked through or by Travel Excellence.  
The booking was requested by you.  And then, was – did it 
cost R 60 000,00? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if you look at the invoice that 
Ms Solomon attaches to her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Again, I do not recall this invoice off hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is SS-6. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, SS-6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   But it seems like the number is in the ballpark 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 158 of 249 
 
of what I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the ticket prices and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR SINGH:   So what is anomalous, Mr Chair, is.  If you 
look at the invoice itself, okay?  SS-6 on page 1565.17. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am there.  Yes? 
MR SINGH:   So if you look at it, Mr Chair, you look at 
airfare and you look at airfare for Mr Singh and Ms Nike, 
the first two lines. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   You see it is actually R 20 000,00 and 
R 20 000,00.  Then you have airport taxes, R 10 000,00 
and R 10 000,00, coming to a balance of R 60 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  Now when you compare that to the 
Serendipity Tours invoice which is on page 1565.16, the 
page before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m? 
MR SINGH:   You will see, Mr Chair, that there is a 
20 
discrepancy in the airport taxes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In respect of the airport tax? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, if you look on the Travel Excellence 
invoice it is airport taxes of R 10 000,00 and R 10 000,00 
straight.  Okay? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 159 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   If you look at the invoice from Serendipity, 
the taxes are R 6 000,00.  So, basically, if you look at the 
line airport taxes and airport taxes subject to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   So you are basically R 6 627,00 plus 322.81.  
Are you there Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am looking but I think ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am thinking in the meantime whether 
10 
we should go into the details ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because you say the booking was 
requested by you ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   But Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...ja. 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
...the 
point 
that 
one 
has 
to 
think 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   So the point I am making Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   Is that there is a discrepancy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Between, let us call it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   R 60 000,00. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 160 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   R 60 000,00 and a source document from 
Serendipity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   Now, the reason why I make that point is, 
Mr Chair, is.  This R 60 000,00 is tied back to an EFT or a 
bank settlement from somebody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Let us not say Mr Essa or whoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Let us just say somebody, okay? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Now, in – and I will – and again, when we go 
through each of these invoices, you will see the same 
pattern. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Is that, it is linked to some bank statement 
with some value and then you have an invoice that is 
generated that equals that but it is not supported by the 
actual, let us call it – for lack of a better word, external 
invoice. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR SINGH:   If this one ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The record(?) ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   ...in itself can be relied upon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 161 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   Because if you look at the date on which the 
Serendipity invoices are generated, they are generated on 
the 13 t h of November 2018.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   So if you look at 1565.16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   If you go right to the bottom, Mr Chair, on the 
bottom left-hand corner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   You see there, Mr Chair, there is a date. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   13 November 2018. 
MR SINGH:   And I think there is a time there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   As well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You regard that date as a date for what? 
MR SINGH:   That is what I am saying.  I do not know what 
that date is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Because if this travel happened in 2014, I 
would expect this invoice to be dated 2014, not 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   ...which is a duplicate(?) invoice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which invoice Mr Singh? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 162 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one at 1565 ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   1565.16.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the date is there in that block. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, but I am saying is, if you look at 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   31 July 2014. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, but if you look at the bottom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   At the bottom left-hand corner, you see a 
date of 13/11/2018. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think, Mr Singh, until we know what 
they say or she says this date represents, it is difficult to 
say much about it because there is nothing indicating what 
it is for.  Whereas if you look at the top, you can 
understand that is the document number, that is date, date 
and that is account number...  But here at the bottom, it is 
just a date and time.  And I do not know whether the words 
SUP or what. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But otherwise there is nothing written 
20 
which gives us an idea what that date represents.  Maybe 
she can be asked to give us a supplementary affidavit and 
say - tell us what that date represents and then you can 
comment on it to see whether – what it means. 
MR SINGH:   No, I take that Mr Chair but again I am asked 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 163 of 249 
 
to comment on a document that is in here.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And I am telling you, from what I see, and I 
am commenting on the issues that you are presenting to 
me in terms of the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And I take your point that maybe when she 
comes, she can say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:   And maybe at the same time she can explain 
as to why the Serendipity invoice is 53 to 70 and her 
invoice is 60. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that point? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair.  If you look at the 
Serendipity invoice the total ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEERDEN:   Chairperson, maybe my client 
must just, when he deals with the invoices, refer to the 
annexure numbers and the pages so we are all on the 
same page. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us – well, it is important to refer 
to, at least, the page.   
MR SINGH:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These pages numbers are long. 
MR SINGH:   Long, ja. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 164 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So it is 1565.16, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:   If you look at the invoice totals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   And then you will see there is a line below 
that says less to... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So it is 53 to 70. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  So that is effectively the total that was 
the costs of these trips(?) from Serendipity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   Then you will see that the 1565.17 which is 
the Travel Excellence invoice, you now have an amount of 
R 60 000,00 in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Okay. So there is a discrepancy of 
R 7 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
20 
MR SINGH:   And it is all allocated to airport taxes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Which is not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, ja.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:   And all, Mr Chair, I would understand that, 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 165 of 249 
 
yes, Travel Excellence has to charge for their service.  So 
there would be a discrepancy between Serendipity and 
Travel Excellence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   But not the value of R 7 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, she can be asked to deal with 
all the queries you raised insofar as they can be explained. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this one, we – the point is.  You 
accept that she made the bookings for you, it was at your 
10 
request for you and your partner to travel to Dubai and 
back on the dates given.  I guess the next thing is.  Did 
you pay her to settle whatever the invoice was, whether it 
was R 60 000,00 or whatever in regard to this trip? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think a general comment across 
all of the travels ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are... ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   As I said, I did pay for all of them 
CHAIRPERSON:   You paid for all of them? 
MR SINGH:   I paid for all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Would ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   In a manner I described to you... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, would you have any proof of 
payment in regard to payments you made for these trips 
where you had requested them to make the bookings for 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 166 of 249 
 
you? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I will check but I do not think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But where you made payments by 
way of cash because you said there would have been such 
occasions, they would have had to issue you with receipts, 
I would imagine? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair, but I do not think I kept any of 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And where you have – where you 
paid by way of EFT, that should be able to be traced in 
10 
your accounts, bank accounts? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think if there were occasions 
where that happened there would be records. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   I said on the occasions when those 
happened, there would be those records.  Unfortunately, 
for me to go back and request them.  Yes, all my bank 
accounts have been closed.  So accessing bank records is 
a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
but 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
20 
Commission 
might 
be 
able 
to 
trace 
that. 
 
If 
your 
cooperation is required, you would give your cooperation? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, we will consider... ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You consider it? 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 167 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Because the Commission – the 
banks 
have 
been 
quite 
cooperative 
whenever 
the 
Commission has issued them with summonses to disclose 
certain information.  They have, generally speaking, been 
very cooperative.  Of course some it may be done without 
your consent but to the extent that your cooperation might 
be required, that is why I was asking but you have said you 
and your legal team would consider. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  But again, her 
10 
version here is quite clear namely that it was Mr Essa who 
settled this invoice.  She says Mr Essa paid via EFT to her 
Nedbank account and she subsequently transferred the 
money from her Nedbank account to the account of Travel 
Excellence.  So I take it that you are not in a position to 
deny whether Mr Essa made some payment to her in regard 
to this trip and she moved the money from her Nedbank 
account into the account of Travel Excellence or you are 
saying it is one, you never asked Mr Essa to do that.  Two, 
you do not see any need why Mr Essa would have done 
20 
that because he had not been involved in this booking, you 
had requested the booking yourself and three, you say you 
paid. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 168 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if Mr Essa made some payment, 
maybe that is their own thing but you made – you settled 
this account [indistinct – dropping voice] 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And Mr Chair not to forget that – and I will 
come back to it, the discrepancies in the invoices are a big 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are a big issue? 
MR SINGH:   Are a big issue. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I understand that. 
MR SINGH:   And you will see why. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand that, I understand that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I just wanted to say 
on that aspect, Chair, it is an inter partes transaction.  If 
Mr Singh says he was overcharged, he must go after Travel 
Excellence.  The Commission, what are we going to do with 
it? 
20 
MR SINGH:   No, let us not get this incorrect, Mr Seleka.  I 
did not say I was overcharged. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I am saying if you say you were 
overcharged. 
MR SINGH:  That is why I am saying, I was saying I was 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 169 of 249 
 
not overcharged.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Because this invoice is a fabricated invoice.  
I am telling you, this invoice has been created to equal an 
amount that appears on the bank statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Wait.   Because 
I also wanted to comment on that.  The invoice, let us go 
through it, is dated 31 July 2014.  That is the invoice on 
page 1565.17. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, what? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1565.17, the one we have been dealing 
with. 
MR SINGH:   That is the invoice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
MR SINGH:   That is the invoice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is Travel Excellence invoice. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   31 July 2014.  Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now they say they received 
20 
payment on 6 August 2014, that is on page 1565.19. 
MR SINGH:   1565.19? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then – is that electronic banking 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 170 of 249 
 
transfer they are talking about on the page before that, 
also dated August, 5 August 2014 which is the very first 
entry, see ex date and the amount is 60 000, the amount is 
60 000 on that receipt.  So I am not sure – what are you 
saying, the invoice has been created to match the amount 
because the invoice comes before the payment. 
MR SINGH:   I could also – we have dealt with backdating 
quite significantly in this [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have dealt with? 
MR SINGH:   I have said we have we have dealt with 
10 
backdating of documents quite extensively. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, only insofar as it relates to your 
MSA and your letter. 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  So, Mr Chair, I think as I have said, in 
my view, if you look at the receipt, if Ms Solomon is to 
continue with this thread, Ms Solomon should then have 
produced Travel Excellence’s bank statements that reflects 
the deposit of 60 000.  Here there is just this rudimentary 
receipt that is again produced, okay?  That references, Mr 
Essa [indistinct].  Similarly, Mr Chair, in terms of this 
20 
electronic banking contra there is not stamp as to where 
this originates from.  The authenticity of this [indistinct – 
dropping voice] what it reflects and it only reflects a 
deposit.  So where is the payment? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 171 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are now talking about Mr Essa’s 
payment? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if you look at 1565.18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   It is purported to be a bank statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   That reflects an amount of 60 000 being paid 
to Ms Solomon specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Ms Solomon asserts that this 
10 
amount was then transferred to Travel Excellence’s bank 
account.  So on her version I would have expected her to 
have a bank statement that reflects her bank statement 
that reflects the contra of 60 000 that is going out and then 
if Travel Excellence’s bank statement to show 60 000 
coming in.  This would deal with her version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Not in relation to my ticket that I paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So that is the deficiencies that we have with 
20 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, that is fine.  Those points 
should be raised with Ms Suleiman so that she can deal 
with them maybe in a supplementary affidavit but she must 
still come and give evidence, maybe she will deal with that 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 172 of 249 
 
but some of the points that Mr Singh is raising are things 
that should be easy to address. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, there is one more 
based on the points that was raised by my client.  Of 
course it is very easy through metadata to establish when 
a document was generated and when not.  So that is a 
further point that can eventually be looked at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well also, I mean, if the relevant banks 
can just produce these documents then it is very objective. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so that would be – that should be 
easy to just obtain the relevant documents from the bank.  
But if, Mr Singh, it is true that Mr Salim Essa did pay 
Travel Excellence in respect of this - in respect of your 
travelling, even if he did so without – or if he did so 
without you having asked him or without any arrangement 
between the two of you, are you able to say why he would 
do that?  In other words, an amount – let us say according 
to Ms Solomon, an amount of R60 000 was paid by Mr 
Salim Essa in respect of your travelling and your partner’s 
20 
travelling.   
 
Now I understand the issues you have raised about 
this bank statement and so on, but let us assume that in 
the end the banks provide proof of the payments and it is 
established that indeed Mr Salim Essa made payment, why 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 173 of 249 
 
would he make a payment in respect of your travelling and 
your partner ’s travelling? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, I can emphatically say that he 
never did so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess that you cannot say that 
because you were not there to see whether he made the 
payment.  What you can say is you never asked him. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I saying is he never made 
payments on my behalf. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   On your behalf. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, sorry, with 
greatest of respect, my client stated it as a fact and I 
thought we were dealing with facts.  He paid for this ticket. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, no, no, I am not dealing with 
that.  If, after all the evidence is in, Mr Singh, the fact 
remains that Mr Salim Essa made payment to Travel 
Excellence and that that payment was in regard to your trip 
and your partner ’s trip.  If you never asked him to do so 
and if there was no arrangement between the two of you 
20 
that he should pay for it, why would he do that because 
that question will arise if as a matter of fact when all the 
evidence is in, the fact stares us in our face that Mr Salim 
Essa did make the payment on the date given by Ms 
Solomon and that the payment was in regard to your trip 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 174 of 249 
 
and your partner ’s trip, the two of you.  So I am saying the 
question that will stare us in the face is if you never asked 
him to pay for you, if there was no arrangement between 
the two of you that he should pay for you, why would he 
have 
paid 
this 
amount 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR SINGH:   This is a hypothetical statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, it is not hypothetical in the 
sense that if the bank documents that will be asked for, if 
they reveal that, it will be a reality.  Of course if they 
10 
reveal that there was no payment, that is the end of the 
matter.  No payment by Mr Essa, that is the end of that 
matter. 
MR SINGH:   Okay, let us deal with it like this, Mr Chair.  
As you said when you started this line of inquiry, you said I 
cannot actually say or not say …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   …whether Mr Essa paid or did not pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   These amounts. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Not for my travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Let us leave travel aside.  So if there are 
indeed amounts that Mr Essa would have paid to Ms 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 175 of 249 
 
Solomon, for whatever reason, those things may have 
happened but it is not necessarily that he paid for my 
travel.  So let us – in your case, Mr Chair, you are posing 
to me, if the bank statements come back and it reflects 
these 60 000 amounts as Ms Solomon alludes to, I still find 
it difficult to understand how it will be then associated with 
the fact that it was for my travel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, this is what I am raising with you.  
You were not there when according to Ms Solomon she had 
communication with Mr Salim Essa about this payment.  
10 
She says that the payment was made by Mr Salim Essa 
was for your trip, okay?  Now I was suggesting to you 
earlier on that you cannot deny what was said between the 
two of them because you were not there. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But what you can say is, if Mr 
Salim Essa said to Ms Solomon he was paying for your trip, 
he was saying so without you having requesting him to do 
that.  That is what you can say and it might surprise you, 
that is another thing, but if I were to believe Ms Solomon, 
20 
that this is what she was told by Mr Salim Essa, then I 
would then come back and say well, on the one hand you 
say you never asked Mr Salim Essa but we all know your 
trip did happen. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 176 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Ms Solomon, based on her affidavit, 
it seems is not going to say you paid for this amount based 
on this, I do not know when she comes what she will say 
but based on this it looks like she will say it is Mr Salim 
Essa who paid and then I would have to ask myself the 
question but what are the probabilities that Mr Salim Essa 
would pay this amount, say to Ms Solomon I am paying for 
Mr Singh’s trip without the two of them having spoken, 
without an arrangement.  That is what I will be faced with 
and I am giving you a chance to say this is how this can be 
10 
explained, if there is an explanation that can be given.  But 
you might say well, I do not know how it could happen and 
I cannot offer any explanation, all I can say is I never 
asked him to and I paid for the trip myself. 
MR SINGH:   Well, that is where it stays, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay ,alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Let us go back to 
Ms Sulaiman’s affidavit.  Well, let us – I must just say this 
part is not captured in the Transnet request to you.  So let 
us go to paragraph 22.3 of Ms Sulaiman’s affidavit. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, what page are you on now, Sir? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1565.5. 
MR SINGH:   1565.5. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  The 6 November trip, paragraph 
22.3.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 177 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   I am there, Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
“A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly from 
Johannesburg on 6 November 2014 to Dubai and 
back to Johannesburg on 9 November 2014.  I 
cannot recall who made the request.  Mr Singh was 
issued with ticket number 4724296595, see SS9.  
The total cost was R55 775 which was charged to 
Mr Essa’s account, see SS10.  From my recollection  
I received a call from Mr Singh who informed me 
10 
that a driver would be dropping off cash to settle 
the account.  As per Mr Singh’s advice, a driver 
dropped off the cash on 11 November 2014.  I 
attach hereto the receipt issued 11 November 2014, 
see SS11.  This amount was deposited into our 
bank account together with other cash we had on 
hand.  The amount deposited on 11 November 2014 
inclusive of the R55 775 amount to R65 700.” 
Now the first question again, Mr Singh, is whether there 
was a booking for you from Johannesburg …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess, Mr Seleka, it is better to start 
with the question whether there was a trip. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On those dates to that destination.  Did 
you travel, Mr Singh, from Johannesburg, did you travel on 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 178 of 249 
 
6 November 2014 from Johannesburg to Dubai and did you 
come from Dubai on 9 November 2014? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at paragraph 22.3, page 1565.5. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There was a trip? 
MR SINGH:   There was a trip. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and it was to Dubai, from Jo’burg 
to Dubai and from Dubai to Johannesburg and on the dates 
given there. 
10 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, then the next thing is whether it is 
true that the booking was made by Travel Excellence. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is so.  And then the next question 
is, who requested the booking? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   I would have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have.  Okay, alright.  And 
what do you say about the payment?  She says she 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 179 of 249 
 
received a call from you and you informed her that a driver 
would be dropping off cash to settle the account and she 
says the account was R55 775. 
MR SINGH:   I am just getting to the relevant annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe the amount should be the last 
thing because you might need to check but in terms of you 
having called and told her a driver would deliver the cash 
to her, do you recall that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think it was basically the same as 
I explained to you before, that I would have paid for this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the method of payment, we will 
have to check and get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but you would have paid it. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Either cash or … 
MR SINGH:   Or some manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So the use of a driver, 
you say you did not.  You did not use a driver to drop cash 
to pay this. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, in terms of this specific one, I 
cannot recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   I said in this specific instance, I cannot 
recall. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 180 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot recall. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is possible? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka?  Or do you want to say 
anything about the amount? 
MR SINGH:   I was just going to go to the particular 
annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   SS10. 
MR SINGH:   SS10. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 1565.21. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, other than again the discrepancy in 
terms of the airport taxes I think nothing else that I want to 
raise around the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, not that is fine.  Okay.  And the 
date of payment that she gives there, you do not take issue 
with the dates or do you? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I see that there is a Travel 
Excellence bank statement at SS12 that reflects an amount 
20 
of R65 700 again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And she explains this by virtue of the fact 
that there was other case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 181 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   That needed to be deposited. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So again, Mr Chair, I do not see a bank 
stamp. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   That indicates how the 65 was made up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Normally you would go and deposit or 
indicate, you know this is the makeup of this 65. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR SINGH:   And it is made up of 55 or 50 or from this 
person or that person or something.  So I do not see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I did not get the answer to your 
question whether Mr Singh you take issue with the cash 
receipt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he said he does not take issue with 
it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He does not take – okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I asked him about the dates, that is 
20 
what I have – you take issue with the dates that she gives 
for payment? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, okay ,alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is fine. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 182 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So just out of interest, Chair, if we 
might go again to the Transnet file, 5(B), page 427 
because this particular clip is reflected there.  427, Mr 
Singh, paragraph 1.13.6. 
MR SINGH:   This is on the 10.6 notice? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So again is the required – let me wait for you.  
427.  You are there?  1.13.6.  Ja relates to your return trip 
to Dubai …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka, is it possible to 
pull your mic closer to you or is it not moveable?  Okay, ja, 
alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Relates to your 
return trip to Dubai between 6 November 2014 to 9 
November 2014, the dates coincide with Ms Sulaiman’s.  
You share the flight to Dubai with Mr Salim Essa on EK766.  
Shall we first deal with that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, do you want to – oh, I thought you 
would take us to the answer. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if there is an answer let us look 
at the answer before he says anything. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the answer …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe you read the whole of 1.13.6, 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 183 of 249 
 
then we go to the answer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So the first part is you – well, 
the second part, you share the flight to Dubai with Mr 
Salim Essa on EK766. 
“The following individuals were in Dubai during the 
same period.” 
Chair, should I read the names of these individuals? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Ashok Narayan, Mr Sanjay Grover, 
Mr Gezinhliziyo Vincent …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Gezinhliziyo Vincent Zuma. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Vincent Zuma, thank you, Chair.  Mr 
Zwelakhe Nhlanganiso Ntshepe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nhlanganiso Ntshepe. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tshepe. Ms Julia Basitsano Khumalo, 
Evan Naidoo, Mr Abraham Stephanus Burger, Mr Mohamed 
Intius Ahmed Patel and Mr Mohamed Iqbal Survé. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And let us go to the answer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh’s affidavit – the relevant 
paragraph is on page 482 of the same Transnet – of the 
20 
same bundle, yes. 
MR SINGH:   482? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   482, paragraph 60, 61, 62.  So Mr 
Singh answers at paragraph 1.13.36: 
“Return trip, Dubai 6 November 2014 to 9 November 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 184 of 249 
 
2014.” 
Paragraph 60: 
“I confirm that I travelled return to Dubai on the 
date set out above.” 
61 – well 61, Chair, is an answer to: 
“You shared a flight to Dubai with Mr Salim Essa on 
EK766?” 
Mr Singh answers: 
“I have no knowledge whether the individuals…” 
Oh no, which one are you answering.  Let us go to 62, 
10 
sorry, Chair.  The answer is at 62: 
“Lastly, I take not of the allegation that I allegedly 
shared a flight with Salim Essa.  I, however, deny 
that I knew that he was on the same flight.”   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think – well, one, he – it seems Mr 
Singh admits that he travelled to Dubai and back to 
Johannesburg on the dates given in the directive.  He has 
no knowledge of – he says he has no knowledge whether 
the individuals listed in the directive in that paragraph 
were also in Dubai during the period mentioned. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he does not deny that Mr Salim 
Essa was on the same flight but he says he was not aware 
of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Is that correct, Mr Singh? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 185 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now is the relevant paragraph of the 
directive which is responded to here does not coincide with 
22.3 of Ms Solomon’s affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, that is the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you said, Mr Singh – in fact you are 
saying there is nothing particularly – there is nothing 
10 
strange about paragraph 22.3 about the trip because you 
requested Ms Solomon to make that booking and she made 
it and you travelled and you paid them. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Obviously, Mr Singh, this is in 
November 2014, you would have known Mr Essa at this 
time. 
MR SINGH:   I have no recollection specifically when I 
actually, as I said, met Mr Essa.  I do not think I can 
20 
answer the question definitively.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us move on.  At paragraph 22.4 
…[intervenes] 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 186 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:   We are back on… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are back at Ms Sulaiman’s 
affidavit.  This is towards the end of 2014, Mr Singh, you 
were at Transnet at the time.  This is November 2014. 
MR SINGH:   On which paragraph are we now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, I just want to piggyback on the 
last point. 
MR SINGH:  On which paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, about ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  He just wants you to confirm that towards 
10 
the end of 2014 you were still at Transnet. 
MR SINGH:  Oh, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and I thought I understood that 
you had on a couple of occasions met with Mr Salim Essa 
in 2014.  
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you just do not recall when was 
that? 
MR SINGH:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you knew Mr Essa towards, by ... or 
20 
towards or by the end of 2014 you knew Mr Essa? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think I said that it was probably in 
2013, 2014. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I think you said 2012, 2013.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 187 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  Ja.  2012, 2013 there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And I thought you also said once or 
twice, is that right?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you have agreed when Mr Seleka 
says on a couple of occasions.  So that seems to me to 
make it more than once or twice, but maybe not really, but 
you it is once or twice.  
MR SINGH:  Yes, Mr Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And around 2012, 2013 ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  That is correct, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And not 2014.  
MR SINGH:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this is the man you would recognise 
if he was on the same flight with you or on the same bus or 
train or car? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Train could be very long.  If you are in 
the same ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Coach. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Shaft, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You would recognise ...[intervenes]  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 188 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, the question is whether based on 
the fact that in 2012, 2013 you had met him once or twice, 
whether in 2014 if you met him in the same flight on which 
you were travelling you would recognise him? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I think I would have recognised him, 
but I did not meet him on the flight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not see him on the occasion. 
MR SINGH:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So let us then go to paragraph 22.4 of 
10 
Ms Suleiman’s affidavit.  Eskom Bundle 18, bracket C: 
 
“A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly 
from Johannesburg on 23 February 2015 to 
Dubai 
and 
back 
to 
Johannesburg 
on 
26 
February 2015.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were frequent in Dubai, Mr Singh in 
2014, early 2015.  Yes, continue Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I, where was I? 
CHAIRPERSON:  22.4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes: 
20 
 
“I cannot recall who made the request.  Mr 
Singh 
was 
issued 
with 
ticket 
number 
1959734196, see SS13.  The total cost was 
R31 000-00 which was charged to Mr Essa’s 
account, 
SS14. 
 
From 
my 
recollection 
I 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 189 of 249 
 
received a call from Mr Singh who informed me 
that a driver would be dropping off cash to 
settle the account.  As per Mr Singh’s advice a 
driver dropped off the cash to myself, which 
was deposited with reference Essa on 6 March 
2015.  See SS15.  The reason the deposit 
reference reflects S Essa was because the 
amount was used to settle Mr Essa’s account.  
I also attach hereto the receipt issued, dated 6 
March 2015.  See SS16.” 
10 
 
Again Mr Singh, the trip between those dates, 23 
February 2015 to 26 February 2015, do you confirm it from 
Johannesburg to Dubai? 
MR SINGH:  I confirm that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you confirm that on 23 February 2015 
you flew from Johannesburg to Dubai and on 26 February 
2015 flew back from Dubai to Johannesburg.  Okay, and 
who had requested Ms Suleiman to make the booking? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair that would have been me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR SINGH:  I did.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You did?  Okay.  Continue Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, and you also confirm the facts 
regarding payment, you calling her saying the driver would 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 190 of 249 
 
come to drop off the cash?   
MR SINGH:  As I have said in the previous response, I am 
not too sure about this part, but at the end of the day I 
paid for the trips, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you cannot remember whether you 
sent a driver. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you made the payment.  
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And can you recall whether it was in cash 
10 
or you say it might have been cash, it might have been in 
some other way? 
MR SINGH:  Some other form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  But as I said we will look into it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and do you make any ... do you take 
issue with the amount? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, we will have to go to the 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  We would have to go there.  
20 
MR SINGH:  Back to the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you say more or less, it is fine.  I 
do not know if we need to go there, because you may be 
making the same points that you have made in regard to 
the others, but if you make a different point, that is 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 191 of 249 
 
different.  
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, just two things.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You want us to go there? 
MR SINGH:  If we can go to SS14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  
MR SINGH:  Which is 1565.   
CHAIRPERSON:  SS14, what is the page, 1565?   
MR SINGH:  1565, 24.25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I am there.  
MR SINGH:  The first one Mr Chair is if you look at Ms 
10 
Suleiman’s statement, she says that I was scheduled to fly 
on the 23 and return on the 26 t h, per paragraph 22.4.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  However, should you go to 1565.25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  You see that there is a return date of the 1 s t 
of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  
MR SINGH:  So the statement obviously is incorrect in 
terms of the return date of the 26 t h, it should be the 1 s t of 
20 
March if the invoice is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Then you will see Mr Chair, if you look at the 
first column, the airport tax column and the total column.  
If you take the EFA and you add it to the airport taxes 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 192 of 249 
 
which is twenty thousand plus twenty thousand, it does not 
give you a total of thirty thousand.  
 
That total should be forty thousand and then if you 
add a thousand to that, the grand total should be forty one 
thousand, but then if you look at the total columns at the 
bottom, the ten plus ... the twenty plus the ten gives you 
forty one, it does not give you forty. 
 
So again there is a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You say there is a discrepancy with the 
numbers, with the figures. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes but other than that you admit 
the trip and, but you say you paid for it yourself.  
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair, but the reason why I 
raised this issue with the discrepancy on the invoice is 
because it is used to justify a deposit or deposits or EFT’s 
that have been made and can be proved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Yes, the substance of this invoice does not 
make sense.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  I think that is all I want to note.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine.  Then continue Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, if we may 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 193 of 249 
 
again go to the Transnet, 5(B).  Page 427. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, sorry one second.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 427, paragraph 1.13.5.  Which 
seems to correlate with Ms Sullivan’s affidavit, paragraph 
22.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka, can I disturb you and ask 
something else?  I do not want to forget.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am remember that because I am 
going to ask that here.  team works on my bundle to 
10 
indicate, indicate a paragraph what Mr Singh’s response 
was, where he says I admit that this trip did happen 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On that date.  From there, there and 
back, but I made ... I requested the 15 t h, I did not send the 
driver or I am not sure, I sent a driver, but I made a 
payment.  In regards to each paragraph I would like 
something like that.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But precisely because I now wanted to 
ask you to make sure the team can do that, I remembered 
that there is homework that your team was supposed to do 
in regard to Eskom.  That document relating to Mr Tsotsi 
and Ms Lynne Brown about the composition of the various 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 194 of 249 
 
committees. 
 
You 
will 
recall 
that 
some 
time 
back 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I had asked that your team should work 
on that and produce a document.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Initially the document that has been 
produced was not correct.  I said it should be redone.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And last time we talked about it, I said 
10 
your team must give me the document.  I have not received 
this.  Now I did not want to forget that because it is 
important.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can make sure that I get that not 
later than tomorrow.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that one but in regard to this one, 
this is the request I am making. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So you can continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am hoping I can get this one not 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 195 of 249 
 
later than Monday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I, yes we should be able to 
provide it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will do it myself, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  I disturbed you while you 
were on something, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no but I am fine.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh, that is Eskom, Transnet 5(B), 
10 
page 427 paragraph 1.13.5.  Which I said seems to 
correspond with Ms Suleiman’s paragraph 24, 22.4.  So 
this relates to return trip to Dubai between 23 February 
2015 and 1 March 2015.   
 
So I think is that one of the discrepancies you were 
trying to point out in the invoice or the air ticket, that it has 
a date of 1 March? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it seems to be here.  
MR SINGH:  I agree. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, thank you.  The following 
individuals were in Dubai during the same period and the 
names are there Chairperson.  Some of them are difficult 
to pronounce. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me which one are difficult to 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 196 of 249 
 
pronounce, I will ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can I read the ones which are familiar?  
Mr Salim Essa is also there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, tell me when you are stuck. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will come to your aid.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  So there is Akash 
Garg, Ashok Narayan, Sanjay Grover, Vivian Keith Oates.  
Mr Singh, may I paused there.  We have not asked you 
whether you knew this people or you know them.  Do you 
10 
know these people?  You do not know Akash Garg? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you know Akash, Mr Akash Garg? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ashok Narayan? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sanjay Grover? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Vivian Keith Oates? 
MR SINGH:  I do sir.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do.  How do you know him? 
MR SINGH:  If it is indeed the same Vivian Keith Oates 
that I know, then it would be, he was the head of internal 
audit at Eskom, I mean at Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At Transnet? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 197 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  Yes, on behalf of Ernest Nyambo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On behalf of Ernest Nyambo? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Shamim Shaik? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do not know.  Is that Mogammed 
Rafique Bagus? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Rajesh Kumar Gupta? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, as I testified before I know Mr

Gupta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know Mr Gupta.  Mr Rajesh Gupta. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Riaz Zaloojee? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Michael Andrew Thomas Hulley? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Abraham Stephanus Burger? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Salim Aziz Essa?   
20 
MR SINGH:  As I have testified I have met him once or 
twice.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the answer is yes? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Stefan Nel? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 198 of 249 
 
MR KOKO:  No.

MR SINGH:  No sir.

ADV SELEKA SC:  Patrick Makhubedu? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Kim Valerie Davids? 
MR SINGH:  If it is indeed Ms Brown’s PA, then I have met 
her in her official capacity. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the answer is yes? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now there is a Lynette Brown.  I do not 
know whether that is Lenelle or Lynette Brown.  Could that 
be the minister?  Do you know? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might not be able ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  If this refers to the minister then I know the 
minister, but if it is not the minister, then I do not know 
who this is.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Maboikanyo Imogen Mashazi?   
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 199 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, they say they were in Dubai at the 
same time as you.  Your affidavit is on page 481.  I mean 
on page 481 you answer, you provide information in 
response.  At paragraph 1.13.5 return trip to Dubai, 23 
February 2015 to 1 March 2015.  Paragraph 58 you say: 
 
“I confirm that I travelled, returned to Dubai on 
the dates set out above.” 
10 
MR SINGH:  Sorry sir, where are you?  Page?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  481. 
MR SINGH:  481. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of the same bundle.  
MR SINGH:  Paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  58. 
MR SINGH:  58. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have read 58, you confirm the dates.  
59 you say: 
 
“I have no knowledge whether the individuals 
20 
listed in this paragraph were in Dubai during 
the period mentioned since I have not been 
provided with any proof thereof.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka, let me complete what I would 
like to be done to make my job easier. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 200 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I need a document that will link what 
the paragraphs in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit link it with the 
questions in the directive.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Link it with the answers of Mr Singh’s 
affidavit.  So that one can see they are the same. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And his answers.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and his answers, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So now this answer at 
paragraph 58 and 59, paragraphs 58 and 59 relates to what 
paragraph in Ms Suleiman’s affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  22.4.  
CHAIRPERSON:  22.4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright, thank you.  So that trip Mr 
Singh which you have admitted, was it a Transnet business 
20 
trip or was it a personal trip?   
MR SINGH:  The one ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The one you, the one dealt with in 
paragraph 22.4 of Ms Suleiman’s affidavit, that you deal 
with in the paragraph that we have just looked at in your 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 201 of 249 
 
affidavit, namely paragraph 58 and 59. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, they are personal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Personal? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  I am not sure whether we 
asked him in regard to each of the trips because it 
becomes important to know whether it was personal 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or business because his affidavit does 
10 
not always indicate whether it was personal or business. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  We know Mr Singh, you 
have at least identified one which is the first one of 8 June 
2014, as according to your recollection is a, well I think  it 
is two.  
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair, if you look at, let us make it 
easy.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Of all the flights that I covered by Ms 
Suleiman, they all [indistinct] and we come to the one 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, yes.  
MR SINGH:  Private trips.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR SINGH:  The one that we have a little bit of a 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 202 of 249 
 
contention with is the first one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:  Which I am saying she records it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  But I am saying I have a different version as 
to how they happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  No, that helps.  Then we know 
that accept that one, your version is all the others which 
you admit were private.  
MR SINGH:  Yes.  Mr Chair, your issue comes in when you 
10 
are looking at the [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR SINGH:  There is a mixture there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, okay.  No, that is fine.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So at least the ones in this affidavit, 
except for one, are private, personal. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Let us complete what we need to 
ask him about paragraph 32.4.  Then let us take an 
adjournment, a ten minutes adjournment.  We will take the 
20 
ten minutes adjournment and then when we come back, we 
I will hear what is going to happen about the evening 
session from the work team concerned and ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Lawyers involved.  So we will interpose. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 203 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then depending on what I am told, 
we will take it from there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You still want to, do you still have 
questions on that paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, Mr Singh have we, you are 
accepting everything there with the payments as well? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, not everything.  He does not accept 
the issue of a driver but says he is not sure whether he 
would have sent a driver.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But he says in the end the payment came 
from him.  Is that right Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the amount, R31 000-00? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have commented ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  I have commented on that, in terms of the 
discrepancy ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, but your recollection of what you 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 204 of 249 
 
paid? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I do not as I said I do not have a 
recollection of the exact amounts like ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR SINGH:  But the issue of the invoice ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  Discrepancy ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR SINGH:  Linking to the deposit in the bank statement is 
obviously a concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So ja, or so the substance of the 
allegations ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think except for the issue of the 
driver and the issue of the discrepancy in the amount, the 
invoice in substance he accepts.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Chair, it may be an opportune time to 
20 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja, 
let 
us 
take 
a 
ten 
minutes 
adjournment, then we adjourn.  Thank you. 
HEARING ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 205 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are just interposing at this stage for 
me to be informed what the state of affairs is with regard to 
the evening session that was planned.  I was going to hear 
Ms Norma Gigaba’s evidence.  Mr Myburgh, do you want to 
tell me anything? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you Chairperson.  We did 
during the course of the morning receive a letter from Ms 
Gigaba’s attorneys advising that she withdraws from her 
participation in the commission.  Ms Gigaba’s attorney is 
here.  
10 
 
She has a copy of the letter.  Might I suggest that 
she be allowed to address you and hand up the letter 
formally? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright.  If you can do it, if your 
mic is working, you can do it from where you are.  That is 
fine.  Just make sure your mic is working or otherwise they 
can sanitise the podium and then you can ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAKHATHINI SC:  I think it is working Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright.  
ADV MAKHATHINI SC:  Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you can just start by placing 
yourself on record and then you can tell me what you need 
to tell me.  
ADV MAKHATHINI SC:  Okay.  The full name Gcwalisile 
Makhathini from RNT Attorneys.   
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 206 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV GCWALISILE MAKHATHINI: I represent Ms Norma 
Gigaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV GCWALISILE MAKHATHINI:  Okay.  We received 
Chair, instructions Chair last night that Ms Gigaba would 
like to withdraw her participation from the commission and 
I this morning addressed the letter to the commission, 
advising truth to that effect.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would you like to read that letter 
10 
into the record? 
ADV GCWALISILE MAKHATHINI:  Yes, Chair.  Okay: 
 
“To the secretary of the commission.  As 
advised by the commission on Friday, 9 April 
2021 that our client Ms Norma Mngoma was 
scheduled 
to 
give 
evidence 
before 
the 
commission today, the 13 t h April 2021.  Two, 
this letter serves to inform the commission that 
as of late yesterday we received instructions 
from our client informing us of one, her 
20 
personal concerns with how various aspect 
regarding her proposed appearance at the 
commission has been handled or allegedly 
mishandled by the commission and two, her 
decision 
to 
therefore 
withdraw 
her 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 207 of 249 
 
participation in the work of the commission.  
We 
are 
further 
instructed 
to 
inform 
the 
commission accordingly of the above as we 
hereby do.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is there anything you are able to 
tell me other than what is in the letter about her decision? 
ADV GCWALISILE MAKHATHINI:  There is nothing Chair, I 
have not yet even had an opportunity to consult in detail 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV GCWALISILE MAKHATHINI:  Other than what she 
discussed with me before writing this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV GCWALISILE MAKHATHINI:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh, what do you say 
about this situation? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, we are not apprised of 
precisely the detail of Ms Gigaba’s facts in relation to the 
commission, obviously those are things that can be 
addressed in the course of her evidence.  What we would 
20 
like to place on record for present purposes, is the letter 
came as something of a surprise to us, because Ms Gigaba 
was schedule to give evidence remotely from Cape Town 
on Friday afternoon. 
 
The next thing that we learnt of was this letter, and 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 208 of 249 
 
I think precious little could have happened between Friday 
afternoon and Tuesday morning.  But that we can deal with 
in time.  What we propose to do is then to issue a 
summons, so that Ms Gigaba is compelled to come and 
give evidence before you.  
 
She of course then will be at liberty to detail 
whatever her concerns are.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We understand that it is obviously 
difficult for you to schedule her evidence immediately as of 
10 
now, but we just do point out that obviously for the purpose 
of the summons, the sooner we get a date the better 
because then we can issue the summons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And I think it will probably be in the 
interest of everyone that her evidence be heard sooner 
than later.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You also know DCJ, that Mr Gigaba 
himself has brought an application during the first instance 
20 
to suppress the evidence of Ms Gigaba.  So when the 
matter is set down again, it may be most practical that Mr 
Gigaba’s application is then heard before Ms Gigaba gives 
evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine.  It is surprising that 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 209 of 249 
 
she made this decision.  She was scheduled to give 
evidence on, I think Friday.  She, we were told I was told 
she was ready to do so via Zoom for, actually from Cape 
Town.  
 
Then I adjourned the hearing of her evidence to this 
afternoon or evening.  So I wonder what it is that could 
have happened in the meantime, but it seems to me that 
you are right in saying that she should give evidence and if 
she has anything to say, she will say it after the summons 
has been issued, and when she hears in response to the 
10 
summons.  
 
So I do authorise that a summons be issued against 
her.  I will give a date to the legal team to insert in the 
summons 
as 
to 
when 
she 
must 
appear 
before 
the 
commission.  So yes, and then with regard to Mr Gigaba’s 
application that will be set down for hearing before the 
commencement of Ms Gigaba’s evidence, on the day that 
she will be required to give evidence.  
 
So let us leave it at that, and we will take it from 
there.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  May we be 
excused? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay, then we can resume 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 210 of 249 
 
with Mr Singh’s evidence.  Have you had a chance to 
sanitise properly?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Our helper ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they go on strike?  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We have an understanding that we will 
try and finish or adjourn at about quarter to six.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So Mr Singh, we unfortunately will 
not be able to finish again today, because we could have 
gone beyond, but everybody thought we would have 
finished earlier which has not happened, and your counsel 
had other commitments and we need to accommodate that 
and another day will be arranged for you to finish. 
MR SINGH:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh, back to Eskom Bundle 18.  
18(B) page 1565.5, paragraph 25.5.  Are you there?   
20 
 
“A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly 
from Johannesburg on 11 June 2015 to Dubai 
and back to Johannesburg on 15 June 2015.  I 
cannot recall who requested the booking.  Mr 
Singh 
was 
issued 
with 
ticket 
number 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 211 of 249 
 
9242812055, see SS17.  The total cost was 
R30 075-00 which was charged to Mr Singh’s 
account, see SS18.  From my recollection ...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Essa’s account.  You said Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, sorry.  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mr Essa’s account.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  “To Mr Essa’s account, see SS18.  
From my recollection I received a call from Mr 
Singh who informed me that a driver would be 
dropping off cash to settle the account.  As per 
10 
Mr Singh’s advice a driver dropped off the 
cash on 13 June 2015.  I attach hereto the 
receipt issues, dated 13 June 2015, see SS19.  
The cash was deposited on 17 June 2015, 
along with other cash on hand, see SS19.1.” 
 
Mr Singh, again do you confirm the trip allegedly 
requested by yourself from Johannesburg to Dubai and 
back from Dubai to Johannesburg on the dates mentioned, 
11 June 2015 to 15 June 2015? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I do confirm.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You confirm making the request for that 
trip? 
MR SINGH:  I do sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  With Travel Excellence? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 212 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The driver? 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You, is it a definite no or you cannot 
recall sending a driver? 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
Mr 
Chair, 
it 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
other 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR SINGH:  There is no recollection.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last time I think you said you do not 
recall having sent a driver, but you know that payment 
came from you? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The same as ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The same as here.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The same as here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess unless there is an issue about 
discrepancy we can move to the next booking. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, at SS18 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  Which is on 1565.29.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  You find the same discrepancy Mr Chair in 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 213 of 249 
 
terms of the invoice.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  In terms of the air fare and the airport taxes 
do not add up to the total.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Singh, can I ask you this?  In so far 
as you confirm the your request, the trips made, the dates 
are correct, the destinations is correct.  Were you invoiced 
by Travel Excellence? 
MR SINGH:  To my recollection, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where are those invoices? 
10 
MR SINGH:  I do not have them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Why? 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are no invoices? 
MR SINGH:  I do not recall.  I do not have record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you do recall that you were 
sent invoices? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, in regard to some ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:  I would have thought all of them Mr Chair, but 
I do not recall them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:  In detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well, you know Mr Seleka, maybe 
Mr Singh could identify in regard to the next paragraph or 
is it only two left, two or three. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 214 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Whether the, his answer in 
regard to this one is the same for the rest, because then it 
was going to be quicker but if it is only two left, then ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  We can do the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can just go through each one of 
them.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So does it mean we will not be 
able to obtain the invoices from you? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  Okay, you can then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Plus proof of payment.  Or receipts from 
you.  You cannot provide that, but you say to the extent 
that you may have paid by EFT, that should be reflected in 
the bank records, but you do not have access to those.  
 
That is what you have said.  If the commission is 
able to get those, you expect that those records will s how 
the payments? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, we said that we will consult with 
counsel. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No, no that is fine.  That is 
fine.  Of course from the commission’s side, it can ask for 
bank records in regard to Travel Excellence in terms of 
what payments were given there. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 215 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which can be identified whether they 
reflect what Ms Suleiman says here.  Okay, alright.  Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now Chair, then we need to go to the 
Transnet bundle because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is a correlation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that is fine.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Transnet Bundle 5(B) page 427, 
paragraph 1.13.7.  That is the last paragraph on the page, 
page 427 Mr Singh.  This relates to return trip to Dubai, 11 
10 
June 2015 to 15 June 2015.  You shared a flight to Dubai 
with 
Mr 
Ashok 
Narayan 
on 
EK764. 
 
The 
following 
individuals were in Dubai during the same period.  
 
Still Narayan ...[indistinct] Mr Singh, you said you 
what did you say about Mr Ashok Narayan, whether or not 
you know him? 
MR SINGH:  I said I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not.  
MR SINGH:  And then there is Suan Dijon.   
MR SINGH:  Do you need me to confirm each one of these 
20 
again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, whether or not you know. 
MR SINGH:  No, I do not.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mark Henry Juan Paul Verasat? 
MR SINGH:  No, I do not.  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 216 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Zitholele Nyangana Absalom Sindi? 
MR SINGH:  No, I do not.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sarushni Pillay? 
MR SINGH:  No, I do not.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Attie Gupta? 
MR SINGH:  I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do know her.  How do you know, is 
it a mister or miss?  
MR SINGH:  It is a Mrs. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, how do you know her? 
10 
MR SINGH:  I think she is the wife to Mr Rajesh Gupta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Rajesh Gupta, the next person? 
MR SINGH:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, so you know both of them.  
Zakiya Ghardia? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Salim Aziz Essa? 
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is pronounced that way, Sanyif 
Kumar. 
20 
MR SINGH:  [indistinct] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, thank you Mr Singh.  Zakharia 
Kasim Vahid? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ashok is already there.  David Clive 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 217 of 249 
 
Hersowich?   
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Veronica Ragavan? 
MR SINGH:  I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Govender.  How do you know her? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, she was either the CEO or had some 
position within Oak Bay Resources or Tegeta at some 
stage.  So I had interactions with her.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have interacted with her? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  What, do you mind telling the 
Chairperson what the purpose was of the interaction? 
MR SINGH:  I was explaining to the Chairperson that if it is 
indeed the same Ms Ragavan who worked at Tegeta or 
either Oak Bay, she was we interacted relating to I think 
the pre-payment for 659. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The 659 payment. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which we will come to when we deal 
with the Tegeta transactions. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Indeed so.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, oh I see.  Then Chair, we go to Mr 
Singh’s affidavit on page 482.  In the same Transnet 
Bundle 5(B).  482, paragraph 63, 64, 65.  
MR SINGH:  The page number again sir?  Page number? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 218 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  482.  So your answer is to, at 
paragraph 1.13.7, return trip to Dubai 11 June 2015 to 15 
June 2015.  Paragraph 63 says: 
 
“I confirm that I travelled to return to Dubai on 
the dates set out above.” 
 
Now again to your earlier explanation, this will be a 
private trip. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  64 says, Mr Singh your private trips, I 
know we have not asked this.  If you are able to tell the 
10 
Chairperson when they are private what is it?  Is it a 
holiday you are taking to Dubai or is it something you 
cannot disclose because it is private and personal? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, at this point I would like to believe 
that they are private and personal.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  64 says: 
 
“I have no knowledge whether the individuals 
listed in this paragraph were in Dubai during 
the period mentioned, since I have not been 
provided with any proof thereof.” 
20 
 
65 says: 
 
“Lastly I take note of the allegation that I 
allegedly share the flight with Ashok Narayan.  
I however deny that I knew that he was on the 
same flight.” 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 219 of 249 
 
 
I see that you do not deny knowing him.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the forensics did not ask for us to 
confirm whether we knew these individuals.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it because you heard my learned 
friend whisper that? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because she just said that now.  You 
are not allowed to testify. 
MR SINGH:  No sir, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She whispered that Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  Chairperson, it was not to 
assist my client.  I mean if Mr Seleka read the notice he 
would have clearly seen that it does not ask do you know 
these people or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I do not think you should 
interfere.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  It was not to interfere 
Chairperson, not at all. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright.  Let us continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Obviously Chair I can 
traverse issues beyond the directive to Mr Singh.  Mr 
Singh, then let us go back to, sorry.  Chair, you do not 
have any question before? 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 220 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you done, are you done with having 
dealt with 22.7? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, we are still ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are at 22.6? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, we are still at, we are just finishing 
22.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let us move on to 22.6 and 22.7 and 
let us finish that part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Singh, back to Ms Suleiman’s 
affidavit.  Paragraph 22.6.  Now: 
10 
“A booking was requested by Mr Singh for Mr 
Singh and partner to fly from Johannesburg on 
15 December 2015 to Dubai and back to 
Johannesburg on 24 December 2015.  Mr 
Singh and his partner were issued with ticket 
numbers 
691663661 
and 
691663662 
respectively see SS20.  The total cost of 
R140 000-00 
was 
charged 
to 
Mr 
Essa’s 
account, see SS21.  From my recollection I 
received a call from Mr Singh who informed me 
20 
that a driver would be dropping off cash to 
settle the account.  As per Mr Singh’s advice, 
the driver dropped off the cash on I attach 
hereto the receipt issued, dated 21 December 
2015, see SS22.  After receipt of the cash, we 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 221 of 249 
 
gave it to a friend of ours who in turn did an 
EFT to the Travel Excellence FNB account in 
an amount of R140 000-00 on 21 December 
2015, see SS23.  We sometimes do this in 
order to avoid having to pay a cash deposit fee 
if we deposited the cash at the bank.” 
Now the same questions follow Mr Singh.  Do you 
confirm your alleged request for yourself and your partner 
to Travel Excellence for the trip on the date 15 December 
2015 to 24 December 2015? 
10 
MR SINGH:  I do so sir.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the place as mentioned, from 
Johannesburg to Dubai and back to Johannesburg? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The amount, hundred and forty 
thousand, do you also confirm it? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, if we have regard to the amount 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or subject to the usual concerns that you 
have raised. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes, Mr Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, and the ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The driver. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The way in which payment was made? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, as before ...[intervenes]  
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 222 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  I do confirm that I made the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You cannot recall how you made the 
payment? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  I confirmed that the payment 
was made by me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that you made the payment, 
what 
you 
cannot 
confirm 
is 
whether 
it 
was 
cash 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or EFT. 
MR SINGH:  Or driver.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Or a driver, did you say or a driver? 
MR SINGH:  Yes, Mr Chair as before yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  There is again in this 
case a correlation in the directive, in the Eskom, Transnet 
Bundle 5(B), page 428.   
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Chair, before we go there.  Are we 
20 
going to deal with the discrepancies on the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The invoice? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I understood you to be saying as 
far as the invoice is concerned, subject to your concern 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 223 of 249 
 
that you have expressed in regard to other bookings, about 
the discrepancy, you had no problem with the amount.  I 
understood you to be saying that. 
MR SINGH:  No, no I am just saying that the amount in this 
case is relatively large. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Relatively? 
MR SINGH:  Large. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Let us, ja let us deal with that.  
Okay, what would you like to say about it? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, if you go again to 1565.32. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  As you will see, as we raised before Mr Chair, 
the airport tax, the air fare seems to be correct when 
cross-referenced 
to 
the 
Serendipity 
invoice 
which 
is 
reflected on 1565.33.  but the airport taxes are completely 
misrepresented and if you then look Mr Chair, the total of 
the Serendipity invoice is in the region of about R95 500-
00.   
 
Yet the amount that is then on the invoice, is 
hundred 
and 
forty 
thousand. 
 
So 
Mr 
Chair, 
these 
20 
discrepancies are rather large.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  And even if I was generous Mr Chair, I would 
not be paying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 224 of 249 
 
MR SINGH:  Such large discrepancies.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:  And Mr Chair, lastly again.  If you add up all 
these numbers that appear on this tax invoice, they 
actually do not come to hundred and forty thousand.  They 
actually come to R146 560, 144 560. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did they give you a discount? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did they give you a discount?  
10 
MR SINGH:   Well it seems like I was overcharged firstly 
and then they decided to give me a discount. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, thank you Chair, and I also see 
that the tax invoice doesn’t only include tickets it also 
includes what appears to be Dubai visas, amounts to 
multiple entry and then the ticketing fee. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.   
MR SINGH:   There’s a correlation again Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry Mr Singh how would you receive 
invoices from Travel Excellence? 
MR SINGH:  I think it was on WhatsApp or some sort of 
communication. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 225 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m on WhatsApp? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or? 
MR SINGH:   I would think it’s WhatsApp, I don’t think – at 
that time I didn’t really maintain an email address or 
private email address but I think it would have been on 
WhatsApp. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I thought the CFO would be fastidious 
about these things? 
MR SINGH:   Well as it relates to my own personal stuff I’m 
10 
not sloppy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m okay what page Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page – Transnet 5(B) page 428. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s Transnet Bundle 5? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 113.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are there, Mr Singh, it relates to a 
trip to Dubai between 15 December 2015 and 24 December 
2015, 
that 
corresponds 
with 
paragraph 
22.6 
in 
Ms 
Suleiman’s affidavit, 
20 
 
“The following individuals were in Dubai during the 
same period, Marc Henry – ja those difficult names, Henry, 
John, Paul …[Indistinct], Zanier Verbeek, do you know that 
person Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   No I do not know anyone of these.

ADV SELEKA SC:   How do you know of him? 
MR SINGH:   Because of all the articles that have been 
written, I don’t have a relationship. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no that’s fine but I just want to 
know how do you know of him? 
MR SINGH:   Because of the media articles. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To what effect? 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the allegations relating to his 
involvement in …[indistinct – dropped voice]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His involvement in Regiments?

MR SINGH:   The allegations relating to Regiments and the 
– I don’t know what you want to call them, the alleged 
relationship that he has with Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You’ve never met him through 
Regiments? 
MR SINGH:   No sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ashu Chala? 
MR SINGH:   No sir, I may have met Mr Ashu at the Gupta

ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so you have been…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know Mr Seleka, Mr Singh if 
necessary can do a supplementary affidavit to say which 
one of these people he knows which ones he doesn’t know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
maybe 
you 
can 
devote 
your 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 231 of 249 
 
questioning to more substantive things. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, oh, sorry but can I follow 
up on this question Chair, which I just had? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Singh you said you might or may 
have met him at the Gupta residence? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that in Saxonwold? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have been there? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A couple of times? 
MR SINGH:   As I’ve testified to the Commission already. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry I didn’t hear the answer. 
MR SINGH:   I said, as I’ve testified to the Commission 
already, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he asked a few times or a number 
20 
of times. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A couple of times.   
CHAIRPERSON:   A couple of times. 
MR SINGH:   Now you ask me to remember my response 
that I gave three or four weeks ago. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 232 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no he’s not asking about the 
response you gave, he says, you said you may have met 
him at the Gupta residence.  So then he asked, oh you’ve 
been there, I think you said yes and then he said a couple 
of times and what’s your answer to that? 
MR SINGH:   Well, if you’re defining a couple as two, then 
no, Mr Chair, it was definitely more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was more than that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and what estimate would you 
10 
give?  
MR SINGH:   I think when we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Over the whole period? 
MR SINGH:  I think when we traversed this the last time, I 
think we spoke about …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Six or eight or ten, no I think you said, 
not more than ten. 
MR SINGH:   I think it was between 10 and 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, now I remember ja.  No, no I’d 
forgotten that you did actually talk about how many times. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I wasn’t – was I here? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughter]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I wasn’t here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was it on Transnet? 
MR SINGH:   It was on Transnet. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 233 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, it was on Transnet ja, so I’m 
sorry Mr Seleka we’re talking about Transnet and you were 
not involved in Transnet. 
MR SINGH:   Well, in all fairness Mr Chair, you also talked 
to me about Eskom and Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no that’s true okay alright, so he 
said under the Transnet work stream he had been to the 
Gupta residence, either he said not more than 10 times or 
maybe around ten times, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, it’s fine, I won’t read the rest of 
10 
the names Mr Singh, if we need to do a supplementary 
affidavit we can do so but I’ll be in touch with your legal 
team.  Then your affidavit is on page 482 at the bottom of 
the page paragraph 66. 
MR SINGH:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   482. 
CHAIRPERSON:   482? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The bottom of the page, paragraph 66. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the - it’s an answer to paragraph 
113.8, return trip to Dubai 15 December 2015 to 24 
December 2015, Mr Singh says, 
“I confirm that I travelled return to Dubai on the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 234 of 249 
 
dates set out above”, 
Mr Singh again it will be for private purpose? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the next page is, 
“I have no knowledge whether the individuals listed 
in this paragraph were in Dubai during the period 
mentioned since I have not been provided with any 
proof thereof”. 
Should we read into that, Mr Singh, that you didn’t meet 
with them in Dubai? 
10 
MR SINGH:   No sir, I confirm that I did not meet with the 
individuals in  Dubai. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry I can’t hear?  
MR SINGH:   I did not meet with any of these individuals. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So even in those occasions when Mr 
Salim Essa is said to have been in Dubai the same time, 
should we read your answer to that, where you say that 
you have no knowledge that they were present there, to 
mean that you did not meet with them? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson I think we’ve reached the 
end of it, paragraph – that was 22.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you were still on 22.6. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja we’re getting to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You still have 22.7. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 235 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That’s correct, that’s Ms Suleiman’s 
affidavit Mr Singh sorry to have to jump between the two 
files. Page 1565.6 paragraph 22.7 reads, 
“A booking was requested for Mr Singh to fly from 
Johannesburg to Dubai on 50524 February 2017 
and back on 27 February 2017, I cannot recall who 
made this request.  Mr Singh was issued with ticket 
number 9150537622CSS24.  We further also booked 
a ticket for Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta (Mr R Gupta) 
for this flight, together with visas for Mr Varun 
10 
Gupta and Mr [indistinct] Singala, the invoice is 
addressed to Mr R Gupta and was charged to 
account number C000349 which was the account 
belonging to Sahara Computers, a Gupta owned 
entity.  The total amount invoiced was R134 560.00 
CSS25.  To the best of my recollection I received a 
call from Ashu Twala who was our contact person at 
Sahara Computers who informed me that a driver 
would be dropping off the money in cash.  This, in 
deed took place seeing as the driver dropped of 
20 
R170 000 in cash shortly thereafter, the difference 
would have been for settlement of outstanding fees 
on their account CSS26.  This cash was again given 
to a friend, who in turn made an EFT payment to 
Travel Excellence FNB account CSS27”. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 236 of 249 
 
I will – for completeness I will read,  
“In the past, we have frequently assisted the 
Guptas with booking flights for themselves or for 
other parties on the request of either the Guptas or 
Mr Essa, then 22.9, it is common for our clients to 
pay cash for their bookings, both Mr Essa and Mr 
Singh frequently sent their drivers to deliver cash 
for their bookings”, 
Mr Singh do you – that 22.7, do you confirm the trip from 
Johannesburg to Dubai on 24 February 2017 to 27 
10 
February 2017? 
MR SINGH:   I do sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do, at your request again? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With Travel Excellence? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And for private purpose? 
MR SINGH:   That’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your – the payment, they say it was 
made by Sahara Computers, did you make the payment 
20 
yourself? 
MR SINGH:   I did sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know of Sahara Computers 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 237 of 249 
 
making this payment as alleged? 
MR SINGH:   No sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know whether – were you 
aware that Mr Rajesh Gupta, together with Mr Varun Gupta 
and Mr Singala were also booked on the same flight? 
MR SINGH:   I don’t think she’s saying that they were 
booked on the same flight, I think she’s just saying that 
visas were arranged. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She says for this one, 
“We further also booked a ticket for Mr Rajesh 
10 
Kumar Gupta for this flight, together with visas for 
Mr Varun Gupta and Mr Singala”, 
Ja, well, maybe we should then just confine ourselves to 
Mr Rajesh Gupta. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I was not – I do not recall Mr Gupta 
being on the flight, I don’t recall seeing him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On that flight? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you recall, how much you paid? 
MR SINGH:   Ah Mr Chair, this is going to be an interesting 
20 
one.  Let’s go to the document…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I don’t think she says you paid 
because she says Sahara Computers made the payment 
and that was a cash payment dropped off by a driver but 
she seems to suggest that the payment for yourself and Mr 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 238 of 249 
 
Rajesh Gupta for the flights and then on the other hand for 
the visas for the two other gentlemen was a collective 
payment made by Sahara Computers. 
MR SINGH:   I think that’s what she’s…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, if we go to the documents at 
1565.37 which is Annexure SS25. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that Mr Singh please? 
MR SINGH:   1565.37. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1565.37? 
10 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SINGH:   And we will also reference 1565.36. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay I’m there.  What points did you 
wish to make about? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think, firstly we – so Mr Chair, I 
have no recollection of this arrangement in terms of Sahara 
paying for my trip, there was no such arrangement that I 
recall.  So, as I’ve stated I paid for my trip, so if you look 
at the 15 – the …[indistinct] invoice which is at 1565.37 it 
20 
is made out to Rajesh Kumar Gupta and it reflects me as a 
passenger which correlates to the tax invoice which is 
basically from Serendipity on 1565.37.  Now, what is 
interesting is that this invoice relates to the Serendipity 
invoice we should have the same configuration of the 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 239 of 249 
 
Serendipity invoice as it was the case with my partner 
when we travelled and the configuration was that her name 
was on the top my name was on the bottom so it was one 
booking with one ticket, I mean, two tickets but one 
booking.  Now you find that in this case, Mr Gupta is not 
reflected on this…[indistinct – dropping voice] which I can 
only assume that he then made his own arrangement and 
there’s another invoice which is obviously not provided by, 
either Serendipity or Travel Excellence, so that’s the first 
point.  Then if you look at the SS26 which is on 1565.38. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, on Ms Osmond’s – on Ms 
Suleiman’s version he agrees that it is Sahara that paid, he 
received the cash from ….[indistinct – dropped voice] yet 
the receipt is made out to Mr Singh, so I don’t understand. 
If anything, Mr Chair, that should have been made out to 
Sahara Computers or in the name of Mr Rajesh Kumar 
Gupta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, there is a correlation 
again, Chairperson, in Transnet. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Bundle 5(B) page 428, Mr Singh, 
paragraph 1.13.9. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   428. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 240 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What’s the paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1.13.9, the second last paragraph, 
return trip to Dubai between 24 February 2017 and 27 
February 2017, that’s one and then the second part of it 
you shared both flights to and from Dubai with Mr Rajesh 
Kumar Gupta on flight EK762 and EK761, you have said 
you were not aware of him? 
MR SINGH:   No sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Your response to this is on page 483 of 
the same Transnet Bundle 5 (B). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   483? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   483 paragraph 68, 69 and 70, it’s an 
answer 
to 
paragraph1.13.9 
return 
trip 
to 
Dubai, 
24 
February 2017 to 27 February 2017, paragraph 68 reads, 
“The content of this paragraph is denied.  I 
specifically deny the allegation that I travelled 
return to Dubai between 24 February 2017 to 27 
February 2017”, 
 
Now – okay Mr Singh I’m not appreciating, yet, your 
denial 
so 
you 
will 
help 
me 
understand 
20 
because…[intervenes]. 
MR SINGH:   In terms of the content of the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No let him finish, Mr Singh 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because the allegation in Ms Suleiman 
affidavit, paragraph 22.7 I thought is to the same effect of 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 241 of 249 
 
your – it’s not? 
MR SINGH:   Not technically. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, you can explain the difference 
because you admit Ms Suleiman’s allegation…[intervenes]. 
MR SINGH:   So, if you look Mr Chair at 428, I’m on the 
right page right, 428? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   428 yes, 1.13.9. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, if you look at 428, Mr Chair, 1.13.9 it 
says, according to the 10(6) notice, return trip to Dubai 
between those dates, 24 and 27. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, in actual fact the – again as in 
the case of Hong Kong, I was transiting through Dubai, so 
the actual flight destination was actually South Africa, 
Dubai, Deli.  So the 10(6) the first return trip to Dubai was 
not a return trip it was a return trip to Deli, so that’s what 
we…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you compare this with Ms 
Suleiman’s paragraph 22.7 because I know you accept that 
one, you admit that one but I just need to understand what 
20 
is different – what is the difference between the two 
because she also says a booking was requested for Mr 
Singh to fly from Johannesburg to Dubai on 24 February 
2017 and back on 27 February 2017.  I cannot recall who 
made this request, Mr Singh was issued with a ticket.  So, 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 242 of 249 
 
that part you have said that it is correct and I thought it is 
the same as …[intervenes]. 
MR SINGH:   Okay maybe I should have then said, it’s not 
technically correct because the Serendipity does refer to a 
date if I can get to it, I think it’s 1565 …[indistinct – 
dropping voice]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You want the ticket, SS24? 
MR SINGH:  SS24.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is on page 1564.36. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, and you’ll see there, Mr Chair, it 
10 
basically says Joburg, Dubai, Deli, Dubai, Joburg, so 
maybe 
I 
should 
have 
also, 
when 
you 
led 
paragraph…[indistinct – dropped voice]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So are you saying the omission of Deli 
is what you’re trying to correct? 
MR SINGH:   Well, let’s understand, when you led 22.7 you 
asked me if I agree that the tickets were issued. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No that was a trip on those dates 24 to 
27 February from Johannesburg to Dubai and back from 
Dubai to Johannesburg. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Okay, so maybe I should have said, 
technically, it was actually to – includes Deli as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so it’s correct – what is it, it’s 
correct, save that you need to add Deli to it? 
MR SINGH:   [Inaudible 27.08]. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 243 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay but is it the same as the 10.6 
directive? 
MR SINGH:   The reason why we deny the 10.6 directive 
was because we thought they were specifically referring to 
flights that only happened between – it says return trip 
from Dubai to – I mean between these with a return trip so 
we actually said, no it’s not a return trip from Dubai only, it 
also included a leg to Deli and we make the point that we 
actually didn’t spend any time in Dubai, it was in transit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which, I suppose insofar as the 
10 
qualification is made in regard to Ms Suleiman’s affidavit 
add Deli, accept the rest but you need to add Deli, I think, 
nothing further turns on that. 
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, it’s just the issue of payment, of 
course which is the one lingering issue. 
MR SINGH:   [Inaudible 28.16]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the sense that she says there was a 
global payment of R170 000 from Sahara Computers, you 
say you paid for yourself. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And  then whether you were with Mr 
Rajesh Gupta on the flight, you say – what do you say, 
you’re not aware of that or you deny that? 
MR SINGH:   I did not see him on the flight. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 244 of 249 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you didn’t see him.  Chairperson 
that is on the travel.  Can you recall how did you pay for 
this flight, Mr Singh, for this trip? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, if you look at the amount, it’s 
around R60 000, I assume it was in and around that 
amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Raise your voice please? 
MR SINGH:    I’m sorry Mr Chair, I’m saying if we have 
reference to the Serendipity invoice it was around R60 000 
so I assume it will be in that region. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but how did you pay, can you 
recall, or you wouldn’t, driver drop off cash, EFT? 
MR SINGH:   I’d be speculating that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, now, Mr Singh, looking at this 
evidence or affidavit of Ms Suleiman that it was Mr Salim 
Essa who introduced you to them, you say you can’t recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I think he did not say it. 
MR SINGH:  I denied it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not say he did not recall, it he 
20 
denied it. 
MR SINGH:  Denied. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh you denied it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Oh then that will make me ask you 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 245 of 249 
 
a different question.  Chair I see the time, 5:44. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well let me ask this question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you noted Mr Singh that in her 
affidavit about these bookings Ms Suleiman at one time says 
she one time says you made the request for the booking.  
Other – on other times she says she cannot recall who made 
the requests. You note that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And sometimes she says you made 
10 
payment by way of arranging for a driver to drop off cash.  
You have noted that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And sometimes she says Mr Essa made 
payment to settle your account. Maybe just once I do not 
know whether it is more than once but sometimes she says 
so.  Do you recall that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and she says I think all the time 
these bookings they linked them – them to Mr Salim Essa’s 
20 
account for the reason that she gave that they regarded him 
as the “Guarantor” in quotes.  Now you are not suggesting 
are you that where she says Mr Salim Essa made the 
payments in regard to your account your bookings or trips 
that she is deliberately and falsely getting Mr Essa to be 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 246 of 249 
 
involved in regard to your trips but you are saying she may 
be mistaken or are you saying no she is just fabricating?  Or 
you saying no I am not saying she is fabricating I think she 
is genuinely mistaken? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair in terms of the overall concluding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Remarks that I wanted to start with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:  You would see that the discrepancies that I 
have highlighted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Throughout all of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Indicate that maybe Travel Excellence’s 
accounting records their books of account and the like is not 
exactly one hundred percent.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR SINGH:  Which may lead one to conclude that it is a 
fabrication in terms of the documents that we have now 
seen.  Because there is one document that I recall now Mr 
20 
Chair that I would just like to highlight.  Just one point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  And then I will move on Mr Chair.  Which is 
fairly a small thing but it is – to me it is a bit of – it is a 
significant matter.  If you – if you look at 1565.37. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 247 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H'm 
MR SINGH:  Which is the – the invoice that relates to Mr 
Rajesh 
Kumar 
Gupta 
which 
is 
the 
last 
invoice 
for 
R134 560.00 you will notice Mr Chair in the centre of the 
invoice at the bottom there is a date of 28 November 2018 
which is the day before the commissioning of this affidavit.  
So again Mr Chair I am as you said before we do not know 
the relevance of this date but it begs the question when was 
this invoice generated?  And on what basis and how?  So on 
one hand Mr Chair I am – if I had to give the benefit of the 
10 
doubt to Ms Suleiman I would say this is just very bad 
accounting and record keeping and admin and if that is the 
case then Mr Chair if you look at the – the theme it may be 
that she – because on her version she allocated me to Mr 
Essa’s account then the receipts that she got she issued 
receipts with reference to Mr Essa.  So that could be one 
version or explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  And then on the extreme side you could then 
say given this evasiveness of this irregular discrepancies it 
20 
could be that – that it is a fabrication because as I said 
before Mr Chair it is – it is convenient for a bank statement 
to reflect a R170 000.00 then to – for you to say I received 
R170 000.00 in cash and then you have an invoice that has 
significant discrepancies that add up to R170 000.00. 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 248 of 249 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  And your source documents do not tie them – 
tie up to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:   So that is the summary I would make Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  We need to stop 
because our counsel needs to go and we did agree that in 
order to stop but I just want to say that it will be a – or let 
me put it this way.  To the extent that you made payments to 
Travel Excellence you would have made those payments if it 
10 
was EFT or other than cash you would have made those 
payments to whatever account number they would have 
given you, is that right? 
MR SINGH:  I would think so yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And if it was cash you would 
have given them cash and they would have deposited 
themselves. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To whatever account.  Okay.  So I think 
that the legal team and investigation team need to make 
20 
arrangements for Travel Agents – Travel Excellence bank 
accounts to check whether there were payments from Mr 
Singh in regard to any of these so that if there is proof that 
payments were made we can know payments were made 
from his account.  Obviously those that 00:08:14 of cash that 
13 APRIL 2021 – DAY 373 
 
Page 249 of 249 
 
is different.  But we must establish which ones if any reflect 
payments that were made through EFT or what okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  I think we must stop here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then maybe on the day when Mr Singh  
comes back to the extent that there is something to wrap up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On this we will wrap up and then move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much to everybody 
we are going to adjourn for the day.  For the benefit of the 
public tomorrow I am hearing the evidence of Mr Gwede 
Mantashe testifying on behalf of the ANC in regard to 
Parliamentary Oversight and the issue of deployment and 
other matters.  But basically it will be about Parliamentary 
Oversight 
and 
deployment 
because 
the 
President 
will 
towards the end of the month testify in relation to the ANC.  
20 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 14 APRIL 2021
