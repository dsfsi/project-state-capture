ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are you ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes I am ready.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  
Mr Chairman we have placed before you the files marked CC20 and 
CC24 and this morning we would turn to EXHIBIT CC24 and I have 
asked the Registrar to place before you Chair the statement of 
10 
Dr Fhatuwani Lastborn Mutuvhi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Doctor? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Dr Fhatuwani Lastborn Mutuvhi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  No I did not hear you say the 
surname.  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The surname.  Oh, I beg your pardon yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I was wondering whether … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Lastborn is the surname. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Fhatuwani is the surname. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know sometimes people start with the surname 
when they write … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  People’s names. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 3 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Than you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Chairman this witness - may I just 
bring to your attention that this witness is going to come back again for 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For this reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Today what he is going to do he is going 
10 
to simply lay out the project as that DDT Project that Ms Mokhobo 
mentioned when she testified.  Then we will interpose witnesses that 
are going to deal partly with the implementation of that program and 
what exactly was done on the ground in that program and then this 
witness is going to come back because then there was an - an 
investigation done by Treasury and he is going to be talking - although 
he was not part of the investigation but he represents the department. 
He will talk to that and that - those are the big files that I 
mentioned to you Chair last night which have not come to hand.  They 
are with us as - as - they have not brought - been brought to - to you 
20 
yet … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because of the magnitude … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of documentation that is involved in there. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 4 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For that reason then we decided that for 
now he must come and introduce the project because he as the Project 
Manager … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And tell the Chairperson how many phases 
was it supposed to go … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And what were the critical areas that were 
going to be focused on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  Before we proceed I - I was 
looking at the list of witnesses in regard to the SABC eight. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in - I was looking at the whole list … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I was more interested in terms of the SABC eight. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now of course I do not remember each and every 
20 
member of the SABC eight … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the media … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time of the incidents but you have already 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 5 of 92 
 
called I think three (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Three for now, yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I - there might be no need obviously to call each 
and every one of them … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they are covering the same thing … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not remember seeing Mr Vuyo Mvoko’s name. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did I miss it?  Is it there? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No it is not there yet Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But we could … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The investigators they had updated us on  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On the coordination of their … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Evidence but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To the extent that Chair feels you would 
like him specifically … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That - that is something that they would be 
attending to, yes. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 6 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I think it would - I think it would be good 
because from what I think Ms Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki said … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His case seems to have ended up being different from 
… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Others in the sense that the others were reinstated … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When they were all dismissed at the same time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand the positon for … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same reasons. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were reinstated but he was not … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For certain reasons and Ms Gqubule-Mbeki was 
saying that you know he suffered … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The most, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quite a lot for two years without a job. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that - that maybe important.  I am interested in 
hearing how … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  How that affected him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that is - that is very different from the other 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 7 of 92 
 
seven. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I would like to - I would like that he be approached 
to see whether he could want to share with the Commission … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His perspectives and how the dismissal affected him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Affected him? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That - that will be done.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and it would be interesting also to see whether to 
the extent that there may have been any cost orders that were granted 
in favour of the SABC again him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether the SABC enforced those cost orders … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that kind of thing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  We will look into … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That, yes. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 8 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other part which I thought of was also that we - 
we did not deal with the - what version was put up by the SABC before 
the Labour Court in opposing the challenge by the SABC eight of their 
dismissal.  What version did they put up about the reasons for 
dismissals and obviously the court judgment is there … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And one can read it but it would be good even for the 
public if we could connect … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That - that version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That by saying this is what the court ultimately find … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If for example it rejected their version … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or it said that is not a constitutionally acceptable you 
know reason … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For dismissing people.  It would be good to connect 
all of that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair may then EXHIBIT 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 9 of 92 
 
CC24 be - be admitted as an exhibit and that then if the Chair is 
satisfied that the witness be sworn in.  Oh, I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did we …? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We did - we did Chair.  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, then that is what I was thinking. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ms - I have just been reminded that we did 
admit it.  I beg your pardon … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because it contains the statements of the 
previous witnesses.  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what - what I was thinking is whether we did 
not decide that it would be the lever arch file that would be exhibit so 
and so and in that file there would be … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Numerous … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So many statements … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they would not have their own … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Exhibits? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Separate exhibit numbers. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Chair but we - when - well what we 
20 
did I think some of those statements were identified and put in as 
individual exhibit numbers like yesterday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But I think it is - it is simply the question 
of packaging because these are in one lever arch file … 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 10 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But if they are packaged separately in the 
- in the presentation files then they get admitted separately as those 
exhibits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We did discuss it.  What I am not sure is what we 
agreed upon.  I think at some stage I may have said something like 
okay it is fine … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not - I cannot remember because you know 
on the outside you have got EXHIBIT Cc20? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So unless - unless I did say EXHIBIT CC20 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To 24.  I think that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is how I remember it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If one says EXHIBIT CC20 to EXHIBIT CC24.  It is not 
- it is not the file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The - the file itself, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the individual statements … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Statements.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Inside. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe - maybe it is safer Chair to 
just identify the statement and admit that statement as exhibit for 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 11 of 92 
 
consistency sake … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I just want us not to get confused or anybody 
later on who has to go through this … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which one was 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Getting confused. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean what is clear is that on the spine of the lever 
arch file it is clear that - well maybe it should say exhibits. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  EXHIBIT CC20 to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe - ja - or should we leave it as it is and if we 
10 
decide to change it we will do that later? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  If - if this is  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the others we have gone … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We have indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In a certain way. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Included the file itself, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and we have admitted it anyway. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  It is just that as you ask questions if you 
talk about - if you refer to EXHIBIT 24 that anyone who has been 
following or reads the transcript might think if they go to look at the file 
- lever arch files they will find … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It would only have 24 and you will not 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 12 of 92 
 
have 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes) inside. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe let us proceed then.  We must just think 
about how to make sure there is no confusion. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  May the witness then be 
10 
- be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Fhatuwani Lastborn Mutuvhi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection with taking the prescribed 
oath? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  So help me God. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  (duly sworn, states) 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 13 of 92

and it is under divider number 24 and it is marked at page 1 of that 
document.  Is it in front of you? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  (No audible reply). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is marked statement. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  (Inaudible). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you please go to page 23 of that 
10 
document? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  20? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2-3 - 23.  Oh, your mic is off.  I beg your 
pardon.  Sorry.  You will have to start afresh, sorry.  Thank you. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Page 23? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Page 1 - let us start with page 1 
because that was not recorded. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is a document that is marked 
statement on page 1.  Is that correct? 
20 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And at page 23 of that document there is a 
signature and is that your signature and are those your names?

6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 15 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think - I think this one strikes a (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  A (intervenes).  Not mentioning Matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Starting at the bottom and going up … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And start - or starting up going down. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and - and how many years have 
you been with the department? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  I joined the department in 
10 
October 2014. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2014? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay and before that have you had any 
experience at all in Project Management? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes.  My whole life I have 
been - I have been in the Project Management environment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and where - did you - with - operate 
within the Project management Space within any of the SOEs of 
Government or outside or in the private sector? 
20 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes.  I worked for Telkom at 
middle management and senior management level responsible for 
strategic projects in the - in the company. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  In paragraph 4 you deal with your 
appointment as a Project Manager.  What were you appointed to 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 16 of 92 
 
manage at that point? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  I was appointed to manage the 
- the Digital Migration Project. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI: 
 
The 
project 
I 
am 
still 
responsible for at the moment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just explain to the 
Chairperson what this project was - was about? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The - the main objective of the 
project is to release the spectrum through migration of television 
10 
owning households that are currently viewing on analogue platform.  
That is the - the main objective of the - of the project. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  In simple terms what does that 
mean? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  That current - the - the current 
broadcast on analogue platform it is more costly in terms of the - the 
bandwidth.  It utilises more bandwidth.  So migrating from analogue to 
digital platform will enable the broadcaster to - broadcasters to have an 
opportunity to launch more channels.  For an example Chair where 
SABC’s current - SABC 1 is currently broadcasting. 
20 
Post migration when the spectrum is released SABC 1 
Channel can have opportunity to broadcast between eight and 14 
channels. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So - and then how does that benefit 
the public or the various households? 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 17 of 92 
 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The - the households benefits 
as - as demonstrated in what has happened so far Chair is that the - in 
- in a digital platform we - we currently even have more channels.  We 
have SABC 1, two, three, SABC News, SABC Sport and parliamentary 
channel on the digital platform.  Whereas on the analogue platform 
those - those channels are not there. 
It is because of the indication I have made earlier that in a 
digital bandwidth it is low and it accommodates more channels to be 
broadcasted on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
10 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  So communities and public 
will have more channels on digital platform that will also enable the - 
the - again Chair it is the quality that we have on the analogue - on the 
digital platform than the one that we have on the - on the digital - 
digital platform. 
If you take the - the analogue television set now and - and 
compare with the one that we are viewing on the digital platform we - it 
- it looks - the digital platform looks like the one that I am face - I am 
facing now but on the analogue platform it has those invisible - some 
other times you will have a demonstration of somebody coming with an 
20 
aerial - a bunny aerial you know. 
You can stand there.  So those are some of the - of the 
benefits that communities who have already migrated are benefitting at 
the moment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 18 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think you assume that some of us are not 
familiar with what you are talking about.  I do not know that when one 
of the cases came before court one read quite a lot in the papers about 
this whole project but that was sometime back but it seems that the 
project had to do with analogue and digital, okay.  I think you must take 
us from the beginning to say analogue refers to this. 
Digital refers to this.  The disadvantages about analogue are 
the following.  The advantages of digital are the following and I am 
saying that because I know that down the line … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will be needing to look at that but it will just be 
helpful to me.  You might not need to go into great detail at this stage 
but it would be helpful if you are able to just give me those features as 
we - so that as we go - go along one keeps that in mind. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Thank you Chair.  Just in - in 
short and at high level the analogue - both analogue and digital 
broadcast utilises the transmitters which are known as aerials. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aerials? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Aerials. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Aerial. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The - the - not necessary 
aerials.  Transmitters I wanted to say. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 19 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh transmitters, ja. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The - the transmitters at the 
towers.  They are known - well known as towers.  However the - the 
analogue platform as I have indicated earlier consumes more bandwidth 
because of the technology it - it utilises.  The digital - on the digital the 
very same transmitted are configured with a technology that is digital. 
That is converted to a television broadcast through a 
decoder.  Although the technology is advanced to make use of the 
integrated decoder that is built inside a television set.  So the - the 
disadvantage of analogue broadcast is the making use of more 
10 
bandwidth but on digital the - the advantage of digital platform it is low 
bandwidth that enables more channels to be broadcasted in the - in the 
same chunk of - of spectrum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In lay terms what is - what is bandwidth that digital - 
analogue consumes more of and digital less of? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Chair I might not be able to - 
to give the - the quantity of - of bandwidth that - that analogue … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I am just talking about what it is.  It is something 
20 
that does what or …? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The bandwidth refers to the 
airwaves … 
CHAIRPESON:  Oh. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  That communicate to the … 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 20 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That are - that are needed in order to broadcast. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  In order to broadcast the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Analogue - the analogue platform as you call it … 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  (Intervenes) more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Consumes a lot of that? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the digital consumes less? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Digital consumes less, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that - that affects the issue of costs? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  So, 
then as you - then you deal with what is it that you were suppose - you 
20 
deal with your team and you deal with how you were going to set up 
this project as a Project Manager.  You could just roughly at the time 
and as you were appointed to project manager the - the program just 
highlight to the Chairperson what were the immediate challenges that 
you were facing roughly as you deal with them. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 21 of 92 
 
I see you mention the officials that you worked with.  They 
are contained in your statement and your team as a whole but basically 
then where are the challenges that you had to - to contend with at that 
point? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Chair at the time of my 
appointment in - in 2014 I was briefed that the - the project is behind 
schedule given the imminent international telecommunications deadline 
- union deadline of 17 June 2015 and by that time I was briefed that I 
needed to initial proper coordination of role playing entities to ensure 
that we - we try to meet the deadlines and the - the entities are 
10 
presented - that are playing a role are on the - on the document that 
was not submitted on there … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  But I have made it - made it 
available this morning. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Might I just beg 
leave to just hand up this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For administration purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  So mainly it was ensure that 
the - the roles that the different entities are playing are well 
coordinated to ensure a smooth delivery of - of the - of the project. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So you do have - doctor? 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 22 of 92 
 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh you do.  Yes, thank you.  Could you 
just take the Chairperson through this diagram that you have given us?  
What - what is this document? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  This is a - Chair this is a - an 
ecosystem that we - we developed to guide the implementation process 
of the program identifying individual roles and responsibilities for 
different 
entities. 
 
This 
includes 
the 
department, 
Independent 
Communication of Authority, South African Bureau of Standards, 
SENTECH as signal distributor. 
10 
The role of department that we - we engaged on to harmonise 
frequency spectrum potential interference.  The procurement of - of the 
decoders I spoke about earlier - the - which was done by USAASA.  The 
role of department to raise - to ensure raising awareness and education 
to the public so that it can entice people to take up the - the digital 
decoders.  The role of SAPO to distribute and - and register indigence 
who qualify for Government subsidy to - to be migrated and the 
broadcasters to provide content. 
As I have indicated in the digital platform Chair we have more 
channels than the ones that are on the analogue platform including 
20 
other broadcasters.  ETV, SABC and community television and to 
ensure that there is a process of switching off those analogue 
transmitters that are currently operational. 
I - I will speak later Chair that we have demonstrated that in 
area where we have switched off we have migrated all - all people - we 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 23 of 92 
 
have switched off those analogue transmission services and once we - 
we are done with the roll out of this program all analogue transmission 
services have been switched off there is going to be a frequency risk 
taking - risk taking and then the release of the digital dividend which is 
the spectrum.  Much needed for the - for the telecommunication 
services. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then you have just 
highlighted the role players in that whole process … 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who was going to deal - you were the 
10 
Project Manager but you were not going to deal with procurement 
matters.  Am I correct? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, correct. 
A0DV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Who - which entity was designed or 
was 
allocated 
that 
- 
that 
mandate 
to 
actually 
procure 
the 
implementation of the - of - of - the stakeholders of the implementation 
of that program? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  It is the Universal Service and 
Agency of South Africa, USAASA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you deal with that at page 6 of 
20 
your statement.  Am I right? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have already spoken about the post 
office and its role … 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 24 of 92 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And - and is it also correct that when you 
say the post office was going to attend to warehousing so what it 
means is that they were going to be responsible for the warehousing of 
these decoders? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The ideal situation Chair is 
that the - the decoders were going to be made available to SAPO for 
distribution immediately … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  A - and not to be warehoused 
because obviously that would - would incur costs. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes.  So the critical role of 
SAPO was to ensure that the - the decoders ordered are taken to post 
office branches where indigence will be able to either collect or they 
will be distributed in those - in those (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In those (intervenes), yes.  The one thing 
that you have not mentioned highlighted there is the South African 
Bureau of Standards.  That it is something that you also had to look 
into.  You deal with that at page 5 just paragraphs 27 to 29.  Could you 
just explain to the Chair why that was important? 
20 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Chair I should indicate that by 
the time of my appointment the standards were - were already done in 
2012.  Mine was to confirm in April which - which was done in April that 
the standards are - are still relevant. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 25 of 92 
 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  In compliance with the policy 
directive. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To make sure that the decoders that 
people are given are … 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI: 
 
Are 
complying 
with 
(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are complaint? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Standards public, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then - now you are the 
Project Manager.  You had to come up with your plan and according to 
10 
your statement you had a three phase plan. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just take the Chair to the 
first plan - first phase of your plan? 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Thank you Chair.  The - given 
the - the challenge - the challenge at the time the imminent 20 - 
June 2015.  There - there were risks that if we do not complete the 
project at that part - at - on - on the date of - of June there were 
20 
potential - there was going to be a potential interference of spectrum 
with the neighbouring countries and we - we embarked on bilateral 
engagements. 
Something I will talk to in this - in this discussion but the first 
one for the program was to ensure that we address the requirements of 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 26 of 92 
 
Astronomy Geographic Advantage Act of 2007 relating to the km² area.  
That is the area Chair that I have indicated that due to - to the 
implementation of this plan we managed to relief those areas by 
connecting all individuals or telephone owning households in the area 
and we have managed to switch off about 17 transmitters. 
So everybody who is within the km² in the Northern Cape are 
viewing television broadcasts on digital platform.  The Phase 2 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Before you move on.  Does that 
mean that they do not need DSTV or they still need DSTV to access 
certain channels? 
10 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Maybe I shall indicate that the 
- we have two different types of - of decoders. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The one that connects through 
towers or transmitters that we have - that - that have been configured 
by SENTECH across the country and we have the digital platform which 
connects via satellite. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  So in - in that - in that area 
because of the potential and interference we connected them via 
20 
satellite decoders. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR FHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay and then … 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The second phase was to 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 27 of 92 
 
address borderline areas. Due to the potential interference we found it 
important to concentrate on the borderline areas. So, that if for an 
example Lesotho want to launch their telecommunication services, they 
don’t interfere with borders of Ladybrand and those towns that are. 
Because if that happens post June 2017 we were not protected. 
Countries like Lesotho can tell us to switch off those broadcasting 
services which will have disadvantage or which had potential to 
disadvantage or community in broadcasting. So, the second phase was 
to target those towns or provinces along the towns that are situated 
along the borders. And the third phase was to concentrate on Gauteng 
10 
and Western Cape where there are no potential interference. That was 
the rationale behind the planning of this program. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. In the following paragraphs you deal 
with various challenges where ETV had launched a legal challenge 
dealing with the septal boxes’ encryption. And you deal also with the 
Constitutional Court decision at paragraph 41. But I would like to take 
you to what you say in paragraph 42.3 at page 9 because it relates to 
progress. Am I correct? The progress in terms of the planning and 
coordination that you embarked upon and execution. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Could you just tell the Chairperson 
what you want to convey there? I know that you’ve mentioned that 
certain areas have already migrated but can you just tell the Chair and 
what do you want to convey in that paragraph? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Chair, due to the Court 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 28 of 92 
 
challenges highlighted in the statement there were some delays that we 
experienced until the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of the 
Minister in that regard to be the right, to have followed the right 
process in the development of the policy. Then by the time we already 
had a challenge of having decoders stored in the SAPO warehouse and 
we had to re-plan the process. Maybe the other issue that also 
contributed to that not only the policy was that there were shortages of 
the direct to home. Direct to home, Chair I refer to the satellite-
oriented decoders. There were shortages of those. To give a typical 
example, in Johannesburg… (indistinct) it could be one area served by 
10 
one tower. In areas where the household is sitting below a mountain or 
an escapement, they cannot receive terrestrial network services from 
the tower. So, those ones require direct to home decoder. At that time, 
we had shortages of those decoders and we could not efficiently 
continue. A typical example here Chair is that if I connect, if we 
connect a household along one street and the other one could not 
receive it could cause a social challenge. And consequently, we had to 
now re-plan to look into areas or provinces which are flat terrain where 
we can be able to distribute these terrestrial decoders and we 
identified Free State as one. So, the first phase on the re-planning was 
20 
to look at in the short term to deploy those decoders that are sitting so 
that we can free the cost at SAPO warehouse while benefiting the 
communities. The second phase was to look into the procurement or the 
supply of the direct to home decoders so that we can connect those 
pockets of those areas where people have registered and we could not. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 29 of 92 
 
And the third phase was to look at the procurement of the remainder of 
the households to benefit from the government subsidy. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. So, then that the procurement is the 
aspect that you’ve already spoken about that USAASA was tasked to do 
that? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes Chair, USAASA is 
responsible for the procurement and I think their best place to do with 
issues of procurement in this regard. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but in paragraph 56 page 13 you deal 
with lack of transparency in that process, the procurement process in 
10 
paragraph 56 of your statement. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes Chair, as the department 
responsible for the coordination of this programs, this program all 
entities should be reporting to the department in order for us to 
properly plan and ensure smooth coordination and execution of the 
program. So, in this regard there were areas of lack of transparency 
with regard to the issues of procurement which are very key, which 
were very key to the program. Because I should, as the department we 
should be able to know when are we expecting devices to be and what 
numbers so that when we plan, we target specific areas knowing that 
20 
we will have sufficient number of decoders and stock to deploy.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So, which is a question that in 
consultation I asked whether if I were to ask you now as a department, 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 30 of 92 
 
how far is implementation? And it’s a question that you are not able to 
answer because you said they were not reporting directly to the 
department. Is that correct? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes Chair, with respect to the 
procurement won’t be able to give details. I think USAASA can provide 
much details but the impact on the delivery of decoders is on the 
rollout of the program. Due to the lack of those decoders we are unable 
to continue with the rollout of those decoders to the deserving 
indigence from the government point of view. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that is what you demonstrate under 
10 
paragraph 78. Am I correct? The table that you’ve put up there. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, those are some of the 
challenges but this table 78 deals with a number of challenges. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then, can you just highlight them for 
the Chairperson? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  The first challenge talk to the 
issues of funding. The project is not sufficiently funded. I should 
indicate that and I have indicated on this statement that by the time of 
20 
the handover of this project the department only had R1 million 
appropriated to deliver this project. And as the department we are 
responsible for ensuring that there’s awareness campaign and 
communication to inform the public and raise awareness. So, that R1 
million was a very limited budget. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 31 of 92 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR 
PHATUWANI 
LASTBORN 
MUTUVHI: 
 
However, 
Chair… 
(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the R1 million just for the awareness campaign? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  It was mainly to run the 
project of, the project management office and awareness campaign and 
all other goods and services for the program. So, I want to demonstrate 
that the project is not sufficiently funded to take care of all the aspects 
of the program. In this regard I indicate the issues of the decoders 
because the decoders procured as per the information from the entity 
10 
responsible is 1.5 million and at the time, we projected 5 million or 
estimated 5 million indigent households to be serviced by government. 
The issues of distribution impacted. I speak about issues of public 
awareness and education campaign. There is a need for a call centre 
so that people in every corner of the country when they have problem 
with this decoder or want to understand something about the program, 
they are able to call. I have this technical challenge, I have this, I want 
to understand what this whole program is all about. There is dual 
illumination cost. Currently, Sentec is running a dual network which is 
the digital and analogue which is costly for the government. And I 
20 
speak about content which is what SABC is currently providing in terms 
of additional channels like I’ve spoken about. The second issue but 
however, maybe I should indicate that those are the impacts. The 
impact of the lack of funding relates to the delays in the rollout of the 
program. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 32 of 92 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  And therefore, we cannot 
switch off analogue transmission services leading to Sentec continue 
running to network. The registration uptake due to the lack of 
awareness campaign it’s low. Inadequate reach of messaging to the 
public, lack of availability of septal boxes to the retail market. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Can I just take you before you move 
on, on that to page 21 of your statement where you give the figures 
throughout the country? You give, you highlight the summary of 
registrations and installation statistics. 
10 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just take the Chair through 
that? Because he talks to the slow pace of rollout, yes. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, Chair since we started 
with the registration process in October 2015, we have so far from the 
estimation of 5 million indigent household registered only 1.06 million 
as demonstrated on the table there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Out of the ones that we have 
registered we have only connected 511,000. So, half of the and this is 
20 
due to the lack of direct to home decoders as I’ve indicated. However, 
the document or this statement talks about the current absence of 
installers who should be installing these decoders because of the 
expiry of the contract in January 2019. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then lastly then because of these 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 33 of 92 
 
matters that you had raised around procurement there was an 
investigation. Is that correct? By Price Water House. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes Chair, in the paragraph… 
(intervention). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think it’s paragraph 56 that you’ve 
already spoken to. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, there was investigation of 
which because of not being involved there was an investigation which 
was requested by the office of the acting director general then. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and National Treasury was involved 
10 
in that? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, it was requested in the 
office of the National Treasury. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, these are matters that related to how 
procurement was sourced and who benefited but those are matters that 
are beyond your knowledge. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will deal with them next week. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, Chair. Those are matters 
that I think require USAASA to outline. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. And then lastly, if you just in 
your conclusion you reemphasize the point of lack of resources as 
being a challenge. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, Chair. The project of this 
magnitude requires resources; financial and human resources. And 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 34 of 92 
 
even now as we speak, we are not sufficiently funded to deliver the 
program; the awareness campaign I’m talking about. Although, this year 
we have a budget better than other years but we need to raise 
awareness campaigns across the country so that we fast-track this 
process of migration. By enticing the community to take up the 
services. Human element as well. We are currently, if not mistaken I 
think we are because we have requested some officials from other 
divisions within the department. We might be having a team of about 11 
people who are expected to roll out this program across the country. 
So, that is one of the challenges that we currently have. The second 
10 
issue in conclusion, in the conclusion statement is that much as we are 
the responsible department for the rollout of this process, we do not 
have control over or we cannot play an effective and efficient oversight 
to the entities that are playing role in the process. And it will be ideal, 
it is ideal to have these entities reporting and accounting fully to the 
department so that even the department is able to take decisions that 
assist the process of the program. And I think those are some of the 
issues that I have raised in the conclusion of this but we require 
resources and there is a need for full control of the department to the 
rollout process. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. And then when you come 
back then we are going to deal with the nitty-gritty’s that relates to the 
procurement processes according to the report that you are going to be 
presenting when you come back to the Commission. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes, Chair. As I’ve indicated 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 35 of 92 
 
on this discussion now is that and reported, the procurement matters 
can be well-placed and responded to by the responsible entity because 
the department was not necessarily involved in the procurement 
process. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you Chair. That 
is the evidence from the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you. You complain that there is no 
sufficient funding for this project. Is there a commitment on the part of 
your, a sufficient commitment on the part of your department and the 
government to this project given how long it’s been on the table? My 
10 
recollection from the affidavits that I read when the matter relating to 
this project came to the Constitutional Court is that it had started. Are 
you looking for a pen? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will somebody help him with a pen? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, with a pen. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  I got it thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you have got it?   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My recollection which might not be accurate. My 
20 
recollection is that the, this project started not later than 2008. I may 
be mistaken, maybe much earlier I can’t remember. But assuming that 
started in 2008 that means it’s been what now, about 11 years. And as I 
understand the position and I think there was something in the 
newspapers a few months ago to the effect that I think set boxes had 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 36 of 92 
 
been stored in some warehouse. I don’t know for how many years and I 
think there was a suggestion in that article in the newspaper that a lot 
of money had been wasted because there was no action. My 
recollection of what the article said might be faulty. And one is bound 
to ask the question, why something like this could take so long? And I 
know that even from the Court papers that I’m talking about one got 
information to the effect that you would have this Minister of 
Communications and he or she would come and say, this is what we 
want to do about this project. And then when there is another Minister, 
he or she would come and say something else as if these were 
10 
Ministers from different governments. And partly, that is why there was 
a Court case to Court because there were fights about exactly what it is 
that should be followed. And maybe the reason why there might not be 
adequate funding now is because in the past a lot of funding was given 
but it’s been wasted. And of course, whatever was thought would be the 
course of implementing this project 10 years ago would be much more 
now. And if it had been implemented timeously a lot of cost would have 
been saved. You might not be able to deal with all of these things and 
maybe other people that will come will deal with them and answer them. 
But if you are able to enlighten me, I would welcome that. 
20 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Thank you, Chair. The 
question around the commitment of government to deliver this program. 
I will speak about since I’ve joined the department, Chair that being 
responsible for the coordination of the program we identified different 
milestones. The first one was to service the market that is to be 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 37 of 92 
 
subsidized by government. And in that regard, we through the data that 
was there dating back to 2012 we identified through… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct about how long the project has been on 
the agenda or am I mistaken in terms of around 2008? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  You are correct, Chair but the 
activities started way back around 2002/2003 towards the finalization of 
the policy that was done in 2008, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, it’s if it makes it even worse. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  From the implementation point 
of view, Chair is that… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything takes too long. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Ours is to implement policy. 
So, the activities prior 2007 could perhaps be pre-post, pre-policy 
activities. But you are correct to say 11 years from 2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I’m just saying everything seems to take ages 
about this program about this project. I mean if they started to put 
together policy around 2002, I mean it’s close to two decades now. And 
from what you are saying and from what one sees in the media we are 
20 
very far from really the completion of the project. Yes, okay. You can 
enlighten me on what you are able to enlighten me on. I accept that 
maybe some things are things that you might not be able to deal with. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Thank you, Chair. In terms of 
the commitment of government to realize the successful migration of 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 38 of 92 
 
television broadcasting in the country, I should indicate that from when 
we started in, when I started in 2014 towards 2015, we identified key 
milestones. Which the first one was to ensure that we start identifying 
those households that qualify to be registered. And within a short space 
of time, although the date of 17 June had passed but we started with 
the registration process in October. After which in three months period 
we started with the rollout of those decoders. Within a period of 10 
months we started switching off the analogue transmission services in 
the SKA. So, those are the milestones we were chasing so that we can 
demonstrate the realization; the potential realization of the migration 
10 
process. However, as demonstrated in the statement, there are those 
challenges that makes us unable to complete; the issues of lack of 
resources and so forth. But where in areas where people have been 
migrated, although every project might have its own challenges people 
are benefiting and are beginning to realize the benefit of what the 
program is bringing to them. Because if somebody visits a household 
that has analogue service and the other one that is digital, they can 
see the difference. So, I can say from where we are sitting and the 
support, we have been receiving from our accounting officers and 
executive authority, there is a will for governments to realize the 
20 
program rollout. The issue of where the decoders, Chair stored in the 
warehouses it is correct and is as a result of the challenge that I spoke 
about earlier. The absence of other type of decoders that can, that 
have impact on the rollout in a particular area. And the question, why 
so long? If I were to respond to a question why so long, I can only 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 39 of 92 
 
speak to the time at which I started with the program. That is the 
challenges I have highlighted in the statement talks to the issues of 
lack of resources and it makes it difficult. But Chair, to demonstrate our 
commitment realizing all these challenges we did not sit and fold our 
arms and say we don’t have resources. In the past week we’ve 
formalized forging the partnership with the Department of Corporative 
governance so that we can make use of the community worker’s 
program. Because they are based in the communities to identify people 
or households that are in analogue platform so that we can register 
them while waiting for issues of the installers that we do not have. We 
10 
could not also complete the Free State. We targeted it to complete in 
March. We could not finish because there are no installers. But we want 
to, we are saying, while these are happening, we want to ensure that 
the registration process continues. By the time we have installers, by 
the time we have decoders we will only be left with the process of 
rolling out or distributing and connecting decoders. So, we have forged 
that partnership with CoGTA. We are engaging and we have engaged 
the different provincial governments, district and local. Free State is a 
case, Northern Cape is a case. We are now this week in the Eastern 
Cape to try and engage with these institutions so that they can assist 
20 
us in getting people registered while raising awareness. Because of the 
lack of resources now we also piggyback on other activities if a district 
municipality is having events, we go exhibit do that but we are a very 
limited number in terms of resources; human resources. I think that is 
all I can say for now, Chair. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 40 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  On your estimation as we speak now, how long do you 
think it would take for the program to be finalized? 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Chair, the key ingredient of 
finalization is the availability of decoders. Not only for government 
subsidy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  But also, the ones that are on 
the retail market. Although, there are some free to air decoders in the 
market but in most instances the people will be asking about the ones 
that we are as government we are providing. Where do I get in the 
10 
retail market and they are not there? So, that’s the activities we are 
trying to engage with the retail. To say, we have this number of 
estimated number of people that could benefit from, that could benefit 
from introducing these type of decoders. So, the question of how long 
Chair. We are determined as department to ensure that we on our part 
would register all households. Due to resource constraints maybe, we 
might not make the end of the financial year but that is what we are 
thinking. That if we can achieve registering those indigent households 
by the end of the financial year, we can therefore be able to focus on 
the rollout of decoders when they become available and that will be 
20 
easy. We have demonstrated in the Free State Chair when the installers 
were there between October and January, October 2018 and January 
2019. That through focused approach where we go to focus in an area, 
get to the installers, load the decoders in the bakkies, install, the 
following day they collect. We have covered those areas and we 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 41 of 92 
 
managed to switch off one transmitter in the Free State. If it was not to 
the issue of the installers, absence of installers perhaps we could have 
switched off Free State and remain with a Metro. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  But in terms of determination, 
how long. It is our wish that we complete this process within a shortest 
period of time. We are unable to say tomorrow because of the 
challenges that we have but if resources are available this is a 
process, we can complete within a period of two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. No, thank you very much. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for Doctor Mutuvhi for coming to 
share your evidence with us. You will come back and deal with the 
balance of the matters that need to be dealt with in regard to the 
project. Thank you very much. You are excused. 
DR PHATUWANI LASTBORN MUTUVHI:  Thank you very much, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair. Chair, there’s another 
witness for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I’m not sure. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You need some time to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just to change places and my learned 
friend is going to deal with that witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, should we combine that with the tea break? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I would prefer that, Chair. Yes, thank you. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 42 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Let’s combine that with the tea break. Let’s 
resume, let’s go for the tea break and resume at 11h25. That will give 
us time for the tea break plus your. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Plus, the setting up, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Time to rearrange things. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.

ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     Chair in front of you, you will find 
four arch lever files containing the statement and Annexures of the 
witness’s statement and Annexures these are labelled CC19A to D. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       May we please admit those files 
into evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is under A, it’s his statement and Annexures. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      It’s Annexures, B contains 
Annexures as well, C contains Annexures as well and finally D contains 
the Annexures as well…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   The Annexures is the report isn’t it? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Chair the report is underneath file A 
and then thereafter there are transcripts until File D. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay alright. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       We’re going to be starting off with 
file A Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The lever arch file containing the statement of Mr 
Joseph Nong Thloloe and certain Annexures will be marked Exhibit

6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 44 of 92 
 
statement will be, respectively – will be Exhibits CC19B, CC19C and 
CC19D. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Thank you Chair.  Mr Thloloe the 
first page in front of you, page one can you identify that document? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes it’s a statement I made and 
signed. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    And if you page – turn to page seven 
of that same statement. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes I see that. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     Is that our signature at the bottom? 
10 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   It’s my signature. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     And it’s dated the 12 t h of August 
2019? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   That’s correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      And all the contents of the statement 
is true and correct? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes it is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     Mr Thloloe if you just, on the first 
page, paragraph three it states that you were approached by the 
investigators of the Commission, particularly to provide a statement 
20 
detailing – with the details of the SABC particular to a report identified 
as a report of Commission of inquiry into the interference in the 
decision making in the newsroom of South African Broadcasting 
Corporation, dated the 25 t h of February 2019, is that correct? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   That is correct. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 45 of 92 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Chair the report can be found on 
page eight in the same arch lever file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Page eight Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Mr Thloloe that is the report that 
you want to talk to…[intervenes]. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes that is a report that we compiled. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Thank you, Mr Thloloe if we turn to 
page two of your statement on paragraphs five, you’ve highlighted the 
10 
mandate in which this report was compiled. Can you just highlight the 
term of reference that you were given in compiling this report 
starting…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that could he just tell us more about himself, I 
think he has been [indistinct] media for long time? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Yes Chair, apologies – apologise for 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he can tell us about himself he has been around 
for a very long time and I see that the statements that’s at paragraph 
five by talking about the term of reference of a certain Commission but 
20 
it hasn’t, I think, told us which Commission that is and how he related 
to it, I think he was the Chairperson. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     Yes Chair, apologies.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     Apologies, Mr Thloloe can you just 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 46 of 92 
 
tell us where are you currently employed? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   I am retired, if one does ever retire, I 
retired from the Press Council of South Africa where I was Executive 
Director but before then I’ve been a journalist for the last 58 years 
starting in 1961 and I have worked for most of the publications in this 
country [indistinct], Rand Daily Mail, Drum Magazine, Post newspapers, 
Post Transvaal, the list is endless.  I was also at one-time Editor in 
Chief of the SABC’s television news and at anther time I was Editor in 
Chief of E-TV News.  As I’ve said I’ve had wide experience in the media 
in the last 58 years, 59 years. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Thank you Mr Thloloe, in terms of this 
report how did you come about, in what capacity were you mandated in 
this report and how did it come about that you became involved in this 
report? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   I was invited by the acting Group 
Executive of the SABC at the time Miss Nomsa Philiso and she asked 
me if I could Chair this Commission because of my wide experience in 
journalism and ethical issues.   I agreed to do that and I was then 
subsequently told that I would be joined by Mr Tawana who is an 
Attorney from MMM Attorneys. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      And in paragraph five on page two of 
your statement, you’ve highlighted the mandate of this Commission, the 
terms of reference in particular, can you just highlight the – starting as 
from paragraph 5.1…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that, I see that it’s referred to as a 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 47 of 92 
 
Commission of inquiry, do you know if it was established in terms of 
any legislation or was that term just used because it was convenient.  I 
know the – legally termed Commissions of inquiry are established in 
terms of the Constitution and the Commissions Act but sometimes 
people speak just informally, so but I don’t know whether – I just want 
to know if it was established in terms of some legislation or not? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   No it wasn’t in terms of any 
legislation, I think the term was used quite loosely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Thank you Chair, Mr Thloloe can 
10 
you just please highlight the terms of reference of this inquiry? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   We had to investigate the nature, the 
prevalence and the merits and veracity of all the allegations and/or 
grievances and/or complaints of editorial, political, business and 
commercial interference in the newsroom if the SABC.  We were to 
establish the factors and/or mechanisms that enabled the Editorial 
Political Business and Commercial interference and/or transgressions.  
We were to establish whether there was evidence to substantiate the 
allegations made.  We were to evaluate the substance of all the 
allegations and/or grievances and/or complaints.  We were to review 
20 
and any or all submissions made before, by any person or persons in 
respect to the allegations and/or grievances and/or complaints lodged 
by the employees.   
We were to make factual findings and conclusions based on the 
evidence, and the testimony that was presented.  We were to do 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 48 of 92 
 
interviews, review all submissions and review applicable supporting 
documents.  We were to interview all SABC employees and/or any other 
persons that are mentioned in the allegations and/or grievances and/or 
complaints 
lodged 
by 
the 
employees. 
 
We 
were 
to 
make 
recommendations 
on 
the 
appropriate 
corrective 
institutional 
or 
structural measures to be considered and to be instituted and to 
address control deficiencies.  We were to advise the SABC Board on 
what steps need to be undertaken, we were to recommend appropriate 
corrective action which could include disciplinary action where there is 
misconduct and we were to prepare a written report setting out, in 
10 
detail, the methodology adopted, the findings, the conclusions and the 
recommendations.  As I had said earlier we were given these terms by 
the then acting Group Chief Executive of the SABC. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Thank you Mr Thloloe and can you 
shed light on the methodology that incorporated your mandate and also 
the evidence gathered that would also be highlighted from paragraph 
seven onwards?  
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   First we got written submissions after 
invitations were sent out to all staff members and to members of the 
public to make written submissions to the Commission and from the 
20 
written submission we then had formal interviews with the people who 
had made written submissions.  We also had face-to-face interviews via 
things like Skype, teleconferencing when we couldn’t reach the people 
directly but most of them came – I mean were in Johannesburg or came 
to Johannesburg to come and give evidence at the venue where we 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 49 of 92 
 
were gathering the evidence. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       And Mr Thloloe, in paragraph 11 
you’ve also highlighted elsewhere in your affidavit that you had all 
evidence, 58 sessions of all evidence that was conducted, is that 
correct? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   It’s correct, we had 58 tribunals, 
political parties, media freedom activists as well as staff members 
coming to talk to us and genera members of the public coming to talk to 
us, but all together we had 58 submissions. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Mr Thloloe you state that you’ve also 
10 
included political parties, what was, you know – I know that invitations 
were sent out to the public but what was the purpose to receive 
submissions from various political parties?     
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   I would imagine that political parties 
are members of the South African public, they took up the invitation to 
come and – I mean to return written submissions as well as to come 
and make oral submissions.  So there was no specific reason why we 
selected political parties 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Okay and the report was accompanied 
by, also in the arch lever files, by various transcripts, which was 
20 
labelled evidence 1 to 12, it stated here that the 8 t h transcript is 
outstanding due to Mr Tawana’s laptop having been crashed who co-
authored the report with you.  Is there an update, you know, if this 
report will be submitted, this transcript in particular will be submitted to 
the Commission when he found this transcript? 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 50 of 92 
 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   As soon as he sends it to me I will 
forward it to the Commission. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Thank you, of the interviews they 
were largely confined to voluntary submissions, is that correct? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   All of them were voluntary. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       As you guys did not have any 
investigative capacity and could not subpoena witnesses, is that 
correct? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       In paragraphs 14 onwards, Mr 
10 
Thloloe you speak about the summary of findings that would be on page 
five of your statement starting at the bottom. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Can you just in detail, highlight, per 
finding and give commentary as to how you came onto that finding and 
so forth? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       I think the first major finding was 
that in the five years that you were investigating, the SABC suffered 
from capricious use of authority and power to terrorise staff and to 
deflect the corporation from each mandate and its editorial policies.  
20 
The evidence we got, in fact, didn’t show a pattern, I mean it was just 
somebody who was in power who just use it because I say so and 
because you should do it.  It was a very frightening [indistinct] 
essentially where people were bullied, you were thrown around and 
they were pushed around and it emerges in the transcripts that you can 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 51 of 92 
 
read and I was delighted in fact some of the people that have given 
evidence for the SABC have in fact confirmed this.  I mean here in this 
Commission…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean as you deal with the findings that you made it 
would help in regard to either each or in regard to some, depending on 
their importance as you see it, if you could elaborate a little bit in 
terms of the evidence that was placed before you which led to that 
finding.  You don’t have to do that in regard to each one of them if 
that’s difficult, you can choose those that you regard as important or 
there might be some that you regard as important but you don’t 
10 
remember the part of the evidence and it doesn’t have to be exhaustive 
just some features that you would like to draw – to highlight. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   For example as far as the first finding 
is concerned, in the report if you go to paragraph 70 right up to 
paragraph 73, staff members describe what it was like [indistinct] Mbeki 
for example who gave evidence to this Commission here said it was a 
egregious abuse of power and she described her state.  You know I’m 
on automatic like I’m a robot, I’m just going through the motions.  I get 
up at 4h30 everyday, go to the gym, go to work, do everything that I’m 
supposed to but there’s no more – no me anymore, there’s just this 
20 
automated, this person you can call it a robot [indistinct] but this is 
what I have become.  Nyana Molete describes it, when you are dealing 
with individuals like Jimi Matthews, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, individuals who 
are all powerful and individuals who at any turn would threaten to fire 
people, you do get demoralised you just feel you come to work to 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 52 of 92 
 
basically earn your keep.  Apart from just the bullying and that kind of 
thing there was also a decline in the quality of the work we were doing.  
That is the type of evidence we were picking up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Thank you and your second findings 
Mr Thloloe? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   As I say, we found an organisation 
crippled by pain, anger, fear by frustration, anxiety and apathy by 
inattentiveness, detachment and helplessness.  If you read through the 
whole report you will see that it tries to give a texture of live at the 
10 
SABC at the time.  So it is not a detailed analysis of line by line of the 
evidence it just gives a texture as people who were talking to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Now one of the main [indistinct] we 
call it, the main thrust of the inquiry, people were saying the enforces 
must go.  Now the enforces are people who were supposed to have 
been enforcing the policies of the SABC at the time, these are senior 
level management and there was a clamour that these must go and this 
must be one of our recommendations and our feeling after talking very 
deeply with Mr Tawana was that a witch hunt for enforcers wouldn’t 
20 
heal the corporation, the wounds are very deep.  In fact what it would 
do is it would just divide an already fractured institution.  There was 
some evidence that- there was the word suggestions that the ANC had 
captured the SABC but we found nobody who could come and say, I got 
instructions from Luthuli House so we found no evidence of direct - of a 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 53 of 92 
 
direct line between the decisions that the ANC had got us and decisions 
in the newsrooms but you have the spectre of the ANC hovering very 
largely over the newsroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me take you back to the finding immediately 
before this one that you have just dealt with the one about the 
enforcers, I guess that in regard to the call by some that the enforcers 
must go and that your report must contain a recommendation to that 
effect, I suspect that what you may have had to deal with is to look at 
the issue of maybe avoiding any division in the corporation in terms of 
staff but also at the same time you must have been alive to 
10 
considerations of accountability because, to the extent,  that whatever 
it is that they may be alleged to have done, that is the enforcers, if it 
was a breach of the law, if it was misconduct there may be a need for 
accountability, so my question is whether that indeed was one of the 
things you considered and having considered issues of accountability 
and maybe the need for peace in inverted commas and stability in the 
SABC you made a judgement call that you would rather say, let’s rather 
have, recommend stability and maybe you might or might not have 
thought that accountability and stability would sit together nicely.  If 
you could just indicate whether those are matters that you considered 
20 
and so on? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   We did consider the question of the 
enforcers rather …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you are able to – if you are comfortable to deal 
with it without referring to a particular page in the report, feel free to 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 54 of 92 
 
do so as long as you know that whatever you say is consistent with the 
report says but if you feel that it’s important to refer to the particular 
page, that’s fine. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       If I may just assist the witness, 
there’s a topic about – particularly and enforcer on page 44 of the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are the paginated page number, is it 44? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       44. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   It starts on page 43 where we deal 
10 
with enforcers and it is a – as I say we looked quite deeply at that, we 
spoke to the people who were alleged to be enforcers and of course the 
reason was, they were under duress because they would get fired, 
that’s what most of them said, they were being threatened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so they mostly admitted having done certain 
things that might be viewed as wrong but they said we were also in 
fear? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   They were also victims of what was 
happening at the time and each one of them had a story to tell about 
why they were doing what they were doing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  For example one person said I ended 
up in hospital in a - in a mental hospital … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 55 of 92 
 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Because of depression as a result what 
was happening the threats I was receiving from my bosses inside the 
SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  And another one would say I am the 
only breadwinner at - at - in my house and I was - I was forced to do 
whatever I was being told to do.  So they were passing the buck to their 
seniors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Now in the end we said we need to 
10 
draw a line at what point of seniority do we say this is an enforcer.  
This one is a victim of the enforcers.  Is everybody down the chain who 
actually carried out that instruction would you say this person was an 
enforcer.  So it is a very dubious area and in the end we said 
Parliament was there to oversee what was happening - oversee what 
was happening at the SABC.  The Portfolio Committee on - on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Communications. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Communications was there.  The board 
was there. The public who were paying for the SABC were there and 
they did not do anything until things got to this very bad situation.  Now 
20 
to single out some people along the way would not be fair because we 
are all guilty of having allowed the SABC to deteriorate to this 
condition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I certainly would not at this stage criticise the 
approach you took.  Later on one will hear everything and take it from 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 56 of 92 
 
there but I can understand where you were coming from but of course 
the point you make about who was there, who was supposed to have 
carried out oversight is a very important point.  The board was there. 
The Portfolio Committee in Parliament on communications 
was there.  What was it told?  What did it know?  What did it want to 
know and when was it told what it wanted to know?  Did it want to know 
the - the true position and if it was told what did it do?  Those are very 
legitimate and important issues to look at also for this Commission but 
of course it may well be - I do not know - it may well be that you go to 
executive management people who are in high positions who may have 
10 
been alleged to be enforcers. 
They say no.  I was forced.  I was threatened.  I feared.  
Maybe they say I feared Mr Motsoeneng.  I do not know who they will 
say they feared and then you - you do not do anything.  You might get 
to Mr Motsoeneng.  I do not know what he may or may not have said 
before you and I cannot remember whether he gave evidence.  I seem 
to have read something suggesting he did not. 
He might also say something else.  He was also scared or 
one might get to people in Parliament and maybe they might say - I do 
not know- they might say well the leaders - my leaders in Parliament 
20 
said I must not ask too many questions.  You know.  The Minister 
involved is our Minister.  I mean Mr Bloom testified here earlier this 
year and said when he was still in the ANC - when he was an ANC MP 
serving in the Correctional Services Portfolio Committee when he asked 
certain questions on - to the Minister trying to exercise his oversight 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 57 of 92 
 
obligation. 
The - the Chief Whip at the time and I do not know who the 
Chief Whip was called him and said something to the effect you - that 
you must not be too hard.  This is our Minister or something to - like 
that.  So we do not know whether we - there might be a lot of those 
types of situations even for MPs who might have been in certain 
Portfolio Committees. 
If they say that are we going to say okay you know and as we 
go up everybody pushes responsibility up.  Are we evert going to get to 
anybody except maybe the very top?  I do not know but I raise these 
10 
things as I say not to say I would not have reached the same 
conclusion that you have reached but just to say these are some of the 
things that this Commission must also look at but as it looks at it these 
are some of the questions that will arise to say where will - where must 
be the line be drawn in order to on the one hand ensure that there is 
accountability but maybe on the other hand give recognition to certain 
challenges that people might have had. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  The - the painful part with abuse is that 
the abused themselves turn against each other … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  And it becomes much more vicious at 
that level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  So what we found as we were talking to 
people here was that the one person would point at another and say 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 58 of 92 
 
that one is an enforcer.  That one is an enforcer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  And fingers were pointed in all 
directions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  That was a target (?) we found at the 
SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm, hm.  Yes, no I understand.  Thank - thank 
you.  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Thloloe.  
10 
Paragraph 17 you had highlighted - that is on page 6 of the main 
statement - that there was no evidence of a direct line between the 
decisions of the - at ANC Headquarters Luthuli House and decisions in 
the newsroom but the spectre of the ANC hovered over the newsroom. 
Can you just explain what you mean by the spectre of the 
ANC hovering over the newsroom? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  There were several examples of this.  
For example when the Minister of Communications did constituency 
work in KZN - ANC constituency work.  Journalists were forced to cover 
her every time she was out there.  Now the ANC might say we never 
20 
asked her to that but the fact that she is an ANC member is as I say a 
spectre over - over what she was told. 
The Chairperson of the board goes to an A - the SABC 
function where the SABC was donating a house to some family or - or 
another and she went to that function wearing ANC regalia.  I mean it 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 59 of 92 
 
says a lot about what role the ANC was supposed to be playing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  But there was - as I say - no direct line 
that says this is what the ANC has said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  When - when the ANC came to give 
evidence - we have got the evidence of Mr Zizi Kodwa.  Where he says: 
“Unqualified people at the SABC are responsible for 
the “myth” that the ANC is running the SABC 
newsroom.  These unqualified people are name 
10 
droppers. 
 
They 
lie 
about 
who 
gave 
them 
instructions.” 
And he considered that that might be happening at the SABC 
that is why over the years they have - there has always this story that 
the ANC is running the SABC newsroom.  So that spectre just hangs 
over the SABC.  Although there was no letter that we got that said the 
SABC wants you to do this.  No memo.  Nothing like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you - as you deal with that my mind goes back to 
the 1980’s.  I guess one can go even before that.  You know under 
apartheid.  There was certainly among I would imagine very many 
20 
people - Black people and people who were opposed to the apartheid 
Government - a very strong belief that the apartheid Government - 
Nationalist Party - the Nationalist Party were running newsroom at the 
SABC at the time. 
So as you say that my mind goes back to the question 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 60 of 92 
 
whether that is what may have happened even then or whether what 
may have happened then is something much - was whether at that time 
if there was a - an inquiry such as yours one would have been able to 
find a directly leak or whether even then one might have not found a 
direct link and therefore not be able to say the National Party was 
running the newsroom at SABC and here - but it was hovering over the 
- that is - that is - I am just sharing with you what is going on in my 
mind as you speak. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  In - in fact I remember those days.  
Any time an SABC journalist tried to interview me I would tell them I am 
10 
not talking to you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Because you are a Government 
spokesperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Now at that time the control was very 
obvious. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  You had a broederbonde … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Running the SABC as - as Chief 
Executive Officer.  You had telephone calls from the Union Buildings to 
the newsroom and there is lots of evidence of that.  In fact some of the 
people who were involved ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 61 of 92 
 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Have written about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  I think there is a book out recently 
talking about the television newsroom at the time.  So there was direct 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Evidence of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to that.  Of course you would know much 
more in that sector than I would know but I was just trying to compare 
because always one wants to make sure that whatever findings are 
10 
made are findings that relate to facts.  Thanks. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Thloloe in 
paragraph 17 you have mentioned there was no direct link from Luthuli 
House.  There have been three people that have had - who have made 
submissions in the transcripts about - concerning Luthuli House.  Two 
of those people however it was just - you know - they have heard and 
so forth who were journalists in the newsroom and so forth. 
However there is a particular who - Chair I am not particularly 
sure.  There was a concern yesterday by Ms Pillay about disclosing 
names and so forth and we have not notified these particular 
20 
individuals.  So I am not quite sure if we should mention their names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe if it is something that must still be further 
investigated.  Maybe you - you do not need to deal with it.  The witness 
can come back at any time in - in the future to - to deal with whatever 
might come out after there has been further investigation and they have 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 62 of 92 
 
been notified. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja, I think that is safer. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  What - what I can say about that is that 
there were people who came to our Commission and said they believe 
that it was an instruction from Luthuli House but they just heard.  It was 
not anything that they themselves were involved in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They had no personal knowledge? 
10 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  No personal knowledge Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair if I may just - just elaborating of 
what you said Ms - Mr Thloloe - people who did not have direct 
knowledge but how was it - I am mindful of the fact that there was no 
investigative capacity.  However how did you then take in consideration 
the specific individual who stated that she had received a call and she 
says this person was lying saying that they were from Luthuli House? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  I - I do not remember that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you might have to deal with it later when you have 
20 
- if it is the one that requires 3.3 Notices to be issued.  You might wish 
to … 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You might want to deal with it at a later stage 
when you might be able direct the witness to the particular evidence 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 63 of 92 
 
and then - and that person or the relevant persons would have been 
notified and then we can deal with it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE: 
 
Mr Thloloe 
I 
am 
going 
to 
just 
specifically deal with the submissions made by the various political 
parties.  There were three parties that were - had made submissions.  
Namely the ANC, the PAC and the EFF.  Is that correct? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  And the DA - the DA also gave 
evidence. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The - the DA transcripts would that be 
contained in the evidence eight? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The eight that is not - that is not -0 
because there is a particular volume of transcript that is still missing. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  No.  It should have been earlier than 
that. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Well we will take - we will take a look.  
It might just be missing from the folders.  In the meantime I am just 
going to be dealing with the submissions these political parties.  Just 
20 
going to - just start off with the ANC and then deal with the PAC then 
the EFF.  Highlight the recommendations that they gave to you and if 
you could just comment on that.  Chair the - the first transcript begins 
at the second Folder B on page 433. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say second folder. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 64 of 92 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Second folder - I mean - apologies sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not see any … 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The second file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The second file.  That would be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but … 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  CC19B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, do not say second file.  Say CC19B.  Then I … 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair.  These folders we have had 
a lot of them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  What page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Page 4-3-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Four? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  4-3-3 Mr Thloloe. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  4-3-3? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  433 and the page numbers she is referring to 
are the red ones at the right - top right hand corner of each page. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Are you there Mr Thloloe? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The ANC had made submissions upon 
invitation. That is correct? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  As I say they responded to the general 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 65 of 92 
 
… 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Invitation? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Invitation, ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Alright and there were about five 
people from the ANC that attended that … 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Yes there were. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  That hearing … 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Yes there were. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And in attendance was Mr Zizi Kodwa 
identifying himself as a Member of the National Executive Committee of 
10 
the ANC.  A National Member of the National Working Committee.  Also 
with Mr Kodwa was Mr Pule Mabe.  Identifying himself as a Member of 
the ANC, National Executive Committee, a National Spokesperson and 
Head of Communications and then with the two of them there were 
three other ANC employees identified as Amati (?), Lerato and Refilwe 
who were in charge of the digital media, media liaison and photograph 
services of the ANC. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Now if we could just please turn to 
page 440. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said if we go to what page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  4-4-0 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  4-4-0, thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Are you there? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Yes I am. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 66 of 92 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  This was - we are just starting off with 
the - at the tail end.  The recommendations that were given by the ANC.  
In particular this was highlighted by Mr Kodwa.  We are going to start 
at the bottom of the page Chair where it says - that would be line 24.  
Where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Where he states: 
“I think that it is a fundamental basis and departure 
point not all parties have equal speaking time in 
Parliament.  The African National Congress in most 
10 
…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should we not start a little earlier than that because 
he talks about it being a fundamental basis and we - I do not know what 
it is.  Is it not stated earlier on what he is talking about?  That he says 
is a fundamental basis and departure point.  He says: 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “The second issue in relation to …” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  We will start from there.  That - 
20 
Mr Thloloe that will be the line - line 14.  On the same page on 4-4-0.  
Are you there? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  Yes.  I am there. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you.  It reads: 
“The second issue in relation to that is in regard to 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 67 of 92 
 
the African National Congress what should be 
covered in detail without repeating what is there.  
As a majority party the concept of equity does not 
mean equal.  I know it is a debate but in terms of 
editorial decision the fact that even in Parliament in 
terms of speaking in terms of the program of 
Parliament it is based on the fact that our 
constitutional democracy recognises the majority 
and I think that is the fundamental basis and 
departure point.  Not all parties have equal 
10 
speaking time in Parliament.  The African National 
Congress in most instances has the largest or 
biggest time slot in terms of speaking.  20 minutes, 
five minutes and so on and it is deliberate.  It 
recognises 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
not 
equal.  
Therefore there are times where as the largest 
political party we think that regardless of respective 
levels of influence how people have spoken in 
terms of outcomes electorally and the SABC as a 
broadcaster tries to give all political parties equal 
20 
time of issues of public interest.  At the largest - as 
the largest political party politically speaking we 
find 
it 
quite 
unfair 
to 
the 
African 
National 
Congress.” 
When we turn over to page 4-4-2 I think just for - for context 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 68 of 92 
 
Chair - apologies.  That I should carry on from where I left off in the 
middle of - at paragraph - at line 16 on page 4-4-1 to be able to 
connect the dots … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  “Because the electorate in 
this country have spoken since 1994 and have not 
given the African National Congress anything 
national and provincial and have not given anything 
10 
less than 62 percent the reflection that obviously 
cannot be undermined in the reflections of the 
editorial in terms of both news and particularly the 
public broadcaster.  Therefore we think that it 
disadvantages 
not 
only 
the 
African 
National 
Congress but it also undermines the editorial view 
which would have been expressed by the majority of 
this country because we cannot be equal under the 
pretext of equity.  Equity does not mean equal.” 
Then if we go to line 14 on the same page. 
20 
“We therefore make fundamental recommendations.  
We say fundamental because they are not just 
important.  They are fundamental.  The first 
recommendation we make which I think is also very 
fundamental is that the SABC should try very hard 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 69 of 92 
 
in case of the African National Congress to 
separate between party and the State.  We say that 
selfishly - selfishly to the ANC but we also - but 
also will defend in areas we are not the majority 
party in the case of the Western Cape.  We will not 
argue the same that the African National Congress 
must be given the biggest slice in terms of media 
above 
the 
Democratic 
Alliance 
because 
the 
Democratic Alliance is the biggest party in the 
Western Cape.  So we will expect the same 
10 
principle.  We will argue - we will argue nationally 
or where African National Congress dominant.  We 
will argue the same principle as the Democratic 
Alliance or we will go to elections now.  That - that 
principle must apply.” 
If we go to line 13 of that same page.  It says: 
“The second recommendation we will make is that I 
think the SABC on a continuous basis must strive to 
consider the objective tool of content analysis.  In 
other words the SABC in terms of how it provides 
20 
disbalance reporting.  Sometimes you cannot rely 
on individuals.  There has to be a too that guides 
those individuals editorially, those - those who 
report, those who write from a newsroom point of 
view.” 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 70 of 92 
 
And if we turn to page 4-4-6.  That would be on page - on line 
eight.  It holds: 
“As 
a 
concluding 
point 
the 
African 
National 
Congress does not want a public broadcaster that is 
a mouthpiece for the African National Congress.” 
Mr Thloloe with all that was submitted by the ANC can you 
give commentary to that effect? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:  A, it was pretty obvious to us that the 
ANC had a particular agenda when they came to make their submission.  
They were in fact asking for bigger - a bigger share than they were 
10 
getting and yet since 1994 the concept of equitable representation on 
news broadcast and on other news media has been accepted by the 
country and their argument was that if we cover a Minister for example 
saying something we should also go to the ANC and get their comment 
on what the Minister said because the Minister was speaking as a 
Government person and the ANC as a party also has a view on the 
same matter. 
As I say we did not take that into account in our 
recommendations. 
 
We 
believed 
that - 
we 
believed 
that 
our 
responsibility was to find out if there was in fact pressure on the - on 
20 
the SABC - undue pressure on the SABC and if this can be kept in one 
way or another. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did - did the issue of separation between party and 
State or Government arise in that context?  You know sometimes it will 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 71 of 92 
 
be said even by the ANC - I think - sometimes one gets the impression 
that when it suits the ANC they will say what Government has done that 
is what the party has done because it is the party that is the ruling 
party but sometimes one gets the impression that they do want to 
distance themselves from Government to say well that is Government. 
That is the Government position.  This is the party’s position.  
Now I say that without necessarily thinking of a particular issue on 
which that has happened but I - I have the impression that sometimes 
that - that happens.  It is like when a particular prominent member of 
the ANC has done something - maybe something wrong. 
10 
It may be that it is a personal thing and therefore it should not be 
associated with the party but sometimes we would all know that if it is 
somebody particularly who is a senior - a senior leader it could be seen 
as look at what - you know - some of the senior leaders of the party are 
doing.  Sometimes not so easy to make that distinction but I - I think 
sometimes it is made.  Sometimes it is not made.  So I wonder whether 
when you were looking at that you had any challenges looking at that 
dividing line. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  At this point we just dismissed it as the 
ANC trying to get out some mileage out of it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  But as a newsman if the government 
does something and to the ANC takes a different position it becomes 
news. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 72 of 92 
 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Otherwise there’s no point. It’s trying 
to get two bites at the cherry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay. So, your inclination would be unless 
there is an indication that the ANC is taking a different position. There 
is no need to, there would be no need to give the ANC a chance to say 
something when a Minister has already dealt with that from the point of 
view of government? 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  That’s the line we took Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you. The second political party 
10 
was the EFF. Chair, that would be CC19C. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  C? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  C, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  912. 
CHAIRPERSON:  912? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  I’m on it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you. Now these were, this is a 
20 
start of the submissions by the EFF. In attendance was Mr Mbuyeseni 
Ndlozi identifying himself as the head of communications and national 
spokesperson of the EFF and Ms Mandisa Sibongile Mashego 
identifying herself as the Chairperson of the EFF in Gauteng. Also, as a 
party leader for the EFF caucus in Gauteng Provincial Legislature. Just 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 73 of 92 
 
to quickly skip to the recommendations that were made by Ms Mashego 
that can be found on page 941, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry. I think I missed that. I’m at 914. Have we 
moved beyond that? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  941. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh? Did I get mixed? 941 not. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. Sorry, I mixed it. I don’t know. 
UNKNOWN:  It sounded like line. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  It sounded? 
UNKNOWN:  Like line. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Like line? Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  That’s what I heard. It sounded like 
nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m at the bottom lines. I’m at a wrong page. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. So, the page where the 
recommendation start Chair are on page 941. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Apologies for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right. Yes, we are ready. 
20 
ADV 
MPHO 
RASIVHETSHELE: 
 
Yes. 
So, 
highlighting 
the 
recommendations by the EFF. I’m going to start on where on number 
one where it’s written number one, the recommendations that are 
submitted by Ms Mashego.  
Content has to be of interest in the interest of the 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 74 of 92 
 
public whether it’s political content or whatever. Even more 
importantly political content obviously. I want to raise the 
issue of separation of party and the State. The proposal from 
the ANC on actual corrupting, sorry. The proposal from the 
ANC borders on actually corrupting that principle of party in 
fact is not a principle. I think in the Constitution there must be 
a separation between party and State. 
In addition, page 948 line 23 Mr Ndlozi makes the submission starting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s that page now? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  948, Chair 
10 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  948? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  That would be at the bottom of that 
page starting at line 23. Mr Ndlozi makes a submission that starting 
from.   
The COO is at the centre of programs and resources 
in the SABC. From time to time when one is mistreated by 
political editor or producer in a political show in the SABC, you 
pick up a phone and you complain or you write to them directly 
20 
and say to the COO that this has happened in the SABC and 
so on and so forth. There are countless reasons why you 
should pick up a phone to interact with senior management 
including members of the board. A panel member responds, 
don’t you think it’s an aspect that contributes towards 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 75 of 92 
 
interference news? Mr Ndlozi replies, no. The majority of the 
people believe that if anyone gets interactive let’s take 
something else outside the public broadcaster which is a news 
institution the City Press or Power FM or 702. Surely, the 
political editor or the senior editors of these institutions can be 
interacted with without it happening in the institution; sorry, 
interacted with about what is happening in the institution. The 
point is that they ought to have known that they don’t owe us 
anything. Panel member responds, okay. Mr Ndlozi further on 
and goes that they must stick to the rules, they must be 
10 
impartial, they must be fair, they must not be biased. Because 
the implication is that you must tell politicians not to call 
senior members of the SABC. No, we don’t care. The question 
shouldn’t even arise. You take a commitment, you sign a 
contract when you take that job in the SABC. Stick to that 
commitment, stick to the oath.  
And that would be the end of the recommendation and the finality of the 
submission by the EFF. Can you comment on that? 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  The essence of what the EFF was 
proposing was that at the end of every lateral cycle when a new 
20 
election date is announced everybody goes to zero. So, you don’t have 
the equity based on the results of the previous years’ elections. Again, 
for us this was another way of trying to get mileage out of the SABC. 
They were saying the concept of equity is not fair to other political 
parties. Everybody must start from scratch. They are all equal. So, they 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 76 of 92 
 
all need to get equal time from the SABC. But again, the SABC editorial 
policies are very clear about what should be happening. The ICASA 
regulations are very clear about how you cover elections and the IEC 
also has regulations during elections. And one of the principles of all 
these organizations is that there is equity and that equity is calculated 
on the basis of the previous years’ elections or the previous elections 
that they were. So, again we didn’t take this argument very seriously. It 
was another game of politics that they were playing with us. They were 
not saying to us there is political interference at the SABC and this is 
the evidence we have for it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you may have had; you probably have had much 
more exposure than I have had in regard to those debates. So, 
whatever I might say now is not necessarily as well informed by the 
debates for and against on some of these issues. But I do, I kind of see 
where the EFF’s suggestion where the EFF comes from when they make 
that suggestion. I ask myself the question, in Parliament the majority 
party is already allocated a lot of time. So, to the extent that they might 
argue that they are entitled to have more time in order to tell the 
populace what they are doing about because they have been given the 
power to govern. They have a lot of time to do that when they speak in 
20 
Parliament. They have been given more time. Apart from that, they 
have maybe as government now we go back to the question of 
separating between party and government you know. They have a lot of 
resources and time outside of Parliament to go to the people over the 
five-year cycle of elections and tell the people what they have been 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 77 of 92 
 
doing and they have much more resources than the opposition parties. 
Again, I just emphasize I’m not talking where one is not separating 
between party and government but they would be talking about the 
same achievements whether it’s government or the ruling party over the 
five-year period. So, my question is, why when they are all contesting 
elections must the ruling party still get more time than the other 
parties? What is wrong with saying, equity dictates that there must 
come a time when all the parties if it comes to for example the public 
broadcaster, they must be given enough time, equal time and they must 
make use of it? Because it may well be that if you’re going to keep on 
10 
giving the opposition party, smaller parties little time and giving the 
majority party the ruling party more time that might be working against 
democracy. Because you are suppressing or making it difficult for the 
smaller parties to rise and compete properly with the ruling party. And 
so, as I sit here and I don’t know if I might change my mind. I’m just 
sharing with you what’s going on in my mind now. I have a feeling that I 
don’t see why there is a justification for talking particularly about the 
time when there are elections coming and they start campaigning. 
Maybe let’s leave out during other times, just that time that I don’t see 
why they shouldn’t be put on an equal footing in order to ensure that 
20 
the citizens as much as about each of them as possible without giving 
anyone an advantage. Because the broadcaster and any objective by 
stand I should be saying, we just want democracy to work and we want 
it to be strengthened. Whoever wins must win on the basis of equal 
chances. Now, there might be argument about equal chances but it just 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 78 of 92 
 
seems that if you give the ruling party more time even then outside of 
Parliament you are unfairly disadvantaging the other parties. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Unfortunately, Mr Chairman democracy 
is extremely… (indistinct).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. No, I agree and but I would like to hear 
what you might have to say about some of these thoughts that come to 
my mind without me having been exposed to many views on this 
subject. But you have had, you probably have had a lot of exposure in 
the media and through the inquiry to look at that and then therefore, 
you might be able to say, well we considered all of those. Or those 
10 
arguments have been considered in literature and there are different 
answers. One of the answers is this, one of the answers is that. And 
when you look at everything the majority, most people think this is the 
way to go. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  I think the reason in 94 South Africans 
settled for this system of equity is because I mean in 94 elections it 
was equal for everybody. And then after the elections then you said the 
majority of South Africans think this way. So, if at one stage you start 
diminishing what they have achieved as a party you are now playing 
God over what they do or don’t do. So, the measure that you can use 
20 
that is fair is, this is how you performed. Therefore, we will allocate you 
time equivalent to what you have achieved. Now, if a new party comes 
online and it is bringing fresh things it’s news, it’s exciting then they 
will get the support that they need from the media generally. But if it’s 
another run-of-the-mill party that says we think we should get a bigger 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 79 of 92 
 
share we are suppressing the views of the majority of the country. 
That’s the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, except that for if we talk about the general 
election that we had in May this year. If you said, well with effect from 
maybe March, the last two months before the election we will give 
equal time to all the political parties. The fact of the matter may well be 
that over the past four years 10 months you have given the majority 
party that more time than others but you are seeking now to at least try 
to strike some balance. You think even then there would still be a 
legitimate complaint to say, notwithstanding the fact that for the past 
10 
four and a half years they had all this time there’ll still be a legitimate 
concern to say no, even that month that last two months they must still 
have? 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  As I say, that’s the solution we found in 
1994 and as I say, the IEC in its regulations every time there is an 
election they insist on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Equity coverage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. It may well be that it is equitable but I just have 
those questions in my mind but I understand what you’re saying. Thank 
20 
you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you. The next party would be the 
PAC. That would be found on page 1071. Are you there Mr Tlholoe? 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Ja, I’ve got it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 80 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m tempted to ask Mr Tlholoe whether there was no 
problem whether you were receiving submissions from the true PAC 
from the genuine legitimate PAC. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  The question is, which PAC? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, anyway thanks. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In attendance to this inquiry was Mr 
Luthando Mabinda who identified himself as a leader of the PAC and 
member of Parliament. Also, with Mr Mabinda was Mr Vusi Ntsotetsi 
identified as a member of the national executive committee of the PAC 
and Comrade Gancho identified as a member of the national executive 
10 
committee of the PAC as well. At a later stage, there was also a Mr 
Puwe whose position is not clearly identified in the transcript but it 
seems like he was assumed that he was a member of the PAC as well. 
On page, if I could just direct the Chair to page 1081.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Just a short recommendation what was 
encapsulated in these submissions. On line 20 it states that, 
The last point that we are raising as a way forward is 
that once there’s an election date that has been pronounced 
and a political party has been registered, all parties should be 
20 
covered equally. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  That’s the same argument that the EFF 
had raised and for the same reason we didn’t take the EFF’s position. It 
quite fell outside our mandate. We were supposed to check if there is in 
fact political interference in the decision-making at the SABC.  
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 81 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you were not there to make any recommendations 
to change existing policies and so on and regulations? 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  We did make recommendations on that 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  If you go to the report, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  I’m almost there Mr Chairman. If you 
go to two paragraph 220 in the A bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page is that? 
10 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Page 59. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 59? Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  It says, 
The Commission accepts that any person, organization or institution in 
the country has a right to influence coverage by the SABC. But the 
decision on what to cover and how to cover it rests with the editorial 
staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  And could I be excused Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Do you need us to take an adjournment? No, 
20 
okay. Thank you.  
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  There are too many documents in front 
of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Tlholoe, can I assist? What perhaps 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 82 of 92 
 
are you looking for? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you indicate to her what you’re looking for. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  The… (indistinct) that says the 
newsroom. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In the report? 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  If you look at in the index. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s a section that deals with the newsroom? 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Ja, it’s headlined newsroom. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  That starts on page, it’s 24 of the 
report but I will tell you the page number itself the paginated number. 
That would be page 31. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  31. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Yes, the newsroom.  
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  Now, if you go to 77, paragraph 77. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  The participants are guided by the 
corporation’s editorial policies which are intended to help the editorial 
staff negotiate difficult editorial issues and decisions so that distinctive 
20 
and compelling and sometimes controversial programs can be made 
while maintaining the highest ethical and editorial standards.  
That already exists in the SABC’s editorial policies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG TLHOLOE:  It also goes on to say, 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 83 of 92 
 
Through this policy, the SABC is well-positioned and 
unmatched in the market to meet the challenge of telling the 
South African story with compassion, determination and 
resolution while creating forums where South Africans from 
every walk of life can communicate ideas about their common 
future. 
So, the values that the SABC should be upholding are already in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. Well, I mean I raised, I shared with you 
what was going on in my mind in relation to this issue of equity. But 
probably it’s something that the Commission has no business dealing 
10 
with whether during elections what parties are given in terms of airtime 
and so on and so on. But and we have to recognize our boundaries. 
The Commission must recognize its boundaries and leave issues that 
must be dealt with by other institutions and other bodies for those 
institutions to deal with. But it’s something that occurred in my mind as 
you were talking. Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Thank you Chair.  We ended off on 
paragraph 17 and then we went to the transcripts, so just to get beck 
onto track onto your main statement so we’re going to go to the 
statement, that would be in file A on page six, paragraph 18. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that’s going back to CC19A. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Have you got the correct file?  
CHAIRPERSON:   CC19A page six. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Paragraph 18, we’re continuing with 
your findings. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 84 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page six of your statement, the red figure, the red 
number at the top. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     Six. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Page six okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And paragraph 18.      
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Are you there? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Can you just read out the following 
finding that was concluded in the report? 
10 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Line 18 or paragraph 18? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Paragraph 18. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   “The evidence shows that from the 
 
year 2012 up until the year 2017 SABC executives took 
 
instructions from people with no authority in the newsroom, 
for  
example we quote, the Chairperson of the SABC Board or the 
 
Communications Minister.  The executives thus failed to 
 
execute their duties in terms of the editorial policies which I 
 
just quoted now.  The Commission further found that 
 
Nonthando Maseko Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane and Nyana Molete 
20 
 
were pivotal to the execution of instructions from Hlaudi 
 
Motsoeneng, Jimi Matthews and Simon Ndebele.  They 
 
succumbed because of threats of dismissal from the 
immediate  
superiors that’s the enforcers we were talking about 
earlier”. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 85 of 92 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, do you want him to read the rest of the 
paragraphs? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Just paragraph 19 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   “Our last recommendation which we 
think is very key to the independence of the SABC is that the Group 
Chief Executive should not be designated as an Editor in Chief, that 
system which we inherited from the BBC is inappropriate for our 
circumstances”. 
 
Now what happens is that the BBC Director’s General are 
10 
people who have come up the ranks from producing programmes 
etcetera right up to the point where they now become Director General, 
so they are [indistinct] in the production…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They are journalists?    
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Now what we have in South Africa is 
that we get a business man to come and run the SABC who is not 
familiar with the world of journalism, so it’s unfair to make him the 
Editor in Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
20 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   So we recommended that the Group 
Executive news should become the pinnacle of the upward [indistinct] 
system. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you, Mr Thloloe yesterday we 
heard the evidence of Ms Pillay and Ms Mbeki both [indistinct] for their 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 86 of 92 
 
dissatisfaction with the outcome of the report.  We’ll start with Ms 
Pillay, Ms Pillay highlighted the fact that people made submissions 
under the impression that their names would remain anonymous and 
this was not proof after they have testified, can you just comment on 
that? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   At the end of our inquiry Mr Tawana 
and myself debated this issues, do we now send each transcript to each 
of the participants to say can we publish this or not and we felt that, a) 
it would delay the process and b) almost all the information we received 
is already in the public domain, it wasn’t as if we’re digging up new 
10 
things.  So we decided we are going ahead and publishing the names 
and the people where there was no – we didn’t anticipate any threat to 
the people who gave evidence to us.  Now there were two Commissions 
appointed at the same time, the one was a sexual harassment 
Commission and the other the Editorial interference…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    When you put it like that it’s sounds inappropriate 
when you say it was a sexual harassment Commission, it was a 
Commission to look into allegations of sexual harassments, yes.    
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Now the confidentiality there is 
understandable…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s like its job was like to carry out sexual 
harassment, so that’s why I’m saying it sounds inappropriate. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Now there the confidentiality was 
appropriate because of the nature of the subject we were dealing with 
and we thought we could publish without any fear of risking anybody’s 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 87 of 92 
 
life or income or whatever so we decided in the end, let us publish 
these names.  The evidence they gave us is in the public domain and I  
must confess that up to this point, not one person has threatened to us 
to say, you published my name against my wishes even Ms Pillay, 
yesterday didn’t say she was opposed to her name being used but she 
was  quoting other people, unknown people who are saying they were 
publicised without their consent. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So but – from what you are saying it seem that you 
are not disputing that the earlier arrangement was that their names 
would not be disclosed, you are simply saying that, that may have been 
10 
so or that was so initially but when we were supposed to issue the 
report here are circumstances that made us feel that there should be no 
problem if we disclose the names, is that right? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Thank you Mr Thloloe, the – Ms 
Gqubule Mbeki also had concerns about the report.  She particularly 
highlighted the fact that there were minor inconsistencies, things that 
actually did not occur, she highlighted the fact in her evidence that 
there was a particular meeting where it was stated in the report that Mr 
20 
Matthews and Ms Ditlhakanyane attended a meeting but this was not 
the case, can you comment on that? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes Ms Gqubule has brought that to 
my attention and I checked it and I found that she was right.  Sibolelo 
was placed in a meeting where I was trying to say, Sekonyela who is a 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 88 of 92 
 
communications person for Brian Molefe at the time.  So instead of 
typing Sekonyela I typed Sebolelo, so it was an error on my part.  The 
second one was Jimi Matthews at a meeting with Alan Tshabalala.  The 
sequence of events there is that Jimi Matthews was not in that meeting 
but the following day he went to the newsroom and dictated an apology 
to Brian Molefe.  So I think in the hurry to finish the report I just 
[indistinct] from the meeting to the next day where he dictated a letter 
of apology to Brian Molefe.  The two mistakes do not – the two errors I 
committed, in fact there were three errors I committed where do not in 
any way affect the outcome of that finding.  The point is the point is 
10 
Jimi Matthews succumbed to a demand from outside the newsroom for 
an apology, when in fact he shouldn’t have, he should have stood by 
his staff and said we will not apologise.  Whether he did it the day 
before or the day after doesn’t materially affect the truth of the finding. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Mr Thloloe you just highlighted, just 
not to lose track that you wanted to finish the report in time you were in 
a hurry process trying to finish this report.  Now this report is dated the 
25 t h of February 2019, was this the date in which the report was 
submitted? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Yes that’s the day we submitted the 
20 
report. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Who did you submit the report to? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   It was delivered to the Group Chief 
Executive but he in turn told us that this is in fact a Board document 
and therefore needs to be submitted to the Board management couldn’t 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 89 of 92 
 
handle that report and the report – I handed the report over to the 
Board on the – in July on the 23 r d of July because there was – the 
Board wasn’t [indistinct] for the months that we were working on this 
thing. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    So just to clarify you handed the 
report to the Board on the – in July 2019? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Ja July this year and it was made 
public in August this year, on the 5 t h of August. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      And just going back to your 
statement, in paragraph 12 on page five…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have gone beyond 1 o’clock. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Oh sorry apologies Chair, we have 
gone – I was not au fait with the time, however upon the Chair’s 
approval I do not feel that this witness will be any longer, I think at 
most we would be ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I was hoping less than ten minutes from what I 
see you have covered…[intervenes] 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Yes Chair I was just exaggerating so 
just two things     
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay don’t exaggerate just ask two or three 
20 
questions that probably are – you still want to ask and I’m sure we will 
be done. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      No actually this is the final question 
so we should done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay then next one is the final one or you mean the 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 90 of 92 
 
last one you did is the final one? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    No this one is the final one?    
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one is the final one, the…[intervenes]. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   The last one.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you very much Mr Thloloe for 
having come forward to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very 
much, should the need arise we will ask you to come back but there 
might not be a need but if the need arises we will ask you to come 
back. 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   Mr Chair I thought she was asking if 
10 
we should accept this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:       Well you heard me ask a few times whether the 
last question was the previous one or the one that she was still coming, 
she ultimately said it was the previous one but I see that the way that 
she is looking at me now is like she wants to change her mind, do you 
want to ask one last question? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes Chair, I blame sleep depravation, 
apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   In paragraph 12 Mr Thloloe you 
20 
highlight that the report and the findings should be adopted by the 
Commission being mindful of the fact that there’s a transcript missing, 
wold you rather make a submission that this report be provisionally 
adopted by the Commission, can you elaborate on this paragraph? 
MR JOSEPH NONG THLOLOE:   The typographical errors I’ve already 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158 
 
Page 91 of 92 
 
mentioned, the transcript is still outstanding but as soon as I have it 
available I can submit it, I don’t know what else happens after I submit 
that transcript but I would ask that this report be provisionally 
accepted. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No I think what will happen is we – I probably will 
find a lot of help from the report we’ll look at it, maybe adopting might 
be a formal term that one can look at but certainly one assumes that 
there will be a lot of help that one can gain from this report and that in 
the end the assistance that the Commission would have derived from it 
would be acknowledged in one way or another, yes, okay thank you but 
10 
I think it will be important that whatever is remaining in terms of the 
transcript that is not before the Commission yes should be made 
available as soon as possible and to the extent that there may be 
certain errors to which you have spoken it would be important that  
there is a clear document that makes it clear where those errors are 
and so that when one goes through it, one bears in mind those errors 
that have been admitted, okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Thank you Chair we will facilitate 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Thank you very much we appreciate your 
20 
coming to assist the Commission, thank you very much you are 
excused.  Ms Mpho that is the end for today, on Monday we start at ten. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       Yes thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who do we have on Monday again? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:       We have…[intervenes]. 
6 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 158
