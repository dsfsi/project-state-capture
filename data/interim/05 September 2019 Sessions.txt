ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Krivani you have submitted two 
statements to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Pillay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay sorry.  We have become very 
acquainted – apologies.  Apologies Ms Pillay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  No problem at all. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay you have submitted two 
statements to the commission the first statement being your main 
statement and the second statement being your supplementary 
statement.  The purpose of your second statement was to correct 
10 
mistakes from your first statement. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And also just to put forth additional 
information that was not contained in your second statement – in your 
first statement. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Pillay is your first name spelt with an I after R? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or with an E – an I? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It is an I – Krivani. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think that the people who prepare these 
bundles you have to check. Remember was it yesterday – not yesterday 
the day before yesterday that instead of writing Mzwamadoda in regard 
to Mr Mxakwe they had written something else which I did read out just 
something else and I see here with Ms Pillay in the statement it is 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 4 of 230 
 
written correctly but on the divider it is Kre – they must just take the 
trouble to make sure people’s names are written correctly, their 
surnames are written correctly.  It is not difficult. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair.  We will relay that message 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Apologies for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Krivani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Krivani the first 
page of the document in front of you can you identify that document? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  This is the statement that I provided to the 
commission. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Your main statement? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  My main statement. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And if you turn on page 8 of that same 
document. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Is that your signature? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And when did you sign this statement? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  On the 13 t h August. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And if we go to your second 
supplementary statement that would be on page 23.   
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 5 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  .Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And we turn over to page 24 is that 
your signature on that statement? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And can you just identify the 
corrections… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what page is the supplementary? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  It is on page 23 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  20? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  23, 23 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  23.  Well I have just seen what they wrote in regard 
to Mr Mxakwe which I talked about.  They wrote Mzwamadod instead of 
Mzwamadoda so – okay, yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Can you just identify the corrections 
that you wanted to amend on your main statement? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  My – the correction was the chronological order 
just to get the date of the time of events which was paragraphs 10 and 
11 in my original statement and in my supplementary I added the letter 
20 
that my colleagues Busisiwe Ntuli and Jacques Steenkamp had sent to 
Mr Motsoeneng and the news executives. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And other than that though – other than 
those corrections and additions are you satisfied with both your main 
and supplementary statement? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 6 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes oh sorry one more thing is in paragraph 20 
of my main statement I mentioned that I received an email saying that 
there would no analysis of President Zuma’s State of the Nation 
Address the correction it was not an email it was a verbal instruction. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.   
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay can you please tell us where 
you are currently employed? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I am currently employed at the SABC in my 
current title of Executive Producer of SAFM Current Affairs. I was 
10 
recently seconded for the duration of November 2018 to June 2019 as 
Head of Elections for SABC News coordinating election content for 
radio, television and digital.  I am now back to my original title of 
Executive Producer of SAFM Current Affairs. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And can you just give us just a short 
background of how long you have been with the SABC and just a short 
career background? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I have been a journalist for almost nineteen 
years of which sixteen has been with broken service at the SABC.  I 
started off as an intern while studying at Rhodes University at the 
20 
SABC newsroom in Durban and subsequently once I got my undergrad, 
my Bachelor of Journalism from Rhodes I worked at the university a 
little bit and then I went on to join the newsroom as a field reporter and 
as a current affairs anchor.  I worked my way up through the ranks 
particularly in radio and then was head hunted to join SAFM Current 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 7 of 230 
 
Affairs in 2006 – 2007 where I stayed and worked my way up to senior 
anchor, senior producer.  I then took a break from the SABC and I went 
to the EWN newsroom and ENCA newsroom where I worked as both an 
anchor and then assignments and editor for ENCA.  Came back to 
SABC in the position that I currently hold.  My qualifications I 
matriculated at Durban Girls Secondary School.  I then have a Bachelor 
of Journalism from Rhodes as well as a Masters.  I have a diploma of 
European Journalism from the [indistinct] School of Utrecht in the 
Netherlands.  I have a diploma in Advanced Broadcasting from the 
Thomson Foundation and Cardiff University.  I have a diploma in 
10 
Essentials in Broadcast Management from the Saul Plaaitjie Institute in 
Rhodes University and I have a diploma in Media Executive Training 
Program with Bloomberg and the Gordon Institute of Business Science 
with the University of Pretoria. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.  Ms Pillay in 
paragraph 3 of your main statement that will be on page 1 the 
investigators of the commission approached you, can you just identify 
the purpose of this approach? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Well it was to find out about the so called 
editorial interference at the SABC and to get – to share the evidence 
20 
and our experiences of what we went through in the Watershed time of 
2016 for about a period of about eighteen months as the so called 
SABC8. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you.  Ms Pillay from paragraph 6 
that would be on page 2 of your main statement where you highlight the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 8 of 230 
 
editorial and political interference.  There was a media statement that 
was issued according to ban protest policy.  Can you just touch base 
and talk to that? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Okay so on the 26 t h May 2016 Chair we had 
heard through a media statement that Hlaudi Motsoeneng had decided 
to implement – it was not – we called it the protest policy but there was 
not a formal policy where you would ban visuals of protest action and 
we were not told as a news division officially we all had to find out 
through a media statement.  And as the executive producer of the show 
of SAFM Current Affairs I together with my colleague Aubrey [indistinct] 
10 
we co-manage a team.  At the time the shows were called AM Live Mid-
Day Live and PM Live and out team of senior producers decided to 
tackle this issue on the Sunday morning edition of the program called 
The Editors.   The Editors is a program that really looks at the media 
industry as a whole.  We reflect on the decisions we have made as 
editorial staff.  We look at how our colleagues over the different 
platforms have covered news and it is interesting to give this kind of 
information 
to 
the 
citizenry 
because 
the 
angles 
that 
certain 
broadcasters, certain newspapers may take could have to do with who 
owns them.  You know some people take one angle of covering the 
20 
story others take a different view and it is – and it is part of our 
approach in the editors to give our listeners all types and it was a very 
popular programme.  And on the Sunday the first Sunday after this 
media statement was issued the editors took to analyse this – this 
statement.  And when we did so we have editors coming in.  We have 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 9 of 230 
 
listeners calling in and we have an anchor who manages the program.  
Unfortunately that did not go down well with Motsoeneng – Mr 
Motsoeneng and we were subsequently called in to discuss why we had 
taken that stance.  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry that – that program where the editors have 
this engagement would it be on SAFM? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes it was on SAFM on a Sunday morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From a certain time to a certain time? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And the editors would it be editors within SABC or 
10 
you would invite editors from outside as well or how was it composed? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Because the program was a SABC news program 
we would try our absolute best the senior producers and the producers 
would try their best to ensure that one SABC editor would be on the 
program and then the other supporting editors would be from other  
CHAIRPERSON:  Media houses. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Media houses that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: But – but the focus would not just be SABC news it 
would include other media houses their publications. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And their broadcasts. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair so sometimes some newspapers will have 
an exclusive. They would break a story.  For example the Rapport or 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 10 of 230 
 
the Star we would invite that editor to come that weekend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  To give us the background to that exclusive 
breaking story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  How did they get the information?  How long did 
the story take you know from the time they got it to the time that they 
broadcast it.  Because what happens generally in the media industry is 
one publication or broadcaster can break a story but once it is out 
there it is fair play for everybody else to then start tackling the story in 
10 
their news diary.  So this is one of the reasons we do that.  We find the 
first people to have – you know have that exclusivity and we invite them 
on the show. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would – would part of what you would be looking at in 
that program be to what extent there had been fairness to affected 
parties in regard to each story and so ona? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  We could… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be part of what you look at to enable the 
citizenry to appreciate what trouble editors take in order – before a 
story is issued. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  No, no you are absolutely right Chair.  We would 
discuss that.  For example I remember when I was sitting in as an 
anchor for that show.  We did a program where there was a bloodied 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 11 of 230 
 
picture on the front page of the newspaper and we discussed the merits 
of publishing such a picture because you know it is free for all and 
children are actually also having a look at that.  Because in 
broadcasting you have Watershed times and you can protect children 
from some content.  But for example – so we – so I remember on that 
particular day – so that would be some of the – the discussions we 
have.  Did that particular newspaper make the right decision in putting 
such a bloodied picture in – on their front page?  Those are the kind of 
editorial discussions that takes place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So then within the context of the policy that had just 
10 
been issued the media statement in relation to the policy about protest 
pictures that came in in regard to asking the question is it appropriate?  
Is it right for the media not to show protest action?  That would be the 
angle. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That was precisely the angle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Krivani.  Ms Krivani – Ms 
Pillay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  You can call me Ms Krivani. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No please stick to Ms Pillay.  Then during the tea 
break you can – you can revert to Krivani. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes.  Ms Pillay you talk about a 
meeting where you were summoned.  You were summoned with Mr 
Krige, is that correct? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 12 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  What was the purpose for being 
summoned to Mr Motsoeneng’s office? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The purpose of that was – it was about 48 hours 
after the Sunday program.  So Mr Motsoeneng was aggrieved that the 
program criticised his decision because callers that had come in on the 
program wanted the merits of such a decision.  At the SABC and for a 
public broadcaster it is rather bizarre when you are supposed to be 
giving a plurality of views and different perspectives on a story for 
someone to issue a directive to say we are now banning these pictures.  
10 
We are supposed to give and we are duty bound to give the South 
African public all access to the South African news and you know in all 
its manner and form so that they can shape their own opinions of the 
information we are disseminating.  By effectively making such a 
directive you are choosing then to decide, to edit what the audience, 
what your viewer, what your listener, what your reader is then going to 
view.  You are making that decision.  So this is the kind of criticism that 
went on on that show on Sunday.  And we then called to his office on 
the Tuesday to discuss Sunday’s program. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And who else was in attendance at this 
20 
meeting?  You have highlighted that on paragraph 9 on page 3 of your 
main statement. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It was Mr Motsoeneng, it was Jimi Matthews, the 
acting at the time he was the acting Group Chief Executive Officer, it 
was the acting GE of News Mr Simon Thebele, it was Anton Heunis, 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 13 of 230 
 
Anton Heunis was introduced to us as Mr Motsoeneng’s advisor, it was 
the GM of Radio News Ms Sebolelo Ditlhakayane, SABC spokesperson 
Mr Keizer Kganyago and then Mr Krige Foeta and myself.   
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   And in this meeting you state that the 
meetings were recorded and everybody was aware that this meeting 
was recorded. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  This is actually the amendment that I made to 
my supplementary.  So this – the point 11 Chair point 10 and 11 of this 
was actually the recording of a news workshop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Not the recording of this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That was the correction that I made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  In my supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.  In paragraph 12 
of page 3 of your statement you have highlighted what Mr Motsoeneng 
had said in that meeting – particular meeting.  Could you just read it 
out for the record? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   
“We are cleaning up the organisation people are 
doing their own stuff.  There are many journalists 
outside that want to work for the SABC.  The 
environment outside is bad.  No person within the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 14 of 230 
 
SABC is independent.  The SABC is independent this 
is the new SABC.  You must adapt or find a job 
somewhere else.  Editors’ forum must go.  Its 
advertising for rival newspapers.” 
And then he added. 
“If people do not adhere get rid of them we cannot 
have people who question management and this is 
the last time we will have a meeting of this kind.” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And Ms Pillay I have noted that this is 
in quotations was this word for word of what he had said?  Did you take 
10 
notes of it?  How was it – how were you able to put this in your 
statement because it is quotation marks? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So to be quite honest with you Chair this 
statement caught me off my guard because I was just in shock that I 
was actually listening to these kinds of statements.  So this particular 
statement I had only in shorthand and – but Foete Krige had made very 
detailed notes.  So when I – when we had done the meeting Foete had 
tabled – I mean typed out his notes and I compared to my notes and 
this was verbatim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Okay. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So there are some parts where I have also got it 
verbatim.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.  And just to just 
jump to paragraph 13. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 15 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  It continues onto page 4 of your 
statement in terms of what Mr Krige had asked Mr Motsoeneng about 
broadcasting vandalism of public property and so forth.  Can you just 
talk to that paragraph please? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So Mr Krige tried to ask Mr Motsoeneng Chair 
what empirical evidence do you have for all of these decisions to be 
made.  We are not averse to change.  Even in the newsroom change is 
good.  Programs need to be changed.  We need to keep up with the 
trends.  As long as we follow and adhere to the journalistic prescripts.  
10 
If a program does not work it is not popular enough we need to make 
changes?  So we are not averse to change.  But when it comes to 
saying the editors must go a popular program that has deep editorial 
values attached to it.  A program that has a long history.  In fact when I 
was trying to do research on how long the program was it is – even way 
before 1994 the editors has been in session.  So Mr Krige tried to find 
out, well what is the thinking behind such decisions that the editors 
must just go?  And Mr Motsoeneng was not able to give us an 
editorially sound reason.  He was not able to rationalise his reasoning.  
He basically just said we must defend the organisation.  No journalist is 
20 
independent.  The COO has final responsibility for news.  If people do 
not adhere get rid of them we cannot have people who question 
management.  I remember still having my hand up he refused to even 
take my question.  He was really upset.  According to him we had 
brought the SABC or my program had brought the SABC into disrepute 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 16 of 230 
 
because we were discussing a decision he sanctioned and we were 
discussing a decision he made.  But we have to be introspective.  We 
have to be reflective as a newsroom and as an organisation and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was a matter that affects the public? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Absolutely.  I mean we are not here for our own 
personal welfare.  We are here for country duty and we are here for 
public service.  And he did not seem to get that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the reference to editors’ forum was a reference to 
your program? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  My program. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what it was called? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   And he made – when he said that newspapers 
must go Chair he was making reference to two parts of the newspapers.  
On a Monday to Friday a program called AM Live hosted by Sakina 
Kamwendo had a newspapers slot where she would review the 
headlines of the newspapers’.  We would not got through the 
newspaper… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Page by page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  But we would look at the general headlines of 
the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 17 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And then the editors would also have a few 
minutes about three minutes where we look at the Sunday papers.  And 
it is common practice. It is age old tradition.  It is done on international 
broadcasters as well.  One of the reasons we do this it – actually there 
is two reasons we do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Some newspapers are not national they are only 
available in certain parts of the country.  It is important for listeners 
and viewers to know what is happening around the country. That is 
number 1.  Number 2 it is also important to see what angle the SABC 
10 
has taken and what angle Times Live has taken.  Or what angle the 
SABC has taken and what angle the Citizen has taken for example.  It 
is to give that kind of varying coverage plurality of views and 
perceptions – perspectives to – I mean this really is what the editors is 
all about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I happen to know that in one of the TV channels 
that shows what is happening in England they have those discussions 
like that I think particularly I think on – I think Saturday evening.  Well I 
happen to know that in one of the TV channels that shows what is 
happening in England they have those discussions like that I think 
20 
particularly I think on – I think Saturday evening. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The BBC 
CHAIRPERSON:  Evening for the Sunday ones. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know preview and look at different newspapers 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 18 of 230 
 
and I think within the country there are other people who do the same. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It is common industry practice ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but he did not like that either. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Well I do not think he – I do not think he had an 
issue with the program at all itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It was just because this Sunday catapulted him 
to the top of the agenda.  His decision was criticised.  His decision was 
10 
then being debated and disputed on the show.  And this must have got 
his attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But because of that he was now saying the program 
must go. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The program must go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they are – that is what you say here.  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And the newspapers must go as well.  So the 
newspapers on the AM Live portion of the morning and the newspapers 
on the Editors program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes.  Okay. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay you have just stated in 
paragraph 13 what Mr Motsoeneng had said just in the second line. 
“The COO has the final responsibility for news.” 
Was this the first time that you have heard that the COO has the final 
responsibility for news or was this a norm? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 19 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  This was the first time that I had heard from him 
that the final responsibility of news because I had only come back to 
the SABC – sorry Chair I have sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you must look at me more than at her. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Sorry Chair.  Chair this was the first time that I 
had heard that because I had only just recently returned to the SABC.  
It was a couple of months prior to that.  So when I had heard that I 
thought maybe he made a mistake.  But then Jimi Matthews was sitting 
you know right next to him and he did not correct him.  And that is 
when I had also heard subsequently no but this is the angle in which he 
10 
is moving toward. He has apparently made changes that – that the 
Editor in Chief is now the COO and not the CEO. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay and in paragraph 15 of you 
statement you talk about the cancellation of the editors. What was the 
aftermath and consequence of the removal of this show? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It was awful.  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the program was actually moved? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It was cancelled.  It was cancelled immediately.  
It was the lowest point of my career because it was left up to me to 
have to go to my colleagues, my senior producers and producers and 
20 
let them know what had just transpired in a meeting.  I felt 
embarrassed.  I felt like I let the team down.  I did try my best to garner 
reasoning from Mr Motsoeneng that I can take back to my team.  He 
would not listen to any – he would not even entertain my questions at 
that meeting and I was basically told you have no choice on the matter 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 20 of 230 
 
and if you do not do it you know my job was threatened.  
I subsequently came back to the office and we made the 
announcement to the team.  I - it did not sit well with me at all.  I had 
sleepless nights afterwards because when I was a student at Rhodes 
University SAFM was the program - it was the pinnacle program that a 
journalist worked toward and the fact that I was now sitting in a 
position that I had aspired to be sitting in and - and a program of this 
calibre was removed under my watch I really felt that I let down my 
team and I let down listeners and I took it quite personally. 
My colleague Busisiwe Ntuli then after hearing about what 
10 
happened - Thandeka and Busisiwe had come to my office and Busisiwe 
basically said what are you going to do about it and I said I cannot be 
quiet anymore because this has gone too far and that is when 
Busisiwe Ntuli, Jacques Steenkamp and myself sat down to draft this 
letter to Mr Motsoeneng and Busisiwe and Jacques said we will support 
you. 
It is not our program but we will support you because we 
believe in the program and - and we also believe that what he has done 
is wrong.  So we got together the three of us and we drafted this letter.  
By this time our colleagues Thandeka, Foeta and Suna were already 
20 
suspended.  Thandeka joined us when we had our meeting and we 
looked at the journalistic prescripts. 
We looked at editorial independence.  We drafted a letter and 
we asked Mr Motsoeneng we just want you to tell us - guide us as to 
your thinking as to why these programs in the newspapers are 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 21 of 230 
 
cancelled.  Tell us why you are suspending colleagues who are just 
debating and - and we sent that letter off and I only felt better once 
that letter was sent. 
So we - we sent off that letter but the senior producers I had 
asked them to keep all the emails and Chair every day without fail 
every day we were getting emails.  I still have them stored on my 
laptop.  The senior producers were collecting disgruntled emails from 
listeners who have been listening for years and listeners who are in 
rural areas.  Remember radio is a very powerful tool. 
There is only a few people that are on social media but radio 
10 
is accessible to everyone and they were very upset and they wanted 
the program to come back and quite a few listeners including one 
Anita Jonker as a lecturer at a university she went straight to the 
BCCSA and the rest of the listeners came to us and we still forwarded 
those emails to Mr Motsoeneng but nobody was willing to listen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I take you back?  I should have asked you earlier 
when this - the media statement that told the public about what you 
later termed the protest policy you said that you only got to know about 
it from the media.  Was it usual at SABC that if there was to be a new 
policy on something or if there was to be a change of policy on 
20 
something there would be no consultation - prior consultations with all 
those who may be affected by it? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes and no Chair.  Sometimes there is 
consultation and sometimes there is not.  We have in the organisation 
what we call rediffusion where everybody from across the country and - 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 22 of 230 
 
all the offices tune in and listen when either the executives of the board 
get together to - to disseminate information to us or to perhaps talk 
about the possibility of introducing a new policy to gauge views. 
So that is one way.  Sometimes it happens but this there was 
certainly no consultation.  This was a directive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  On - on this … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On this particular one and the issue that the final 
responsibility for news now lay with the - with him and I think you have 
said and other witnesses said that the norm was that the Editor in Chief 
10 
would be the Group CEO.  Now was that also not notified to the 
newsroom - to the news people in advance? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I stand to be corrected Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  In my recollection I was not notified via … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Email or via rediffusion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Or anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You only got to know at the meeting? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Then let us go back 
to you - you were talking about the reaction of the listeners of the 
program … 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Hm. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 23 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the cancellation of the program.  If you still want 
to say something you can continue. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair, I also - I received a lot of hate mail on 
social media which - some of it is still there - where - where people 
thought that I made the decision to cancel the editors because I am the 
Executive Producer of the show.  It was very hard for me to have to go 
through that because it was not of my doing but I was not going to - to 
undertake a discussion with - with listeners on - on social media. 
A - a statement was never issued to say that it was 
Mr Motsoeneng’s decision.  So I had to bear the brunt but eventually 
10 
obviously with the advent of speaking out and - and with Parliament 
etcetera then the viewers realised it was - it was not of my personal 
doing that the - that the program was cancelled.  Also I used to field a 
lot of telephone calls. 
My - my office number was circulated and I would sit on the 
phone with listeners and they were very upset.  Ja, and - and that is 
the extent of the disgruntled nature of our listeners and which was - it 
was very sad because this is effectively the people we have to serve. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The media statement which had announced the policy 
20 
did it not make it clear that it was Mr Motsoeneng who had made the 
decision? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it simply say SABC without saying who? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I - I do not recall.  I wonder if it is here as a … 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 24 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well if it is we will check.  I just … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just - I just think of this situation where people think 
you are the one who made the decision. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you did not make the decision. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It is - public deception is a cruel thing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Even when a year ago there were changes made 
to SAFM where current affair hours were reduced drastically from six 
10 
hours to two hours a day.  I was - also had to bear the brunt of social 
media bullying because it was very popular programs that were 
cancelled. 
AM live and PM live and that too - listeners thought that I was 
behind that and they - some of them went as far as likening me to 
Mr Motsoeneng saying that I am as bad as - as he is and - and again I 
kept quiet.  I blocked people who were bullying me on social media but 
I never engaged.  I just did not engage with the public on social media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you.  The media statement we 
20 
currently do not have it but during the tea break we can attempt to - to 
source it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay just to stay just on top of 
your evidence.  You mentioned a letter that was sent.  That is attached 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 25 of 230 
 
on your - on your supplementary statement.  That is on page 25 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually earlier on I thought I had found the 
supplementary statement but I discovered that I had not.  Now I found 
it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
you 
say 
the 
letter 
is 
attached 
to 
the 
supplementary statement? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair on page 25. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay that is - that is the - is this 
10 
the letter that was sent to Mr Motsoeneng after the canning of the 
editors? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair this - this letter is quite lengthy 
but I find it very critical that Ms Pillay does read it into record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well she can do one of two things.  One, if she 
able to tell me the main features of the contents of the letter without 
reading it.  Maybe reading one or two paragraphs that is fine but if you 
think there is particular importance you know reading the whole letter 
that will be fine.  What is your own sense? 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair my own sense is that the entire 
letter is important because it touches base on the editors.  It also 
touches base of you know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The purge and suspension of the other 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 26 of 230 
 
members of the SABC eight and so forth … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay (intervenes). 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In that context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She may read it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay can you just also just identify 
you know from the top who the letter was sent to, who was also cc’d in 
the letter and the contents of the letter? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Okay.  Chair the letter was for attention SABC 
10 
Chief Operating Officer Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng at SABC Radio Park 
corner of Henley and Artillery Road.  It was also copied to 
Jimi Matthews Acting Group CEO, to Simon Tebele Acting GE News, to 
Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane GM Radio News, to Nyana Molete Acting GM 
TV, to Angie Kapelianis National Editor Radio Current Affairs, to 
Nothando Maseko Acting Head TV Current Affairs and to Zolisa Sigabi 
National Bulletin Editor.  The title was: 
“Request for Editorial Policy Clarity and Concern 
over Unfair Suspensions:  we the undersigned write 
this letter to you to register our displeasure and 
20 
increasing concern about the recent developments 
occurring in the SABC Newsroom.  Our newsroom 
has become a source of derision, despair and 
criticism from the people that we are fundamentally 
accountable to the public at large.  In particular the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 27 of 230 
 
developments of the past week have heightened the 
sense of fear, lack of clarity about our journalistic 
responsibility and low staff morale permeating our 
newsrooms because of what we considered to be 
normal 
editorial 
engagements 
and 
the 
usual 
contestation of ideas during a diary meeting.  In 
addition we are of the view that the recent 
decisions to remove the newspaper slots and the 
editors on SAFM’s AM live amounts to what we 
consider 
censorship 
unless 
reasonable 
and 
10 
professional explanations can be advanced within in 
the framework of our Editorial Policy and our 
obligation to serve the public.  As seasoned 
journalists within the SABC we maintain that the 
reasons given for these sudden decisions contradict 
our governing policies and legislation.  Namely the 
SABC 
Editorial 
Code, 
the 
South 
African 
Broadcasting 
Act 
and 
the 
South 
African 
Constitution.  As journalist having to operationalise 
the policies of this public institution which is 
20 
important for the promotion of our democracy we 
feel aggrieved that the image of our institution, our 
journalist integrity continues to be compromised by 
unconstitutional pronouncements that erode the 
credibility of the SABC and the journalistic integrity 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 28 of 230 
 
of all of us who work for it.  Furthermore we wish to 
register our deep concern for our colleagues who 
have been suspended for expressing their right to 
freedom of expression by simply debating and 
assessing 
the 
newsworthiness 
of 
events 
as 
expected during editorial meetings.  As such we 
view 
the 
suspensions 
of 
Thandeka Gqubule, 
Foeta Krige 
and 
Suna Venter 
as 
acts 
of 
victimisation.  An editorial meeting is to debate, 
deliberate, argue and find consensus on news 
10 
stories. 
 
However 
based 
on 
the 
recent 
developments it seems that this no longer allowed 
during editorial line talks.  A situation that we 
believe needs to be challenged.  We are ethically 
and legally bound by the provisions of the South 
African Constitution in particular Section 161(a) 
Chapter 2 in the Bill of Rights.  Likewise we are 
bound by the Broadcasting Act and the SABC’s 
mandate from the South African public.  We are 
shocked 
by 
the 
latest 
pronouncements 
that 
20 
fundamentally erode the right of the public to know 
the whole story about the developments in their 
communities and to display such stories in a 
responsible manner as has been done as per ICASA 
and BCCSA requirements.  These pronouncements 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 29 of 230 
 
affectively render our newsrooms incapable of 
providing compelling audio visual content that 
educates and informs the public to disseminate 
balanced and accurate information.  We the 
undersigned therefore request an urgent meeting 
with the COO to gain clarity and resolve the above 
indicated matters.  Our primary interest is to clarify 
the confusion and find a lasting solution that will 
also provide guidelines on all issues editorial.  
Lastly we hope that this will also restore our public 
10 
image and uphold our integrity in the eyes of those 
we are meant to serve.  Signed, Busisiwe Ntuli 
Executive 
Producer 
Special 
Assignment, 
Krivani Pillay Executive Producer SAFM Current 
Affairs and Jacques Steenkamp Senior Investigative 
Reporter.” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.  Did you ever 
receive a - a response or you know a meeting with the then CEO Mr - 
Mr Motsoeneng? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  No Chair I did not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I take it that - that reference to Section 161(a) 
Chapter 2 in the Bill of Rights may have been a - a typo because the - 
you must have been referring to the Section 16. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  16, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subsection 1(a) … 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 30 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which deals with freedom of expression and so on? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  What was the 
consequence if any what - what happened after issuing this letter? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  After issuing this - this letter was issued on 
Saturday or Sunday.  On the Monday morning Jimi Matthews had 
resigned via social media.  We all found out via social media Chair and 
then four days later on a Thursday afternoon I was given notice to 
10 
appear before a disciplinary hearing on the Friday.  I was given less 
than 24 hours’ notice to appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When that happened there had been no response 
from Mr Motsoeneng to the letter or there had been? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  There had been no response.  That was the first 
time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh or was that the response? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That was the response was the disciplinary 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, hm. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay if you can just turn to page 
27?  It is just after the letter. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Is this the letter you - you are speaking 
about the response that you received for you to go to a disciplinary 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 31 of 230 
 
hearing?  Can you just talk to this letter? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So this is the letter I received after the 
disciplinary hearing.  There is one letter missing which is the first one 
which we will try and get to you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Sorry Chair.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The one letter is the invite to the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The disciplinary hearing. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The disciplinary hearing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Which was a Thursday afternoon to be there for 
a disciplinary hearing on a Friday morning.  I had not been unionised at 
that time and my colleagues quickly rallied around me to basically sign 
union membership forms.  The first union I called was CWU.  I was told 
that a shop steward would come and meet me.  The shop steward came 
and basically wasted my time because I subsequently found out that 
CWU had no intention to represent me. 
I called BEMAWU.  I was not a member of BEMAWU but 
BEMAWU already had another disciplinary hearing that - that their shop 
20 
steward was attending the next day.  I effectively had no assistance.  I 
waited till 7 o’ clock for CWU to return to my office to assist me in 
preparing for this disciplinary hearing.  Nobody arrived.  I then looked 
out of the SABC. 
A friend of mine is a lawyer by profession.  She then arrived 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 32 of 230 
 
at my home and upon one look at the notice for DC laughed it off 
saying it was less than 24 hours to appear before a DC.  That in itself 
is against labour laws but she did nevertheless help me prepare.  I got 
to the DC on Friday morning and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we - before we get to the DC what was the 
charge that the letter that called you to a disciplinary inquiry told you, 
you were going to face or charges? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  They said that we were - we - we had basically 
brought the SABC into disrepute.  So that we wrote a letter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh -oh is the letter at 27 - page 27 the one that you 
10 
got … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or does it reflect the charges? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So this is similar to the charges that were in the 
first letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Ja.  So that is why I am - I am trying to recall - I 
beg your pardon Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  What was in that first one which … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I will ensure that I get to the evidence leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you say the charges referred to here … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  These are pretty much … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are basically the same? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 33 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Let us - let us hear what the charges are 
before we get to the actually hearing.  Maybe she can read. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Ms Pillay can you just read the 
charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes or just say what the charges are. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  “You are hereby notified in terms of 
Schedule 8 of the Labour Relations Act Number 66 
of 1995 that allegations have been received that 
you are continuing to commit further acts of 
10 
misconduct after receiving your letter informing you 
of your disciplinary hearing.” 
So these were additional to the - to the first disciplinary … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the first ones? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Letter Chair.  So the fact … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That we were speaking to the media - so: 
“You wrote a letter to the SABC COO raising 
concerns in relation to the instruction given by him 
and leaked it to the media platforms thereby 
20 
displaying disrespect and persistence in your 
refusal to comply with an instruction pertaining to 
the Editorial Policy of the SABC as well as the 
directive not to broadcast visuals, audio of the 
destruction of property during protest action.  Since 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 34 of 230 
 
the policies and personnel were …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Before that … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right to think that paragraph 1.1 which you have 
just read seems to suggest that even raising concerns with this COO 
was a problem? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct Chair and that is also how … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How - how can that be a problem when somebody 
raises concerns with - with you about issues at work? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  This is the kind of environment we worked in at 
10 
that time Chair.  Nothing made sense really.  The - the directives that 
were issued out, the - just nothing made sense.  I want to say it was 
the ramblings of a madman.  So - you know to edit it but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Really nothing made sense. Just us inquiring … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  About it and it as a very diplomatic letter in my - 
in my opinion that we had sent out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well may - may - maybe - maybe there might - in 
certain circumstances maybe there might be something about any 
20 
allegation of leaking it outside but when one reads there one gets the 
sense that part of - of the problem is that you raised concerns. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes.  We questioned the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how - how does it become  
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And how do you work in a newsroom? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 35 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Objectionable to these concerns? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Newsroom - journalistic principles are all about 
asking questions.  Any story you do you ask a question.  That is how 
we get out stories and how is it that you can run a newsroom without 
allowing the very people who are supposed to be asking questions by 
profession are not supposed to ask you questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what do you do if you do not understand the 
directive … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Well we would not know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without raising concerns? 
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Because we were never afforded the audience or 
- or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The response to our letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright.  1.2. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  1.2: 
“Since the policies and personnel regulations are 
incorporated into your employment contract your 
conduct as stated above constitutes a contravention 
of Paragraph 2(d) of the Regulations in that you 
20 
made comments or published an article in the media 
on your terms and conditions of the contract while 
you were in service of the SABC without prior 
consent of the Group Chief Executive.” 
1.3: 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 36 of 230 
 
“It also contravenes section - Regulation 2(e) in 
that it constitutes a refusal to obey and carry out 
reasonable and lawful instructions including the 
policies and regulations of the SABC.  It amounts to 
insubordination and contravenes Clause 2.1 of the 
Disciplinary Code and Procedure.” 
1.4: 
“It undermines the editorial responsibility and 
authority of the SABC as vested upon its Chief 
Operating Officer in terms of Paragraph 2 of the 
10 
SABC Revised Editorial Policy 2016.” 
Point 2: 
“Since receiving your …” 
So those are just the charges now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Maybe for the sake of completeness you 
can read the … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the last two paragraphs. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Point 2: 
“Since receiving your disciplinary hearing notice 
you continuously took part in media interviews with 
various 
daily 
newspapers 
resulting 
in 
the 
publication of articles wherein you had criticised 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 37 of 230 
 
and displayed disrespect and persistence in your 
refusal to comply with an instruction pertaining to 
the Editorial Policy of the SABC as well as the 
directive not to broadcast visuals, audio of the 
destruction of property during protest action.  Your 
conduct 
constituted 
a 
contravention 
of 
the 
prescripts set out in Paragraphs 1.2 to 1.4.” 
Point number 3: 
“You are accordingly afforded an opportunity to 
state your case in response to these allegations.  In 
10 
that regard you are entitled to prepare that 
response with the assistance of a trade union 
representative, a fellow employee or lawyers of 
your own choice.  Such response must be delivered 
to my office no later than 4 o’ clock on Friday 
15 July failing which I will assume you have no 
answer to the allegations levelled against you.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Before we proceed I just want to take you back 
to soon after you had sent the letter to Mr Motsoeneng and to the 
copies - copied other people including Mr Jimi Matthews.  You said that 
20 
you had sent the letter on a Saturday and … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I beg your pardon Chair.  It was a Sunday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh a Sunday? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then you say - you said soon thereafter or 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 38 of 230 
 
was it the following day Mr Jimi Matthews resigned? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So we - if I correctly remember it was early 
evening Sunday night Chair.  We had sent off the letter.  We had all 
met to sign - scan it and send it and on my way to work on Monday 
morning roundabout 7 o’ clock I received a phone call from another 
media house asking if I had heard about the resignation of 
Jimi Matthews and that was how I found it and it was about a couple of 
hours later that I had seen the social media post that he had indeed 
resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do -  do you know whether his resignation was 
10 
connected in anyway with the stand that you would or what you said in 
the letter as a group or you do not …? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I found the timing to be quite coincidental … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  But I - I could not say for sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You could not say?  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you.  Ms Pillay on that letter 
page 28 paragraph 2 it is stated that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Page 28 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Paragraph 2.  It is stated that the 
directive not to broadcast destruction of property in - in protests and so 
forth.  Was that in line with the Editorial Policy? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That was not in line with the Editorial Policy.  
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 39 of 230 
 
The Editorial Policy is clear Chair - I beg your pardon.  The Editorial 
Policy is clear.  The only thing that we are not going to broadcast if 
something incites violence or racism or things that are against our Bill 
of Rights in the Constitution.  That is - you know there is - there is just 
- there is a whole lot of prescripts - editorial prescripts. 
I do not understand how showing the destruction of property - 
I want to give you some context Chair.  These protest policy - protest 
action are service delivery protests that were have - that were 
occurring across the country.  The timing of this was just weeks before 
an election.  All the people that we were interviewing that we were 
10 
viewing that we were - the community leaders that we had on our 
programs talked about service delivery. 
They talked about access to water and sanitation.  They 
talked about homes.  They talked about jobs.  They talked about food.  
They talked about infrastructure, right.  They - they then named their 
councillors.  They named the governing party.  They named 
Government.  According to them their leaders were to blame for 
non-service delivery. 
 
So when somebody says I am going to ban this, the audio and 
the video, weeks before an election, when somebody is criticising an 
20 
administration in power, that’s also running for the same election, how 
else do you interpret that Chair?   
 
For me that was already the start of a capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me take you back before we proceed, let us 
go back to that meeting where you were confronted about the protest 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 40 of 230 
 
policy as you came to call it.   You said that Mr Krieger did say 
something, you said that you raised your hand you wanted to say 
something but you were not given a chance.  Were there other people 
who spoke at that meeting other than Mr Motsoeneng and I think you 
said Mr Jimmy Matthews also spoke, were there other people who 
spoke at the meeting, and if so what did they say? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     The GM of radio Miss Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane 
was there with us, she attempted to defend the show, the editors but he 
still wouldn’t listen to her even though she was my line manager’s 
manager.  So very senior person but he wouldn’t even let her finish her 
10 
sentence as senior as she was.  So he didn’t let her speak and he 
didn’t let me speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I just want to make sure I don’t mix up issue, there’s 
only on meeting, I think that we have talked about so far, did it discuss 
both the issue of the problem – the editor’s forum and newspapers and 
the protest policy or was there no meeting at which the protest policy 
was discussed? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:    This was the one and only meeting I had with 
Motsoeneng Chair in which he discussed the editors and the 
newspapers with my programmes and – because those programmes 
20 
were talking about the protest policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh so the protest policy was discussed because of 
that okay, so I got it right. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     The content yes on those programmes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so I got it right, okay so only those people 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 41 of 230 
 
spoke at that meeting? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    And Mr Krieger spoke but did Mr 
Motsoeneng say to you why he thought it was justified to come up with 
this policy at that meeting? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     There was no justification Chair, he said he 
was in charge, to paraphrase Chair, these are not the exact word, it 
was basically my decision goes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes okay thank you and I think we were – when 
I interrupted you we were about to talk about the disciplinary hearing 
10 
and because I wanted to know what the charge were, we went to a 
letter that seems to have been a later letter, is that right? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes so I just want to make sure we don’t end up 
skipping the disciplinary hearing, what happened to it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Yes, Miss Pillay you stated, just for 
clarity purposes because we have dealt with this subsequent letter you 
received after the first letter. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    You said you received less than 24 
20 
hours to appear at the disciplinary hearing, you receive it on Thursday, 
Friday was supposed to be your DC.  Now with this letter it’s dated the 
8 t h of July and you were to write a response to these charges on the 
15 t h of July, now that’s more than 24 hours.  When did you receive this 
letter, the third letter? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 42 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     So this is the second letter, 8 t h of July – Chair 
it’s the second letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes the one that you got on the Thursday, you said 
you don’t have here but you would try to get it for us. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     I don’t have so that would be Thursday’s date 
for Friday’s disciplinary, Friday…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was it the 16 t h of June, I think I saw some date the 
Thursday…[intervenes]. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     No it couldn’t have been the 16 t h of June Chair 
it would have been early – it would have been end June early July. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     Chair so I went to the disciplinary hearing with 
Jacques Steenkamp and Busisiwe Ntuli who had their labour union reps 
with them and solidarity kindly offered to assist me free of charge 
because I was, for want of a better word, a lone ranger there on Friday 
without any union representivity and solidarity had told me that they 
would represent me pro bono and sit with me in the DC. That DC 
started and because of the argument that we had…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And who was chairing it? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     Chair, I can’t remember but it was a gentleman 
20 
that was flown in, I think, from Free State Province, flown in 
specifically to chair this DC. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:     And –so into it the union representatives 
argue why the DC could not go ahead and the…[intervenes]. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 43 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry, this DC you have mentioned a number of 
other colleagues of yours that came with you, but that DC was for you 
only or were there a number of you facing charges in the same 
disciplinary hearing? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   The three of us who wrote the letter to Mr 
Motsoeneng et al. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So it was a joint disciplinary hearing? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   It was a joint disciplinary hearing for the three 
of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright, you may continue. 
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Thank you Chair and when they argued that this 
DC could not go ahead for various reasons, it was then adjourned but it 
was never re-scheduled.  The re-scheduling was the 8 t h of July Chair, 
this letter.  
CHAIRPERSON:    You got this letter yes.   
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   We got this letter to then provide a written 
response by the 15 t h of July and then in this letter they added more 
because they felt because of the media interviews and all of 
that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:      You were continuing? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Exactly so there were more charges here and 
then our lawyers subsequently responded to that letter, meeting the 
deadline of 4 o’clock on the 15 t h of July but unfortunately they didn’t 
find our responses good enough and we were subsequently fired on the 
18 t h of July. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 44 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:      Now there was no disciplinary hearing now? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Originally the idea was that there was going to be 
a disciplinary hearing. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      And this letter of the 8 t h of July had said that your 
response had to reach them by 16h00 on Friday 15 July failing which 
the writer would assume that you had no answer to the allegations 
levelled against you.  So one could say well, if there was no response 
by the deadline, they might have taken the attitude that there’s no need 
10 
for a hearing because these people are admitting these allegations but 
the response was filed and one would then have expected that there 
would then be a date for a disciplinary hearing but you say there was 
no such date, there was just a decision to fire? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   That’s 100% correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Chair they actually acknowledged receipt of our 
response and I didn’t – they – I’m paraphrasing again I don’t know the 
legal jargon that was used basically to say, your lawyers have sent us a 
response we’ve gone through it and we’ve taken the decision to 
20 
terminate. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay something like the response has no merit or 
something like that? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Ja okay, yes? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 45 of 230 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you Miss Pillay, so you filed – 
your legal representatives filed their responses on Friday before 4 
o’clock and you were subsequently fired, you said the 18 t h, was the 18 t h 
on that Monday? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   On that Monday, I remember it clearly because 
it was Nelson Mandela’s birthday Chair and that’s a personal hero of 
mine so it just felt very ironic that the person who encouraged me to 
get into journalism, I would be fired on his birthday. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Miss Pillay on paragraph 18, let’s go 
back to the statement on page five. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We go back to what page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Page five of the main statement 
Chair, that would be under folder 14 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  
 Yes you 
must 
just remind 
me about 
the 
folder…[intervenes]. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Folder CC14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I close when we move to another page, I 
close completely. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      That’s fine Chair, I will remind you.  
Paragraph 18 – well the second paragraph just under 18, the 
20 
subsequent paragraph.  It states that the cancellation of the editors, Mr 
Motsoeneng justified it, can you just elaborate on Mr Motsoeneng 
justification of the cancellation of the programme? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Okay so it seems then that the only reason for 
the cancellation was that the programme criticised, Chair, the decision 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 46 of 230 
 
of Mr Motsoeneng protest policy.  The argument that Mr Motsoeneng 
made was that the programme was promoting the sale of newspapers 
whose editors were interviewed and I felt that, that argument was 
irrelevant because newspapers are not the direct competition of any 
broadcaster.  Mr Motsoeneng made this argument at the time when the 
SABC was promoting the Gupta owned New Age newspaper through its 
New Age breakfast briefings on SABC TV.  I also want to add that when 
they cancelled the newspaper, shortly after the actual newspaper was 
removed citing austerity measures, one of the reasons the actual 
newspapers we usually use every morning when we’re – you know 
10 
before we do our diaries, those were removed but there were copious 
amounts of the New Age everywhere, ten copies per table, you know, 
almost.  Like the – it was really bizarre because if you’re going to cite, 
you know, selling newspapers then that newspaper had no business of 
being there with so many copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you or people in the newsroom raise this to say, 
you have just said, you know, we are not going to have these 
newspapers anymore for – as part of austerity measures, how come we 
have, you know, stacks and stacks of the New Age? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   We didn’t raise it formally Chair, we did speak 
20 
about it amongst ourselves, the producers, the senior producers we 
even brought it to the attention of our line managers and austerity was 
cited as one of the reasons for removing the main newspapers, the 
ones that we were used to getting every day and when we made the – 
we didn’t really make a formal argument, we all just, amongst 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 47 of 230 
 
ourselves, you know in our…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:      To say is this austerity measures if you bring in 
this one and not just in big volumes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Absolutely but we also knew which were our 
battles, if he wasn’t going to respond to a formal letter that senior 
journalists had written, was he going to answer about the New Age 
newspaper? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Miss Pillay you talk about the New 
Age 
newspapers 
being 
a 
stack 
of 
ten 
per 
table 
and 
so 
forth…[intervenes]. 
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Well the meeting table – meeting table not per 
desk, sorry. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Yes was the distribution of the New 
Age newspapers, was this a daily occurrence of these newspapers 
being brought in, was it an astronomical amount, was it, you know a 
manageable amount, you know, that it’s ne newspaper per employee, 
can you just talk to that? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   I can’t really put my finger on the number Chair, 
I would arrive for my shift and there’d probably be about five or six of 
the newspapers stacked around the meeting table, there would be one 
20 
or two around other tables, ja but unfortunately Chair I’m so sorry but I 
can’t put my finger on the exact number that was there on a daily basis, 
I just know that there were many copies of the New Age available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the time this – by the time of your disciplinary 
action and the removal of other newspapers do you have a recollection 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 48 of 230 
 
of – about how long the New Age had been around in terms of being 
made available at SABC being delivered in big numbers?     
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   I honestly can’t recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      You can’t remember? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:      But it had been there for some time? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Yes as far as my memory – yeah. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Thank you Chair.  Chair I’ve noted 
that it’s quarter past eleven I don’t know if the Chair would like to take 
10 
the tea break now before we carry on with further with the 
editorial…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How much more time do you think we need before 
she’s done? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      I think we would take about, my 
estimation, 45 minutes at most. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay no that’s – I was looking at her statement 
and I was thinking it’s less than that but that’s fine, I think let’s take 
the tea break, I think your watch and my watch are not giving us the 
exact time, mine is still a few minutes before quarter past but it’s okay 
20 
there’s no point in starting another question now.   
 
We will take the tea adjournment now and we’ll resume at half 
past eleven, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:      All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 49 of 230 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us proceed. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Chair just during the 
tea adjournment I had asked the – our team’s investigators just to 
acquire that media release by SABC.  They on it and as soon as we get 
it we will then submit it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Pillay on 
paragraph 19 that is on page 6 Chair on your main statement you talk 
to your editorial woes that had begun.  You emphasise on the day 
10 
before the State of the Nation Address that was to be given by the 
President.  Can you just elaborate on any editorial interference that 
you guys endured in that period? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair – Chair – I beg your pardon. Chair on the 
– in February 2016 as is tradition for the President to do a State of the 
Nation Address and part of our public service mandate our teams fly 
down to Cape Town to give almost wall to wall coverage.  So it would 
be a preview to the State of the Nation Address and a post analysis and 
response and reaction to the President’s address.  And we do this 
every year and it is one of the things that is a main attractor to our 
20 
station because I would like to say we do it so well.  But in February 
20… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now SAFM? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  This is SAFM yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Okay. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 50 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  In February 2016 so the production teams they 
would plan ahead. They would organise who we call political analysts, 
economic analysts, social you know anyone who is able to give some 
kind of post SONA analysis.  And we had an analyst lined up.  We 
usually find them in the provinces where we have to travel in order to 
also keep the costs down.  And we were told there will be no analysis 
of President Zuma’s address.  Obviously that coming from the top and I 
had to make the unfortunate call.  My team were too embarrassed to 
call the analyst because they felt that they had not taken that decision 
and they should not be the one to have to call and cancel the analyst.  
10 
So I called and cancelled with the analyst 24 hours before the State of 
the Nation Address.  And that was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would have made arrangements with that 
journalist about how long before the actual date of the State of the 
Nation Address? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  You mean analyst? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The analyst that you had to cancel.  You would have 
made arrangements about how long before the State of the Nation 
Address day? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  A couple of weeks before because we do… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So long before? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Long before.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  We –and we also because you know we know 
some of the analysts who are well read who – so we try and book them 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 51 of 230 
 
in advance as possible so that other broadcasters may not have not 
first dibs – dibs on them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you – you want to – you book them before your 
competitors book them? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And so this is how the team works, this is how 
the senior producer in charge of that broadcast would have worked.  
They would have booked and they basically told me well if you want 
them cancelled you are going to have to cancel it because I am not – 
10 
we have booked them and so I was the unfortunate – had the 
unfortunate task.  And I had to very diplomatically call and say 
unfortunately we will no longer be requiring your services.  That – that 
speech went on without political analysis.  There was only political 
party response to the speech. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you say the instruction came from the top and 
I see in paragraph 20 of your statement that you say it was an email.  
Who did the email come from? 
MS 
KRIVANI 
PILLAY: 
 
So 
this is another 
correction in 
my 
supplementary. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It was a verbal instruction and not an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 52 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I – I was just trying to recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And even when I consulted with my colleagues 
they were like email nothing was done on email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And then I – they reminded me it was a verbal 
instruction and that is when I very quickly called the evidence leaders 
to tell them me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Who gave the verbal instruction? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I think at that time it was the acting GE of news 
10 
Simon Tebele.  He would have given the instruction then so Mr 
Motsoeneng would have given the instruction to him and he would have 
given the instruction to the GM of Radio and you know filtered down.  
Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you heard it from your – do you call them 
supervisor or manager? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but it did not necessarily come from … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I was not called directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you were not called directly? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON: You heard it when it had been given? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  But in terms of who exactly it emanated 
from did you get to know that or was it just speculation? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 53 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The speak at the time was it is from the top that 
is how we were used to. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. Was there a general understanding who the 
top referred to? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was it? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay you talk about booking the 
political analyst weeks before was this a service that was paid for by 
10 
the SABC to book that analyst? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  No we seldom – sorry Chair.  We seldom pay for 
services.  We usually only book and pay during an election period 
because over that period you know we need them – it is wall to wall 
coverage and we need them you know to be with us for 24 hour 
broadcasting.  But we do not necessarily pay for analysts.  We – it is 
done out of good will.  We look for researchers, we look for experts and 
we invite them to be participants in a program.  So they would join us. 
They would be part of you know their accreditation we assist with the 
accreditation etcetera.  But we are not known for paying for such 
20 
services and if an analyst request payment then unfortunately we would 
have to let them go because we are not – we do not do that.  Generally 
all – most broadcasters and publications usually pay for analysists 
mostly over an election period when you exclusive use of analysts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Let me just go back to this instruction that 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 54 of 230 
 
there would be no analysis of the State of the Nation Address.  Were 
you ever told why that – what the basis was for that instruction?  It just 
seems quite strange to me.  Well it might be a bad thing but I can 
understand an instruction that says, make sure you get analysts who 
will speak favourably.  Because then you know that the person who 
gives that instruction does not want people who will criticise the State 
of the Nation Address.  But the instruction seems to exclude even those 
who may have spoken well about the Nation Address – State of the 
Nation Address.  I wonder whether whoever gave the instruction had 
seen the State of the Nation Address and had taken a certain view of it 
10 
that maybe lots of analysts would be very critical of it.  Did you ever 
get to understand what the basis was and did you get any information 
in regard to why this instruction was given? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair I almost admire your optimism that there 
would be reasons afforded to us for any decision.  Unfortunately we 
were working in an environment where it was just issued, orders were 
just issued without justification or reason.  I would also take it that yes 
if you wanted to promote the President you could say here is a list of 
maybe analysts that you could use.  But I think given the circumstances 
of the time, of the manner in which the leader of the time was being 
20 
lambasted across the media, across he public I can only imagine that 
the reason would be to avoid at all circumstances criticism against the 
leader. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe – maybe it was seen as better to simply say 
there would be no analysis because if you said only the following 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 55 of 230 
 
analyst then it becomes more blatant. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.  Apologies just to 
backtrack a little bit.  I think I might – I have left this out and it is very 
critical because Mr Matthews has responded to paragraphs particularly 
paragraphs 14 of your main statement on page 4.  In the meeting where 
you and Mr Krige were summoned to Mr Motsoeneng’s office where Mr 
Matthews had stated that if it is cold outside if you do not like this you 
can go. You have two choices the door or the window.   
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Can you elaborate what was the 
response to this?  You said you were particularly surprised why is that 
so? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I was particularly surprised because even 
though Chair Mr Matthews and I did not have a close working 
relationship I knew of him and he was someone that as a young 
journalist I had admired and almost – you know you – as you grow up in 
the ranks of journalism you kind of spot the journalist you want to be 
and you spot them in the veterans.  And Mr Matthews was one of those 
20 
people … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It happens with law students and lawyers too. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  You know in the television industry that you 
know – I know that he also had an eye for pictures and storytelling and 
I was aware of you know his career.  So when somebody like that and 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 56 of 230 
 
you know you have admired as a student says something like that 
instead of defending you at a meeting it is confusing and it is worrying 
and then you start to wonder well what is in it for you?  Why – I mean 
you have been such a good journalist for so long and then why does the 
tune change.  You know. And I almost expected afterwards to get a call 
from Mr Matthews to say perhaps I was under duress and you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Kind of explain. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Explain himself but I never heard from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You – maybe you will deal with this.  You will 
remember Mr Pillay that earlier on I asked you whether you got to know 
10 
whether his resignation was connected in any way with the letter that 
some of you had written.  I think in his response to Mr Krige’s 
statement Mr Jimi Matthews in his response to Mr Krige’s statement I 
think I read something along the lines that he said there were certain 
things that he had done of which he was not proud.  I got the 
impression that he was saying his resignation may have been 
connected with him coming to the conclusion that he had done certain 
things that he should not have done that were wrong and that people 
might not have expected from him.  That is the impression I got.  It 
might be a wrong impression that I got and that is part of the reason 
20 
why I was asking whether you knew whether there was a connection 
because your letter raised certain issues which may or may not have 
made him to reflect.  Ja okay thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Pillay when this 
instruction was given not to have any political analyst and so forth in 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 57 of 230 
 
paragraph 21 you state that you protested this instruction to the 
general manager of radio news.  Who exactly was at the time the 
general manager of radio news? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It was Sebolelo Ditlhakayane. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And what was her response? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I remember going to her office and I had brought 
this to her attention and she said she tried to explain it to Mr 
Motsoeneng – sorry Chair – why it would not work.  Why this instruction 
would not work and basically he had not – he told her that she had no 
option and we had no option. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay what would have happened 
hypothetically if you had you know said no I am going to have those 
political analysts and so forth. What do you think the consequences 
would have been had you not followed the instruction? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair I think I would have been fired much 
earlier than I was.  
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Let us got to the second occasion when 
this happened that you have highlighted in paragraph 22 of your 
statement – your main statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  This thing of prohibiting analysis is quite 
20 
strange. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  it is very strange. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because analysis means you look at all angles of a 
story and you ask why this, why not that, why that and you comment 
where you know somebody has done well and – and you criticise where 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 58 of 230 
 
they have not done well.  It is meant to be an analysis and an analysis 
must be to the benefit of everybody because everybody is supposed to 
want to be exposed to all angles and perspectives to a story. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  You hit the nail on the head Chair that is exactly 
what analysis is about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay just to pick up on that.  What 
do you think the intention was to prohibit this analysis?  What do you 
think the primary goal was? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Not that it was precisely communicated as such 
10 
but for somebody who has been in the industry long enough and to use 
my powers of assertion and deduction that there was a view not to 
criticise President Jacob Zuma.  Not to paint him in a poor light.  Not to 
paint his leadership in a poor light. Not to show that service delivery 
failures at the hands of government or the governing party in weeks 
before an election and for me that is the only deduction. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.  You also state 
that that was not the first occasion whereas you were prohibited to 
include political analysis.  You have highlighted that in paragraph 22. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Can you just talk to that? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  On the 23 r d August Parliament’s Portfolio 
Committee Chair they met the SABC board.  It was televised live. The 
board – by this time there was a lot of upheaval about what was going 
on at the SABC because we had obviously publicly rebuked these 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 59 of 230 
 
decisions.  And the board and some of the members of the executive 
called us disgruntled journalists.  They went as far as calling us liars 
and we were told there would be no analysis of that appearance before 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Portfolio Committee. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that date 23 r d August is 23 r d August 2016? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But so this instruction was now coming from … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Again. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  From – it was coming from the executives?  Well I 
guess all of them were coming from one or other executive? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so this was another occasion? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Another one.  From the top filtered down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But now were you told this time also why not? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I once again went to my line managers Chair 
and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  One of the conversations we had we would not 
20 
have analysis but why do we not get communications experts or 
broadcast experts or media experts to come in. I was trying to 
circumvent this issue, move around it, find a commentator, an expert, a 
researcher, an academic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were trying to make the best of a difficult 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 60 of 230 
 
situation. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. And it was not working and – but I do 
remember a conversation saying yes we could do that but not a political 
analysis of it.  Which was a very fine line you know between the two. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm.  Now at this stage August 2016 who were 
the executives in terms of the hierarchy that would have – that you 
would have expected to have had something to do with this instruction? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It would have been – well Mr James Aguma and 
Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng were working quite closely together as 
executives… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was an acting GCEO/ 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I think the acting GE was Simon Tebele.  I am 
just trying to recall I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well if you do not remember all of them it is fine 
I just wanted to have an idea so that one does not necessarily think of 
somebody who might not have been there, who might have left. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Okay sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know for example.  But this was also quite – I 
know the prohibition of the analysis in regard to this meeting was quite 
– would have been quite strange because of the job of a Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee.  The board and the executives go there because 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 61 of 230 
 
the Portfolio Committee exercises oversight and they need to get 
answers on what may be happening on certain things within the SABC 
and the public needs to know about that.  And there have been 
problems at SABC for many years and the public is – is supposed to 
know about that and they are supposed to know what is Parliament 
doing about it because it has an obligation to exercise oversight.  But 
that is being prohibited. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair in my opinion Parliament’s Portfolio 
Committee of Communications failed in their oversight role.  Because if 
you go back and get the Parliamentary tapes of the 23 r d August even 
10 
the lining – line of questioning from some of the MP’s was not of an 
oversight body it was almost of friends speaking to friends.  Or one 
team mate speaking to the same team mate. So the line of questioning 
was not to find the whole story and the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth about the goings on at the SABC. So I also encouraged the 
investigators to look at that tape of the 23 r d August and to see the line 
of questioning of that oversight body and to see the kind of responses 
that the executives gave to Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well that must be done and you – well being in 
the media you probably would know that I have said one of the things 
20 
that the commission needs to do is to see to what extent Parliament 
exercised its oversight obligations properly in regard to the executives, 
in regard to various government departments and SOE’s.  So that if at 
the end of the work of the commission I conclude that indeed there was 
State Capture I can look at what is it that Parliament could have done?  
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 62 of 230 
 
Did they do it?  If they failed was there justification for them failing to 
do what they could have done because otherwise it may well be that 
things might have been arrested before they got to where they got to. 
And also the question of the levels of corruption.  One has got to ask 
has Parliament and its various Portfolio Committees have they 
exercised their constitutional obligations the way they should?  And 
because it may be that if they have not and if they had exercised their 
obligations properly a lot of damage could have been avoided. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair I would also like to put on record that the 
SABC 8 through our legal team Aslam Moosajee and Advocate Steven 
10 
Budlender wrote to Baleke Mbete the speaker of Parliament to point out 
these kind of inefficiencies and the failure of Parliament as an 
oversight body.  And we – we for want of a better word pestered them 
until we got what we got which ended up being the first ever inquiry 
into the SABC in Parliament. But it took a while before we could get 
that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well probably it would be good to even get that 
kind of correspondence. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An exchange of correspondence because you would 
20 
have been doing nothing more than saying Parliament must perform its 
job. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is precisely what we were doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from what you say it looks like it took quite some 
time before it happened and maybe if you had not persisted the way I 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 63 of 230 
 
understand you did maybe it might not have happened. So – so that 
plus any other information that you at SABC and other people at SABC 
might have that would give this commission a picture of how the 
communications committee was exercising its oversight over the years 
if you have got any information then the commission would really 
welcome that. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Thank you Chair I will pass the message on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.   
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Ms Pillay.  On paragraphs 
23 of your statement that would still be on page 6 of your main 
10 
statement you talk to a pre-election workshop and what was said at that 
pre-election workshop.  Can you just – Mr Krige has touched base on 
what the election – the pre-election workshop is about and so forth so 
you do not have to go in that detail but however you talk to on the next 
paragraph on paragraph 24 what Mr Motsoeneng had stated in that 
workshop on paragraph 24 on page 7.  Can you just read that out into 
the record and comment thereafter? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Okay.  Chair at the workshop Mr Motsoeneng 
made the following deeply concerning remarks. 
“Do not focus on negative stories. 
20 
Reporters at the SABC do not know the world. 
When they report they mislead listeners. 
Today I am going to talk to the press club, to all 
editors.  I am going to tell them they cannot try to 
influence SABC. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 64 of 230 
 
I am going to tell them they cannot tell us what to 
do. 
Look at your editorial policy. 
We have removed news and replaced with content. 
If you as SABC mess up the organisation you mess 
up your life. 
I am in charge. 
News is now part of operations. 
We change the world. 
We must have news with content. 
10 
I am in charge, you must adhere to my instruction. 
President Zuma is the President of the country. 
I do not regard him as ANC. 
You cannot treat him the same. 
We will give him more time. 
You can question everyone.” 
And he referred to Mr Mantashe etcetera. 
“Except our President. 
We need to respect him especially you SABC. 
I expect you to align with my instruction.” 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Probably my ignorance.  What does it 
mean to say we have removed news and replaced it with content? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So in the editorial policy Chair when we talk 
about news content could mean anything.  Content… 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 65 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other than news? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes.  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Adverts? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Content could be a music video. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Content could be a kids program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  News has very clear prescripts of what is a news 
10 
item? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So he is effectively removed it and muddied the 
waters of what the news prescripts are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so what did this mean?  Look at your editorial 
policy we have removed news and replaced it with content.  What did 
that mean?  Did he remove anything in the policy relating to news?  Or 
what did that mean?  I am trying to understand it.  Firstly I did not 
understand the – the context which you have now explained but what 
did it actually mean?  What was there that was removed and where was 
20 
it removed and what did it say? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The way I understand it and I stand to be 
corrected perhaps my other colleagues could give you a better 
explanation but that news content, news items, news programming was 
being watered down. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 66 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay but the watering down was taken 
care of in the policy because he says look at the Editorial Policy or …? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is where he swapped.  So in the news 
editorial - in the - in the section of news … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  In the Editorial Policy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Because we have mandate.  We have language.  
We have sport and education etcetera in the section of news.  So where 
we talk about news values or - or prescripts it would be content. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  In the policy? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  In the actual 2016 changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Policy? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Thank you and the effect of that was - 
was what at a practical level in the newsroom? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It would mean that there would be no robust 
political … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Debates? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Debates. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you would just report? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  You would just report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without having debates and so on and so …? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 67 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  You would have debates but they would then  
CHAIRPERSON:  But watered down? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Be watered down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So at a practical level would you like have to 
tell your - your guests if they were going to talk to say well do not be 
too harsh or anything?  How would it work or you would be careful in 
how you choose them? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair at the risk of sounding insubordinate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I actually did not listen to this instruction. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I continued and so did my colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The producers and senior producers and 
anchors we continued to work … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  As journalists. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay on the - more or less the last 
paragraph of that statement.  It says: 
“I am in charge.  You must adhere to my 
instructions.  President Zuma is the President of 
the country.  I do not regard him as the ANC.  You 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 68 of 230 
 
cannot treat him the same.  We will give him more 
time.” 
How do you interpret this?  More time was this more coverage 
of President Zuma?  You know.  Can you - can you talk to this?  How 
was your interpretation or the general interpretation amongst your 
colleagues for the statement? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So Chair in the context of this - this was a 
pre-election workshop.  So when it comes to election coverage there is 
something that - that we use that ICASA prescribes and that is 
equitable coverage.  It is not equal coverage but it is equitable 
10 
coverage.  It is a formula moved based on the number of seats you 
have in Parliament etcetera. 
So obviously the governing party will have a slightly longer 
coverage than the say the official opposition who will then have slightly 
coverage to the second opposition party etcetera.  What I understand 
this to be is that you will give the President more time.  Almost 
disregarding equitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  In other words more than whatever … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  More than equitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be prescribed by ICASA? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, which - which would be more in any event? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And Ms Pillay how did you - what was 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 69 of 230 
 
the reaction?  Was there any kind of descenting views from anyone who 
put up their hand and said well you know I do not agree with this? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I do remember - I do remember that immediately 
nobody - people were looking around.  It was almost this unease 
because some of us could not believe what we were listening to.  Some 
obviously heard it again and they - like I said they were used to the 
kind of utterances of this individual.  It was my first time back after a 
few years as I mentioned. 
So I was - I know I was bewildered when I saw - I did not 
raise my hand.  I did not say anything.  We had adjourned for a lunch - 
10 
a tea break or a lunchbreak and I do remember people not being very 
happy by that but there was no kind of formal caucus where we then 
stopped him in his tracks and - and asked him questions. 
People did put their hands up, asked questions and you know 
tried you know in a - in a way to - to voice their discontent but this is 
the kind of individual who commanded this room in this almost way that 
what I say goes and even if somebody attempted to rationalise or be 
reasonable with him they would not win.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this meeting was the - was the Acting GCEO there 
or the highest ranking executive was Mr Motsoeneng? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  The Acting GCEO was there.  Mr James Aguma 
was there because I remember asking a question.  I remember putting 
my hand up to say that one of the things that irks me as an Executive 
Producer is when reporters do not have the adequate resources to do 
their work and can only file stories when they come back to the office 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 70 of 230 
 
and why do they not have the 3G data cards etcetera and I remember 
Mr James Aguma was there because Mr Motsoeneng said but we have 
got the money and he must just make it happen.  That - ja that the 
reporters get the 3G cards … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And they get the resources that they need … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  To get the job done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay I have - I have noted that in 
10 
paragraph 24 what we have just read what Mr Motsoeneng had stated is 
in quotes.  Was this word for word that was said by Mr Motsoeneng? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes because ironically I was the scribe at this 
workshop Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  There was - there was a few of us that were 
asked to scribe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And this - and this workshop was the recorded 
workshop. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was recorded? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  A (indistinct) was placed in front … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And every single session was recorded … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 71 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And we had turns to take notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So - so this is not just based on your notes? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  No this is based on - on my notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was mechanically recorded as well? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes.  I did not - I did not get my hands on the 
recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So these are just my typed notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  There … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a mechanical recording? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  A recording exists somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  If we could just turn to page 10 
Annexure 1.  Ms Pillay can you identify that document in front of you? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is the minutes of the workshop. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Dated? 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  6 June. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  6 June 2016? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And if we turn to page 17 of that same 
document. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 72 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In the middle of the document there is 
a heading COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Is this what was the minutes of what 
the content in - in which what he was saying? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  There is just a few because it is - it is 
not numbered.  There is just a few particular paragraphs that I want you 
to give comment on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  Did you say page 1-6? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  1-7 Chair.  Sorry.  1-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 1-7.  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  That would be under the heading of 
COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, okay.  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The first two lines of - of that document 
is said: 
“Concerned About News:  there is laziness in the 
newsroom.  When we compare broadcasters there is 
20 
a huge difference between us and them.” 
Was this a contribution to maybe the low morale between the 
journalists and so forth?  You know him stating that the journalists the 
newsroom is lazy and so forth.  How did you guys react to that 
comment, if any? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 73 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair at this workshop would have only been 
editors, specialists, desk editors, assignment editors, regional editors.  
So basically the editorial leadership of the news division.  So the 
journalists themselves would not have been - there would have been 
maybe one or two but the journalists themselves would not have been 
at that workshop. 
So I do not think he would have said this face to face to the 
journalists.  He said that to us as editors in the hopes that we would 
take his concerns about the shoddy camera work.  For example he used 
- he talked about inconsistencies in camera teams, needing to train 
10 
camera people.  He said that the journalists need to be passionate.  
They need to go back to basics. 
So he - he said all of this in the hopes that we would take 
this message back to our teams in preparation for elections. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And Ms Pillay did you feel that you 
know being the editor that the journalists - the newsroom was lazy or 
so forth or do you think that his comment was misdirected? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Chair I do believe that some of his comments 
are misdirected because to my recollection Mr Motsoeneng never came 
to the newsroom.  He never - I do not recall him meeting journalists, 
20 
getting to know them, getting to know their work.  Journalists work 
under - often long unsociable hours filing and you really have got to 
understand the nature of the work that we do and he to my recollection 
never did that. 
So this was the first time that I - I had his opinion of the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 74 of 230 
 
quality of news being disseminated but I am not in charge of the input 
team which is the journalists.  My team - I co managed a team of output 
producers, senior producers and anchors where they would then use 
the stories of the input journalists in - in our programs.  So I was not - I 
am not in a position to assess whether his comments had any 
validation. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And just to go to the bottom of the last 
paragraph on that page there are some typo errors and so forth so I am 
just going to read it as - as well as I could or Ms Pillay can you read 
that last paragraph … 
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Sure. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Starting with journalists? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY: 
 
“Journalists 
who 
belong 
to 
an 
organisation is not independent.  In the new 
Editorial Policy it is clear that the organisation is 
independent not the individual.  When we issue an 
instruction it is an instruction.  We are not asking 
you.  No one is independent.  SABC has a clear 
agenda.  The way we report is unique from other 
media.  If you are not in line the door is open.  
20 
Revamping the SABC is not about just content.  It is 
also personnel.  Need people who support the 
agenda of the SABC.” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay so that last line: 
“Revamping the SABC is not just about content.  It 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 75 of 230 
 
is also about personnel.” 
How would you interpret that?  Would revamping mean you 
know also revamping our personnel?  Taking personnel out or how 
would you interpret that? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I would - I would understand if you cannot do the 
job or - or if you cannot … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Comply with the instruction? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Then - then out you go. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did you understand or do you understand how it 
is possible to speak of the SABC being independent but the journalists 
- the individuals not being independent? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is a difficult one Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Because he - I think he viewed the SABC as an 
entity on its own. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And him being at the helm … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Of that entity … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And whatever he saw that organisation to be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Is what us as journalists and staff members had 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 76 of 230 
 
to be in line with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  So there - therein strips the independence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  But to be in line with his vision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Of leadership … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  For this so called … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Independent institution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So effectively he would determine where the 
independence starts and where it - it would end? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  That is how I understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the journalists had to simply that whatever he did 
he took into account independence and theirs must just be to comply? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Comply.  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Sorry.  Chair for the record I … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I - I do - I cannot remember if I - if I said at this 
meeting that James Aguma he was there as CFO … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Not as CEO. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 77 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Because I remember the conversation being 
about we have money for these resources. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  You know the - the - to do our work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Ja, so it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was the finance person? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes.  I would like to make that correction please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And if we turnover to page 18 still on 
the minutes paragraph - the fourth paragraph starting with “changed”.  
Can you just read that into the record? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  “Changed Supply Chain Management 
Exclusion:  if anything affects broadcasting then we 
classify those as emergencies.” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Can you give comment on that on the 
changed Supply Chain Management in that aspect? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I - I - I am sorry Chair.  I am unable to do so 
because I - I cannot recall in - in what context this … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  This was said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I do not know the changes in this - in the - in the 
Supply Chain Management. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 78 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay; and the next - the next 
paragraph where it starts with - the next two - well there are two 
sentences then straight underneath that there is a discussion by him 
about freelancers.  Can you read that out into the record? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  “On the issue of freelancers only rude 
open for abuse is freelancers.  There is no scrutiny. 
Caution that to do it in transparent manner if not 
10 
and we know of shenanigans we are ruthless now 
as far as fraudulent use - use of organisation 
resources.” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And - and the next paragraph. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  “News has got 1 000 employees.  That 
- news should have 1 000 employees.  That should 
be sufficient.  If - if they all news I will worry if you 
need another 500.  This financial year I will focus 
on freelancers.” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And what was his intention to focus on 
20 
freelancers?  Can you give comment to those two - two paragraphs? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  On the freelance issue I do know that the 
freelancers Chair had some issues that they had taken to - you know 
brought to his attention but I - I do not know the details of that 
communication between freelancers and Mr Motsoeneng and how 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 79 of 230 
 
exactly he was going to focus on freelancers.  Unfortunately I would not 
be in attendance of freelance meetings as I am a permanent staff 
member. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And on paragraph 25 and also to touch 
base with paragraph 26 that is on page 7 of your main statement.  You 
stated that Mr Motsoeneng’s instructions at that workshop went against 
the Editorial Policy and so forth.  Can you just talk to those two 
paragraphs please? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Okay.  Chair well Mr Motsoeneng’s instructions 
went against the International Journalism Code of Conduct, the 
10 
Editorial Code of the SABC and the legally binding documents of the 
South African Constitution and the Broadcasting Act and my own 
personal views. 
These instructions by Mr Motsoeneng have created a rift 
between those who want to adhere to the South African Broadcasting 
Act and those who feared losing their jobs and this is precisely the 
situation that was as the SABC three years ago and - and I want to on 
the record state that there were a lot of people that did not like what he 
did but there were single moms who could not afford to lose their jobs. 
There were single head households who could not afford to 
20 
lose their jobs.  So not everybody - it was not that we could afford to 
stand up but there were some people who the risk - the price was too 
high to pay to stand up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yesterday I heard evidence from Ms Mokhobo 
who was Group CEO at some stage at the SABC that within a week or 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 80 of 230 
 
within - ja within a week or so after her appointment as GCEO she was 
taken by Mr Motsoeneng to meet the Guptas who wanted to 
congratulate him (sic).  As at this time was there any knowledge 
generally speaking within SABC as to whether Mr Motsoeneng had any 
relationship with the Guptas … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  I was not aware Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that something that you - ja. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Because at this time I was actually at ENCA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  At the time of Ms Mokhobo’s … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Tenure, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Ms Pillay you said that there were 
those who feared to lose their jobs.  Was there anyone - besides the 
SABC eight - was there anyone that you have - that you had worked 
with at the SABC that stood up that detested these instructions and 
actually lost their job? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Yes.  My colleague Vuyo Mvoko at least we were 
reinstated but Vuyo Mvoko’s fight continued.  He was without a salary 
20 
for almost two years and - and that was a very painful experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was part of the eight? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  He was part of the eight.  It was just that his 
employment contract was different to ours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you were permanent? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 81 of 230 
 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  We were permanent and he was freelance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was a freelancer. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And he bore the biggest financial brunt … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Of standing up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  A lot of people would have wanted to stand up … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And have come to us and given us support … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And explained why they could not afford to lose 
their jobs … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their situations. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And - and I - and I hold no grudge against my 
colleagues at all because they would have wanted to but we have also 
in this economy Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  With - with sometimes the reality in South Africa 
is one salary … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Feeds more than one family … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, huh-uh. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And you have got to keep that in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Whistleblowing is often … 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 82 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  It is not a very glamorous … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Task … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  And - and there are some heavy consequences 
that come with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja, it is - it is - it is a reality.  I - I often express 
the concern even with regard to the court of the Commission that there 
must be many people in Government departments and maybe some who 
10 
in the past were Ministers and maybe some are still Ministers and some 
who - who may have been DGs, Deputy DGs and so on and CEOs of 
some SOEs who must have a lot - they know that should be brought 
before the Commission but who have not done so and some of them 
may be - it is that kind of situation. 
They are employed in Government and they have a fear that 
if they were to come and reveal what they know either they would lose 
their jobs or they might fear that something else might happen … 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To them emanating from whoever they might implicate 
20 
and it is - it is quite a challenge because on the one hand you do not 
want to close your eyes to your reality but at the same time you say 
can we change the country for the better if we do not know exactly what 
happened. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 83 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  If we do not know the full extent of what may have 
happened. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it becomes quite a difficult thing.  You - it is 
difficult to criticise people who are in that situation but at the same 
time you - you know that there - there may be people - there may be 
still a lot of people who - who can afford to come forward who are not 
as desperate - who are not as in as desperate a situation as some 
people maybe but it - it becomes quite difficult. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Striking the balance you - you admire those who are 
able to come forward because it is because of people who have 
behaved like that who have come forward who have had that courage 
that some of the things have come to the fore and without those people 
come forward.  Lots of things might have happened which did not 
happen because they come - came forward and the country could be in 
a worse situation. 
So - so we as a nation need to make it clear how much we 
appreciate those in various Government departments, State Owned 
Entities and just in community who come forward and say this is my 
20 
country.  I know things that have gone wrong.  There is an opportunity 
to make a contribution that might help with the change.  I will come 
forward.  I know that it is not risk free but I will come forward and I will 
play my role. 
So - so - but one just does not know what to do to encourage 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 84 of 230 
 
more people while accepting that there are some who definitely would 
like to but feel that their situation is too desperate. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So - so I understand, ja.  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE: 
 
Thank 
you 
Chair. 
 
Ms Pillay 
Mr Matthews had - has answered in terms of a 3.3 Notice that was 
issued.  That would be CC25 Chair.  On page 20 of CC25 that would be 
at the tail end of that document Ms Pillay.  At that affidavit under you 
heading - under your name Krivani Pillay he states: 
“In paragraph 14 of Ms Pillay’s affidavit she refers 
10 
to the same extract of the meeting referred to by 
Mr Krige in paragraph 14 of his affidavit.  I 
accordingly repeat his paragraphs 15 and 16 above 
in response thereto.” 
We have read the same paragraphs to Mr Krige but he is also 
responding to you.  So can you comment - kindly comment on - with 
these individual paragraphs that I am going to be reading on the 
record? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  Is that paragraphs 15 and 16? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  15 and 16 that would be found on page 
20 
12 of CC25.  Yes, have you got it?  Are you there? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  (No audible reply). 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  On paragraph - paragraph 15 it states 
that: 
“That decision was made by Motsoeneng.  Just to 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 85 of 230 
 
clarify that decision was.  The decision was that the 
ACBC (sic) would no longer show any visuals of the 
destruction of property.” 
It further states: 
“It was quite clear that the news staff were not 
happy with the decision and many had decided not 
to implement it because it breached the editorial 
policies of the SABC and the principle of fair news 
coverage.  It was in that context that Motsoeneng 
arranged 
to 
meet 
with 
those 
who 
dared 
to 
10 
undermine his decision.  I was present at some of 
those meetings and at the meeting held on 
31 May 2016 
where 
amongst 
other 
things 
Motsoeneng is reported to have said Simon if you 
do not adhere get rid of them.  We cannot have 
people that question management.  This is the last 
time that we will have a meeting of this kind.” 
15.2: 
“And 
thereafter 
I 
reported 
to 
have 
said 
to 
journalists that it is cold outside.  If you do not like 
20 
it you can go.  You have got two choices the door or 
the window.” 
Can you just give a brief commentary on those paragraphs? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:  This is - this Chair was - was at the - at the 
meeting that we had when he decided to cancel the - the editors and he 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 86 of 230 
 
is basically confirming what Mr Krige and I have told this Commission 
in our - in our evidence.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see at paragraph 17 of Mr Matthews’ statement 
that he says: 
“It was because of the corrosive circumstances in 
which I had found myself that I finally felt that the 
only alternative was for me to resign from my 
position with the SABC with immediate effect.” 
 
And if one reads this in the context of his entire affidavit it 
does appear that he is saying that he, himself was not going along with 
10 
some of these decisions from Mr Motsoeneng but he says Mr 
Motsoeneng was such that it was very difficult to disagree with him or 
express dissenting views and he says that he was just carrying out Mr 
Motsoeneng’s instructions.  So going back to the question I’d asked 
earlier about whether his decision to resign may have been connected 
with the issues you raised in the letter, it may well be that, I mean the 
issues you raised in that letter went to the same issues about the 
breach of editorial independence and so on, the policy and so on, yes 
okay. 
  
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Thank you Chair and lastly just to -  in 
20 
response to your statement Miss Pillay, in paragraph 16 Mr Matthews 
states that, 
 
“I accept that I did not stand up to Motsoeneng or voice my  
 
concerns about his decision or his stance and I repeat that it 
 
was extremely difficult to disagree with him or take a different 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 87 of 230 
 
 
view in an atmosphere that was highly corrosive.  I also accept 
 
that it was an unfortunate choice of words that I was merely 
 
trying to warn the journalists of Mr Motsoeneng’s approach to 
 
dissenting views in what had become a trite method of the way 
 
he operated.  That anyone who opposed him or voiced a 
 
dissenting view would face the prospect of dismissal but I deny 
 
any invitation that, by my presence in such meetings I had 
 
associated myself with his accusations that such staff were 
 
guilty of destabilising the SABC and somehow on my own or by 
 
association assumed responsibility for the dismissal of SABC8 
10 
 
in circumstances when my resignation had preceded the 
 
dismissals”, 
 
Can you give comment on that Miss Pillay? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:    Chair this was the first time this response – Mr 
Matthews response is the first time that I’ve heard of his response to 
anything that I have presented in public since that May meeting three 
years ago.  This may have no relevance to the Commission but I’m 
Hindu by belief and a God fearing person and I believe to err is human 
and to forgive is divine and that this is the closest of any kind of 
explanation or even to stretch it to an apology that I will ever receive 
20 
from Mr Matthews but I do want to place on record that if he deemed 
and felt this way he had many opportunities to come to the fore, like 
Parliament and like this Commission itself because it really is important 
to show, Chair,  how the newsroom was abused because it really was 
abused.  There’s a lot of trauma in our newsroom that’s very slowly 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 88 of 230 
 
starting to heal but I accept Mr Matthews’ explanation and I hope that 
this Commission can in some way or another, in your findings or 
recommendations ensure that this kind of reasoning will never hold 
water ever again in the newsroom in the Public Broadcaster.  We need 
to have unfailing leadership for such a massive institution.  Everybody 
wants their hands on the Public Broadcaster, it’s the first place you will 
start if you want to capture a mind or capture a nation or for that matter 
government 
and 
now’s 
the 
time 
to 
ensure 
that 
whatever 
recommendations you make, Chair, will all due respect, that this 
newsroom and this organisation is duly protected. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:      No, no I understand that – it will be important that 
media people like yourselves, journalist and people at SABC, they keep 
track of the progress of the Commission because at a certain stage I 
would be very interested in getting submissions from various 
stakeholders as to what they think would be the right recommendations 
to make in regard to their own situations or their own institutions with 
regard to may have happened in the past in their own institutions to 
make sure that if those recommendations are implemented it never 
happens again.  So it will be important that, you know,  people in the 
media, journalists and everybody who is concerned with the media, they 
20 
begin to reflect on what types of recommendations they would like to 
put forward before me to consider for when I have to make my 
recommendations in regard to various sectors that the Commission has 
been looking at. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Chair would you like me to take that message 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 89 of 230 
 
back to our newsroom? 
COMMISSIONER:      Please, please yes, you know, not just the SABC 
everybody, you know, other media houses, I’m very interested in getting 
submissions in due course on what recommendations I should consider 
to make sure that if those recommendations are implemented we 
prevent some of the things that have happened in the past from 
happening in the future because that’s very, very important.  So please 
do take it back to the newsroom. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Thank you, will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I also wanted to ask the question, you referred to 
10 
some of your colleagues, who, when these things were happening to 
the newsroom and to the SABC8 came to you and gave you support but 
indicated that they couldn’t give you open support or couldn’t take the 
same stand because of their situation.  Those people were fearing 
losing their jobs, maybe Mr Motsoeneng had the power to dismiss them, 
but I don’t imagine he had power to dismiss the acting GCEO to the 
extent that Mr Jimi Matthews may have been acting GCEO at that time 
maybe that is a different time because I’m trying to understand his fear 
of Mr Motsoeneng of saying no to him and saying – he says it was 
difficult to argue with him it was difficult to take a different view to him.  
20 
My question is, he was so senior, why was it so difficult, now you may 
or may not be able to explain that to me as you understood the 
situation.  It may be that you say, look I know how the situation was, 
maybe the acting GCEO would tremble when Mr Motsoeneng stepped in 
or came into the room, I don’t know, I’m trying to understand why, 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 90 of 230 
 
somebody at that senior level would feel that they couldn’t stand their 
ground against Mr Motsoeneng.  Now it may be that if this was during 
the time when he was acting GCEO the fact that he was acting meant 
that he remained as vulnerable as if he was not acting because he 
could go back to his position in due course and then he could be 
dismissed.  It may be that he was not acting GCEO at the time, he was 
just in his position but I’m wondering even if he was not acting GCEO 
at the position which he occupied which might not necessarily have 
been above that of Mr Motsoeneng and might not even have been, 
maybe at the same level I don’t know, whether nevertheless somebody 
10 
at that level, although it would be unreasonable to have expected that 
somebody at that level would stand up and say no. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Chair you raise a very interesting point, I mean 
the GCEO, like you heard from Mr Madodo this week and he is the final 
accounting officer, he is the final voice and signature for many of the 
decisions, so it would be very hard to explain the dynamic Chair 
between Mr Matthews and Mr Motsoeneng.  I hadn’t come into contact 
with them much at all in fact before being summoned to that meeting.  
So I wouldn’t be able to understand the dynamic that exists there but 
just in this, kind of, new SABC that we’re experiencing with the new 
20 
executives that on-board, there’s a lot more transparency than we have 
been used to or have been exposed.  There’s a lot more communication 
to us than we’ve been exposed or have experienced and I’m not saying 
that, you know, they are going to take us out – I’m hoping they are 
going to take us out of our current situation but it’s a refreshing 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 91 of 230 
 
leadership Chair.  I have certainly not experienced this at the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:      In a long time? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   In a long time, so it would be difficult for – from 
what I see from the current executives and how they communicate to us 
to what I’ve experienced with Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Matthews in that 
meeting is chalk and cheese but to talk about whether – why Mr 
Matthews, wouldn’t, as acting GCEO stand up to the COO would be 
very difficult for me to kind of understand why that happened or why it 
didn’t happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe others are witnesses – among the other 
10 
witnesses from the SABC who will give evidence there may be 
somebody who might be able to give their own perspective in regard to 
that.  I know that yesterday Miss Mokhobo also testified that there was 
a time before she decided to leave the SABC, apart from her fights and 
disagreement with the, then, Chairperson of the Board Ms Tshabalala 
she said she had lot of fights with Mr Motsoeneng, now Mr Motsoeneng 
I take it was at a lower level because obviously Group CEO is the 
ultimate within the executive management but from what she said, I got 
the impression that Mr Motsoeneng, and I hope I’m not being unfair to 
him and I hope I’m not misconstruing Miss Mokhobo’s evidence but I 
20 
got the impression that she was saying Mr Motsoeneng was also kind of 
pressurising her to leave or making life difficult for her and part of what 
I’d like to know is,  what was going on,  how is it possible for this 
person who is not the CEO, who  is the COO, of course that’s still quite 
a high position to seem to have power to  make   it difficult not just for 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 92 of 230 
 
people under him but even those who are above him to just  make life 
difficult with the result that maybe he was just getting things his way, 
but you will not be able to explain, maybe somebody will be able to 
explain yes, thank you.     
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Thank you Chair.  Miss Pillay we’ve 
reached the tail end of your main statement and supplementary 
statement apart from what was said and is there anything else that you 
would like to disclose or any commentary and so forth, further 
commentary? 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Thank you Advocate, Chair I have just before in 
10 
preparation for evidence today, as you know even though I am giving 
evidence mostly on SAFM current affairs I am part of the so-called 
SABC aids and some of us had a brief caucus yesterday and there are 
a few things that I would like to put on record if you don’t mind? 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes you can go ahead ja. 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   So despite everything that has happened, 
during our fight as the SABC8 we have found that the majority of 
support we’ve had has been overwhelmingly from democracy loving 
people and we want to place on record our thanks to the South African 
public and our thanks to the entire journalism community.  It is one 
20 
event that – we can’t recall in recent history where one of the 
journalism community came together regardless if you were private or 
public and regardless of what platform you belong to.  They came 
together to give us support and our public support was generously – 
went into crowd funding where we – when we were fired we received a 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 93 of 230 
 
sum of money from the public that assisted us but unfortunately what 
happened here at this Commission was a very generous and innocent 
crowd funding idea, was then usurped when Bosasa claimed that 
Bosasa had made a donation to this which was proven to be completely 
untrue and we want to put on record our absolute thanks to the people 
who have put together that fund during our time of need.  Also Chair we 
want to put on record our thanks to Aslam Mussa G and Advocate 
Stephen Budlender, who over months worked with us pro bono and 
really stood the test of time with the SABC8 but we also want to put on 
record something that we are quite disappointed with and that’s the 
10 
recent editorial inquiry report from Dr Jo Klawe, we are disappointed in 
the results of that report because we have been to Parliament and 
have, under oath, stated our experiences of the protest policy of the 
removal of the programme and we find it very difficult to understand 
that conclusion.  We understand that there will be no telephone call 
proof or email proof or photographic proof or video proof but we do find 
that, that kind of conclusion was quite worrying and concerning to say 
the least.  We also believe that when the SABC introduced the two 
inquiries, sexual harassment and the editorial inquiry, our colleagues 
were guaranteed anonymity to come forward with information, this was 
20 
honoured by the sexual harassment inquiry but it was not honoured by 
the editorial inquiry.  The final report published all the names of 
everyone who came before.  I personally don’t mind because whatever I 
have brought to your attention is already in the public domain which I 
have brought to Dr Joe Klawe’s attention but there are some people 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 94 of 230 
 
who stood up for the first time with the anonymity guaranteed and 
whose names were then plastered all over that report.  My concern and 
our concern as the SABC aids is that going forward should anybody 
want to whistle blow or bring anonymously issues to the fore will their 
identity be secure.  As journalists we have to protect our sources, 
journalists were the sources here and nobody protected them.  So we 
want to bring that and put that on the record Chair and finally I want to 
say that when a programme is removed and when you decide what the 
public needs to see or hear, who does that benefit?  It certainly doesn’t 
benefit the citizenry it doesn’t benefit the public we are meant to serve.  
10 
When you take out plurality of views and different perspectives and you 
decide what your audience, your viewer will see and hear, who does 
that benefit?  Surely all of this amounts to a form of capture, media 
capture in my opinion.  So Chair I implore this Commission to please 
safeguard the rights of the SABC newsroom and to ensure its longevity 
and to help save our organisation and that’s all I wish to submit. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Thank you very much Miss Pillay and once again 
thank you for coming to share with the Commission your experiences 
and what you know, we appreciate it, if a need arises we will ask you to 
come back, but thank you very much and you are excused. 
20 
MS KRIVANI PILLAY:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Thank you.

Page 95 of 230 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Ten to one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Okay, yes I guess maybe we should start the next 
witness at two? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      that would be perfectly fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Because it’s just ten minutes …[intervenes]. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     That’s absolutely fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:      If we try to start now we would have to break 
before much has been said. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:      Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay we’ll take the lunch adjournment now and we’ll 
10 
resume at two o’clock, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.

MR MWABA PHIRI:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes I may proceed.  Thank you.  Mr Phiri 
you have in front of you a lever arch file and I had asked that you have 
a look at a divider marked CC16 which contains what appears to be 
20 
your statement, is that correct? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is true. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank youj.  If you go to that page 1 of 
that document it has your names, your full names there and then I 
would like you to have a look at page 6?   
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 97 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Page 6. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that your signature? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is my signature. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then if you go to page 7 
did you depose to that affidavit at Brixton 21 s t – on the 21 s t August 
2019? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And are the contents of 
your statement true and correct? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  They are true and correct. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Mr Phiri is correct that you 
employed by the SABC? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In what position are you employed? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I am an Executive Producer in the Current Affairs 
department. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. For how long have you been with the 
SABC? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  The SABC recruited me from Lusaka in 1996. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  My maths is very bad.  20 – sorry that should be 
25 years. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just – just briefly place your 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 98 of 230 
 
qualifications on record? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Okay.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I hold a Post Graduate Diploma in Business 
Management from Milpark Business School.  Or am I going about it the 
wrong way?  Should start from my matric?   
CHAIRPERSON:  No Mr Phiri you can … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But just be careful not to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can start from anywhere because you know 
sometimes maybe if you start in a certain way people think you belong 
10 
to a certain age group.  So start where you want to start. 
MR MWABA PHIRI: Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  And I also hold 
a Bachelor of Mass Communications Honours Degree from the 
University of Zambia obtained in 1989.  I matriculated in Zambia in Pati 
Mufulira Secondary School. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  In 1975.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is all. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And now in terms of your career you told 
20 
the Chairperson that then you were recruited in 1996.  Before that if 
you were in Zambia what positions were you holding there? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Oh I worked in various organisations. I worked with 
Zambia Information Services, Zambia News Agency and Zambia 
National Broadcasting Corporation. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 99 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Did you then when you 
were recruited to South Africa did you – to the SABC rather did you 
progress through the ranks or were you recruited just to hold positions 
in the executive or management positions? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  No I went through the ranks.  I was initially 
recruited because the SABC was on a very big program to venture into 
the continent.  So Channel Africa Radio Station is the one that brought 
me to Johannesburg.  But then as I was here the SABC started the first 
24 hour news channel it was called SABC Africa and then I – I was 
moved from the radio to television.  From 1998 up to now I have been 
10 
rising – yes I might say what you call rising through the ranks. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Happened to me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then in paragraph 3 of 
your statement at page 1. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Paragraph 3. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 1.   
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair I have got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes you state there that you were 
approached by the investigators of the commission hence you deposed 
20 
to this affidavit.  Is that correct? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  What – would you just 
briefly tell the Chairperson about the question time program that you 
deal with in paragraph 5 at page 2 of your statement as to what was 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 100 of 230 
 
this program and how long did it last and how did it end? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Question time was a program designed to 
interrogate news makers of various what should I say, professions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Different sectors. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Different sectors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It was providing an in-depth kind of feel about 
what is break – what is making news?  Like right now the violence is 
making news.  We would have probably brought in the Home Affairs 
10 
Minister or various NGO’s. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It was that kind of program. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It started just initially with the – with the start of 
the SABC News channel in 2012.  So we were on air from 2012 up to 
2018. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then how did you halt that 
program? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Sorry I did not get your question. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  How did you put an end to the program or 
why? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I never put an end to that program.  The program 
was halted in very, very controversial circumstances. During reign of Mr 
Motsoeneng, 
Mr 
Hlaudi 
Motsoeneng 
the 
program 
was 
quite 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 101 of 230 
 
controversial in that we brought people that were not friends of for lack 
of a better word yes not friends people whom management was not 
happy about to our platforms and this annoyed most of our managers.  
So much so that we used to – we ended up coming in and fulfilling our 
mandate rather secretly. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Like the instances I have put in my affidavit where 
we have – we had to smuggle in Ms Madonsela, Ms Thuli Madonsela 
after she had released the report on the SABC, 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now we going to talk about that just 
10 
now.  But I would like you to tell the Chairperson as to how were you 
told that this program is going to come to an end and what the reasons 
were for putting it – for halting that program? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I was told in 2018 by Ms Maseko, Ms Nothando 
Maseko that the program would not continue.  Then I proceeded to 
request reasons behind that.  She did not have any reasons so I in 
upward referral… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you say she did not give you reasons 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  She did not give me reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But nevertheless because of upward referral I 
decided to take it to the acting – I thought [indistinct] it was the acting 
CEO. She called for a – sorry she did not call for a meeting I cannot 
remember what happened.  I think we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say acting COO or acting CEO? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 102 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Acting CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CEO? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay in 2018? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was the acting CEO at the time? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It was Ms Nom – sorry I forget – her second name 
Nomsa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you forget the surname? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  The second name I forget it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine I am sure we will find out. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay you may continue. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ja at the meeting we heard – I think we discussed 
this issue. She thought it needed to be resolved between me and the 
COO.  The COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The COO? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  The COO then was Mr Maroleng, Chris Maroleng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chris Maluleka?  Okay. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair.  Her directive was never enforced.  He 
20 
never came back to me despite my queries on whether we would go 
ahead and do what the CEO had requested of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who would take the whole process forward? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 103 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go for – forward let us go back to the 
actual program.  Are you saying that its nature was that you would look 
for people who are knowledgeable in different sectors? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And bring them in and interview them? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And interview them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If it was something that needed Home Affairs you 
10 
might bring the Minister of Home Affairs. If it was something relating to 
energy you might bring in the Minister of Energy and maybe you might 
bring in an expert on energy, that kind of thing.  That is what is was 
dealing with. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Precisely Chair.  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – and then you would ask questions and 
there would be answers and so on? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what it was like? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is what it was.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  What was the frequency 
okf this program, Question Time? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It was a daily program. From Monday to Friday 
initially – sorry Monday to Saturday initially then we changed it some 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 104 of 230 
 
two years into the operations of SABC News into a four day program.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and what time during the day? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  What I would call 17:30 is what time now – half 
past five pm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Half past five pm.  So you walk into your 
work establishment one day and you are told that it is not going to – 
your program has come to an end? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I was given some 30 days’ notice. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – oh there would be some notice? 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Ms Maseko sent me a memorandum which said 
next – from next month this program will not be on air. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before – before you proceed.  You said that you 
were bringing into the program people that the management did not 
like? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Which news management did not like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you bring only people that the management 
did not like? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Maybe I made a sweeping statement.  It is not 
20 
always but everybody that we brought in was not liked.  But we had the 
audacity for lack of a better word to bring in even the people that 
management did not want because we felt they were driving the news. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but were you bringing in a mix of people so there 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 105 of 230 
 
would – there were some that management liked or should have liked 
and there were some that they did not like and maybe should not have 
not liked. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Definitely so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you Chair.  The 
name of the person that you forgot just to remind you is that Ms Nomsa 
Philiso? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Philiso yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct? 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you then tell the 
Chairperson about the incident then in your drive then to bring the 
people onto your program?  You have mentioned that after the release 
by the Public Protector of the – of her report governance – when 
governance and efforts failed in 2014 – February 2014.  So you say you 
decided that you were going to bring her to your show? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or invite her to your show? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair.  At our daily editorial meeting we 
20 
decided – my team decided we needed to have Ms Madonsela even if 
she was giving a report that was quite negative for the SABC.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is this now between the date when you received the 
notice to say your program will come to an end in 30 days’ time 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 106 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  No this is actually before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this is before okay.  Okay alright. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  This is before. This is in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  Ms Norman  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he had not finished saying what happened. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it may be that you might wish to finish everything 
that happened before. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh before the termination? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was the question of the process not being 
taken forward in terms of which he and the COO were supposed to talk 
further. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To meet yes and deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To meet and so on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Maybe we could 
20 
finish that so that I do not forget. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  You say then the CEO had 
given sort of a direction that you had to meet? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Mr Maroleng had to meet me. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 107 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Maroleng. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  To resolve this issue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You had to meet and resolve the issue but 
that never happened? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That never happened up to today it has not 
happened. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So I would imagine then when Mr 
Maroleng was not getting back to you you would have gone back to the 
CEO and say CEO nothing is happening, what is happening with my 
program? 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I indeed went back to the acting CEO.  I still did 
not receive any response. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  She did not give you any response? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I was not given any response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but did you speak to her?  She – did she just 
stand there and not say anything or did you just send something in 
writing? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I communicated in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In writing oh okay. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not get any response? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I did not get any response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then during that 30 day period 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 108 of 230 
 
that you – of notice that was given to you then as a person who was 
producing this program I would imagine that would be the time for you 
to be telling your listeners and your viewers that this is going to  come 
to an end, is that what you did during that period? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I must admit I was defiant and I thought 
announcing to my audience that we are going off air I would be 
agreeing that – agreeing to the wrong decision that the program should 
go off air.  I had not agreed.  If they were going to give me a rationale 
of some kind I would probably have gone and told my audience that yes 
the program is coming to an end but they did not come back to me. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Was this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sorry.  But actually as I understand the 
position from what you have said although you had been given notice 
that a decision had been taken that the program would come to an end 
in 30 days’ time or so. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There had been subsequent developments namely 
your meeting with the acting CEO and in terms of that meeting the 
process was still going to go forward.  You and the CEO were still going 
to meet? 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Very true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would imagine that it would be reasonable to 
think that until that process had been taken 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I get the final answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Forward you could not take that notice to remain 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 109 of 230 
 
valid. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Very true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Very true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you did not know what would be the outcome 
of your further consult meetings with the COO? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It could result in you agreeing that the program 
should come to an end. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Should go off air. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you could persuade the COO that there is value in 
the program continuing. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  In the program going ahead.  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  How was the popularity of 
this program? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  This was one of the most popular programs on the 
channel.  The marketing department for the SABC would probably give 
you the data – the evidence that they were often giving all of us.  They 
said it was the best performing program in the afternoon section of the 
20 
broadcast.  So on one day when this marketing professional was giving 
us this talk he was puzzled at the fact that it had been pulled off air. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what time to what time did you used to have the 
program? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 110 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  From half past five in the afternoon to six o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay.  So it was thirty minutes? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  30 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But very popular? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But very, very popular. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And according to paragraph 5 of your 
statement it last for almost six years. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you.  Then let us go back then 
10 
to the question that – the matter that you were dealing with then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but did it end or did it not end when the thirty 
days was up?  Let us complete that. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes it ended. It was – it was just pulled off air I 
would say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without any further discussion? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Without any further discussion. So much so that I 
was forced to take the issue to the Joe Tlolo Commission – editorial 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It features in that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But even then I am still awaiting some kind of 
action after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 111 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then let us 
talk about then the report comes out on governance and ethics fail and 
you decide that you would want to invite… 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ms Madonsela. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ms Madonssela.   Ms Madonsela to your 
show yes.  Take us through that process.  What did you do?  And then 
what happened? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ja there was a very, very stifling atmosphere at 
the SABC then.  We had a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was which year now? 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  2014.  So much so that even the bringing – sorry 
the inviting of Ms Madonsela was done discreetly.  We did not want the 
top management to be aware of whom we are – we were bringing in.  
But even then we still knew that we could – sorry I forget one thing.  At 
the time the program was a pre-recorded program meaning we would 
record in the morning and then put it on air later.  So when we invited 
20 
Ms Madonsela we had to make sure that between the time of recording 
and the time of airing nobody interfered with whatever product we had.  
So we went about this by doing everything very, very secretly.  Invited 
– we invite her, she comes, sorry again I forgot something.  We had a 
strategy in which we first of all informed our colleagues in the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 112 of 230 
 
“colleagues” in the news media in the [indistinct] media that we were 
going to have Ms Madonsela on our program.  We were going to record 
her at a certain time.  This ensured that they would bring in a camera 
person of some kind who would record the fact that we had talks to Ms 
Madonsela.  If she does not go on air they would still have the 
recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there would be proof. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes.  So that is what happened. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  We recorded Ms Madonsela but we hid the tape 
10 
that – the tape is called the FX tape that is the final tape that we have 
to – supposed to take to FCC.  FCC is supposed to be the final control 
centre.  These are the people who receive a product and then put it on 
air for the rest of the public to view.  We hid that tape from everybody.  
We wanted to give – to hand it in only at about five o’clock thirty 
minutes before going on air.  And I think that plan worked quite well 
because if there was anybody looking for it they could not have seen 
the tape anywhere.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But then before you on how would you 
hide her with coming into the studio?  How did you manage that? 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Okay what we did in this case is the team gave the 
tape to me to keep. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  So I was holding onto the tape and this is a bit 
embarrassing I ran away from the office.  I had to run away because I 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 113 of 230 
 
was anticipating queries. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But where is this tape.  So I had to run away until 
five o’clock that is when I came back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And then handed it over to FCC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think she was – she was asking before that what 
you have said is important but I think she was asking how you managed 
to hide Ms Madonsela herself when she came to the SABC? 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Oh I see.  No I would not actually put it in those 
words.  We did not hide her as such.  She had come – she had come 
earlier for a program called News At Eight. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It is a radio program.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Now she did not go on air.  I do not know what 
happened there I am on the TV side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  On the – but we heard rumours that her show 
which was supposed to have been done earlier had been cancelled so 
now my team was getting very tense.  If her earlier radio shows were 
being cancelled what would happen to us?  And indeed even before that 
again one of my team members came and told me she is supposed to 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 114 of 230 
 
be on Morning Live but she has been cancelled again.  We nevertheless 
decided we just had to go ahead with whatever we are doing.  We knew 
we were going to be in big problems but we decided let us go ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the day when she was going to have this interview 
with you and which was going to be recorded happened to be the day 
when she was going to be at SABC anyway for other programs? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  For other programs yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And the date is what you 
have in paragraph 9 being the 18 t h – Tuesday 18 t h February 2014? 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  18 t h February yes if I recall, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the date? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That was the date. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright and then – so maybe I should just 
take you to – then you will tell me if you think that the reference to this 
article is premature but I think it relates to some of her invitations that 
were now declined in the sense that they were not going on.  If you 
could turn to page 9 of that – of your statement.  You will see there is 
two page.  Page 8 and then there is page 9. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Page 9 Thuli in duck. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What does it say. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Thuli in duck over cancelled interview. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and when you said some of her 
interviews were cancelled are you relating to this? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  To this interview. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 115 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To this interview yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ja this is the radio interview. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And I am sure if you can see there is a picture of 
Thuli and Mpho Seduma a presenter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  He was the presenter of this program. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then… 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  They are coming – emerging from the SABC> 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then if you go to that 
10 
page, page 9 let us just deal with that and then we know – then we 
move on we will not have to come back to it.  If you go back to page 9 
you will see the date there is the Sowetan article date 19 February 
2014 and then it says:   
“The last minute cancellation of a scheduled SABC 
radio interview with Public Protector Thuli Madonsela 
yesterday is shrouded in mystery.” 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So this is what you were talking about. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair that is what I am talking about. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then did you get to know why this 
show was cancelled?  Even if it was just after you had now recorded 
her? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Not formally.  All I knew was that because of the 
fact that she – she had a report that was negative about our COO 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 116 of 230 
 
definitely she would not be welcome. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But I think the SABC did issue their own reasoning 
behind – they claimed something of the sort that she was not invited 
properly.  I am not on record.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes alright.  But there is some reason that 
is – well this is – I think this – the spokeswoman for the Public 
Protector  
“We were not aware that the interview was cancelled 
until 
we 
got 
here. 
 
He 
said 
Mandonsela 
10 
spokeswoman Galele Masebi outside the studios 
were not given a reason why it was cancelled.” 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is true. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is what is contained in that yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is true Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then said then they 
just gave us an apology and that was it. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is true Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  So going back then to your 
recording.  So then you say you ran away and then your program is 
20 
going to air at five o’clock so you came back at five o’clock and… 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I came back at five o’clock. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you played? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then it went on air. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 117 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ja then it went on air. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay and then what were the 
consequences of you having done that?  What happened? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  My line manager Mr Themba Mthembo called me 
and – well he asked for the professional reasons behind me bringing in 
Ms Madonsela.  I explained exactly that she is the kind of person this 
program had been made for.  She is making news at the moment.  And 
people want to find out more about whatever reports she has given.  Mr 
Mthembo was to me looked quite understanding.  He said it is alright 
but unfortunately I have to go and explain this at some meeting.  That 
10 
is what he told me.  My line manager Mr Themba Mthembo called me 
and – well he asked for the professional reasons behind me bringing in 
Ms Madonsela.  I explained exactly that she is the kind of person this 
program had been made for.  She is making news at the moment.  And 
people want to find out more about whatever reports she has given.  Mr 
Mthembo was to me looked quite understanding.  He said it is alright 
but unfortunately I have to go and explain this at some meeting.  That 
is what he told me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and - and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you wanted to invite somebody to come and 
participate in your program or to be recorded for your program were 
you required to notify anybody beforehand that this is the person you 
are inviting for that day and they were supposed to approve or not 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 118 of 230 
 
approve or where you free to invite whoever you thought would be good 
for your program? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  According to SABC Editorial Policy I am not 
supposed to but we do have - we do have a diary meeting at which we 
call an “idea” is handed over and you explain to this - to the meeting 
who you are going - who you are going to invite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and it is at that meeting that other people might 
get to know what your plans are in terms of inviting anybody? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes.  It is at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they can express their views if they want to but 
10 
normally you decide? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Normally ja because the manager of - of the 
product or the program … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Decides. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  They could give you advice which - which might 
make you think twice … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And you may … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Decide not to go ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is nothing more than advice? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Nothing more than advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 119 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So 
that was the first incident that you had mentioned - you mentioned and 
then the second incident you deal with it in paragraph 14 and you 
entitle that paragraph by saying: 
“Changes to Editorial Policy 2014 Elections.” 
Could you then tell the Chairperson what that - what is that 
incident all about? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  This incident involved Mr Julius Malema.  The 
leader of the Economic Freedom Front.  He had just released his … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Economic Freedom Fighters. 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Economic Freedom Fighters. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, okay. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  The part - it is a political party. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no I thought you said front, okay.  
Maybe I miss … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Is it Economic Freedom Front or …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Twice you said fighters. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It is fighters? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Mr Malema had just released his party election list 
on March, the 17 t h.  My team again felt that he was the right person to 
bring to our program … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But like I - like I have said the atmosphere in the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 120 of 230 
 
SABC - this is a month later after the - after Ms Madonsela’s case. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Bringing him in was going to be very difficult.  
What - indeed when he came in unfortunately by some coincidence he 
was coming in as our GE News was going out for a - for the workshop 
that my colleague Krivani was earlier talking about.  So they were going 
to - to some hotel in East Rand to discuss election coverage. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who is the GE News?  The name of 
the GE News? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Mr Jimi Matthews. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Jimi Matthews yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Mr Jimi Matthews. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I hear that - I was not - I do not know what 
happened but I hear that immediately he saw - he saw Malema going in 
he looked for somebody to follow him and go and stop whatever he was 
doing.  So this happened to be Mr Kwesi Sikosana my colleague.  He 
was also an Executive Producer. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Mr Kwesi Sikosana went after Mr Malema to go and 
20 
stop whatever interview he was doing but before that another colleague 
called Vincent Mphondesi came to my office and tipped me off and said 
your program is about to be - to be stopped.  Go to the studio right 
now.  So I ran to the studio and indeed I found Mr Sikosana busy telling 
my team to stop - to halt the recordings. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 121 of 230 
 
I told Mr Sikosana I would not - my reporting line had nothing 
to do with him but nevertheless he insisted that he - I should not have 
a quarrel with him.  It is not him to blame.  He was only passing on a 
message from Mr Matthews.  I retorted that his message had been 
received but we were going ahead with our recording.  I had asked him 
to leave the studio. 
We - we continued with the recording and we concluded with 
it eventually … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But given these happenings we knew we would be 
10 
in big problems.  So we decided rather spontaneously to - to - not it 
was not spontaneously this.  We decided to have two tapes - two final 
tapes and then one we hid.  I was having - I was holding onto it.  The 
other one my team was holding because we were now anticipating 
either Mr Matthews or anyone to come and request for that tape. 
Before we could go near - I cannot remember precisely the 
order of events but Mr Tebele approached my team and asked for the 
tape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you suspected would happen? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  As I suspected it would happen Chair.  Mr Tebele 
unfortunately was from a different unit all together.  He was heading 
what we call the Special Projects Department.  So I wondered why he 
had to ask for my tape.  Nevertheless by the time I was thinking about 
that Mr - Mr Tebele had already been handed the tape.  I would not 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 122 of 230 
 
have handed it to if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  If he had come to me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But he had gone behind me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And talked to my - to my juniors … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And asked for the tape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  So they gave him the tape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  There was also some controversy over this.  I 
remember Mr Malema on his part he thought that - that prerecording 
they had done on that particular day would go on air later in that day 
but it was not supposed to be that way.  It was supposed to be the 
following day.  So when they did not see their - their show on air … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  They concluded the SABC had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had cancelled it? 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Had cancelled it yes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But it had not been cancelled yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I was holding onto the tape like I said. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 123 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the - the tape you were holding onto was the - the 
second one or the alternative one? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  The second one yes but it was the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - but … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  (Intervenes), ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But those who took the other one may have thought 
that there would be no - it would not be shown because they were 
having the tape.  They did not know about the second tape.  Did they? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  No apparently what happened Chair was this.  
They - Mr - Mr Tebele viewed the tape and came back to my team and 
10 
told them he was - he was of the opinion it was alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It could go on air … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But he never came back again to come and tell us 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  If we should go on air or not.  I did not - I did not 
wait for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but he brought back the tape? 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  He brought back the tape to my team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  The next day but … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and - and in any event from what you 
are telling us he had no business telling you whether to air or not … 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 124 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  True. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That program from - from what you had 
said. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  True Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now - so the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were saying that Mr Malema or the EFF when 
they did not see the interview being shown on that - that evening.  They 
thought the program or that interview had been cancelled.  I think you 
10 
were about to say something about whether there is anything they did 
about it. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  They went to - to the media and spread the story 
that SABC had cancelled their interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I think that was the story that was trending in - in 
those two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I was sort of not very concerned about that 
because I knew it would go on air … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  In the evening … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 125 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Next - on the next day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  So when it went on air I think they silently … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then these events - these two 
incidents they must have been the incidents that really - that is the 
reason why you felt that look you needed to bring these incidents to the 
attention of the Commission but what I want to understand is what do 
you conclude or what did you conclude at the time as to what was 
happening within the SABC and why would you regard these as 
changes within the Editorial Policy as you have headed one of the 
10 
paragraphs? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It was not very difficult to conclude although we 
may be accused of speculating more than necessary but our COO at the 
- at the time had just been I think confirmed in that position.  Now if 
you monitored the victory over … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Mr Motsoeneng? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Our COO from I think producer level up to COO 
position it was some kind of amazing thing.  How a producer would go 
and become the COO.  Apart from that given Thuli Madonsela’s report I 
do not know if you - if you are familiar with it. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Familiar with it. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ms Madonsela had stated that our COO had no 
Matric and then she wondered why - what he was doing in the SABC.  
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 126 of 230 
 
Given all those kinds - kinds of happenings around at that time you 
were bound to believe that this gentleman had ties with very, very 
offices in - in the land. 
How else did he make - manage to go up in such a very, very 
- what can I say for lack of a better word.  Such a lightning manner.  At 
the same time as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is - is that very quickly? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Very quickly yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  At the same time as he goes into that COO’s office 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did it like lightning? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Like lightning ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  As he arrives in the office of the COO the Minister 
of Communication decides to change the job responsibilities or 
descriptions of the COO position so that he now has control over the 
newsroom.  All - all along the COO in the SABC had nothing to do with 
the newsroom but suddenly he is a person who goes controversially 
20 
into that position and becomes head of - of the newsroom. 
That left many of the - many of my colleagues to think he has 
very, very strong relations with someone in the - in the - high in the 
political leadership.  So that became very stifling in the newsroom.  You 
did not - you did not need to be on his wrong side. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 127 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you spoke about somebody moving from being 
producer to COO.  Are you talking about Mr Motsoeneng when you talk 
- when you say that? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I was talking about Mr Motsoeneng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  He - did he producer level to COO? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and how many levels are there from COO to C - I 
mean from producer to COO more or less? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  There should be about six - six yes.  Producer, 
senior bulletin editor, executive producer there should be about six. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so normally to get to COO one could be expected 
if you got through the ranks as you were saying earlier on to go at least 
through most of them? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Through most of those … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ranks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and could just read out what 
20 
you say to the Chairperson in paragraph 15 of your affidavit please? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  On - on paragraph 15? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes 1-5.  That is at page 4. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  “The newsroom was at the time a buzz 
with 
Mr Motsoeneng’s 
close 
ties 
with 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 128 of 230 
 
President Jacob Zuma and inviting a person like 
Mr Malema who was going to be seen as an affront 
to our boss’ reputed relation with President Zuma.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did - did you share these views? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then those are the only incidents 
that you wanted to highlight in your evidence.  Am I correct? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes.  These are the only ones. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I think I raised some other incidents which you are 
10 
aware of when the SABC eight was asking for a - for a review. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  My affidavits are there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh you mean in the - in the - in 
Mr Kolosi (?)? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  In the Constitutional Court.  No, in the 
Constitutional Court. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh no, no.  Those applications, yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay.  No, ja - but then can we - 
20 
can I just take you through to what Mr Matthews says in response to 
what you say about him? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Matthews … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that … 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 129 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you for doing a favour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that - I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Phiri it is - it is really strange it seems to me that 
the newsroom had at some stage this type of situation that you have 
described.  Particularly the newsroom of a public broadcaster where 
you have to - I do not know if you used the word - maybe you did not 
use the word sneak in but you know bring in people that you think have 
something to contribute for the listeners or for the public. 
You have to bring in - bring them in secretly and - and you 
10 
have to record - when you record them you - you fear that somebody 
from high up is going to come and demand the tape and you will never 
be able to have it on air to the extent that you have to - you had to 
resort to absenting yourself from the building for - for I assume a 
number of hours and come back at 5 o’ clock just to make sure that the 
tape would not be taken away from you and that the public would be 
able to - to view - to watch the interview. 
It just seems a very strange environment that in - for any 
journalist in South Africa in 2014 with our Constitution and the kind of 
democracy that we have it is just - I mean as you were telling me it was 
20 
like can that really be South Africa.  Could that kind of thing happen? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair.  Those things - I would probably say 
even worse things happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  If - if I have to somehow refer to the - the other 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 130 of 230 
 
affidavits I am submitted with the SABC eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  There was times - there were times when 
somebody would be on air … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And then you get a call that halt that program - 
stop that program immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  So you have to go there and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Defend yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  As - as the program is on air. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I am sure there will be those in - in - 
incidents will be told to - to me in due course as well but you did say 
they are covered in an affidavit that you had prepared.  It is important 
that one gets the full picture of what is - what - what happened because 
one does not want a situation where you think you have got the full 
picture and somebody else comes and says no, no that is not the full 
picture. 
20 
Actually what Mr Phiri was telling you was just an exception.  
If you - I can give you a full picture and when you have the full picture 
you will see that things were not as he described them … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also we do not want a situation where we might 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 131 of 230 
 
think it is an isolated incident that you have told me about if it was not 
an isolated incident.  If there were many more it is important that one 
gets the full picture. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  May 
I just - Chair direct your attention to EXHIBIT CC25 which is the 
affidavit of Mr Matthews?  Mr Phiri you have it there next to you.  If you 
could please turn to page 2 of that. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Page 2? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  After 
Mr Matthews was sent a 3.3 Notice he responded and this is his 
response to paragraphs 17 and 18 of your affidavit and he even quotes 
those - he started quoting from paragraph 16 and he deals with the 
incident that you testified to relating to Mr Malema and his response to 
that - he says - I beg your pardon: 
“I 
have 
been 
requested 
by 
officials 
of 
the 
Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State 
Capture, Fraud and Corruption in the Public Sector 
including organs of State to respond to the 
20 
statement of Mr Mwaba Phiri dated 15 August 2019 
particularly paragraphs 17 and 18 thereof which I 
have been advised implicate or may implicate me in 
relation to matters that are being investigated by 
the Commission.  In order to respond to paragraphs 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 132 of 230 
 
17 and 18 it is necessary to quote those paragraphs 
as well as paragraph 16 of Mr Phiri’s statement 
which records the following …” 
And then he goes and he quotes what you have already 
testified to about Mr Malema’s recording - interview rather … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then in paragraph 6 then he says I 
respond to Mr Phiri’s contentions as follows: 
“It is clear from the contents of these paragraphs 
that Mr Phiri does not have any personal knowledge 
10 
of the allegations that he makes against me and 
they accordingly constitute hearsay evidence and 
should be disregarded.  In any event …” 
6.2: 
“In any event I have no recollection of any 
involvement in this matter and accordingly deny its 
contents.” 
Do you have any remarks to that?  Any response? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I would just probably say I accordingly accept the 
truth of this - of this contents as far as I am concerned. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say you - you were saying what somebody 
else told you namely that he had been asked by Mr Matthews to come 
to the newsroom and stop the program? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Recording studio Chair. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 133 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So what you were saying is what that person 
said.  Namely insofar as he mentioned Mr … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Mr Matthews. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Jimi Matthews name? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is that person who would know whether it is 
true or not but that is what the person said? 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is what the person said.  That is true … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And he told my team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  To stop the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So the part that - that is what you heard being 
told to your team from that person that remains. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That remains. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you do not know is whether … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  (Intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was telling the truth in - in saying Mr Matthews 
had sent him? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you do not know? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  That is true, ja. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 134 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then lastly Mr Phiri then 
the current environment that you are in now the newsroom and how 
matters have been handled now is it different from how it was in 2014 
or has it improved and could you just tell the Chair if it has to what 
extent? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  It has definitely improved.  I would - I will give a 
very bias answer because I am affected.  My program is not on air.  
That is why I - I cannot say it is excellent.  It has improved … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But my program went off air because I suspect of 
10 
the residues of the Motsoeneng area who are still trying to have their 
way at the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say your program is not on air.  Are you 
referring to …? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Question time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - to question time? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you wish it to be restored - to come back? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair.  I have been fighting for that up … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Up to today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman that 
is all from this witness.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is all. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 135 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you were there at the SABC for all the time that 
Mr Motsoeneng was COO or Acting COO.  Is that right? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have many dealing with him directly yourself? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Not directly.  Except for times when I would 
probably invite him to my program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  He would come in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I - I was just looking for - I was wondering 
whether you might be able to explain or make us - give us a picture of 
why it is that it looks like he was very influential within the - within 
SABC.  Earlier on I heard evidence and Mr Jimi Matthews in his 
response to the statements of other witnesses has said that 
Mr Motsoeneng was the kind of person that - it was difficult to disagree 
with or have a fight with or - or express different views from his and I 
was thinking you might be able to give me a picture as to whether that 
was your feeling as well. 
20 
That was your view and what the basis was for even 
somebody as senior as Mr Jimi Matthews not feeling that he could 
stand up and say no I do not agree with you to Mr Motsoeneng.  That is 
something you - you are unable to - to do.  To give a picture that might 
explain that. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 136 of 230 
 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  In - influential is I - I think Chair what you are the 
Judge would politely want to put it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  As far as the newsroom was concerned he was 
authoritarian.  He was a dictator.  Whatever he - he wanted - whatever 
he woke up with must be done.  I gave the example not in this forum 
somewhere else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Of the fact that the 90 percent South African music 
… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And director - directorate was not in any way bad 
but just the way it was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Ja.  It - it - there was no strategy.  Somebody just 
wakes up one day and tells all of you 90 percent.  There - there are 
quarters - there are local music quarters nearly everywhere around the 
globe.  You find the French have got something like nine - I think it is 
99 percent music must be in - in their language only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must be - yes. 
20 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  So there was probably nothing wrong … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  With the SABC going to 90 percent … 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 137 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  But the way it was done … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Was not proper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  He antagonised stakeholders within and outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Business could have been partners in that 90 
percent … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
10 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Felt that (indistinct) by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Withdrawing their business … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  And that is what made it fell … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Because there is no … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Consultation? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  No consultation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay, okay.  No thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Phiri.  Thank you. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Sorry Chair I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  I also wanted to put this on record.  I thought this 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 138 of 230 
 
Commission needs to look out for - for the fact that state broadcasters 
around the continent are some - they are the norm on the continent.  As 
a result even our political leadership he wants to replicate both.  
Fortunately for South Africa it has a constitution that is very, very, very 
- so ideal that I think it goes into the clouds instead of interrupting with 
the people.  It is - it is too good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Too good? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Yes; and I do not think it is appreciated on the - on 
the ground.  The media - us the news media needs to play our role 
there.  I think we are very integral to the constitutional requirement or 
10 
the fact that for - for your - for the judiciary, the legislature and 
Parliament to check each other.  They must have freedom of 
expression.  They cannot do that without freedom of expression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  So if the public broadcaster is captured that kind 
of check would never - will not take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  We need to have a - public broad - a public 
broadcaster more than any other broadcaster.  Let us forget about the - 
the private media. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  The public broadcaster whose stakeholdership 
includes the whole country needs to be protected … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  From any form of capture … 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 139 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  From either the state … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or private interest? 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Political or even ideological … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:  Capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  No, no … 
MR MWABA PHIRI:   So I would have thought, I would like to be very 
stern about our plea that something should happen after this 
Commission to protect the SABC so well that whatever happened in the 
10 
last five years should never, ever occur again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No, no I mean the media is crucial in any 
democracy, I mean the matters that this Commission is investigating a 
lot of them came to the fore because of the media, because of 
journalists, courageous journalists who investigated certain things and 
put them forward then the public began to realise that there were 
certain things that needed further investigation, so the role of the 
media is really crucial but as you may have heard when I spoke to Ms 
Pillay journalists all over are invited to reflect on what kind of 
recommendations this Commission should consider making at the end 
20 
of its work that would achieve what you are talking about, so I will be 
very interested at the right time to receive input from the media people 
themselves and take them into account in making recommendations that 
I would make, so all of you can start working. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:   We will definitely respond. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 140 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No thank you very much, thank you for 
coming to share your evidence with the Commission, if we need to ask 
you to come back we may ask you but for now you are excused. 
MR MWABA PHIRI:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman the 
next witness is the witness Ms Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Her statement is in EXHIBIT CC29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Mr Chairman whilst the witness is 
proceeding to take a seat may I just explain to the Chair that this 
witness was moved, she was supposed to testify sometime next week, 
but because one witness that was supposed to – that was scheduled for 
today could not make it today due to an official engagement, we moved 
her to today, but all the implicated persons were notified telephonically 
and they had all indicated that they had no difficulty with her testifying 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that’s fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Chair there is a few errors in the 
statement of the witness, her name is not spelt correctly, in fact I think 
the team that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is happening, I have been talking about 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 141 of 230 
 
people’s names not being spelt correctly. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you, but what is interesting 
here Chair I think the mistake was made by the witness herself because 
if Chair had to go to page 28 where she signed her surname, the first 
surname is spelt incorrectly, and I think then the team that was binding 
went – in fact even on the first page Chair you will find that what is on 
page 28 and what is on the first page is also different, so the team just 
went with what is contained on the first page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  G-c instead of G-q? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and then in 28 there’s Gc and then 
10 
the witness signed, I think it must have been maybe a computer glitch 
there, I don’t know, but ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You will make arrangements for these pages to be 
replaced by pages that have got the correct spelling?  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   With the correct names yes Chair, thank 
you.  And then Chair you will find also this affidavit of the witness the 
witness herself had decided instead of attaching annexures to actually 
incorporate what’s contained in the Annexures, in the affidavit itself, so 
the numbering is a bit different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   But she is quite comfortable, I am quite 
comfortable leading her on her statement, we will be able to navigate 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that’s fine.  That’s the norm isn’t it, outside of 
the Commission? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 142 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Some people like to do that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexures and just attached without these dividers 
that you people like. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   No that is true Chair thank you.  Chair 
may she be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us admit this – the file containing the 
statement of Ms Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki will be marked as EXHIBIT 
CC29. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   May the witness be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes administer the oath or affirmation 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   My name is Thandeka Gqubule-
Mbeki. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   None.. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I consider the oath binding on my 
conscience. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 143 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Gqubule-Mbeki.  Thank you, 
you may proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you, Ms 
Gqubule-Mbeki can you please look at the document that is in front of 
you, is that your statement, in fact it is an affidavit, but it is written 
statement at page one is that correct? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes it is Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, and if we turn to page 28 of 
that document.  
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes is that your signature that appears 
there? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Indeed it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you and then is it correct that your 
first surname is not spelt correctly there, could you correct it for the 
record. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It should be Gqubule which is G-
q-u-b-u-l-e. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, and that is the same at 
20 
page if you go to page one it also is misspelt there, is that correct? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes, may I clarify that, on the hop 
I – we had worked on this document for quite a while so I really 
addressed myself to the contents rather than the aesthetics and the 
spelling which I apologise for. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 144 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, yes, we will do, we will 
have to do a supplementary affidavit but after you have testified today 
to correct those errors. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, and did you make this 
statement freely and voluntarily? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I did so. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and the contents of this affidavit is 
true and correct? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Ja. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you.  Could you just tell the 
Chairperson ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see the one is a statement, the others may be 
...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   There were others that are incorporated, 
are various court applications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that it was done at a police station 
nevertheless. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One statement, ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you Chair.   Thank you, where 
are you currently employed? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I am employed by the South 
African Broadcasting Corporation, the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And what is the position that you hold 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 145 of 230 
 
there? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Chair I am the Economics Editor 
for the SABC, I am responsible for all economics, finance and business 
reporting across our 19 radio stations, our four channels and our digital 
platform. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Could you please place on record your 
qualifications please? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I am concluding a Masters of 
Philosophy in International Business, I have a Masters degree in 
Journalism from the Columbia School of Journalism in New York, I have 
10 
various business qualifications from ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Too many to mention. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Insead which is Fontainebleau in 
Paris, I have various qualifications from Wits Business School and ja I 
think I will leave it at that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you see the humility prevents her from saying all 
of them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you ...(intervention)  
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I did matriculate however at 
20 
Epworth Girls High School in Pietermaritzburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And those qualifications most of them are 
contained in paragraph 5 of your statement? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Indeed they are. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 146 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you.  Could you then tell the 
Chairperson that I would imagine maybe even without going into detail 
into what happened with the SABC 8 because your colleagues have 
already spoken to it, maybe you could just highlight the areas that Mr 
Krige and Ms Pillay have not dealt with in their evidence, which I 
believe you might have had – listened to or at least have had a look at 
what they testified to the Commission about.  Could you  just highlight 
those areas that they have not dealt with? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Chair they have broadly dealt with 
the sweep of most of the happenings, they have however left to me I 
10 
suppose to deal with the human trauma and the smear campaigns, the 
victimisations and the death of one of us, Suna.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   And I know that Foeta must have 
have dealt with the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s Mr Krige? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   That’s Mr Krige, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   He must have dealt with the 
meeting in which we were dismissed, for which we were allegedly 
20 
dismissed.    
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember whether he talked about the 
contents, the discussion. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   He spoke about him largely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, maybe you can deal with that. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 147 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Every morning Chair there is a 
meeting at the SABC.  It is held by the leadership of the newsroom 
across radio and TV.  In those days there were two meetings and we 
were in a radio meeting.  At this radio meeting a discussion came up 
about whether to cover the objection by the activists, the Civil Society 
Activists to the protest policy.  Now a few days before that the capital 
city was burning as the ANC ripped itself apart on the streets of the 
capital city.  We were asked not to cover the events ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is 2016? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I just want to locate it in terms of time what you 
are talking about. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Chairperson we were asked not to 
cover it in a normal journalistic way, using all the journalistic values 
and prescripts, we were asked instead to conceal the intensity of the 
fires that burnt through the capital city.  We were asked to stand under 
Jacaranda trees, well our journalists to stand under Jacaranda trees 
and not show the burning capital city.  For us this is heinous, and at a 
previous meeting to the one for which we were fired I asked and I 
pleaded with Ntati Tebele, Simon Tebele and I were rather close, we 
20 
used to pray together, we used to eat breakfast in his office together 
some days.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remind me what his position was at the time 
Head of News or Acting Head of News. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 148 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   He was at the time Head of News 
or Acting Head of News. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Head of News or Acting Head of News would be 
Head of News for Radio and TV? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Indeed sir, and Digital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and Digital, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So having yourself, having been a 
lecturer teaching journalism I am sure it must have been shocking, 
something that was unheard of that you could be told what to cover and 
what not to cover. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It is heinous to hide from citizens, 
it was heinous on a number of levels, three mainly, firstly to hide from 
citizens what they need to know about how they are governed and the 
public response, to be asked to mute the public voice in a democracy 
was for me a treasonous request.  Then the second part was that our 
journalists were being constrained from practicing their vocation as 
they have been taught.  I lectured in journalism at Rhodes University 
and I began and started and founded the Journalism Department of 
Monarch University South Africa and some of the students who come 
out of Rhodes inevitably end up in our newsroom and some of them 
20 
wash up from Monarch in our newsroom, so some of my students 
reported to me and those people that we taught ethics to at Rhodes and 
we taught them writing what were they to think of me if I was to 
endorse this after teaching them to do the opposite.   
 
The third part was not so much about the rights of freedom of 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 149 of 230 
 
expression, but the fact that in a cavalier way we were being asked to 
bend the very mandate of public broadcasting.  Now I am a die-hard for 
the mandate of public broadcasting, perhaps I should have said that in 
my CV, I cut my teeth in journalism at the Weekly Mail, which was a 
pro-democracy newspaper in the dark days of apartheid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During the Eighties? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   During the Eighties and we were 
taught and it was you know really seeped into us that journalism is one 
of the democracy propellers, that in any democratic eco-system 
journalists are part of those who ought to be considered the guardians 
10 
of governance and so having been reared in this way and having reared 
and taught others this way I couldn’t sleep at night, I had the most 
amazing cognitive dissidence, so I begged Ntati, depending on our 
relationship together Ntati please just let them free, let them get into 
Pretoria, ramp up deployment please Ntati. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry is that now still back at the meeting or was 
it after?  
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   This is a meeting before the 
meeting for which we were fired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, that is the meeting where he said don’t – 
20 
the journalists mustn’t show the full extent of what was happening in 
Pretoria. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes, this is the meeting at which 
he is operationalising the protest policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 150 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   And it happened prior to the 
meeting for which he got really fed-up and participated in our 
evacuation from the broadcaster. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   This is the previous meeting and I 
looked around to colleagues and I said please support, Ntati this has 
gone too far, look behind you where we sit, our editorial code sits 
behind us as we have this round meeting.  Some of the colleagues 
wanted to speak, I could see, but something was constraining them, I 
turned to one of the other editors and she said to me (African 
10 
language), so I then ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give the English version, so ...(intervention)  
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   She said “I do not wish to get into 
any trouble”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   So that painted me in eyes of 
others as somebody who is somewhat willing to get into this trouble, 
but in my own eyes I am somebody who is trying to expunge a guilty 
and a dissonance that I can ever be involved in such actions. 
 
So the meeting for which we were fired it was myself, it was – 
20 
it happened soon after the meeting about the – where they first 
operationalised the protest policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay let’s finish that meeting first, how did it end, 
just give me some more discussion at that meeting where we – you 
were looking for support and there wasn’t support forthcoming and so 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 151 of 230 
 
on. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Ntati Tebele was absolutely firm, 
he 
was 
absolutely 
firm 
that 
we 
wouldn’t 
entertain 
my 
fears 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You tried to raise it with him but it did not work. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So then he would after the meeting then 
you would be directed to simply implement that decision that he had 
taken. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes I went back into the newsroom 
10 
and I went around voicing my disgruntlement and my utter displeasure 
at what was going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   And ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So then the next meeting would be the 
one that you moved to, the one where you were then fired? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Before that I got a call from 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry let’s try if you can remember, we know it 
20 
was 2016, do you remember the month or even the date ...(intervention)  
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It was winter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it is such an important meeting you would 
remember even the date ja. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It was the Winter of our 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 152 of 230 
 
Discontent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing) okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It was mid-2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, oh it would – before the elections, so the 
elections would have been May I think. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes it was May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less, they were not in June I think that’s for 
sure, so they would have been in May or April, I’m not sure the 
elections. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe – I may be mistaken actually, I may be 
mistaken, I think it’s the National ones that are normally held in April or 
May, 2016 was local government elections, I think those were in 
August. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes, it was the morning after this 
capital city went up in flames. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but now I seem to remember I think they were  
held after May, it might have been even August, the local government 
elections, if I’m not mistaken, but I wanted to have a sense of 
roundabout when in 2016 it was, but you’re saying roundabout mid-
20 
2016. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes sir. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I seem to recall that according to Ms 
Pillay’s evidence it would be between June, around June/July but we’re 
just looking for the exact dates from her statement. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 153 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine, but winter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   After that meeting, the initial 
meeting the first meeting about the capital city and the coverage of the 
capital city at which they operationalised or wished for us to 
operationalise the protest policy.  I received a call from a colleague, a 
fellow editor called Zolisa Sigabi, and she told me that Busisiwe Ntuli is 
looking for me, and I was – I didn’t know Busi at the time and I was 
aware that throughout the newsroom there were pockets of discontent 
and 
rumblings 
about 
organising something 
to respond 
to 
the 
10 
increasingly heinous things that we were being asked to do.  
 
I went to see Busi and I called her before and I went to see 
her and effectively she recruited me into the efforts that later became 
the SABC 8, and it was prior to that, together we went to see the 
Freedom of Expression Institute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The two of you now?  
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   The two of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, is this the following day or same day of the 
meeting where they sought to operationalise the ...(intervention)  
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Chair it was between the 
20 
operationalising 
meeting 
and 
the 
meeting 
for 
which 
we 
were 
subsequently dismissed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the same day or different days? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It was different days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright.  You went to see the Freedom of 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 154 of 230 
 
Expression Institute? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes, we asked them whether there 
is any route legally to challenge the editorial policy of 2016, and we 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You had just heard for the first time at this meeting 
about this policy or you had heard about it before but they had not 
started operationalising it? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Sir I was away at home in the 
10 
Eastern Cape and I returned to the capital city story and to the 
rumblings in the newsroom and to the call that Busi is looking for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   And then I had a meeting with 
Busi and she invited everybody but unfortunately there were only two of 
us in that meeting, Busi and myself, and we decided to then go to the 
Freedom of Expression Institute to ask them if we could find a way as 
staff members of the SABC to have the 2016 policy set aside, and we 
also wanted to know what we could do about the protest policy legally.   
 
Then we went about our business, went back to our different 
20 
departments and began to work, and then I went into a meeting the 
normal diary meeting and this is the meeting that in Joe Coller’s report 
he describes as the diary meeting from hell.   
 
In the meeting ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to make sure one understands at the Freedom of 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 155 of 230 
 
Expression Institute did you leave there to go back on the basis that 
they were going to look into the issues you have raised to see how to 
help you? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Indeed they said they would 
investigate how to help us because they’ve got a pro bono legal clinic 
attached to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right.  So you went back. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   So we went back and we also 
phoned the CPJ, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in New 
York and we were trying to find a way of telling them what we were 
10 
going through.  Then we went into our different departments, giving 
each other tasks, Busi and I, to recruit other people and to speak to 
other people and it is in this context that we spoke to Jacques and to 
Krivani.  Then we went into this meeting and Busi wasn’t there, it was 
chaired by Jonathan Lungu from Mpumalanga and he was somewhat 
assisted by Zolisa Sigabi back here at home in terms of keeping the 
Johannesburg crowd going.  Ntati Tebele came in and asserted himself 
in the meeting and he primarily said that the – one of the top slugs, a 
slug is we name a story, we just give it a quick name, and then we give 
a brief indication of what the story is about and then we assign 
20 
journalists to cover it and then we tell what time it is to be delivered.   
 
So Ntati said the slug called protest, I think it was called 
protest, which was the slug referring to the protest by the right to know 
campaign at different SABC facilities, I think in Durban and in Cape 
Town, that story was to be banned or canned or just wasn’t to happen.  
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 156 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Just as a matter of interest that right to 
know story did it relate to this policy? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes, it was – it related to the 
protest policy they were protesting the public’s right to know from its 
own public broadcaster. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether at that stage they were acting 
simply because they might have seen in the media that the SABC was 
implementing, they adopted this policy or whether they may have been 
contacted by the Freedom of Expression Institute or anything or you 
10 
don’t know? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   No, what I am aware of is a 
mushrooming of discontent throughout the media industry and civil 
society after the issuing by SABC of a media statement about the 
protest policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Yes I think I – we interrupted you while 
you were telling us about the – continuing to tell us about the meeting, 
the diary meeting I think. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes.  At the meeting Deputy Chief 
Justice I then asked Ntati Tebele to cover the story, to allow us to cover 
20 
the story, and he said no, he was quite adamant and given that I had 
already experienced his firmness around the capital city burning I 
decided to also put my own foot down, and I said Ntati with regards to 
this it is a matter that is really concerning for the entire you know 
newsroom and media industry, and I suspect it’s a matter that may well 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 157 of 230 
 
end up in the courts of this country.  I wish to be recorded as 
dissenting.  So Foeta Krige also expressed similar views, and Suna 
Venter, the late, said that she may be the youngest among us but she 
believes that she shouldn’t you know kick of her journalism career in 
this fashion and that she really she felt that she ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  She needed to take a position. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes and she took a firm stand in 
that meeting and said that she wouldn’t associate herself with this.  
Thereafter we – it wasn’t that caustic a discussion, it wasn’t you know 
and Ntati seemed to be quite composed and he – Ntati Tebele that is, 
10 
seemed you know to accept your right to dissent and Jonathan then 
proceeded with the meeting and he closed the meeting, I have even 
read his affidavit about what time the meeting closed and his version 
tallies with mine.   And then thereafter we went about our business and 
we thought that Ntati’s decision would hold, but soon after that we were 
called into his office and served with suspension letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Before you got served with suspension letters both 
at the first meeting and at the diary meeting did he ever provide 
whatever it is that he regarded as justification for saying that  
1. The protests in Pretoria should not be shown properly the way it 
20 
should be shown by journalists and 
2. For saying that the protests by the right to know organisation 
should not be shown. 
Did he provide any reasons? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  As – several points he said that he 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 158 of 230 
 
has his instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did he ever say who the instruction came from? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No but I do not need to be two 
years old to have guessed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You knew where it came from? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did it come from Mr Motsoeneng? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I am done you can continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you finished?  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Ordinarily when there is decent as 
there was at this meeting what usually happens because look you have 
recorded your disapproval of whatever it is that they wanted to do and 
the journalists were going to – they wanted to cover this story.  So if 
then there is that kind of dissenting voice what would ordinarily happen 
20 
say if you are in a normal environment. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  In a normal environment dissent is 
accommodated we agree to disagree and somebody with the power to 
decide decides. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 159 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that if it is the editor who decides that is more 
acceptable to the journalists in the newsroom than if it is somebody 
outside of the newsroom, is that right? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But generally newsrooms are not 
peaceful places they are… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are debates and disagreements. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  There are [indistinct] of ideas, they 
are market places. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And robust debates. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Of the trade of ideas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  But there everybody is used to that and 
everybody knows in the end the editor has a job to do and sometimes 
you will agree with him or her, sometimes you will not agree but what is 
most unacceptable is somebody from outside deciding? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Not really.  Chair I should have 
told you that this tenure of mine at the SABC was my third. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I had had previous tenures in 
20 
different environments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And in the environment led under 
Zwelakhe Sisulu a debate was one of the most welcome things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 160 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI: Because it would lead us to better 
policies and the more vigorous the better. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And it enlivens the newsroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And it created for a certain 
passion, a certain air of freedom, a certain Prague spring that the 
SABC experienced when we were there in the dying years of the 
apartheid regime. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So I was accustomed to that 
culture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And I was failing to adapt to the 
new culture where silence and compliance and robotic decisions were 
the order of the day.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when there were instructions such as these that 
you were very opposed to and that came from the COO or acting COO 
did you consider that you could go to the CEO or acting CEO and say 
but this is what the COO is saying and it is unacceptable to us and that 
20 
maybe there could be an intervention or was there – was the position 
that no intervention from the CEO was expected to happen once the 
COO had spoken? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Formerly there is a referral 
upwards which formerly rested with the CEO prior to Hlaudi 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 161 of 230 
 
Motsoeneng inaugurating editorial policy of 2016.  And Chair he – when 
he inaugurated it at that Bos Parade in Magalies he basically said he is 
the Alpha and the Omega.  Now after that every CEO was a laying duck 
frankly.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Every CEO was dead in the water. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was – after that was he like the [indistinct] CEO? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  He was the Alpha and the Omega. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Omega.   
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  So then this is all – then 
those meetings happened and then let us get to the meeting then where 
you were finally dismissed. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So Chair we get called up one by 
one the three of us.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is yourself, Mr Krige and Ms Pillay? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And Suna, the late Suna Venter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ms Venter. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does that make four? 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The three of us. The others were 
party to a different disciplinary but those disciplinaries happened on 
the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so it was yourself, Ms Venter and Mr Krige? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes.   
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 162 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But we were called in one by one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One by one. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And separately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.[ 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  In fact we did not know that we 
had been called in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Until we called each other when 
the rumours began to percolate. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Later in the evening and it was a 
question of oh so you also and you also and we then concluded that the 
three of us had spoken out in that meeting.  This must be the premise 
on which they are going to move against us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you were called you were just given the 
letter of suspension without any discussion of any consequence really 
or there was some discussion? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  When I was called and Dade 
Ndebele was seated to my left and Sebolele Ditlhakanyane was seated 
20 
to my right. Opposite me was the head of HR Mani Aloo head of HR in 
the news division.  And I said to Dade Ndebele, Dade Ndebele this is 
unlawful and I hate to say this to you but we are going to relate through 
the courts now.  And I turned to Sebolele and I said that she is a very 
sweet human being and it is a pity that we stand at odds.  And I was 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 163 of 230 
 
then accompanied to my office to clear my desk and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The suspension was with immediate effect? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  It was immediate.  Dade Ndebele 
was very firm that the corporation has decided to part ways with me.  I 
– when from that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but this – I am sorry – was – this was a 
suspension and not a dismissal as yet. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No it is a suspension now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But Dade Ndebele at that meeting 
10 
was very firm that and the corporation has decided to part ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is – is that the term he used part ways? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes to part ways and they have 
made this decision and he insisted that I sign the letter and receipt of 
the letter which I did do and then Mani accompanied me to my office 
and took my clocking devices and by then my colleagues could see 
what is going on.  It looks like a frog march out of the building and 
people are trying to hold onto me.  And to say goodbye and people are 
baffled and I could not even say goodbye to my teams.  And so he 
marched me out of the building but oddly as – the SABC is a very 
20 
paradoxical place.  It is a very loving humane place but it is a – also 
can be a very vicious place.  So as he is marching me towards the 
turnstiles where you know the gates of no return he asks me if I can 
hug him to say goodbye because we basically had a good relationship.  
So the whole thing about capture is that it ruptures relationships it 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 164 of 230 
 
victimises people, it devastates, it creates trauma. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   Alright.  So then that is how you – 
then after that then there was a dismissal that – because you… 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Then after that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the suspension that you dealing 
with yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Then after that I went to the 
Freedom of Expression Institute. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before – I am sorry  
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  To arrange a result. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The letter said you were suspended until 
what would happen?  Until a hearing or what?  Usually you would be 
suspended pending a disciplinary hearing. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Deputy Chief Justice I think it is 
identical to Krivani’s – no Krivani did not – it is identical to Krige’s 
suspension letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm  I… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think I saw it was [mumbling] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe – maybe she can have a look at it. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is – do you have any recollection whether it said 
something along those lines that you were suspended to and you must 
appear at a disciplinary hearing on a certain date and that these were 
the charges that you would face? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 165 of 230 
 
 MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I think it mentioned something 
about a refusal to carry out an instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Something about insubordination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Insubordination yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And – but it did not name a date on 
which we would be afforded an opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A hearing. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  To defend ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But I may be mistaken.  I cannot 
recall there have been so many letters and so much litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, okay.  They will check if you think it is the 
same.  But if later on there is a chance of getting the one that was 
addressed to you that would be helpful. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I can make it available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you did you ultimately 
appear then before disciplinary hearing? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Well on that day after I was 
20 
suspended I drove out and I went back to the FXI and I phoned around 
and obviously I got in touch with Busi and too really to organise a 
revolt to bring it on because we felt that we owed it to the country to be 
heard and to be heard on this issue. So we organised a meeting with 
Civil Society.  We sat at De La Crème in Melville ironically where we 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 166 of 230 
 
used to sit to debate how we would have a public broadcaster in the 
Zwelaka days instead of a state broadcaster.  And we decided to march 
to the constitutional court and that Krige, myself and Suna would lead 
the march.  And it is for our statements as we marched and as we drew 
attention of the public to the happenings at the SABC that Mr 
Motsoeneng and his cohorts referred to as your wilful speaking out of 
turn, speaking out to the press and so on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you might not recall the exact wording that was 
used to describe the charges or what the letter said you had done 
10 
wrong but you would – do you remember that whatever the wording was 
it related to the stand you had taken against this policy and against the 
instructions that have been given that you have told me about. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That much you know. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  That much I know indeed it is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And 
then – and then when – were you then brought before someone who 
was going to discipline you? 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who was that person? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  We were given 24 hours’ notice. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  To appear before a disciplinary 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 167 of 230 
 
hearing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  There were two, three people in 
the disciplinary hearing on the other side.  And there were three of us.  
There was myself, Suna Venter and Foete Krige. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And the disciplinary proceeded? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No.  It was not meant to be they 
were not serious, they were joking, they were just kicking time and they 
just allowed the lawyer to argue about legal representation and they 
postponed the hearing. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then after that postponement is 
that the matter that ended up in the labour court? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  After the postponement we were 
just fired. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then – but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  There was – was it Mr Krige or Ms Pillay 
oh it was Ms Pillay who was asked to submit representations by four 
o’clock on a certain date I think. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes we all did that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that did not happen – oh it happened with you as 
20 
well? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  We all did that.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was the date the same? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  It was all the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 168 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And then after that they rejected 
our representations and they dismissed us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And this is when we lodged the 
matter in the labour court. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Labour court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Labour court.  Yes okay.   
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And this is when we took our 
constitutional court matter up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ys. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I would like 
to – us then to deal with specific matters because now that you have 
confirmed what Mr Krige and Ms Pillay had testified to about your 
having been dismissed from the SABC I think you deal with quite 
important topics. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In your statement at page 3.  Instances of 
political interference in the news agenda and mandate of the SABC and 
you deal there with about two instances and I would like you to just 
take the Chair through those.  The one refers to what is – was 
20 
popularly known as the Nanagate and the circumstances around what 
was supposed to happen in the news about that matter quickly. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  May I remind you so that I am 
economics editor. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 169 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So the issue around Nanagate 
affected me and my department. It was our responsibility to tell the 
South African public about the value of the money in their pockets, the 
plunge of the rand, the inflationary implications of that as well as the 
rise in the price of the bond yields and everything that happened 
around the slump in the currency.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Basically the economic implications of what happened 
as a result of the dismissal of Mr Nene? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The most – you will recall Sir that 
it was the 9 t h December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  9 t h December 2015. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC: Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes indeed and that the following 
day was the 10 t h.  So the following day we run across the SABC 
platforms updates on the currency, the currencies of other countries as 
well as the emerging markets and the Brix currencies.  So we report on 
these as is our duty and our mandate every single day.  The – what 
moves currencies is our bread and butter. We need to analyse that.  We 
20 
need to bring in analysts who explain what is happening so that people 
can make good commercial decisions. People can trade meaningfully 
and in a well-informed manner and people can make long term 
economic decisions affecting their debt levels, their interests, what 
interest rates they would get from the banks and so on and so forth.  
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 170 of 230 
 
So when Nothando Maseko attempted first very gingerly to engage me 
asking me to veer away from mentioning the conduct of the President 
and the political factors moving the rand on those days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now in relation to the 9 t h December 2015 
where about are we when that happened when… 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  We are on the 10 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 10 t h. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Or the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And it is already a storm and the 
10 
team is very busy at the moment.  So initially I am baffled by this 
assertion and I do not respond immediately.  Instead I go and check the 
emerging market index.  Now the emerging market index is – there are 
two.  There is the JP Morgan one and then there is the general MSCI 
right.  So it will tell us how the rand is doing in relation to its peers.  
Because the emerging market currencies normally track a certain – they 
respond to external or [indistinct] factors in a similar fashion.  For 
example that December had been a very busy December for the 
markets. The United States was tidying up and mopping up when it had 
cheapened its rand so they were mopping up excess liquidity in their 
20 
financial system.  They were tapering off the quantitative easing 
program.  So that would have had an effect of strengthening their 
currency and weakening the emerging market ones and so on and so 
forth. I also checked what was happening in November with the rand.  
The rand was doing well compared to its peers something variance of 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 171 of 230 
 
7% and I am not one who believes that necessarily a strong currency is 
a good thing or a weak one is a good thing it is all relative. But on this 
– on these days the rand was doing something unique and what I found 
strange about the request not to look at the political economy and the 
events – political events that may have had effects on the rands, the 
equities markets, the bond markets and the huge sell-off that happened 
as a result.  Was that Brazil was going through something similar that 
December and I never got a request not to mention the impeachment of 
Del Maruso and the resignation of the finance minister in Brazil and 
Mexico had its own wobbles at the same time so and their currencies 
10 
responded you know to those happenings.  So the issue of whether the 
rand is trading a fair value – what is determining the value – the 
current value of the rand is our bread and butter at the economics 
department.  So to be asked not to tell the public about what is driving 
he value of the rand in their pocket for me is another treasonous 
request. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And Ja so I – I basically decided 
not tell the members of my team and just to proceed with covering the 
rand as everybody else was doing. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is it even possible not to take into account 
the political climate when you looking at the performance of the rand or 
is it something that you can actually just ignore and focus on the fine 
[indistinct] markets without even looking at the political climate? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But that is not possible to extricate 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 172 of 230 
 
political uncertainty to market movements.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON: And when you were asked to – not to deal with this in 
your coverage was that something you expected by then that could 
happen and it could come from the person that came from or it was 
strange that she came to you – that she came with that instruction or 
request. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  It was not so much strange as it 
was alarming and annoying and the – the request and the things that 
she said in trying to prevail on me like the rand has been trading badly 
10 
for a while. It is not the President’s behaviour that has done this as 
well as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why was she coming to you?  Why did she like 
think you were going to say it is because of the President necessarily? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No she is coming to me to prevail 
on me not to follow the general narrative around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh outside. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And to dim the spotlight on the 
20 
conduct of the President and its economic impact. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And you refer to that 
conduct of hers as being illogical and un-journalistic in paragraph 9, is 
that correct? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed I still maintain it was 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 173 of 230 
 
illogical and un-journalistic. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And then in paragraph … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, sorry Ms Norman.  That instruction is it one of 
those in respect of which he would say it was not just coming from her 
it was coming from the COO even though she might not have said so 
herself or you do not know? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I do not know however a bizarre 
set of events happened.  The – a Sunday soon after that we carried the 
views of the President on what had happened and basically President 
Zuma said that it was an overreaction really and that the markets had 
10 
over-reacted and he also said that the rand had been trading badly for 
a while and he also said something to the effect that he does not 
believe that the currency should be something that you can trade in.  It 
is – he seemed to say that it should be just a store value and a form of 
exchange but not something that you can trade in which was beside the 
point to what was actually going on and the actual value lost in the 
economy and the obligation we have as the public broadcaster to 
basically tell the public what their currency is doing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then can 
you also highlight another incident when you deal with the mandate of 
the SABC at page – at paragraph 10 page 4 where somebody handed 
you a file for you to investigate. Could you talk to that? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes.  Nyana I was in his office and 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 174 of 230 
 
we – Nyana and I..l 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Ms Nyana. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Mr Nyana Molete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Molete. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Mr. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Molete or 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Molete yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  He handed me this file I think 
rather reluctantly and he said that it contained allegations about certain 
machinations or misdemeanours committed by Pravin Gordhan at 
SARS.  So I took the file and I said I would have a look at it.   I read 
the file.  There was absolutely – it was a whole lot of people recorded 
speaking about Mr Pravin Gordhan.  And I could see no wrongdoing that 
they are alleging.  I mean yes it is certainly it appeared they did not 
like him but that is not a story.  And I – I just ignored it for a while 
trying to think what to do about it.  And then I was called by a relative 
who said Jimi Manye says that I am sitting on a file and I am supposed 
20 
to be investigating this file and I am supposed to do something about 
this investigation.  Then I then told Nyana and the others that I would 
do something about the file only if the people making these allegations 
which are very frivolous as far as I could see would go and depose 
themselves in an affidavit at a police station or wherever and once 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 175 of 230 
 
charges had been officially proffered to Mr Pravin Gordhan I would then 
fetch the docket and the file and then I would do something about it 
because I felt that I would be opening the corporation and myself to a 
defamation suit which I could not honourable acquit myself of like how 
would I get out of that?  And besides it would be fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure I have determined this and using my journalistic and 
editorial judgment that this file is – there is no story here until it is 
official.  And if I were to just run with this file what would I be doing to 
besmirch somebody’s good name which he has a right to on just furious 
grounds. So I decided to tell Nyana I think I actually wrote an email to 
10 
this effect that let the people making the allegations depose themselves 
under oath in an affidavit and go to the police and then once the police 
have charged this gentleman I will go and fetch the docket and the file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Ms Molete tell you where she got the file from 
that she was giving you? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I am sorry to correct you Sir it is a 
gentleman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the first line of. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes I see the error. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 10 in brackets it is written Ms can you see 
that in your statement. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is an error. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes it is an error. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 176 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is a man okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I apologise Chair.  It is a man. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes did he tell you where he got the file from when he 
gave it to you? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I think casually he mentioned that 
Jimi Manye  
CHAIRPERSON:  Gave it to him? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Ja 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Was a bit anxious about 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No movement on this file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you Mr Chairman the 
time now is four o’clock.  This witness still has some ground to cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I know there is a lot of ground to cover. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there are two possibilities. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Depending on what the situation is tomorrow in terms 
of witnesses and in terms of Ms Gqubule-Mbeki’s own situation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We could stop and continue tomorrow or we could 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 177 of 230 
 
continue.  I am available we could continue until five. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are available and Ms Gqubile-Mbeki is 
available. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair I would prefer that we continue 
because I have a request to make to you Chair about tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that be convenient to you? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed Sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright let us continue then. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman thank you.  So 
then in paragraph 11 in  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe we should take a… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Just a five minute adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some comfort break of ten minutes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us resume at ten past four. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 178 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Ms Gqubule-
Mbeki you speak then from paragraph 11 right up to - all the sub 
paragraphs in paragraph 12 of the threats then that they directed at 
you and other journalists - the SABC eight. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just summarise because 
the Chairperson has read your statement?  Just summarise briefly 
those threats that you believe that they are - I am not suggesting that 
there is any threats are not important but just to summarise the ones 
10 
that you wish to place on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe to also emphasise that that is not to 
pressurise you not to tell your story. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  You - you would know what you would like 
to put forward as part of telling the Commission what you experienced 
and - and so in the end we want to do justice to - to that while - while 
you are here. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Thank you Deputy Chief Justice.  
On - on the phone I received the following threats on my phone.  Two of 
them were mainly directed at Suna Venter who for some reason our 
assailants had decided to focus on and to - to terrorise her and some of 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 179 of 230 
 
them just enveloped us in this attempt to terrorise Suna.  One of the 
death threats that she received said: 
“Enough girl, you are first to bleed to death.” 
So this is the one that was - we believe directed at the late 
Suna Venter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And it was received on Tuesday 
13 December 2016 at 17:05 pm by SMS.  I have given my phone over to 
the Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  To the Forensics Department … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  To scrub through these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes and then the … 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Another one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The second one, yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Another SMS also from the same 
number 0849234036 said to us, the Black members of the SABC eight: 
“Traitors protecting your White friends in Parliament 
20 
who started this.  Telling lies about your comrades.  
You were warned.  We do not kill Blacks but sit and 
watch the blood flow.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Phew. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  This text message was received by 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 180 of 230 
 
other members of the other members of the SABC eight and it came 
from that same number 0849234036 as an SMS. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the first one.  You said it was directed at 
Ms Venter? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did not get it from her.  You got it from 
another number.  In other words she is not the one who forwarded it to 
you to see what she had received? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  We had a WhatsApp group and 
10 
everything that we received  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, was shared? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  We just dumped on - on that 
WhatsApp group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  (Clearing of throat), excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So - so I was wondering whether - I was 
wondering it came to you if it was not sent - if it was directed at her 
and it was not sent to you by her and I was wondering whether the idea 
was to intermediate, threaten you as well and others by letting you 
20 
know what was being directed at her but you say that it was … 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was sent to the common WhatsApp group? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  It was sent to - it was sent to Suna 
… 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 181 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And Suna then shared it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  It was sent to her and then she sent it - she - 
she shared it on the - on the group … 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  WhatsApp group? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And then the second one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Was sent to all of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Including Calata. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And Vuyo Mvoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And then on Monday … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how - how far was this in terms of time now and 
20 
date from the date when you were dismissed?  Where are we in terms 
of time when this was happening? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The - the bulk of the threats came 
post our reinstatement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After you had been reinstated? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 182 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  After we had been reinstated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So this is likely to have happened after you had 
been reinstated? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These two threats? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Chairperson, most of the threats 
happened post our reinstatement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh that is - does that mean that there may have 
been quite a very tense opposition to your reinstatement and those 
people might not have wanted you to be reinstated? 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed when we first - upon our 
reinstatement we were told by our lawyers to report to work and on the 
first day that we reported work we were turned back.  They came to the 
turnstiles to - to meet us there and they said you better go back.  We 
are appealing and then by the end of that day I remember I was at a 
civil society meeting on the SABC eight.  We were called and told that 
the SABC is now ready to reinstate us. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then you speak about 
something that happened on Monday, 18 December 2017. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes.  A picture of a child is on a 
fake Twitter account which - I do not know - it is - it has got my name 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 183 of 230 
 
on it.  This Twitter account and it has got my name Thandeka Gqubule 
on it and I do not have - I do not own a Twitter account or a Twitter 
handle or a Twitter address.  I am not on Twitter and these people are 
tweeting all sorts of things about other people. 
It almost looks like it is in my name and I had to make an 
announcement at work that this is not my Twitter handle.  This is just 
creating heat for me.  I - I have no intention of going onto Twitter and 
then the following SMS (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Before you - you move on from that 
one.  You mentioned something about a picture of your daughter that 
10 
was linked to the account. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes.  It is a picture of Khani - 
Khani Gqubule on this account which I hope has since been 
demobilised. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So the roping in of family and 
people’s children in attempts to involve them in trouble is - is most 
cruel. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Deputy Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that this was to say we know your - your 
child.  We know your daughter or something like that as part of 
intimidation or threats maybe. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 184 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously you would be concerned if people who are 
threatening you know your child. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore can identify or recognise her … 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somewhere? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So the following SMS which 
appears to have been directed at not only Ms Venter but sending this 
message I think to all SABC eight it said: 
“To scared to go to Parliament forcing your 
comrades to betray themselves for your agenda.  
We have been patient.  Warned you.” 
It came from the number 0784923436. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes and I would imagine with all 
these threats that you receiving on your phones you would have then 
had to approach the police? 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  We approached the police. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What happened? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Several times we met with the 
police and we were interviewed.  We offered them our phones and the 
police never came to our help at all. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 185 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They took statements, they took your phones.  Did 
they come back to say our investigation has challenges because of A, 
B, C, D or we - there is no way we can establish who was behind this 
thing?  Did they come back to make that report back or anything like 
that? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  They - they did say that the threats 
were being made by - through those disposable phones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Burn phones apparently … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And that there is no way to discern 
who actually was sending these … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was behind them? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you make - in paragraph 14 
you deal with you approaching a General of Intelligence. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI: 
 
Yes. 
 
We 
approached 
the 
20 
Inspector-General of Intelligence.  We first wrote to him - Dr Dintwe.  
We wrote several letters and he gave us an audience.  We met with 
him.  That meeting with him was attended by myself, Suna Venter, 
Busisiwe Ntuli and Foeta Krige.  We were promised a report but never 
received one. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 186 of 230 
 
Busisiwe wrote to him severally after the meeting to - to 
inquire as to how far the Office of the Inspector-General for Intelligence 
is on all the matters including the threats and the request and the news 
that certain people from National Intelligence had been requested to be 
deployed at the SABC.  So we received correspondence from his office 
saying that the matter is still receiving attention but we have never 
received a report. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to today? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Till today sir. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was just the acknowledgment of receipt of 
correspondence and saying the investigation was going on but nothing 
further? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Indeed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was 2016? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  That was … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now it is 2019. 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2017. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2017? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 187 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now it is 2019. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair and then you 
move onto deal with two incidents of break ins in properties in some of 
your colleagues which were like two days apart.  The 6 t h of - the 6 t h and 
8 October 2017. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes.  On 6 October Suna’s home 
was broken into and her house was trashed.  The pictures on my phone 
10 
indicates the scale of the destruction at her home. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  On 8 October Busisiwe Ntuli, her 
house was broken into and on the same day 8 October Mr Foeta Krige’s 
one property - the caretaker there was held up at gunpoint. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  On 3 November our lawyer at the 
time Mr Aslam Moosajee who acted for us while he worked at Norton 
Rose Fulbright and he - we believe he headed up the Pro Bono 
Department and he acted vigorously for us and he received a text 
20 
message to drop the Constitutional Court case that we had lodged. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then going forward you deal with what 
was now happening with you at work in paragraph 18. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 188 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  Before that did you get to know 
where the text message came from that went to Mr Moosajee. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI: 
 
Moosajee. 
 
No, 
not 
to 
my 
knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You not - okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  You may proceed.  
Paragraph 18.  Thank you. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So this point deals with the almost 
half day where I could not work because my computer had been 
remotely taken over and it just moved on its own for ages and I called 
10 
the IT Department.  I said please guys I need to work.  I cannot work 
and they said no, we are working with this computer.  We have remotely 
taken it over. 
I said maybe it has got a virus.  Can you work with it quickly 
and the computer just - for hours just carried on just doing its own 
thing.  Showing files and - so I just filmed it and I left it at that but I 
found it horrific. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and paragraph 19.  You 
deal with what … 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And audit query?  Was it an audit query? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  An audit query came to me saying 
that I had failed to disclose an - a business interest and it said that this 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 189 of 230 
 
company now had business with the SABC and it is called 
Indisa (?)Media.  At first I could not recall what this could be referring 
to because as far as I know I had no interest in this company and I 
have never received anything from a company called Indisa Media and I 
looked at this letter which purported to come from the Auditor-General’s 
Office. 
I phoned the Auditor-General’s Office to find out, trying to 
follow through.  Nobody knew anything about this letter but then there 
was a little box at the end and it - next to my own Pers numbers which 
is my SABC employee number.  They had the name of businesswoman 
10 
Danisa Baloy. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Now the background to this is that 
many years ago I was invited to serve on the Board of Indisa Media.  I 
was then told that this company is insolvent.  It is going into liquidation 
and there is no such company anymore.  I never received any money or 
anything from the company.  So … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had been invited to serve on it? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  On the board yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
CHAIRPERSON:  On the board.  Invited by whom? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  By the then CEO Jabulani Mabaso, 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh of - of the - of a company called …? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 190 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  A company called Indisa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you discovered after he had invited you that 
the company was going through liquidation or he is the one who told 
you? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I think I attended about two 
meetings there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBLE-MBEKI:  And I was told that the company is 
10 
going to be shut down and that this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh after you had started … 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Attending meetings there? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And that this is going into 
liquidation and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had become a board member … 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before it went into liquidation? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 191 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And I had disclosed that at my 
previous job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  As required … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But that it now pops up at the 
SABC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  With my Pers number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Next to Danisa Baloy’s name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Was most baffling … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And I had to vigorously refuse this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was - was she in anyway involved with that company 
(intervenes)/ 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes she was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She was? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and in paragraph 20 you 
deal with a day when you were accosted by the police and the SABC 
security.  Could you just quickly tell the Chair about that incident? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I was on my way to meet people 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 192 of 230 
 
who were - who can be described as whistle-blowers from within 
PRASA.  I was due to meet them somewhere in the Cresta area.  So I 
was in a hurry and I was leaving the TV building of the SABC.  When I 
had passed through the turnstiles I was approached by the SABC 
security. 
They were in the company of the Brixton Police.  Now the 
SABC and the Brixton Police Station have got a long relationship and 
the - the gentleman asked me to come into the little security room and 
wanted me to make a statement about the death threats (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was now a SABC security or …? 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  SABC security together with a 
gentleman from Brixton Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without any appointment you knew nothing about 
this? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No appointment… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No indication that they were 
coming.  It is embarrassing.  It looks like an arrest. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The - the reception is full. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  It is just downright humiliating … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 193 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And my colleagues were so worried 
that they phoned the union when they saw me being whisked into this 
little office as though I am being arrested or - or something like that.  It 
is very defamatory. 
Just the whole scene and they - while I was inside the union 
and the union leader called and I told the police that I have got a trust 
problem because they have not resolved the issue of what happened to 
Suna and Suna is dead now and how - how can I trust them and they 
then said that they received instructions from across the road. 
Across the road is Radio Park where the authorities - the big 
10 
authorities in the SABC sit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And they also said that they had 
received an email that this was to happen to me and that the cops were 
to be called for me and I must handover my phone to the cops.  Then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is in November 2017 according to …? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 20. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would this have been now out of the blue in the 
20 
sense that it was not closed to the events of your dismissal and your 
reinstatement? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  It was closed to me writing a letter 
of concern to - to the authorities at the SABC about a - a scary 
gentleman sending me a message on telegram. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 194 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  He since deleted his telegram 
message so I cannot find it on my phone … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But the gentleman worked in the 
Presidency and this message - maybe I am paranoid … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But I did ask Busisiwe what should 
I feel and think about this message. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Should I - should I be fearful … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And Busisiwe said you must not 
take anything lying down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  At face value.  It is - it is of 
concern … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And I - I then - the unions called 
around and a colleague called Zonke Smith came to wait outside to see 
20 
if I am okay and we then went to sit in the carpark together because I 
completely refused to cooperate with the - the police.  They wanted me 
to come to Brixton the following day to - to chat to the Brixton guys and 
just to fob him off because I noticed that he was wearing a green, 
yellow and black T-shirt underneath his tracksuit which made we 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 195 of 230 
 
wonder if he is in a condition to take a statement. 
So I went to sit in my car with - in the carpark with 
Zonke Smith.  I must say Chairperson by now I was falling apart. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Crying uncontrollably and I then 
called Brixton and gave the gentleman’s name and his service number 
to the Brixton Police and they told me he is off duty.  Now how can an 
off duty cop take a statement from me.  I was so baffled.  So here is a 
cop on a frolic of his own doing favours for people across the road. 
What - what is to be thought of the South African Police in 
10 
this context?  Are they in hocked to a toxic network inside the SABC 
that is hell bent on terrorising us.  So that was what was in my mind 
Deputy Chief Justice. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the names of these people the security guy. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - I guess you would know because he was SABC 
based.  Is that right? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then this off duty police - policeman obviously 
20 
you got to know the name? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was anything done particularly in regard to his 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 196 of 230 
 
conduct to - from your side to take it further?  As soon as they left you 
alone you decided you did not want to do anything about it?  Just want 
- it just sounds very strange that when he is off duty he is engaged in 
something like that and it is not clear exactly what - why he would be 
involved in - in that when he is off duty. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  He was asked to do so by the 
people in Radio Park. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is - that is why I want to find out whether 
anything was done later to report his conduct because how can he 
being a police officer and then being off duty carry out instructions from 
10 
anywhere other than from the police.  (Intervenes). 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  This was his conduct truthfully 
Chief Justice and I have no idea … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Of what possessed him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  To behave in this manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but as far as you know nothing further happened 
or nothing happened to him after that about his conduct? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  No nothing happened to him as far 
20 
as I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I do not see his name here.  Have you given the 
name to - to the Commission by any chance? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes, I will give the name … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 197 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  To the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I - I think - I think that is very concerning and … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Something needs to - that kind of conduct needs to 
be reported. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It - it may well be that if what you have in this 
statement because maybe it might not be focusing enough on his 
conduct.  It may be that it is not enough.  It may be that it might be 
necessary to do another statement that focuses on what his role was in 
10 
that whole thing.  Alright. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I understand Deputy Chair Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but you will - you will - you will indicate if it is 
something you would rather not raise again or - or what?  I am just 
saying that because sometimes when people have gone through certain 
situations sometimes they - they do not want to have those things - 
those stories revisited but it is something that concerns me quite a lot 
and it is not something that one would wish to just go away like that. 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes sir I will indicate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman and then in 
paragraph 21 you deal with an incident when you - you and your 
colleagues were chased by a car until you reached a certain Shell 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 198 of 230 
 
Garage where then later you were able to view the footage and you got 
to get to the name of the person who was chasing you and there is 
currently litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was a very scary thing.  Please tell me about it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes ma’am.  I am a big admirer of 
the late economist Sampie Terreblanche.  So when his colleagues the 
other economists under the coordination of Patrick Bond and his 
colleagues organised at one of the facilities of the University of 
Johannesburg a retrospective look as his main economic contributions 
10 
and his theoretical work over the span over his lifetime. 
The reason for this was that he was dying of cancer.  I had 
worked with his daughter, Christelle in my early journalist career and 
really read his work a lot.  Especially his book A History of Inequality.  
So I was so excited that his colleagues are doing this for him and that 
would afford us an opportunity to speak to him and his colleague - to 
speak about his work specially on the idea of a wealth tax for South 
Africa. 
 
I pitched it at the morning diary meeting and I said I would 
cover it myself.  I took the live view which is like a mobile satellite and 
20 
the camera.  I was with a - an intern by the name of Hilda and a 
camerawoman by the name of Vanessa.  We went to this facility in 
Westdene and we arrived late but we covered the story and we crossed 
using the satellite into the 1 o’ clock news and interviewed people. 
Then we were packing up late on after we had accomplished 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 199 of 230 
 
our task and we were getting ready to go and package up a mini story 
like it is a tiny little documentary.  It is a news item for the evening 
news on Sampie Terreblanche’s work.   
 
When we were driving out of this facility, this facility is on a 
sort of incline, and we went towards a stop sign and it is important that 
it is a stop sign and not a red robot or a robot, we then after crossing 
over onto the other side heard this screeching of a car and we thought 
the guy is in trouble, should we just linger a bit to see what is 
happening and we even wondered if we had done something to cause 
this, but then it became clear, because we stopped there for a while to 
10 
see if we can attend to the car, for a few minutes we just sat in the car, 
then this car gave chase, and it was a furious chase.  We phoned the 
office and we screamed into the handset we are under attack, we are 
under attack, and Lemeez Gilbert at the office was wondering what is 
going on, where are you what is your GPS location, and obviously we 
couldn’t tell where we were anymore because we were no longer 
stopping at robots, we were no longer stopping at stop signs anymore 
because ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that in itself was dangerous? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   We were endangering everyone, 
20 
and we had tried at different points to think oh maybe we are being 
hijacked, we must surrender the equipment, we must surrender 
ourselves, we then found ourselves, it had begun to drizzle, we found 
ourselves on roundabout, coming through First Street in Melville and 
dipping towards the Shell Garage, because of the speed at which we 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 200 of 230 
 
were approaching I saw the petrol attendants put their heads, their 
hands on their heads as we were approaching the garage, and I was 
begging Vanessa, Vanessa please let’s surrender now, the cameras 
must be here, let us just do something, let us get out of the car, maybe 
we are safe now.   
 
And then he charged right there in the garage, and Vanessa 
said no ways I am driving like crazy.   So we were driving this car – she 
drove this car like a madwoman.  She saved our lives on that day, and 
exhausted we climbed up, she went and put the car there, and I said 
Vanessa you are never going to drive this SABC car again and the 
10 
intern was trembling in the backseat and there was a lot of obviously 
trying, wondering what’s happened, because we had lost the car in the 
slipstream of traffic on Empire Road, so we parked the car and entered 
the building and I went through to Nyana Motlete’s office and I found 
him there with Kenneth Mackateurs, one of our seniors, and they  told 
us to go to the Brixton Police. 
 
Vanessa went to the Brixton Police Station and she wrote me a 
letter saying that a certain Sergeant Villigazi at the Brixton Police 
Station refused to take the case, refused to open a case, not even a 
case of intimidation.

So I travelled and then I went back to the garage and a 
gentleman who is the management of ownership of the garage, long-
bearded gentleman, he is no longer there now, gave me on Patrick 
Bond’s USB the incident as recorded by the cameras and he helped me 
to isolate the number plate and Foeta Krige then traced the number 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 201 of 230 
 
plates to a car leasing entity in the East Rand.  I then phoned the car 
leasing entity in the East Rand and they told me that the car was not 
leased to an individual but to a company, this company is Schindler 
Lifts. 
 
Schindler Lifts has a multimillion Rand contract with the SABC 
to fix about 16 lifts and four walkways, escalators.  It occurred to me to 
go to Mr Mathebula, the Head of SABC Security, just to ask about 
Schindler and I went to the car department of the SABC to ask about 
the car registration number, which was strangely similar to the cars that 
we lease, but I couldn’t draw any help, so I decided to litigate and I 
10 
went to the South Gauteng High Court ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Roundabout when did this incident happen?  2017, 
2018? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It was ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   If I may direct the witness Chair page 8, 
29 January 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes thank you.  It was a Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You decided to litigate? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes I decided to litigate to 
20 
ascertain the identity of the gentleman who gave chase.  I stood alone 
in court even though I was on duty with the SABC Satellite Live View, I 
was with SABC personnel, and I was (indistinct) harm in the line of 
duty, and the Court issued an order compelling the company, Schindler, 
to reveal the identity of the driver.   
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 202 of 230 
 
 
We were being chased by one white gentleman whose name is 
Jan Ungerer, the man who often fixes the lift next to my office on the 
second floor at the SABC TV Block. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody you knew? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I don’t know him sir, I didn’t know 
him but he fixes the lifts at the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you didn’t know him before.  Yes, okay. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   So I went back to Ntati Mathebula 
who runs the security department of the SABC, and I gave him the 
name Jan Ungerer and he printed out several pages of the number of 
10 
times Jan Ungerer had entered the SABC building to fix the lifts and a 
PERS number, which is an SABC employee number.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But he is also employed by the lift company? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   By Schindler, the supplier of the 
SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So ...(intervention)  
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   To my mind it is a discussion 
between the SABC and Schindler. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   The SABC has the power in the 
20 
relationship because it is a service provider to a corporation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   It’s a CEO to CEO discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   You ask why the employee is chasing 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 203 of 230 
 
journalists and you – well I wrote to the Board members, including my 
sister in-law Phoebe (indistinct) Gqubule and I asked for a full report.  I 
never received a report on this incident, but ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But this is 2018 isn’t it, this is 2018, it is no longer 
2014, 2016, it is – or was it an old board? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   This is the interim board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the interim board, ja. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes, the interim board was 
attempting to clean up but the issues were unresolved, they pitched 
battles between enforcers, ourselves and the scrapes over editorial 
10 
direction was unabated and we realised what Mr Nyana Motlete told us 
on the first meeting back in Tebele’s office after our reinstatement he 
said nothing has changed here.   
CHAIRPERSON:  By the way you were reinstated within weeks after 
you were dismissed isn’t it? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within weeks, so you didn’t stay out of SABC for a 
long time? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I think it was a little less than a 
month. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Little less than a month.  But once you got the name 
of the person who had been chasing you, endangering your lives like 
that, apart from going to the Board did you go to the CEO, the COO or 
people like that, apart from Mathebula? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes, the Acting CEO, GCEO at the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 204 of 230 
 
time was Nomsa Pelliso, she said that she would engage a law firm, 
Madonise, to look into this.  This matter was so incompetently handled 
by Madonise and whoever was responsible that I discovered by 
befriending the other black Schindler guys that Jan Ungerer had been 
invited back into the building a month after this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before a law firm could be asked to do anything I 
would have thought that the first thing that would happen would be to – 
for the CEO or Acting CEO to say well if this guy has – is supposed to 
be employed by the SABC who is in charge of that person, how did that 
happen, I want that person to come here, I want to find out and do an 
10 
internal investigation to establish exactly what is happening before you 
even go outside.  That didn’t happen or you don’t know? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Not much of that happened Deputy 
Chief Justice, I only saw a letter from Nomsa Pelliso to Bruce Phipson 
saying that the gentleman’s entry to the building should be halted and 
clearly ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Should be halted? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes temporarily clearly, because 
he later found himself back merrily in the building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was any issue taken up with Schindler, with the 
20 
life company? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I saw a letter from Nomsa Pelliso 
indicating that the CEO of Schindler was out of town and Schindler 
believes that it was a case of road rage because we had skipped a red 
robot but there was no red robot where we were. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 205 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did the SABC ever call upon this guy to answer to 
say you know this is what we – what has been found out, what was 
going on, what do you have to say, as far as you know there’s nothing 
like that? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   I would have expected that they 
would have put the – our assailant and us in the same room 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes at some stage. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   ...and said talk it out, what 
happened. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   But none of that happened, and 
the odd thing was her – well them, SABC inviting him back to report on 
duty.  The other thing that was very odd was that Foeta Krige 
investigated this man, found that he has a criminal record and he is 
entering a criminal record, I mean he is entering a national key point 
with a criminal record, and the second part is that the criminal record 
was for similar behaviour, and on his personal websites we found scary 
swastikas, armed people, bullets, that kind of visual and image which I 
then gave to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as far as you know is this person still, is this 
person back at SABC even as we speak, or the last time you knew he 
was back? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   He was back and in a meeting with 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 206 of 230 
 
our new CEO, Madoda Mxakwe, Weber Wentzel, Daniel (indistinct) he 
was working at Weber Wentzel at the time, and he – we confronted 
Nomsa Pelliso about this gentleman and the incident and she said two 
things that alarmed me, she said that the cop who was off duty was 
asked by her to go and take a look at – look into me across the road at 
the TV block, she also said that – she also said that she was unaware 
that this gentleman is back in the building and then the CEO asked her 
to make sure that this doesn’t occur again, that’s the CEO Madoda 
Mxakwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Said she must make sure what? 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   That this matter is resolved, that 
this man must not come back here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What position is she in now, she was acting 
CEO at the time of the incident? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   She has since left the corporation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She has since left the corporation? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she left before there was finality on the matter? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   She left before there was finality 
on a whole slew of matters. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm.  This is quite concerning because it happened 
in the context of what appears to have been continued acts of threat 
and intimidation that may have been connected with the stance you 
took, you and others took against the protest policy and against 
instructions that were being given to the newsroom that were 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 207 of 230 
 
objectionable. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   Chief Justice may I say that the 
SABC 8 became the most unlucky people, the most coincidence-prone, 
coincident prone people on earth, and the most traumatised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean I – when I read your statement and all the 
things that you have talked about here and also what some of the other 
witnesses from the SABC 8 who have given evidence talked about, it 
just seemed a very strange phenomenon that was happening around the 
SABC 8.  I mean the manner in which I mean, Ms Venter’s house was 
broken into in circumstances which appear to have been intimidation, 
10 
threats and then Mr Chris (indistinct) or somebody was held at gunpoint 
roundabout the time, that time and then you were receiving as the 
SABC 8 threatening messages all of which seemed to be connected 
with this stance you were taking simply about you know certain 
directives and the protest policy and then you were chased like this, I 
mean when you read how you describe in your statement and affidavit 
how you were chased you are lucky that no car accident, no accident 
occurred as a result of trying to run away from the person who was 
chasing you and then there is this incident which you were talking 
about where the off-duty policeman, where they just wanted you to go 
20 
to the police station and all of that and all of these things all seemed to 
be left hanging. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   All of them are left hanging 
Deputy Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean we certainly don’t see ourselves as the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 208 of 230 
 
Commission as people who can solve everything but we certainly 
should do what we can in regard to particularly matters that seem quite 
connected with what we are investigating, because it may well be that 
certain people were prepared to go to very great lengths to try and 
make sure that people who stood against certain things at SABC were 
dealt with and if one is going to look at what ultimately might need to 
be recommended to try and prevent similar things happening in the 
future, one needs to understand the full extent of what was happening, 
so I think that the investigators who must follow these things up and 
the legal team can guide them. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think they  must be followed up and I would like 
to be updated in a few weeks time as to how far they have gone to try 
and establish, get full clarity about some of these things and some of 
these characters that were involved, the police officer who was 
involved in this thing and the handling of the matter relating to 
somebody that is known by the SABC who chased SABC staffers and 
almost got them killed because anything could have happened with 
them driving you know through red robots and whatever, but it just 
seems like the matter was not being given the seriousness and urgency 
20 
that it deserved, so I would like if you can take that further and get the 
investigators to look into all of those things, I would like to be updated 
before the end of September as to how far everything is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, we will do that, thank 
you. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 209 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Then Chair as I have indicated because 
of the pacing of the annexures then the paragraphs, now we are at 
paragraph 175, it may appear as if we have jumped but it is actually the 
sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay no that’s fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, then you make mention of 
your colleague Ms Sophie Mokwena and just tell the Chair what 
happened between you and her. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:   We were coming back from 
10 
Krivani’s office, we had a dispute about a story involving SAP, one of 
the IT companies from Germany and how it handled the issue of 
contracts with Eskom and the Guptas.  So I felt that in this case, and I 
was you know I was in two minds even as I was arguing but I felt that 
journalistically we did not have credible sources on the story, but that 
is a separate matter, because when we came back I followed her to her 
office where we were still talking about SAP and then she told me that I 
am defending SAP because I was an apartheid spy and I said you must 
be crazy, you must take some meds, I have never been an apartheid 
spy, I was an activist from the age of 12, and that was a discussion that 
20 
just went south. 
 
A few weeks later Mandela passed away, I was aware that 
Sophie was close to Mandela and the family and on the sideline, and 
that she, Mahlatse (indistinct) the head of SANEF, told me after the spy 
allegations now were blowing hot and furious and I was being insulted 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 210 of 230 
 
all over social media that Sophie had taken her to see Mandela and 
Mandela I think prompted by Sophie, this is what I read into Mahlatse 
(indistinct) told me, then told her that I am supposed to be a spy and a 
journalist called Deshne recorded Mandela doing this on the sidelines 
of the launch of a documentary. 
 
Then in a 2015 meeting Sophie then says that we must then 
prepare for a story about journalist who were at Stratcom and I am still 
naively unaware that the issue is me here.  Then I went to Village Walk 
to a gathering about ethics and when I opened my phone I discovered 
that the whole town was talking about me being a spy, and I got a call 
10 
from Sam Mkokeli, the Chairperson of the Media Freedom Committee of 
SANEF, and a colleague, and he said Thandeka what are we at SANEF 
to do about this, these spy allegations.  What can you say?  I have 
never been a spy.   
 
I then went home and I called the church   My father was one 
of the leaders of the South African Council of Churches, and President 
of the Methodist Church, so I reached out to the Archbishop, Thabo 
Magoba, who was at university with me, at Wits and he was travelling, 
he was in Rome, I said to him Thabo I am hurting in places I didn’t 
even know exist, I just need some kind of spiritual counsel, what is 
20 
this, and then he said I will attend to you once I return from Rome.  The 
next call I made was to (indistinct) and I said to (indistinct) Advocate 
(indistinct) that what they are doing to me, the EFF is really 
unwarranted and I take strong exception to it.  I phoned Dahli Mpofu 
who was also a classmate of mind, a comrade of mine, we were 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 211 of 230 
 
arrested together at Wits University.  We spent the better part of our 
final year in solitary confinement, we arrived at John Vorster together.  
I phoned him and I said Dhali you are Chairman of this thing, you need 
to do something and he said – I said Dhali since when am I a spy, he 
said oh man Gqubs I know you are not a spy, and I couldn’t understand 
why this thing is a runaway fire, why is it not being doused by reason 
and sanity. Needless to say, it was five days of this. My brother, the 
economist Duma Gqubule didn’t go to work. He was so enraged and so 
aggrieved that he decided to go online and fight every single troll. I 
decided to apply to every single intelligence agency in the country to 
10 
have my apartheid records declassified. Once they were declassified, I 
discovered that I wasn’t a spy wish I knew and that I was spied on 
heavily especially in my first job as a reporter at the Weekly Mail, calls 
to Lusaka, to Tom Sebina and even operations of Stratcom that we 
didn’t know about. Like operation Aristotle and all of those were used 
to spy on me and my comrades in those days before I was a journalist. 
So, it’s only through this that we were able to put it to bed. I also had a 
meeting with Nomavenda Mthiyane who was also unfortunately 
fingered. And she reminded me that on the last day of the seven days 
of the testimony of Mam Mandela at the truth Commission Advocate 
20 
Dumisa Nsebeza put it to her that he had been given by Stratcom the 
list of journalists who were spies and that the three names Thandeka 
Gqubule, Anthon Harbour and Nomavenda Mthiyane were not spies or 
were not on the list. So, even as Mahlatsi’s being invited to listen to my 
spying everybody knew that there was no such in terms of what was led 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 212 of 230 
 
as evidence before the truth Commission. The matter is still before the 
Court. It will be heard. It’s a defamation matter. Advocate... (indistinct) 
is set to argue this matter before the Course in October. But we see it 
as part of a slew of smears that were meant to devastate us and 
destroy us someday Chief Justice. I’m just happy when I wake up that 
I’ve woken up alive. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Sorry, Mr Chairman we’ve gone 
past 5 o’clock. I’m sorry I lost track of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think it’s better that we finish. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That we finish? Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much. Shall we then deal 
with the issue where the Sunday World according to paragraph 177 
were they publish an article about you and the SIU. Could you talk to 
that? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes, I got a call from a journalist 
by the name of Aubrey Mthombeni. He’s from the Sunday World. He… 
(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, let me interrupt you. Mr Pretorius, I know 
we need to meet but I know we need to meet but it may be that if your 
20 
other commitments dictate that maybe we should rather me tomorrow 
morning that would be fine. 
MR PRETORIUS:  I don’t have a microphone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I can hear you. 
MR PRETORIUS:  I’m in your hands. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 213 of 230 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR PRETORIUS:  So, it depends how long the evidence will go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so, we’ll continue but if while we are continuing 
you think let’s rather me tomorrow feel free to leave and then you can 
talk to me later in the evening. 
MR PRETORIUS:  I will do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. Yes? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes, I interrupted you. I think you 
might have to repeat the question. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon, sorry. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I received a call, ma’am from 
Aubrey Mthombeni. He’s a journalist with the Sunday World. He was in 
possession of my entire employment file at the SABC. He was also in 
possession of the scores, interview scores of the panel that met to look 
at the performance in the interview of various candidates for the post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Candidates for a position that you had applied for? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes, Deputy Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The current position? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The current position. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, hm. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And the headline of the story that 
he subsequently wrote was SIU guns for Gqubule. Now I was mystified. 
The SIU had not even interviewed me and the SIU at the SABC had 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 214 of 230 
 
been quite brisk in interviewing people, looking for documents and so 
on so forth. They had not even sat down with me because to my 
knowledge there were no allegations of impropriety. I don’t steal public 
money. I frown on people who do and it’s just not in my makeup. So, I 
was just worried and mystified. So, the SABC 8 responded in a letter 
after this publication to say that for about a year and a half I had 
refused to return to the SABC after repeated approaches to come back 
to fill the position of economics editor. Because they said that they had 
had seven economics editors in a short space of time; I think four years 
I’m not sure and that all of them hadn’t lasted. And they said that they 
10 
had trouble filling the post. The trouble was to get the right combination 
of a tripod of skills which is journalism, business and economics as 
well as broadcasting. So, candidates tended to have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One or the other or two or ja? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  One or the other but the 
combination of the three was not proving a challenge to fill and they 
were reluctant to fill it just anyhow. That is what I was told. So, 
eventually I wrote to Jimmy and I said, I’ll come. So, I was concerned 
that they implied that the SIU could possibly be gunning for me. As it 
turns out the SIU wasn’t gunning for me at all and this was just part of 
20 
the smearing that stepped up on me after Sooner died. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was when now in terms? This was 2018? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  This is all 2018. In 2018 Deputy 
Chief Justice, I became a spy. I was chased by a car; the SIU and we 
were accused of taking Bosasa money which was also untrue. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 215 of 230 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay, yes. Thank you. Thank you, Chair. 
Maybe now that you’ve dealt with the issue of your appointment and the 
interview, I should just bring to your attention that Mr Hlaodi 
Motsoeneng has submitted an affidavit to the Commission. At page, 
paragraph 128 of his affidavit he says, the Commission amongst other 
things that he deals with about various employees. He says, 
The 
Commission 
should 
also 
check 
the 
new 
appointees and check what kind of processes was followed 
especially Thandeka Gqubule whom I have been advised never 
attended any interviews. 
10 
I know you do deal with the interview issue in your affidavit in 
particular at page 26. That you could not attend when other people 
were interviewed but you were subsequently interviewed. 
MS 
THANDEKA 
GQUBULE-MBEKI: 
 
Yes, 
I 
was 
subsequently 
interviewed by Sefako Nyaka, the head of current affairs and by Nyana 
Molete and then I had an interview with Jimmy Matthews and I, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. Thank you, Chair. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But this was my third return to the 
SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So, I was a known entity. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  So, they knew what they were 
getting and what they were not getting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 216 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And headhunting is a legitimate 
process and I guess Hlaodi would know that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. And then paragraph 180 
you deal with the death of Ms Suna Venter and you are relating her 
death to the threats that you were all receiving or are you just 
mentioning the matter? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Suna was unwell. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Suna had a heart condition but 
Suna was really, really going through the most. She was traumatized. 
10 
At certain times I would ask her because some of the stuff seem just so 
bizarre, so unbelievable and it’s only after her death that we realized 
that yoh, Suna had suffered a lot. And she was shot in the face in 
Westdene. This is not far from where I was chased. She was, her house 
was burgled, she was constantly scared. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  But Deputy Chief Justice the place 
is replete with mysterious deaths. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s very mysterious. So many things really are 
mysterious. 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The death of the former head of 
legal is very bizarre, I mean being shot at a time when the 
investigations are going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you look at all of these things that were 
happening to the SABC 8 and some of them happening to individuals 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 217 of 230 
 
who were in the SABC 8 like yourself and Ms Venter maybe more 
particularly ones which stretched into 2018 and so on. Are you able to 
say there may be other things other than the stand you took against so-
called protest policy and directives that were issued in 2016 that you 
are able to link this with? To say, it maybe it’s this and that and that 
and maybe it’s not part of it. It’s not connected with that stance you 
took or are you only able to say, if it’s connected with anything it looks 
like it can only be connected with the stand you took then? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I don’t know, Deputy Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t know? Yes. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I don’t know what’s connected to it 
and what’s not connected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  What I know is that in quick 
succession, devastating events occurred to us and what is most 
concerning is the institutional response to the events. I’ll give an 
example. I asked Nomsa Philiswa for the whistle-blower policy of the 
SABC because if you’ve got a whistle-blower line you must have a 
whistle-blower policy. And we had hoped that we could deal with this, 
these things are happening to us through the protected disclosures Act 
20 
which companies are obliged to follow and implement protections for 
internal whistle-blowers. She responded by saying, there is no such 
entity SABC and therefore, you cannot rely on what doesn’t exist. I 
remember I was driving with her in a car. And I said, but this is a no-
brainer. It’s the law. You have to have it. You can’t say to me there is 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 218 of 230 
 
no such and therefore your reliance on it is nil or it’s just something 
banal. So, I myself and Busi and the others sought to engage Webber 
Wentzel again to construct a potential or a draft or a skeletal whistle-
blower policy to protect not just us but anyone who in future hopes to 
stand up in workplaces especially at the SABC. And Webber Wentzel 
did this and about a few weeks after Webber Wentzel had drafted this 
skeletal whistle-blower policy for us at our behest. Well, the new 
gentleman, the new head of HR Jonathan Thekiso simply produced the 
whistle-blower policy from the annals of the IT system within the SABC 
and it was dated 2013 and he gave it to us. He said, the SABC has 
10 
complied. Here is the whistle-blower policy. What was that all about? 
So, even as we were being told by authority that there is no such, there 
was a whistle-blower policy. So, we were being led up the garden path 
because the argument that we cannot rely on this was to be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And comparing the 2013 policy and the one that had 
been prepared by Webber Wentzel, you would have no issues with the 
2013 one? It was fine as well? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  The 2013 one is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm but it had almost been forgotten. Not many people 
knew about it. 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Not many people knew about it and 
not many people trusted the internal whistle-blower mechanism. The 
perception was that if you made use of the internal whistle-blower 
mechanism you would be toast. And indeed, the history of whistle-
blowers in the SABC is that they get whipped out of the system. So, 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 219 of 230 
 
like Krivani and the rest of the SABC 8 would that particularly for 
SOEs. This country can develop measures to insulate and protect 
whistle-blowers from harm and from experiencing the kinds of harm that 
we have experienced. And because they are the ones who would stand 
between us in future capture. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair. Can I just ask before I 
take you to the last paragraph? As you would, I’m sure you would 
appreciate that you’ve reached the end of your statement? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chairperson 
10 
because this is a matter that Ms Pillay had raised regarding the report 
that Mr Joe Tlolo had prepared after having been commissioned to do 
so by the SABC. And you indicated in consultation that you had raised 
certain concerns about that report and I would like you to raise those 
so that when Mr Tlolo comes before the Commission tomorrow, he is 
aware of the matters that you are complaining about. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes, I did so in correspondence 
with the chief executive Madoda Mqakwe and Phatiso Magopeni, our 
boss as well as Ntate Joe Tlolo. I raised the issue that there are certain 
meetings in his report where Jimmy and Sibulelo are placed in those 
20 
meetings where they really were not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Jimmy Matthews? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Sibulelo, Ms Sibulelo Ditlakanyana. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 220 of 230 
 
She wasn’t in some of those meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Where she is placed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And Ntate Tlolo pointed out that in 
his view these are minor issues and they don’t affect the substance of 
his findings. He said, in fact that these are typographical errors but in 
our view these errors have bearing because they imply either Jimmy’s 
complicity or Sibulelo’s complicity in matters which they really were not 
involved. So, we would want that part of the report corrected but our 
10 
board and our CEO is aware. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  And there are just some details 
about who was chairing what meeting that need to be corrected. The 
other concern that we have beyond Krivani’s concern is that journalists 
must also be accountable in some way to the profession and to society. 
Precisely because they play a key role in the democratic dispensation 
and public service broadcast journalists in particular because of the 
power that they wield. To speak every day to 28 million people is a 
huge privilege that must go with inordinate responsibility. And the 
20 
impunity that is condoned in the Joe Tlolo report is for me inadequate 
as a response to the type of moral ethical crisis that journalism faced 
at the public broadcaster. Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. We will raise those. They will 
be 
raised 
with 
him 
tomorrow 
morning. 
Thank 
you. 
Chair… 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 221 of 230 
 
(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I’m sorry before. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that you raised the issue of journalists being 
accountable that they’ve got accountability, you may or may not know 
that I have on a few occasions complained that journalists and media 
houses are very much in the habit of giving people about whom they 
have stories to write very inadequate time to respond, very short 
notice. We here in the Commission have been subjected to the same 
thing and it looks like whatever appeal I make to the media to say, not 
10 
just us everybody please just give people adequate time to put their 
side of the story. It looks like they say, ah we don’t care about that. You 
get the impression that if journalists or editors think that they’ve got a 
scope or whatever they don’t care about somebody else’s rights. Even 
the kind of notice that they sometimes give it’s like they think everyone 
must be sitting and doing nothing and just waiting for them to write and 
say please comment my deadline is tomorrow. And they must drop 
everything and respond because they give you that short notice so that 
in the article, they’ll be able to say he did not come back to us. We 
invited him or her to comment, he didn’t but actually they give you an 
20 
extremely short notice to do anything and I don’t understand why so 
many journalists appear to think it’s right to do that. I suspect that it’s 
their own concerns, maybe selfish concerns about being the one who 
comes out with the story first and so on. But if the same things were to 
be done to them, they wouldn’t. They would find this unacceptable. So, 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 222 of 230 
 
you wonder where are these principles of fairness that we are all told 
are so entrenched in journalism. So, I just mentioned that for what it’s 
worth because I have mentioned it on a few occasions in regard to 
other people but in regard to the Commission as well you know. I think 
sometime early this year or last year the Commission was approached 
on Saturday afternoon by a Sunday newspaper to say, we must 
comment. They want to run a story the following day. I mean, what is 
that? Are we supposed to be sitting and doing nothing and just waiting 
in case one or other newspaper rights and says, comment? So, we must 
be available to comment within 24 hours. It’s just unacceptable but it’s 
10 
happening and something must be found to correct it because nobody 
would like that kind of thing to be done to them when they are on the 
other side of this thing. So, I mention it for what it’s worth. You are 
quite senior in the field and you may or may not be able to say, well 
this is the justification why people do this in the industry or you might 
be able to raise it where and whatever fora. To say you know, there is 
really concern about this kind of thing. I mean whatever the person has 
done you know, process is different from the merits. Just make sure 
that the process is fair you know. So, okay alright. That was just my 
thought. 
20 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I do take it seriously Deputy Chief 
Justice. I sit on the National Council of the… (indistinct). I attend the 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  I do feel that there is a 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 223 of 230 
 
conversation about ethics more broadly that we have to have as an 
industry especially at the time where revenues are seriously squeezed 
and so scoop culture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Is encouraged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  We need to draw some rules of 
some sort to introduce the principles of fairness but is a conversation 
that I do believe the industry has the intellectual faculty to engage 
with. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  As well as the will to look inwards 
and find resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. It’s quite important because even for the 
professional journalists if I’m the subject of the story that a particular 
journalist writes. I must be able whatever the story says about me, I 
must be able to say, this journalist was just doing her job; was just 
doing his job and it’s nothing personal. And I must be able to say, even 
though I disagree with this and that and that but he or she is just doing 
her job and she has followed a fair process. But when I’m not given 
20 
adequate time, I’m likely to think this journalist doesn’t care about my 
rights as an individual. He or she just cared about being the first want 
to come up with a story and I don’t think that’s a good perception that 
the profession she’d want to have. I would have thought that all self-
respecting journalists would want a situation where you might write 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 224 of 230 
 
about somebody but that person would be able to say, there’s nothing 
personal. You are just doing your job and you are not being sent by 
certain people to write certain things about me. You have not been 
captured. You are just doing your job. But when some of these things 
happen, I think it taints the image of the profession because too many 
people think journalists are not fair. They are driving certain agendas 
against certain people and it’s not good that the public should have that 
kind of perception about such an important profession. Okay alright, 
thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you. Just 
10 
lastly, what you’ve told the Commission for the two and a half hours 
that you’ve been sitting there, you summarize it at page 27. And I think 
it’s only fair that I allow you to just read that paragraph into the record 
because it summarizes everything that you’ve told the Chairperson. 
Yes, thank you. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  During the past 10 years, a 
determined and corrupt group of people laid siege to the public 
broadcaster to loot it of his resources and to lead it astray from its 
mandate. It was a systematic and rigorous project. It involved people 
inside the SABC and those outside of it. They wished to bend the 
20 
narrative to suit their misappropriation agenda. They were in different 
to the human rights of citizens and employees of the SABC. They 
violated the public’s right to know how they are governed. They violated 
the right of freedom of expression of their journalists. They violated 
labour rights and the rights to privacy the citizens and journalists have. 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 225 of 230 
 
The corporation buckled under the looting and the plunder. 4.1 billion 
was unaccounted for. The newsroom was a place of fear and pitched 
battles. They were vicious in their execution of their project and in their 
wake many people suffered; employees, families, children. Those 
considered to be opponents of their agenda were dealt with ruthlessly. 
This is the story of our recent history as a corporation. It is also the 
story of our country of how a cutlass of people laid siege to our lives 
and our livelihoods and helped themselves to our future. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chairman. That 
is the evidence from this witness. 
10 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  May I say one last thing? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Deputy Chief Justice, we want to 
thank you for hearing us. We have been yearning to have some moment 
of cathexis where we finally tell it all. We are worried about the SABC. 
The SABC as you may have heard or sensed is a place that inflames a 
lot of passions and it’s a much-loved corporation by its workers. And its 
future is in danger if we carry on with the current funding module which 
is already disrupted by three factors. It was disrupted by the plunder 
20 
and the stealing and that’s why some of us didn’t want the 
retrenchment’s because the staff have suffered so much and they 
didn’t, they are not responsible for the plunder. And so, others must 
plunder and they must suffer. Then the second part is that digital 
disruption has happened. People no longer watch TV through the 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 226 of 230 
 
normal device that you pay for and TV license, the future of the TV 
license is a mechanism for extracting sufficient revenue even though 
it’s 15% is in danger because of this digital disruption and the multiple 
use of devices; the use of multiple devices; excuse me. The third factor 
is that of broadcasters in the world and the SABC 8 took the time to 
travel throughout Germany and to do research on other public 
broadcasters throughout the world. The 3% contribution of the public to 
the broadcaster is an anomaly globally. The public deserves a healthy 
sound public broadcaster that is not subject to capture. Financial 
vulnerability therefore enables capture. It enables politicians to play 
10 
games with the future of the SABC by withholding funds and it makes 
the SABC a dictate to bailouts because the mandate, the noble 
mandate is unfunded. So, this unfunded mandate is in need now of 
another bailout and it’s not forthcoming and misery is about to begin. 
And misery in our country especially when it comes to so powerful 
mechanism of political, social and economic communication it is going 
to result in another opportunity for a looting spree. And at the SABC 
the staff fear the day that our honourable current leaders walk out the 
door and leave us to the ravages of enemies that we’ve seen before.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The Chairperson of the board of SABC, the current 
20 
group CEO Mr Mxakwe and now yourself. All of you have spoken about 
the situation in which the SABC finds itself with no funding coming. And 
the sense I’ve got each time each one of you I mean whenever each 
one of you spoke is that the SABC is or may well be on the brink of a 
calamity which could happen anytime. Is my understanding correct? 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 227 of 230 
 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  It is. It is very correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Deputy Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to put your finger on whether there are 
any legitimate reasons that people within the SABC think may be 
behind this situation or what you may be thinking why the SABC is 
allowed to be in, to stand on the brink of this calamity when that could 
be avoided? And from what I’ve heard could have been avoided by 
funding being provided months ago? 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  All I can say is that, the story of 
10 
this corporation is one for the ages because it is so powerful that the 
powerful seek to tame it. A weakened SABC is a controllable SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is where everything revolves. And well, Mr 
Mxakwe told me that the situation is so bad that he finds himself, he 
finds that every week he has to speak to his executive colleagues to 
ask them not to resign. Which seemed to suggest to me his pleas could 
anytime become ineffective and his colleagues might say, that’s it. And 
I think both, I think the Chairperson also if I’m not mistaken indicated 
the challenge that could happen if that were to happen. And of course, 
that we don’t know where that could put the SABC other than what we 
20 
know happens when a calamity happens. I said to Mr Mxakwe if I recall 
correctly, I’m not sure what if anything I can do at this stage before I 
finished the work of the Commission. But I’m very concerned about 
what the situation of the SABC that has been described to me by 
successive witnesses here. And it’s a situation where one wouldn’t like 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 228 of 230 
 
a calamity to happen and to say, maybe I could have done something. 
But sometimes it’s difficult to see what one can do. So, but it’s 
something that is very concerning. I’m reflecting on it, ja. Thank you. 
Thank you very much Ms Gqubule Mbeki. 
MS THANDEKA GQUBULE-MBEKI:  Thank you, Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For having come forward to share your experiences at 
the SABC over the period that you have dealt with and to tell me about 
what happened to this SABC 8 during the period that you have 
described. I’m happy that you did come forward to give evidence. I’m 
happy that other people from the SABC came forward including the 
10 
other members of the SABC 8. You may have to come back at some 
stage if we have reason to ask you to come back and I’ll still hear other 
evidence and so on. But I believe that the judgment of the Labour Court 
vindicated your position in regard to what you stood for. Of course, you 
have described to me a lot of other things that would have happened 
after that happened to you. The issue of being chased by a car over a 
certain period. I think your statements may be saying it was 15 minutes 
or whatever of being chased. It must have been a difficult time when 
you didn’t know whether you would crash against a car. But as I have 
indicated, I would like the investigators of the Commission to look into 
20 
some of the issues that you have raised. It is very important that we 
have people who will stand, stand up when things happen which they 
believe are wrong and because if nobody stands up then wrong things 
don’t get stopped. I’m really happy that you and the other witnesses 
came and gave evidence. Thank you very much and the other issues 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 229 of 230 
 
that I said should be investigated will be investigated and I will ask the 
investigators and the legal team to keep you informed. I have no doubt 
that you will give whatever cooperation to them. And then you would 
have heard what I said earlier to the other witnesses that I’m very keen 
for people in the media to reflect on what input, contribution they can 
make to the Commission with regard to what recommendations I should 
consider making in regard to what happened at the SABC, what 
happens with political interference with editorial policies, editorial 
independence. So, people like you should work on that so that at the 
right time the Commission can be enriched by the submissions that the 
10 
media can make. So, thank you very much for coming once again and 
you are excused. Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Mr Chairman. That is all for 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is all for today. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how many have we got tomorrow? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Tomorrow we’ve lined up only two 
witnesses Mr Chairman and that’s one of the things I like to talk to you 
about. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They are not going to be long witnesses at 
all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that might mean that we might have to 
05 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 157 
 
Page 230 of 230 
 
finish early. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, what’s your estimate when we might finish? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think by lunchtime. We should even. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By lunchtime? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or even slightly before lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. No, that’s fine but we’ll start at 10 o’clock 
then. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn at the stage and then tomorrow we 
will start at 10 o’clock. We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
