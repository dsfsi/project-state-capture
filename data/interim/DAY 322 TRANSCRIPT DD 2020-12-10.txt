20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Mothepu just by way of a 
background could you tell the Chairperson what is your 
profession – your qualification and your background in 
terms of your career? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Certainly. I have a B.Com Accounting 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 8 of 289 
 
Degree from the National University of Lesotho which I 
obtained in 2000.  And then I have a Honours in Corporate 
Finance and Investment at – from the Witwatersrand 
University.  I started working as a banker at Investec 
private bank in 2002 and I moved across to I think 
Nedbank as a – a senior corporate banker dealing with 
municipalities and public sector.  And I was invited by the 
City of Joburg Jason Ngobeni to head up their head of 
investor relations programs when the city started issuing 
diamond 
support 
bonds 
and 
so 
I 
accepted 
that 
10 
appointment.  I was there for three years and that is where 
I met with Regiments Capital as they were the City’s 
sinking fund on managers.  And I moved there in 2007 in 
October and I was primarily in the advisory division 
reporting to Eric Wood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh sorry when you say you moved 
there are you now talking about moving to Regiments? 
MS 
MOTHEPU: 
 
Yes 
I 
resigned 
from 
the 
City 
of 
Johannesburg. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The City of Johannesburg. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  And in – and I was appointed as an 
associate director at Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which year did you move away – resign 
from the City of Johannesburg? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I think October/November 2007.  Yes and I 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 9 of 289 
 
was appointed as an associate director reporting to Mr Eric 
Wood who was one of the directors and shareholders. So 
the significant mandate that I held I work on – you actually 
had a discussion with Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi last week.  I 
drafted that mandate letter with Priscilla Mabelane and our 
mandate was essentially to assist the airports company to 
upgrade their habit and investment program in preparation 
for the 2010 World Soccer – Soccer World Cup. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So we assisted them in updated their 
10 
capital investment program, a funding plan and then the 
execution thereof. So I led that transaction along with Eric 
Wood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  so – sorry the full name of Regiments is 
that Regiments Capital Pty Ltd? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you joined them towards the end of 
2007? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes October/November. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
October/November 
2007 
as 
an 
20 
associate director? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Associate director with Mr Eric Wood? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Pardon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you say associate director with Mr 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 10 of 289 
 
Eric Wood – together with? 
MS MOTHEPU:  So Eric is a director. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is a director okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So for how long... 
MS MOTHEPU:  So are Mr Leballo associate yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see.  Yes.  So for how long were 
you with Regiments? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I was with Regiments for three years. 
ACSA kept me busy. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is until 2010? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Absolutely then I moved to Transaction 
Capital as a debt capital specialist and then I decided to 
go Wits and do my M.Com and I managed to do the course 
work but my thesis is still outstanding.  And then I was 
approached by KPMG to be an associate director at their 
division in I think it was Infrastructure of Projects and that 
was now November 2014 and I was an associate director 
there as well.  So I got a call in May 2015 from Eric Wood 
and we had coffee. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  May 2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. And he told me that would I consider 
returning to Regiments it has changed significantly working 
with McKinsey one of the best consultancy firms in the 
world and now they have got Blue Chip Public Sector 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 11 of 289 
 
clients and they are doing very structured and interesting 
work.  And he essentially gave me a black – blank cheque 
and he gave me my salary and a sign–on bonus. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So by that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He gave you? 
MS MOTHEPU:  The salary increases from what I was 
earning at KPMG and a sign-on bonus to have me back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry I do not know whether… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja the microphone is not good. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is an echo or whatever I am not 
sure there is something that.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja there is – the sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja where are the technical people?  Also 
if the technical people can switch off the screen.  I assume 
that they can switch it off without interfering with television 
and so on because it was used for the witness who needed 
to use a screen for – to show some figures.  Ja.  Okay let 
us try again and see whether the echo is still … 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  Is that better?  Or am I too close? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you are too close but probably 
that is not the only reason.  Do not be too close do not be 
too far. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Okay. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 12 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So ja okay let us try again.  You said – 
you were talking about Mr Eric Wood having giving you a 
blank cheque or whatever? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes he was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So? 
MS MOTHEPU:  He was very keen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said something about your 
salary that is what I need? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes he substantially increased my salary 
from KPMG to Reg – 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tripled it? 
MS MOTHEPU:  No I think there was a KPMG I think I was 
on 1.3 and then I went to 1.75 and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he 
MS MOTHEPU:  And then I got an R500.000,00 sign-on 
bonus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So he was keen for me to come. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes and it was good.  So I started at 
Regiments on the 15 June and we had a good rapport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:  2015. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 13 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Chair. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  And we had a good repore.  I found 
out that they had contracts with McKinsey and the Public 
Sector 
clients 
were 
Eskom, 
Denel, 
SA 
Express 
and 
Transnet and if felt good to be part of a – I would say a 
transformed black advisory firm because when I had left 
there; there were only fifty people and when I – when I 
returned there were two hundred and fifty people.  So I 
was so proud that black professionals can have a credible 
business. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you – can you tell the Chairperson 
your relationship with Mr Eric Wood? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I think he took me everywhere.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that now including before you left or 
only after you came back? 
MS MOTHEPU:  After I came back.  So I would go with him 
to all the meetings with Anoj Singh, Gary Pita, Matshela 
Koko, SA Express and Unathi Njanga [?] so essentially 
where every single meeting I would accompany him, take 
notes and I will execute.  So we had a very good 
20 
relationship.  And we were both early birds and so he used 
to come… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just before that what – what is your 
position now in June 2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Oh a Principle. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 14 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is Principle is that equivalent to a 
CEO? 
MS MOTHEPU:  No it is – it is below partner. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  Okay you may proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And below – I assume partner obviously 
must be above CEO? 
MS MOTHEPU:  They took on McKinsey's hierarchy so it is 
Principle and then you become a partner.  But with 
Regiments it is below a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And CEO is where in that hierarchy? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  CEO was I would say Litha Nyhonyha so I 
was two levels below him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so proceed you were saying the 
two of you were early birds? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes we were early birds.  We had a very 
good relationship.  We would share professional and 
private stories in the – the – so I used to have coffee with 
him from around seven o’clock.  And so one morning on the 
20 
26 October 2015 out of the blue he tells me that the 
President of the Republic Jacob Zuma was going to fire 
Nhlanhla Nene who was then the Finance Minister.  Now I 
did not understand the significance of what he was telling 
me I was actually quite bored because our previous 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 15 of 289 
 
President had been doing various re-shuffles and I did not 
understand why I was being told about this one Minister 
getting fired. And he told me that the new Minister will be 
more pliable and he will approve various transactions that 
the old Minister was not approving.  He mentioned too the 
nuclear deal and hybrid capital which he wanted to 
potentially 
have 
a 
mandate 
from 
the 
state 
owned 
companies so that they can earn a fee but a lot of the state 
owned companies were reluctant to issue it. 
 
So subsequent to that – so I did not ask him how is 
10 
the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you say he mentioned two 
like projects or? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One was the nuclear deal the other one 
was what? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Hybrid capital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Were those projects that Regiments 
was working on already or had been working on that you 
knew about?  Or was he mentioned to you projects that 
20 
were still being planned? 
MS MOTHEPU:  He had proposed it to the CFO’s of I think 
Eskom and Transnet because they were the ones who had 
the largest funding debt requirements and the CFO’s 
response was that the board does not understand the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 16 of 289 
 
instrument.  So they were very reluctant to approve an 
extracted instrument that they did not understand.  So it 
was something that they had already proposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now which of the two projects are you 
talking about now nuclear? 
MS MOTHEPU:  The Hybrid Capital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And were you at that time before he told 
you about Mr Zuma’s plan to fire Mr Nene were you aware 
10 
of the existence of those projects? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I – we have had discussions with him 
regarding the Hybrid Capital that is why I knew the 
reluctance of the CFO’s and the boards to approve them.  
But the nuclear deal no I had only heard about it in the 
media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So it was the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you heard about it. 
MS MOTHEPU:  He discussed it with me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Correct.  And I have to say that he did not 
tell me who the new Finance Minister was and I did not – I 
was not curious as to why he is telling me and who told 
him.  Because for me I did not understand the significance 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 17 of 289 
 
of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Then he went to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just before that. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Mothepu.  What sort of services 
does Reg – did Regiments offer?  Is it in the – I see you 
have qualifications in finances. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Hm. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was that the services Regiments were 
offering? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Well ja Regiments had asset management.  
It had advisory, it had management consulting and it had 
securities.  So I was in the advisory division.  So most of 
our services were in the – in providing public sector clients 
with 
capital 
raising, 
debt 
restructuring, 
financial 
risk 
management, drafting funding plans for them, the club 
loan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is in the finance field? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In the finance field. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 18 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now the – what you refer to as the 
Hybrid Capital.  If you break it down for us in layman’s 
terms so that we can understand it. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What did it entail? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Okay.  So Hybrid Capital is when you raise 
an instrument that has the characteristics of both equity 
and debt.  And – so that the rating agencies will allocate a 
little bit of that instruments to equity and debt.  And what – 
and it is subordinated in terms of the – in the waterfall.  So 
10 
it is senior debt and subordinated debt.  And the good 
thing about it is that for example a preferent share you can 
defer interest payments so it is quite flexible. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  And Eskom and Transnet had their debt 
service ratios were very high.  So if the issued a Hybrid 
Capital some of that debt. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Debt. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Will be to – will be in equity where it will 
not – detriment their debt service ratio and then they will 
20 
not get an A – a credit downgrade. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  My understanding of a debt which 
is subordinate is that means it is not made immediately 
payable – repayable.  Is that correct? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes you can defer the interest payments. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 19 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So they defer the payments. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this is the concept. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Of our… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Regiments was proposing to SOE’s at 
the time. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we – ja they subordinate a debt and 
kind of increase your capital so you look good in the books 
– your debt can be paid over time. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  Plus your – you will look good with 
your credit rating agencies which will keep your credit 
rating on a – an investment grade which means your cost 
of borrowing will be cheaper. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Plus some of the existing loan agreements 
had ratios that could not be breached.  So… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you know – do you know which SOE 
had been offered this proposal? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Transnet and Eskom because those were 
20 
the ones with the largest funding requirements and a lot of 
pressure on their balance sheet. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  So Mr Eric Wood then tells you 
Minister Nene will be replaced by a more pliable… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 20 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you have that debt that is a 
subsidiary you said? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Subordinated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subordinate that probably means that the 
client whether it is Eskom or Transnet ends up paying more 
interest than it otherwise would – would have had is it not?  
Because if you make the period of the loan longer then you 
will – you might be happy that you do not have to pay now 
but for quite some time but later the interest would hit you. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is very true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Plus I think they are a little bit more 
expensive because they are riskier.  So they are ranked 
below the senior loans so they are subordinated.  So of 
course the investor would want a little bit more return for 
the subordination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So that may well have been 
the reason why the then Minister Nene was reluctant to 
accept these proposals. 
MS MOTHEPU:  I suspect so. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 21 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you say he did not say – he did not 
tell you however who is the pliable Minister who will 
replace Minister Nene? 
MS MOTHEPU:  No he did not tell me who the new Minister 
would be. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so you have – you have placed the 
date of this conversation on the 26 October 2015 and I 
mean what is your observation of events thereafter? 
MS MOTHEPU:  From what I have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before – before that how certain are you 
10 
that that was the date? 
MS MOTHEPU:  There is a – he sent me an email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright – yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So tell the Chairperson about that email 
20 
and does it relate to what he was telling you? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we can go to the email. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322

numbers top left corner of the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  679.8 Chairperson. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  679.8. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .8. 
MS MOTHEPU:  It is interesting because when I first went 
to the Public Protector I said and told her but then I 
retrieved my Regiments email and then that is why I can 
say it was the 26 of October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh so – sorry so that the Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am at 679.8. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay talk about that email? 
MS MOTHEPU:  So it is National Treasury 26 October 2015 
as you can see it is an email from Eric Wood on Monday 
what time is that?   
CHAIRPERSON:  It is … 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 23 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The time… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is eighteen minutes past ten on the 
26 t h. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  October 2015. 
MS MOTHEPU:  To Mosilo Mothepu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So he comes to my desk . 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that email address there was … 
MS MOTHEPU:  Is my email address. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your email address at Regiments? 
MS MOTHEPU:  At Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is mosilom@regiments.co.za. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Mosilo.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Then he tells me that he has sent me this 
document and I should keep it because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The email just says one 
attachment 18KB is that right? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  And this is the attachment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is the attachment the document that 
starts at page 679.9? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 24 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct Chair – Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is headed National Treasury 
discussion points key initiatives? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay was it just that document – oh that 
must have been just that document. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the next one as … 
MS 
MOTHEPU: 
 A 
– 
there 
is 
twelve 
initiatives 
so 
essentially these were the projects that they wanted the 
10 
new Minister to approve.  For example if you go to one that 
we have just discussed number 6.  Hybrid debt capital it 
says? 
“Support the issuance of Hybrid debt issuance by SOE’s in 
order to bolster their equity positions in particular Eskom 
ensuring that the Hybrid instruments are in fact quasi debt 
i.e. subordinated debt and that they do not confer real 
equity rights and benefits.” 
So there that hundred basis points is the fee that they want 
to earn if they raise R50 billion of Hybrid Capital.  That is 
20 
1% of R50 billion is how much? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it R500 million?  Or is it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Finance person and she … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She should know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Document from your company. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 25 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  10% is ja – it is something big. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  [Inaudible]. 
MS MOTHEPU:  1% of R50 billion somebody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  R5 billion it is R5 billion. 
MS MOTHEPU:  No – it is R5 billion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  R5 billion. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes so this was the fee R5 billion that they 
envisioned if Eskom issues a Hybrid Capital.  And then the 
rest I do not think we should go but it was just – they 
wanted - the minister projects so that he looks good but the 
10 
engine room will be Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, let us ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   And though ...[indistinct] [speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS 
MOTHEPU: 
  The ...[indistinct] [Speaker

approves these ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   contracts(?).  [Speaker not clear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that document is headed:  National 
Travel - Treasury Discussion Points – T Initiatives.  Then it 
20 
has got 12 topics. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
1. Is Collateralised Municipal Debt.   
2. DBS ...[intervenes]  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 26 of 289 
 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Find model. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...find the model.   
“3. 
Risk Charge on National Treasury Debt. 
4. 
Debt Redemption Management. 
5. 
Collateralised Property Development.   
6. 
Hybrid Debt Issuance. 
7. 
Project and Specialised Finance. 
8. 
South African National Black Bank.   
That is about facilitate the establishment of a black 
10 
bank in order to ensure state business supports 
black industry. 
9. 
A South African National Black Insurer. 
10. 
SA National Black Life Company. 
11. 
Centralised Procurement of Key-Items. 
12. 
Collection of Municipal Debt. 
 
I have mentioned 8 what it seems to be about according 
to the document.  Nine, which refers to the South African 
Black – National Black Insurer.  The document says: 
“Ensure that the state supports the establishment of 
20 
a National Black Insurer for the short term insurance 
requirements 
of 
state. 
 
Vehicle 
fleet, 
aircraft 
infrastructure, insurance and other insurance.   
The National Insurer will work closely with state to 
ensure that the right product and partnerships are 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 27 of 289 
 
established for the benefit of all. 
 
And the Supply National Black Life Company, the 
document says: 
“Assist in the establishment of a National Black Life 
Company for the life insurance requirements of state 
and state employees (life cover, general cover, 
credit life, additional investment products).” 
 
In terms of the first time:  Collateralised Municipal Debt 
is: 
“Assist hereto municipal entities to efficiently tap 
10 
capital 
markets 
through 
facilitating 
the 
collateralisation of debt with the financial assistance 
of De Beers, AN and PIC through support for the...” 
 
Is it me-se-mine(?)? ...[intervenes]

[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   [Indistinct] [Speaker unclear]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It sounds like plans for something 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, so ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that was to be proposed.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Exactly.  So if – the fee will be ...[indistinct] 
[Speaker unclear] which is 0.3% of R 20 billion.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right to say, it sounds like plans 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, these ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or certain projects that ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   [Indistinct] [Speaker unclear] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...propose? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So these are the new key initiatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   But they wanted the new minister to look at, 
approve and ...[indistinct] [Speaker unclear] they have also 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 29 of 289 
 
put their fee on each project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Project, yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that – what you have just said, of 
course, is not written here.  Is that because that is what he 
told you or where do you get that from? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, that is what he told me when he sent 
me this.  He told me that these will be the new minister’s 
initiatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   And I should say that because he has bad 
admin skills.  And indeed I say it.  It is all here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So he sent as a document 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   An email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that reflected the new initiatives that 
would be the new minister’s initiatives? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But proposed by him? 
MS MOTHEPU:   By him, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or Regiments. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said you must keep it safely because 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 30 of 289 
 
he had bad admin. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay continue Mr Seleka. 
MS MOTHEPU:   It is worth mentioning that ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe let her mention what she wants 
to mention. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   It is worth mentioning.  In the Regiments’ 
papers, they – the three directors have instigated court 
cases to declare each other a delinquent director.  He sent 
this same email to Salim Essa at eight o’clock.  So I will try 
and get the court documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So...  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what Ms Mothepu is trying to say 
Chair, which she told us yesterday, is that this email with the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 31 of 289 
 
document is part of the court papers between Mr Eric Wood 
and Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so there is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Corroboration of what she says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  That this email would have been 
sent to Mr Salim Essa prior to it coming to her.  And is dealt 
within the papers and she will try to locate that for us. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   But what I wanted to say to say to the 
10 
Chairperson because you were reading those paragraphs.  
Particularly, paragraph 8 and paragraph 9.  It is interesting.  
They say it is a black bank.   
“Facilitate the establishment of a black bank in 
order to ensure state business supports black 
industry.” 
 
And when you look further Chair.   
“The 
stage 
wage 
accounts, 
SOE, 
provincial 
governments and the municipalities will use the 
services of this bank as opposed to the services of 
20 
the current commercial banks.” 
 
[laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I did not pick up that part.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 32 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see the same thing?  In the next 
paragraph, that is targeted but actually to the state even 
though they use a black insurer.   
“Ensure that the state supports the establishment of 
a National Black Insurer for the short term insurance 
requirements 
of 
state. 
 
Vehicle 
fleet, 
aircraft 
infrastructure, insurance and other insurance.” 
 
So it is a target on government 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I wanted us to connect the dots.  Something 
happened in October.  From what I have seen from former 
Finance Minister, Mr Mcebisi Jonas.  On the 23r d of October, 
he was taken to Saxonwold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And after ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is two days before you went. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And he was offered 600 000 in a bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Million? 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, a deposit.  Six hundred thousand in a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 33 of 289 
 
bag and six hundred million ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
cannot 
remember 
the 
figures 
...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, if he works with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So he...  From what I can recall.  He called 
the Minister Nhlanhla Nene and they were ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Nene? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Over the weekend. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who called? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mcebisi Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.   
MS MOTHEPU:   But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he called him on Friday after the 
meeting with the Saxonwold. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Nene was on his way to KZN.  
They arranged to meet on Sunday and then Sunday, they 
shifted it to ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   To Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to Monday morning. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  And they had a conversation in the 
morning on the minister’s ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear]  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 34 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MS MOTHEPU:   ...balcony. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was on the balcony. [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   So after having that conversation, Eric is 
telling me ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, say again? 
MS MOTHEPU:   At the same time, Nhlanhla Nene and 
Mcebisi 
Jonas 
are 
having 
a 
conversation 
about 
what 
happened in the weekend.  I have been told that the finance 
10 
minister is going to be fired. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, just...  Just ...[intervenes]  
Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought the meeting was on the 23r d.  
It was on the 23r d which was a Friday.  That is the meeting 
between 
Mr 
Jonas 
and 
one 
of 
the 
Gupta 
brothers 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...as 
well 
as, 
according 
to 
him, 
Mr Duduzane Zuma and mister – somebody else who was 
20 
Mr Duduzane Zuma’s friend.  And then ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Bana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Bana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...they – Mr Jonas and Mr Nene meet at 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 35 of 289 
 
Treasury, at National Treasury in the balcony in the morning, 
on Monday ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   26t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that Monday is the 26t h. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say that is the day you were told 
by Mr Eric Wood that Mr Nene was going to be fired. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And are you also saying, it was actually in 
the morning when you were told this by Mr Eric Wood? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  Remember, I was an early bird. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   And he sent the email at ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So it was in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say it was around ten o’clock? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Probably earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Earlier? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Because I think an hour or so passed after 
me going back to my office. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So it was not immediate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So but you are simply saying...  It is 
interesting that ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 36 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   According to Mr Jonas, he was told at the 
meeting on the Friday at the Gupta house, that Mr Nene 
would be fired. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when he tells Mr Nene this on 
Monday, the 26t h.  That is the morning you were also being 
told by Mr Eric Wood the same story. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   [Indistinct] [Speaker unclear] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the email that you have referred the 
Chairperson to, comes, you say, an hour or so later after 
Mr Eric Wood had told you this is what is going to happen. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct.  And he sent that email at around 
eight o’clock to Salim Essa.  If I recall from the court papers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From the court papers. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well... 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So during this time, Tebogo Leballo who 
was the Financial Director of Regiments Capital.  He tells 
...[intervenes]  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 37 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MS MOTHEPU:   He tells me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the name? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Tebogo Leballo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Who was the Financial Director at 
Regiments Capital.  And he tells me that Mohammad Bobat 
was going to be the minister’s special advisor which I 
thought was quite interesting because he does not have any 
public service experience but we continued our day. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that on the same day now/ 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, it was a few weeks later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A few weeks later? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But still in October?  Oh, no.  Probably 
November? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, probably November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Probably November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOTHEPU:   So by that time, the Regiments’ directors 
had decided to split.  Erich and Salim Essa wanted to buy 
Regiments’ advisory.  So Eric had picked a team that he 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 38 of 289 
 
wanted to take to Trillian, for form Trillian.  So he was 
supposed to acquire Regiments and then he forms Trillian.  
So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  May I interrupt? 
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They just want you to sit a little bit...  
Just put the mic away from you.  Pull it away from you.  Push 
it away from you a little bit. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Push it away. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, a little bit away. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So he invited to signature in Morningside 
and – sometime in November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who invites you now? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Eric Wood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Wood, ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And tells me that he is going to form Trillian 
and he would like me to the CEO of Trillian Financial 
Advisory and he would like Mohammed Bobat to be the CEO 
20 
of Trillian Management Consulting and Grant Joseph to be 
the head of – CEO of Securities and Daniel Roy was already 
CEO of Trillian Asset Management.   
 
What is significant to that is.  Because they knew that 
Mohammed, Mr Bobat was already going to be the minister’s 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 39 of 289 
 
advisor.  Eric Wood and Clive Angel and Mr Bobat and Salim 
Essa started to recruit for the new Trillian Management 
Consulting CEO and they recruited Ms Bianca Goodson.   
 
She will come soon and you will see that her contract is 
signed on the 30t h of November.  So they were already 
planning or what will – to happen in December.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Ms Bianca Goodson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we have a copy of that contract by any 
chance?  If we do not have it, it will be good to have it. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I cannot recall whether it is 
annexed to Ms Goodson’s affidavit but she does refer to the 
contract and when she – when it was signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If...  We will double check ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody must check, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will be part of her affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay.  So on the 9t h of December 2015, so 
while I was asleep, I received a call from my former life 
partner, Ambassador Vusi Mathibela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the date now? 
MS MOTHEPU:   This is the 9t h. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 40 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 9t h of December? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I received a call from him.  He was the 
Ambassador ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...of South Africa and Zimbabwe, based in 
Harare.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say while you were still sleeping? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he called ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the morning? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I used to sleep at ten and the reshuffle(?) 
was usually on the night ...[indistinct] [Speaker unclear] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are not sure ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   I ...[indistinct] [Speaker unclear] in the 
morning Chair.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are not sure whether it was the 8t h 
or the 9t h? 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 41 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So he calls me.  So I will say, he told me 
that the president had fired the minister.  I told him I had 
known for some time but he could not – how could I possible 
know?  But he was trained in Intelligence.  So he always told 
me never discuss political issues on the phone. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   So he ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu? 
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when was Minister Nene fired? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Midnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was on the 9t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 9t h? 
MS MOTHEPU:   On the 9t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the 9t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
So 
then 
you 
get 
a 
call 
from 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  As in the president has just made the 
announcement ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   But he told me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 42 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   I was sleeping. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So and then you tell her – you tell 
him that:  I have known that for some time. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he is wondering how did you know 
that? 
MS MOTHEPU:   How...  Yes.  I am not part of the 
Deployment Committee of the ANC. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And so what do you say in 
response? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I tell him:  I cannot go on.  Because he has 
trained me never to discuss these kind of matters over the 
phone.  So I – he pressed and he did not succeed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He succeeded? 
MS MOTHEPU:   He did not.  I did not tell him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   How I knew.  But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the – if I recall correctly.  The 
20 
announcement of Mr Nene’s dismissal was either early 
evening or somewhere close or around midnight but it might 
have 
been 
early 
evening. 
 
Do 
you 
recall 
when 
the 
announcement was made or is that something you cannot 
recall? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 43 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   I know Nene’s date is the 9 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I know that the date, the Nene date was the 
9t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So I suspect he(?) needed(?) late on the 
8t h.  Remember, the markets were acted(?) on the 9t h.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, announcement was on the 9 t h.   
MS MOTHEPU:   Was it on the 9t h? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   So difficult to ...[intervenes]  
Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, because Mr Fuzile who was Director 
General of the – of National Treasury.  He was on his way 
home 
in 
the 
afternoon 
when 
he 
got 
a 
call 
from 
Mr Godongwane of the ANC, telling him that he was going to 
20 
get a new minister who would be accompanied by advisors...  
I cannot remember whether he said advisors supplied by the 
Gupta’s ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Gupta advisors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or advisors that he did not know. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 44 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the announcement at that stage had 
not been made yet.  And that was ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay.  That was on the 9t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Then the question arose.  How 
Mr Godongwane knew before the formal announcement was 
made. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he has dealt with that in his affidavit 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
Mr Godongwane  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...that 
has 
been 
furnished 
to 
the 
Commission.  So the announcement was certainly on the 9t h. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it means, Mr Magibela also knew 
before the formal announcement was made.   
MS MOTHEPU:   No, he knew...  He called me after.   
CHAIRPERSON:   If it is after, then it could not have been 
between the 8t h, later on the 8t h in the night and morning of 
20 
the 9t h. 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was at midnight, the announcement. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
It 
must 
have 
been 
in 
the 
night 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, it was midnight. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 45 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 9t h or 10t h. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So I...  So he made it at night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when he spoke to you, he spoke on the 
basis of what was official? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   What the president had announced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Okay. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, from the president’s website, back 
in 2015, the statement by President Jacob Zuma on the 
appointment of the new finance minister, the date is 
9 December 2012 at 12:00 a.m.   
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At 12:00? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A.m. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, midnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  [laughs] 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  Hence the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Then it should be 12:00 midnight. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Hence the confusion.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Ja.  So it was a – one of the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 46 of 289 
 
late night announcements – officials ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, 2015.  Oh, they say I said 2015(?). 
Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015, ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Magibela must have called you then 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Immediately after. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in the early hours of the 10t h? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  As soon as the president made the 
announcement, then he called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  That would have ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Immediately, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would have been probably early 
hours of the 10t h. 
MS MOTHEPU:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He deals with it in his book Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  He deals with it ...[intervenes]  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 47 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MS MOTHEPU:   On the... [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   He deals with...  I know he always asked:  
Who else did you tell?  So I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got it but just deal – just... 
MS MOTHEPU:   I do not ...[intervenes]  
Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what he says. 
MS MOTHEPU:   We are on ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, his book ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   [Indistinct]  
Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is his book called? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Vusi Magibela, Time is not the Measure, A 
Memoir.  And it is published ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you are referring to what page? 
Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...eighteen.  And we are on page 416. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  416? 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay.  So I will ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is page...  The paginated page is 
679.12. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 48 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it.  And it is 416 of the 
book? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I will just go to the relevant ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just go to the relevant part. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, so I will not take long.  So I start with 
the – on the 9t h which is the second last paragraph. 
“On the 9t h December 2015, I got back to my official 
residence in Harare after eleven at night.   
10 
I decided to catch up on the latest news in South 
Africa.   
I sank into my sofa next to my bed in dismay.   
In a late night announcement, Zuma had fired the 
Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene.   
Nene had been in the office for less than two years.” 
 
Then we will go to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
“I immediately called Msilo ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   “...who was supposed...  Skip the first 
paragraph and then go to 417. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 49 of 289 
 
“I immediately called Msilo, my life partner, who 
worked for a company called Regiments Capital who 
would later joint Trillian Capital Partners as the 
Chief Executive and Executive Director of the 
Subsidiary and financial Advisory. 
I knew she understood the Treasury, state-owned 
enterprises, 
banking 
institutions 
and 
her 
work 
entailed interaction with them. 
She told me how well-connected her boss, Eric 
Wood was with all those institutions and the higher 
10 
echelons of government. 
So you people have decided to fire Nene.   
I second(?) guessed(?), referring to a company who 
has close ties with government.   
Eish, eish [vernacular] explain.   
I told her, I just switched the TV on and discovered 
that Nene was out. 
I already knew what she said. 
I asked her to tell me what had happened but she 
lowered her voice and said:  Unfortunately, I cannot 
20 
talk over the phone.  I will tell you when we meet.  It 
is very sensitive. 
I pressed on further for an explanation but she 
asked me not to insist.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you.  Yes? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 50 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you done miss ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue.  Not the reading necessarily.  
Not reading the book unless there is something else in the 
book that you want to highlight? 
MS MOTHEPU:   No, I think I have made my point here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Miss...  Okay.  So this – he would have 
been 
the 
person 
you 
informed 
that 
you 
were 
aware 
beforehand that Minister Nene was going to be removed? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Well, what is apparent from that 
passage that you have just read, the last, is that he was 
aware that Regiments was closely connected to government. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he was my partner.  I shared my 
professional life with him.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What would you say about Trillian’s 
connection to government, higher echelons of government 
20 
from your observation at the time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what was that? 
MS MOTHEPU:   At the time I was at Regiments? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   The liberal come later. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 51 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But Regiments – was Regiments itself 
not serving government? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was.  It was – they had Business 
Development Partners.  Salim Essa and Moodley, who 
essentially got the contracts and then they got a fee for it.  
So I understood – because when I left Regiments, they were 
struggling to get those things on company contracts.   
 
But the minute they find on with Salim Essa and 
10 
Moodley, the doors were opened.  So – and it was from 
ministers to chairpersons to CEO’s of companies, FD’s, 
treasurers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The meeting with them? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They were having meetings with 
...[indistinct] [Speaker unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So, I mean, you know the 
connection is investigating State Capture.  From – and I 
20 
wanted you to explain to the Chairperson the nature of the 
relationship that you saw at the time, meaning, the business 
relationship, whether Trillian or Regiments had with – as it is 
expressed here, the higher echelons of government.   
MS MOTHEPU:   At the time, I was – I thought:  Wow, they 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 52 of 289 
 
have hit the jackpot.  They have just close relationships.  
And sometimes the chair-people will come to our offices and 
it is courtesy when you got to a client’s office.   
 
So it felt like Salim and Eric were more in control than 
the client.  It is like they are trying to get what the service 
provider told them to do which was a weird relationship.   
 
But I want a problem(?).  So there will be a problem(?).  
[Speaker unclear]  And if it does not happen, then somebody 
will call Salim and it will happen.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   That kind of relationship. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were personally aware of 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Of? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were personally aware of this?  You 
personally witnessed ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   I became aware of it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We know that later you became – I 
mean, you reported these matters to the Public Protector.  
But what was your sense of what was happening?  Did you 
20 
realise that this, at the time you are there, that this is, what 
we have know come to refer to as the Capture of the State? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Not at that particular point.  Can I just - 
lead the evidence and then I will let you know when the light 
bulb hits? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 53 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  So on that morning of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What morning are you talking about? 
MS 
MOTHEPU: 
 
 
The 
morning 
after 
the 
midnight 
announcement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that would be the 10t h? 
MS MOTHEPU:   The 10t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I walked into Eric’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   And I told him:  Oh, you were right about 
Nene ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOTHEPU:   ...getting fired.  And he said:  Yes, of 
course.  But then he went further to say:  But Mohammed 
Bobat who was a Principle at Regiments Management 
Consulting reported to Eric.   
 
He said he will be the Van Rooyen’s, the new minister’s 
minister – new minister’s special advisor and he will, 
essentially, set up a team at Trillian (because now we are 
20 
moving to Trillian) with special expertise and those people 
will be the one who execute these initiatives.  And he will 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The ones contained in the document? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 54 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[intervenes]  
Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS MOTHEPU:   And he will...  us or his team insider 
knowledge so that when the tenders come, they already have 
privilege information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOTHEPU:   So he was – that was the purpose of his 
appointment.  And he was supposed to be there for two 
years and then come back to Trillian.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Do you recall roundabout what time 
10 
that discussion took place on the 10t h? 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was probably first thing in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And your morning was seven o’clock? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  And he told me that...  Sorry.  Bobat 
was with the minister.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Was...? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Was with the new minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So certainly before eight o’clock 
20 
when this discussion took place. 
MS MOTHEPU:    That is right, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, because Mr van Rooyen gave 
evidence that on the morning of the – either on the 10/10 
or the 11 t h he went to a meeting I think in Melrose Arch 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 55 of 289 
 
where he had to meet somebody but I think Mr Bobat 
and/or Mr Eric Woods both came into the meeting in 
circumstances where he had not had any plans to meet 
them.  Okay, alright.   
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, so through this time Mr Bobat did not 
resign from Regiments Capital, he was – I do not know, he 
was moonlighting as an adviser or he was adviser and 
moonlighting at Regiments.  He kept the laptop, he kept 
the email address, he kept – he got paid.  In December he 
got paid and January he got paid and February and we 
10 
used to have two drivers.  So in the morning when you 
have a client meeting you fill out a form and you tell what 
time I have to go, please collect me.   
So I realised one of our drivers, Lawrence, is not 
longer available.  So I go to Eric and ask Eric what 
happened to Lawrence?  He said no, we cannot expect 
Mohammed to drive himself to National Treasury every day 
so he has exclusive rights to Lawrence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was on the same date, nearly the 
10 t h or when was it? 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   During that week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   During that week. 
MS MOTHEPU:   During that week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   He was at National Treasury and then the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 56 of 289 
 
following date he was at COGTA – I mean, the following 
Monday but it was still in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:   But it took me time to realise that one of 
your drivers was no longer available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say you wrote to somebody 
about the issue of the driver? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, I went to Eric Wood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   And complained and he said no, Lawrence 
10 
has been designated because it is not fair for Mohammed 
to drive to Pretoria every day without a driver. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka is that email here or not? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
MS MOTHEPU:    No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She does not say she wrote, she says 
…[intervenes] 
MS MOTHEPU:   It was a conversation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, she went and spoke to… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you spoke, I thought you said you 
20 
wrote to him [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MS MOTHEPU:    No, I had a conversation with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So Mr Mothepu, Mr Bobat is now 
– you say he does not resign at Trillian, he still remains 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 57 of 289 
 
…[intervenes] 
MS MOTHEPU:    Regiments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At Regiments.  He remains an 
employee there but he is also serving as the special 
adviser to the minister, Minister van Rooyen. 
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct, Mr Chair.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   The newly appointed Minister of 
Finance.  
MS MOTHEPU:    Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we know that his stay at the 
10 
Finance Ministry was short-lived.  
MS MOTHEPU:    Yes, Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What happened to Mr Bobat’s position? 
MS MOTHEPU:    He moved across with Mr van Rooyen to 
COGTA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To COGTA? 
MS MOTHEPU:    Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so he stayed there still, he 
continued there as a special adviser.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he continued there as a special 
20 
adviser.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said he was paid by Regiments in 
December 2015, is that right? 
MS MOTHEPU:    2015, January 2016 and then February 
2016.  So the market and the media did not know who the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 58 of 289 
 
two advisers were and I think Barry Bateman, a journalist 
broke the story, but which named Mr Bobat as one that 
advises and Eric and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Mr Wood. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Mr Wood, sorry.  Eric panicked a little bit 
so they conjured a plan because his partners, Litha 
Nyhonyha and Niven Pillay did not know about Nene being 
fired prior and he did not know that Mohammed was a 
special adviser. 
 
So 
when 
Tebogo 
- 
Mr 
Leballo 
had 
to 
meet 
10 
Mohammed in mid-February just after the story broke. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Mr Bobat and Mr [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, so Mr Bobat and Mr Leballo met and 
Mr Bobat had to sign a backdated December resignation 
letter.  I recall Eric was on leave and his PA was also on 
leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Wood. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:   You know, we – sorry.  And Mr Wood was 
on leave and his PA Ms Mapasa was also on leave so Tebo 
called her to come in to unlock Eric’s office and they put 
the resignation letter just underneath some papers just to 
essentially advance Eric’s misleading his partners that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 59 of 289 
 
indeed Mohammed had resigned in December, he just 
forgot to process the resignation letter.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:    I think one last part of Mr Bobat, 
Regiments Financial year ends end of February and we 
normally get bonuses in April, half in April and half in 
September but you have to be within the employ.  So 
obviously Mohammed had to be within the employ to get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have to be within the employ on 
both months. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:   So when we moved across to Trillian on 
the 1 March 2016, Regiments transferred the bonuses of 
the people that were going to get bonuses because we 
were transferred via a Section 197 in terms of the Labour 
Act but they did not include Mohammed Bobat.  So I was 
told by Mr Leballo and Mr Woods that it was Salim Essa 
who paid Mohammed a million bonus to compensate the 
fact that he was no longer of the employ of Regiments. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Mr Bobat was paid that amount. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, yes, so I am sure the investigators 
can verify bank statements to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am going to stop you there, Ms 
Mothepu I think both Mr – I think Mr Seleka underestimated 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 60 of 289 
 
how long your evidence would be.  I think your counsel was 
closer to the mark. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He thought it would be an hour, Mr 
Seleka thought 45 minutes might do.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   45 minutes. 
MS MOTHEPU:   May I have …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course he has not managed your 
evidence because we allowed you to just go on. 
MS MOTHEPU:   How – can I be given …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, hang on, hang on, Ms Mothepu, 
hang 
on. 
 
I 
am 
going 
to 
unfortunately 
disrupt 
our 
programme.  I need to take an adjournment.  Now I did not 
mention this to both Mr Seleka and your counsel and Mr 
Crouse because I thought we would finish at least by 
eleven o’clock.   
I told counsel who was going to come after, after 
you.  I need to go and speak for a very short time at a 
function at Constitution Hill.  So I had said to counsel who 
is going to lead the McKinsey evidence that we would start 
20 
at one, so we will have our lunch during the break when I 
am there and then we go on. 
But now I think we will have to – I will have to come 
back a little earlier so that we can continue with this 
evidence but I do not have an idea of how much more time 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 61 of 289 
 
we need in order to finish with her evidence. 
MS MOTHEPU:   15 minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu says 15 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   15? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   One, five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are counsels’ estimate?  What is 
your estimate. 
MR CROUSE:   Chair, I do not imagine it will be longer 
than 15 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Alright, okay.  No, that is 
10 
fine.  Well, all the evidence that – even though it has gone 
beyond what we expected is relevant and important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is fine.  So I think if – I think we 
are going to stop now.  I am speaking at twelve, I am 
supposed to speak for only 10, 12 minutes, so I think we 
should start at quarter to one, so we can use that 15 
minutes before I start at one o’clock with the McKinsey 
witnesses. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry that we have to have this 
interruption, I did not think it would affect you because I 
thought we would finish earlier. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So let us adjourn now and we will 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 62 of 289 
 
resume at quarter to one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you to everybody, are we ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are ready Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, may I start Chairperson by 
drawing the Chairpersons attention we have managed to 
10 
obtain 
a 
copy 
of 
Ms 
Bianca 
Goodson’s 
employment 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just for present purposes Chairperson 
I will hand it up so that we confirm the date of her 
employment contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the one.  The document I have 
just handed up Chairperson is not paginated but if you go 
to the second last page, the penultimate page that is where 
20 
the parties have signed the contract and the Chairperson 
will see there the date, the contract is dated at Melrose 
Arch on the 17 t h day of November 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She refers to that herself also in her 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 63 of 289 
 
own affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you want this to be admitted as 
an exhibit, or you want to deal with that later? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think I should deal with it later 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Maybe Ms Mothepu 
you can just refresh our memories with regard to what was 
significant about the fact that Trillian and Bianca Smith 
concluded this contract at the time that they did. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Certainly Chairperson.  If you recall 
10 
sometime in October/November, the Regiments directors 
decided ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   2015? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is important to always mention the 
years so that everyone knows which year we are talking 
about. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, 2015 they decided to part ways and 
20 
then Eric ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay hang on Ms Mothepu, you speak 
while I am speaking so, that will not ...[intervenes]  
MS MOTHEPU:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  That will not be captured 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 64 of 289 
 
properly on the transcript so you need to wait until I am 
finished then you can speak.  So just answer the question 
again, what was significant about the fact that Trillian and 
Ms Bianca Smith concluded this contract at the time that 
they did? 
MS MOTHEPU:   We had known that Mohammed Bobat was 
going to be the new Minister ’s advisor and Mohammed was 
supposed to Trillian’s management consultant so they had 
to replace him because he was going to the Minister in 
December.   
10 
So they head-hunted Bianca Goodson and if you 
can see that her contract is indeed signed in November 
2015. 
 
So 
essentially 
she 
filled 
Mohammed 
Bobat’s 
vacancy in preparation of them knowing that he will be 
deployed at National Treasury in December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in October 2015 Mr Bobat was 
employed by Regiments.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, he was an employee of Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Regiments.   
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
you 
are 
saying 
that 
it 
was 
contemplated that because he was going to be an advisor 
to the new Minister of Finance he would need to leave 
Regiments or Trillian and that would create a vacancy and 
Ms Bianca Smith was appointed to the position that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 65 of 289 
 
otherwise would have been Mr Bobat’s position.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the second item Chairperson is 
we managed to obtain a copy of the founding papers in the 
court application that Ms Mothepu referred to and I beg 
leave to hand that up as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a court application between 
various applicants and Regiments Capital against Mr Eric 
10 
Wood for him to be declared a delinquent director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, when was it lodged?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was lodged on the 11 t h of October 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay is the first applicant is it Ms Litha 
or Litha Veliswa Nyhonyha and various other applicants.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Regiments is the third applicant.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The first respondent is Eric Anthony 
Wood, the second one is Eric Anthony Wood NO the 
second respondent and then there are a number of others 
20 
up to six respondents.  You say it is an application where 
the applicant sort among other orders an order declaring 
the first respondent that is Mr Eric Anthony Wood a 
delinquent director.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 66 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   This one Chair I think I will beg leave 
to have it admitted as an exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to deal with that as an 
exhibit now or you want to deal with them later I guess do 
you not need to deal with the agreement first.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   This other one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well in the end it can be either.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It can be…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you want to deal with this first? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The agreement is well it is sort to be 
an annexure in Ms Bianca Goodson’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you want to check that because if it 
is there then you do not want to repeat it.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct then we deal with it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so let us take this, this is a notice 
of motion and a founding affidavit in the matter, in case 
number 
16/35530 
in 
the 
Gauteng 
Local 
Division 
Johannesburg that is Gauteng Local Division of the High 
Court and the founding affidavit is that of Mr Litha Veliswa 
20 
Nyhonyha.  Yes, and I guess…[intervene]    
ADV SELEKA SC:   And 19 other and 18 other applicants.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is Mr Litha Veliswa Nyhonyha and 18 
other applicants against Mr Eric Anthony Wood and five 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 67 of 289 
 
other applicants’, other respondents.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I had put that on record I thought you 
would give me the exhibit number.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh the exhibit number is U32. 
CHAIRPERSON:   U32.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Point three.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The notice of motion and the founding 
affidavit 
in 
the 
matter 
of 
Litha 
Veliswa 
Nyhonyha, 
10 
Nyhonyha is N-y-h-o-n-y-h-an and others versus Eric 
Anthony Wood and others case number 16/35530 is 
admitted as Exhibit U32.3.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The relevant potion of this exhibit 
Chair is on page, there are paginated pages let me refer 
the Chairperson to the paginated one, page 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh if Ms Mothepu has already looked at 
it she can just as part of her evidence tell us the relevant 
20 
part of it because she is the one who raised the issue of 
this papers then she can tell us the relevant part.  Well you 
can start by saying why it is important to have regard to 
this papers and then you can go to the relevant part if you 
are not sure where it appears Mr Seleka will guide you.     
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 68 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you Mr Chair.  So we can start on 
how we doing the pages? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, the…[intervene] 
MS MOTHEPU:   The top, right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, yes.  
MS MOTHEPU:   It is National Treasury and Mr Bobat this 
is – if you recall I have said that Eric Wood had sent me 
that document on the 26 t h of October shortly after telling 
me that the President will be…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that was talking about projects 
10 
that would be initiated?   
MS MOTHEPU:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MOTHEPU:   So even the Regiments matter where they 
wanted to declare Mr Wood a delinquent Litha Nyhonyha 
says on the 26 t h of October 2015.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are you reading from? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I am reading from 119. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What paragraph? 
MS MOTHEPU:   119.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 119? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Mr Nyhonyha’s affidavit?  
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me go there, yes okay.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 69 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   May continue Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Start from 
the 
beginning 
of that 
paragraph actually.   
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay.   
“on 26 October 2015 Wood sent an email to Mr Essa 
a copy of which is marked AF46 thereto.” 
Unfortunately, we do not have the annexures.  The subject 
heading of the email was: 
“National Treasury 26 t h October 2015.” 
And Wood writes: 
10 
“Hi Salim, 
As discussed I have crisply jotted down a few points 
for the FM these are not comprehensive in time I 
am sure.  I can develop a more comprehensive list.   
King regards, Eric.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you know what FM stands for 
then or do you…[intervene] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Finance Minister.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Finance Minister? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you based your knowledge on what 
just on FM or there were discussions where Minister of 
Finance was referred to as FM or correspondence? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I think it is just an inference from the 
conversation that I had with Eric that he was talking about 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 70 of 289 
 
a new Finance Minister and my inference is that he just 
decided to abbreviate it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay well I see that Mr Nyhonyha 
shares that view in the next sentence he says: 
“The reference to FM in context is a reference to 
the Minister of Finance.”   
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
This 
email 
and 
the 
accompanying 
document with a list of initiatives for National Treasury and 
the Minister of Finance has absolutely nothing to do with 
10 
Regiments business and it was clearly intended by who to 
assist Mr Essa and the latter over shows to National 
Treasury on behalf of Trillian.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, is it only that part you wanted to 
indicate or is there another part? 
MS MOTHEPU:   I think the other parts they just confirm 
the fact that he was given exclusive use of the driver and 
he still had a salary.  So I think, I do not think we 
should…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if there are parts that are relevant 
we can cover them as well.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I read them quickly Chairperson.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Oh yes, thank you.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 71 of 289 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I do so? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you read paragraph 119 which 
confirms the email that is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Seleka the aircon how is it 
like?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is again on.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is too noisy.  Okay alright.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so which confirms the email that it 
was sent - Chairperson we have received from the 
10 
instructing attorney for the applicant a copy of FA46 which 
they are busy printing out.  So…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry just repeat that oh you have 
received a copy of Annexure FA46.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   FA46 from the instructing attorney for 
the applicants in this very application they are busy 
printing it out for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we will see that, it should 
correspond with Ms Mothepu’s email in the document that 
20 
she received from Mr Eric Wood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the next part is paragraph 120 it 
says: 
“Wood withheld, the applicants are alleging, Wood 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 72 of 289 
 
withheld the Regiments material information in his 
possession pertaining to the employment of a key 
Regiment senior executive Mr Mohammed Bobat in 
a position outside of Regiments in December 2015. 
The circumstances of this appointment cost both 
reputational and financial harm to Regiments.  Mr 
Bobat suddenly and without any notification to 
Regiments took up an appointment in a high profile 
position outside of Regiments.  Regiments became 
aware of this only when it was reported in the media 
10 
that Mr Bobat had taken up an appointment as a 
special advisor to the new Minister of Finance 
despite 
apparently 
not 
having 
the 
requisite 
qualifications 
and 
while 
still 
an 
employee 
of 
Regiments.” 
Which is what Ms Mothepu was saying earlier. 
MS MOTHEPU:   I concur.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“In accordance with Bobat’s employment contract he 
was required to dedicate his services to Regiments 
20 
and for which he was paid a salary.  He was not 
permitted to take up the position as a special 
advisor to the Minister of Finance or any other 
Minister and remain as an employee of Regiments 
and being paid as salary for two months whilst he 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 73 of 289 
 
was entirely absent from Regiments.  The complaint 
against Wood is that he plainly knew that Bobat was 
illegitimately drawing his salary from December 
2015 to January 2016 whilst he was engaged at 
other at one or other Ministry and with the intention 
of returning Bobat as an employee until March 2016 
so as to enable him to qualify for a bonus to which 
he was obviously not entitled.” 
That is what you testified about.      
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, and being compensated by Salim 
10 
paying him the bonus through the Trillian bank account the 
R1million.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, if you recall my testimony that he 
was not entitled to a bonus but Salim Essa paid him using 
a Trillian bank account.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I remember that evidence.  
MS MOTHEPU:   Thank you.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   What - the deponent carries on: 
“What exacerbated the problem was the fact that 
20 
Wood 
then 
pretended 
that 
Bobat 
had 
already 
resigned in December 2015 of course this was plain 
nonsense because Bobat drew a salary in December 
2015 and January 2016 and Wood obviously had 
knowledge of this.” 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 74 of 289 
 
Attached hereto marked FA7, then the attach exchange 
between the two gentleman Mr Bobat and Mr Rossouw.  
The next paragraph says: 
“Bobat’s 
email 
was 
in 
response 
to 
Rossouw’s 
requesting Bobat’s comments and response after 
the matter was reported in the press and alluding to 
the appointments of Bobat and Whitley as special 
advisors to National Treasury.  I emphasise that 
Wood further permitted and consented to Bobat’s 
continued use of Regiments resources including a 
10 
laptop and other infrastructure facilities as well as 
the use of Regiments vehicle and driver to transport 
him to his new place of work as advisor to the new 
Minister between the period 9 December 2015 and 
15 February 2016 when the matter was first drawn 
to Regiments attention through the media.” 
Chair I think so far so good.  Now Ms Mothepu the next 
thing is the removal of Minister Pravin Gordhan. 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, on the 1 s t of March 2016 I moved 
across to Trillian Financial Advisory as the CEO via a 
20 
Section 197. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What date was that? 
MS MOTHEPU:   The 1 s t of March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MOTHEPU:   So I became the CEO of Trillian 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 75 of 289 
 
Financial…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second before that is done.  
It looks like paragraph 128 might still have relevant 
information.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, in fact it talks about exactly what 
she is starting to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that where she is starting okay 
alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But let us read it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No but that is fine if it were you wanted 
10 
to fit it, so she can start and come to it at the time that you 
planned to let her bring it in.  If you wanted to read it now 
if it is convenient it is okay.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mothepu can I read it now you want 
to deal with it? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Ja, I am happy.   
“Moreover 
Regiment 
has 
recently 
discovered 
contemporary communication exchanged between 
Wood and the Minister Van Rooyen and Whitley and 
another special advisor and Bobat pertaining to 
20 
commentary from Wood on input required by him 
into 
a 
speech 
that 
the 
Minister 
Van 
Rooyen 
subsequently delivered to the media.  In this regard 
I attach the following series of emails 28.1 Bobat 
using 
his 
Gmail 
account, 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 76 of 289 
 
Mohammedbobat@gmail.com email inter alia Wood 
on talks December 2015 forwarding him an email 
trail of communications concerning a subject having 
feedback from Minister Nqwene meeting with an 
attached 
economic 
outlook 
presentation 
12 
December 2015 being an apparent power point 
presentation.” Minister – how do you pronounce that 
surname? Minister? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which paragraph? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nqwene.  
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Nqwene thank you.   
“As Accounts Minister serving in the cabinet of 
South Africa as per Minister Rural Development and 
Land Reform.” 
This paragraph jogs my memory Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
MS MOTHEPU:   I recall on the morning, on the Monday 
when the Minister of Finance was now appointed the 
Minister of COGTA.  The Minister called Eric we were in 
the same car coming back from Transnet and I was with 
20 
Mohammed Bobat and of course they had appointed a 
public relations team to write the speeches of the Minister.   
So obviously they had prepared a National Treasury 
speech and over the weekend his portfolio had changed.  
So now Eric had to ensure that the public relations people 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 77 of 289 
 
write a new speech that related to COGTA.  So thank you 
for jogging that memory.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay one second before you 
continue I do not know Mr Chaskalson is here.  We did not 
finish at the time we hoping to finish Mr Chaskalson and 
the witnesses for McKinsey but we should be finishing 
anytime from now.  Okay alright let us continue.       
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair if you are done there 
Ms Mothepu we can go into how you became…[intervene] 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, the finer parts on Mr Bobat he spent 
10 
a lot of time at Melrose Arch meetings and Mr Salim Essa 
and Mr Eric Wood having meetings while he was the 
special advisor to the COGTA Minister.  Ms Bianca 
Goodson will come and testify about their relationship, yes.    
 ADV SELEKA SC:   Now just remind us quickly before you 
go over to the next point.  What was the purpose of Mr 
Bobat being placed at the office of the Minister of Finance 
as a special advisor?   
MS MOTHEPU:   He was supposed to essentially give 
Trillian insider information on tenders and give price and 
20 
technical specification and Ms Goodson will attest to that, 
so he transferred to COGTA.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know whether, do you 
personally know whether that did happen?  Personally do 
you know?  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 78 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes but I would prefer Ms Goodson to 
testify but she did confirm that indeed he use to give her 
documents on Gmail accounts and leave white paper 
envelopes with confidential government information.  Yes, 
so I think the plan just moved from National Treasury to 
COGTA.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh I see, so you also say in your 
affidavit you were given prior knowledge of the removal of 
Mr Previn Gordhan as a Finance Minister.  Can you tell the 
Chairperson briefly how did that come about?   
10 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, so after I had…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry please do not forget the 
question you put to her.  Paragraph 128.2 of that affidavit 
seems to have some importance.  It says: 
“On 14 December 2015 Ian Whitley in (also using a 
Gmail email account) emailed the Minister “S Van 
Rooyen” (using likewise a Gmail email account) in 
regard to the content of a draft media statement for 
the Minister.” 
A copy of the email trail is marked FA48 hereto as is 
20 
evident from the contents of the email emanating from 
Minister Van Rooyen it states and this is quoted: 
“Morning and thanks Ian, 
Please solicit Eric’s input on usage of municipal 
household 
assets 
for 
collateralisation 
we 
will 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 79 of 289 
 
discuss my inputs this morning.” 
Now what I want to ask you is whether what Minister Van 
Rooyen is referring to there in that quote namely he wants 
Mr Wood’s input on the usage of municipal local source 
assets or collateralisation.  Now I remember that that 
document that you said Mr Wood sent to you on the 26 t h of 
October had quite a few places where it was talking 
collateralisation.  
MS MOTHEPU:   You are correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could this be; could this provide a 
10 
connection that one what he was talking about now on the 
14 t h of December 2015 that is Mr Van Rooyen was 
something that had been contained in the document that Mr 
Wood sent to you on the 26 t h of October or it might not be.  
MS MOTHEPU:   It is the same thing Mr Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the same thing?  
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so you have a situation where on 
the 26 t h of October Mr Wood sends you a document and 
says these are the projects or that we want the new 
20 
Minister 
to 
initiate 
or 
we 
want 
to 
initiate 
with 
the 
assistance of the Minister I am not sure which is which and 
now you have an email a quotation from an email address 
from Mr Van Rooyen of course I think by then he had 
moved to COGTA but you are saying that this quotation 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 80 of 289 
 
links with one or more of the items included in the 
document that Mr Wood had sent you on the 26 t h of 
October.   
MS MOTHEPU:   That is correct Mr Chair and it dealt with 
the municipal debt so it was a COGTA initiative and they 
wanted and they wanted to securitize it or what is the 
expression collateralisation so now that portfolio fell under 
COGTA and I think that was why they hurried with this, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Seleka it is important that we 
quickly go through that document.     
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was sent to the witness on the 26 t h 
of October by Mr Wood and identify which of the 12 items 
links to this.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 679.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   679?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 679.9 of Eskom Bundle 14.   
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes, it was the first item on the initiatives 
list the collateralised municipal debt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ja item one of that document which 
20 
appears at 679.9 is collateralised municipal debt, okay 
alright, continue.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, then my question Ms 
Mothepu was explain to the Chairperson how did you get 
prior knowledge that Minister Pravin Gordhan would be 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 81 of 289 
 
removed as a Minister of Finance?  
MS MOTHEPU:   Okay just a way of background on the 1 s t 
I was appointed as Trillian CEO of financial advisory and 
Bianca Goodson was CEO of management consultant and 
Tebogo Leballo had moved across to be the financial 
director.  By this time my relationship with Eric has 
deteriorated and with…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had deteriorated which times was that 
now 2017,2016?   
MS MOTHEPU:   I would say January 2016. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   January? 
MS MOTHEPU:   2016.  
CHAIRPERSON:   2016? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   16? 
MS MOTHEPU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
MS MOTHEPU:   So I no longer went to his office for coffee 
and he was not telling me anything.  So I got my primary 
information from Mr Leballo the financial director.  So we 
20 
were sitting in a very tight open plan and it was the 16 t h of 
March I remember it was my birthday and Mr Leballo tells 
me and Bianca that the President wants Minister Pravin 
Gordhan ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is Mr Leballo telling you? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 82 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  And alongside Ms Goodson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Alongside Ms Goodson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  So it is three of us.  But he was whispering 
so he wrote it down on my notepad changing Finance 
Minister.  I still have the original notepad and it is – but I 
have made a copy. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright Mr Seleka will know exactly what 
page. 
MS MOTHEPU:  It is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes page 679. 
CHAIRPERSON:  679. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Point 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Point 1.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Point 1.6. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Which is Annexure NM3 to Ms 
20 
Mothepu’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes I see do you want to read what is 
written there Ms? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Changing Finance Minister.  Yes.  So I was 
shocked and horrified given the fact that NeneGate had – 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 83 of 289 
 
had such a devastating economic impact on South Africa and 
that the former President was considering removing the new 
Minister who had essentially stabilised the market.  So that 
really caught me off guard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this – you say you still do have the 
original document? 
MS MOTHEPU:  It is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is in your… 
MS MOTHEPU:  It is 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I think it will be important Mr 
Seleka that we have a Commissioner of Oaths who certifies 
that these copies are copies of that original 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he or she has seen the original. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and if the witness is happy to let us 
keep the original that is fine but if she would like to keep the 
original then we must just have a certified copy by a 
20 
Commissioner of Oaths who certifies – will certify that he or 
she has seen the original. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  We will attend to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do that Chairperson. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 84 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So is the page from your diary or 
just your notebook? 
MS MOTHEPU:  It is a notebook.  When I go to meetings I 
always write. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Summary of the notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this – this handwriting here is it Mr 
Leballo’s handwriting? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  It is Mr Leballo’s handwriting.  You will even 
peruse my notes and you will see a significant difference in 
handwriting plus Ms Goodson when she comes to testify she 
will confirm that indeed he wrote it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Leballo wrote these words – changing 
Finance Minister in front of you? 
MS MOTHEPU:  In front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Because he was whispering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  And I could not hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 85 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so effectively continue to tell me 
about the conversation between you and Mr Leballo in the 
context of this writing? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I think I expressed my shock and horror 
saying I cannot believe after the economic devastation of 
NeneGate the President would fire a – a credible Finance 
Minister who has managed to stabilise the market and I felt 
like the – the advancement of capturing Treasury was still 
happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did he – did he say anything on this – 
10 
on what he wrote here or in terms of mention the name for 
example and maybe when the changing of the Finance 
Minister would happen? 
MS MOTHEPU:  No he did not give a date or the new name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Of the new Finance Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay but obviously at that time 2016 
the Minister of Finance was Mr Pravin Gordhan. 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so if there was a changing of Ministers 
20 
– Finance Minister it would be him leaving the Portfolio? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So – but you say he did not 
tell you that is Mr Leballo who the new Minister would be? 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct Mr Chairman. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 86 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  How did your discussion around this 
issue proceed? 
MS MOTHEPU:  My shock and concern about the President’s 
advancement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes what else –  
MS MOTHEPU:  Advancement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so I just want you to continue if there 
is still more that you have not told me around this issue of 
changing Finance Minister? 
MS MOTHEPU:  No I do not think – I think I just expressed 
10 
my views and then I remember we had to go to EXCO and it 
was my birthday and then there was cake and then – and we 
left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  I do not think we spoke about it again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So did it appear like he just wanted 
you to know that there was going to be – or the Minister of 
Finance was going to be changed and nothing more – there 
was nothing he wanted you to do about it he just wanted you 
to know? 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  It is the same principle as Eric Wood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Just for your information. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 87 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay just give us the date again of this? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I cannot forget it was my birthday the 16 
March 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  16 March 2016. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And was Minister Gordhan removed? 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  He was removed on that – the following 
year. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2017. 
MS MOTHEPU:  But there is a few things that I need to 
traverse before we go there if you do not mind?  The last five 
minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja let us see – the Chairperson is.. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes.  I – so I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can hear what you say. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  I am saying there is a few significant events 
that happened before then and then we will deal with his 
firing if that is okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us me hear those. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 88 of 289 
 
MS MOTHEPU:  Okay.  So I – I – he asked me a very 
pertinent question about when did I realise Trillian was part 
of state capture and I think by that time the AmaBhungane 
and the Daily Maverick and the Sunday Times started to 
write the Gupta’s dealings with Tegeta, Eskom.  I was given 
unlawful instructions to issue invoices without contracts or 
work being done.  Trillian was doing work at Eskom about a 
contract and without being done so I left on the 31 May and 
then I resigned on the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which year?  Always mention the year. 
10 
MS MOTHEPU:  2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  31 May 2016. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You resigned? 
MS MOTHEPU:  I left the – I wrote Eric a letter raising my 
concerns and I resigned on the 22 June 2016.  Then I went 
to my lawyer because I was a director and I had to tell him 
what I suspected, the fraud, the impropriety and what my 
obligation was as a director because I had to fulfil my 
fiduciary responsibilities.  So when he told me I had to go 
20 
the PP or to a member of Parliament or to the police and I 
was very, very scared and because at that time I think the 
Gupta’s and Salim Essa were very, very powerful in the 
political arena. 
 
So I went to Cairo.  Now my partner was living in 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 89 of 289 
 
Cairo and I – when I saw the Hawks charges circling around 
Minister Pravin Gordhan and then when I saw the terms of 
reference of Thuli Madonsela I realised that I can help her in 
certain areas.   
 
So I – my partner and I decided that I had to go back 
to South Africa.  So I spent a couple of days writing my 
statements and we cut my vacation short and I made an 
appointment to meet the former Public Protector Thuli 
Madonsela and I gave her my statement but I asked her not 
to have my name in the report because I – I was not a 
10 
Minister I do not have security. 
 
And then I – I asked her if I can trust Minister Pravin 
because I wanted to warn him that I suspect those fraud 
charges are related to the fact that Trillian was already 
talking about the President wanting to fire you and I suspect 
these would – if the Finance Minister is charged with fraud 
he has to step aside.   
 
So I asked Thuli Madonsela if I could trust him the 
Minister and she said yes.  So I had his – the Minister’s 
special 
advisor 
made 
contact 
with 
me 
and 
told 
me 
20 
unfortunately the Minister could not meet me.  This is I think 
the 18 September 2016 so – but he wants me to meet Mr 
Jean Ravelle [?] who was the Minister special adviser.  
 
Now remember we – it was a Sunday afternoon and 
we met in a steakhouse and we were sitting in a booth and 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 90 of 289 
 
we ordered I think two bottles of wine because what I had to 
tell him was just so shocking and I conveyed that I do 
believe – it is a suspicion that I cannot really prove it but – 
so he went on to convey the – my message to the Minister. 
 
And then after that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your message to the Minister was 
basically that you understood that he was going to be 
changed? 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes and he was only changed if you recall I 
think it was 31 March. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it was … 
MS MOTHEPU:  Because of an intelligence report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot remember whether 17 March or 31 
March 2017. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But March 2017. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes – so – but you message you say 
about him revolved around the fact that you understood that 
he was going to be changed as the Minister of Finance. 
20 
MS MOTHEPU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Even though it was a year later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  31 March 2017 seems 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 91 of 289 
 
to be the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So yes the – he gets removed – 
well you know that brings to mind what we have heard here 
something said the previous year also happening in a later 
year what gets to be told to what you may not know if you 
have been following maybe you will know Mr Hank Bester the 
year before that we decided who is going to the boss of 
Eskom and lo and behold that is said in 2015 lo and behold 
in 2015 – April 2015 Mr Brian Molefe gets to be seconded to 
10 
Eskom.  So it does not surprise.  If you are done with your 
evidence Ms Mothepu I have no further questions. 
MS MOTHEPU:  I would just like to make a closing 
statement?  I will not take more than three minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You are done with her evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Thank you very much.  So after I went to the 
Public Protector my statement got leaked to the Sunday 
Times but it was not from her office and what ensued were 
20 
nine criminal charges that Trillian had laid a charge against 
me.  Cybercrime, fraud, theft, perjury, corruption and it was 
quite shocking how I was called by the police to give a 
warning statement. 
 
And he tells me – I will not mention his name since 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 92 of 289 
 
he has not – I have not put him in my affidavit.  He tells me 
that because of who these people are and the political 
connections they have they have – he has to expedite my 
case. 
 
When my lawyer went to see him he said there was 
no case here.  He is getting pressure from upstairs for him to 
move to the – for it to be moved to the NPA. 
 
And it was the first time I realised that institutions 
can be used to [00:14:10].  I used to [00:14:12] against 
people who stand up for the truth.   
10 
 
And what was also quite disappointing is that I was – 
I could find employment after two years because South 
Africa doubted my integrity.  Some of the banks said – were 
not sure how this Minister will react if you are part of the 
team. 
 
So corporate is always saying we want people of 
integrity but I can say the people who have sat here with you 
like Suzanne Daniels and myself we are unemployed, we 
have lost our livelihoods and also so I am just saying 
corporate give us a chance.  We stood up and our lives have 
20 
been devastated plus on the legislation we need tighter 
legislation to protect whistle blowers.  We need to protect 
them.  We need to reward them and I am hoping in your 
recommendation we need something called reparations that 
like what KPMG is doing with SARS. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 93 of 289 
 
 
We have – I mean I have gone to the Parliamentary 
Inquiry.  I have gone to the FBI.  I have gone to the NPA.  I 
have gone to the Hawks.  I have gone to – I got involved in 
the Eskom matter. All of this of course takes time and it has 
an 
effect 
emotionally, 
psychologically. 
 
Luckily 
I 
was 
employed at MTN for two years but my contract ended in 
March this year so – but I am using this year till just heal, 
write my book and I am just hoping that South Africa will just 
take the heed and say we need – that is the legislation; that 
is the protection and rewards for the people who stood up for 
10 
this country. 
 
That is my [00:16:40]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you very much.  I want to 
check with your counsel whether there is any question for re-
examination that he wants to put or there is nothing? 
COUNSEL FOR WITNESS:  No Chair we happy with the 
evidence and the submissions made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you.  Well I want to 
mention to you that Ms Mothepu that the – there is – there 
are people within the legal team of the commission who are 
20 
looking at the issue of legislation that seeks to protect 
whistle blowers to see whether it is adequate and whether 
there is a need for any amendments – whether there is a 
need for any changes so that in due course submissions will 
be made to me in regard to that because certain things 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 94 of 289 
 
appear to be quite important for this country if we are going 
to deal with corruption in any significant way. 
 
One of those is ensuring that there is adequate 
protection, statutory protection for whistle blowers and that 
there are adequate incentives if possible for people to blow 
the whistle and of course adequate protection is one of the 
incentives. 
 
But there will be an examination of the legislation to 
see and the public is free to send submissions if they want 
to make submissions on that and they can do that just right 
10 
away. 
 
Another 
measure 
is 
to 
see 
whether 
there 
are 
adequate oversight mechanisms for Parliament over the 
executive.   
 
Another relates to the appointment of executives at 
SOE’s as well as members of boards of SOE’s.  How do we 
make sure that the kinds of board members that SOE’s are 
going to have in the future are the kinds of board members 
who are going to make sure that they fight against 
corruption?  How do we make – what criteria should be 
20 
followed in selecting for appointing people to be members of 
boards of SOE’s?  That might go to even DG’s maybe and 
CFO’s in government departments but certain areas need to 
be looked at so that if they are weaknesses in the systems 
that those can be addressed. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 95 of 289 
 
 
So – and the public must feel free anytime to send 
submissions. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Thank you Chairman I will definitely engage 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Your legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOTHEPU:  Much appreciated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much for coming to give 
evidence.  I suspect that we will need you at some stage in 
10 
the future so we will ask you to come back but thank you 
very much you are now excused.  I think counsel for Mr 
Bobat indicated that they would reserve their right to cross-
examine and if they want to cross-examine they will apply for 
leave at some stage.  So that is fine.  You are now excused. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I should take a five minutes 
adjournment.  Excuse those who need to be excused so that 
Mr Chaskalson can – and his team can come in and set up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.                   
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon, Mr Chaskalson.  Good 
afternoon everybody. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Good afternoon, Chair. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 96 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Are we ready? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are Chair.  Our first witness is 
going 
to 
be 
testifying 
on 
Zoom 
from 
Paris. 
 
He 
is 
Mr Mieszala.  And he is online as we speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  We will need to make sure that 
at some stage before the expiry of the last commission, if it 
at all possible, if he is in South Africa and he comes in, just 
make sure that we cover certain aspects regarding the oath.  
If possible.   
 
Because with people who are outside of the country, that 
10 
is how we have arranged it up to now but there is no urgency 
now.  It is something that can be given thought to in due 
course. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, we will be using Bundles 7 
and 8A and B today.  And Mr Mieszala’s statement is at the 
start of Bundle 7.  It is the document commencing at page - 
FOF-7, page 4.   
 
And Mr Mieszala, can I first ask you to confirm the 
20 
correctness of your statement?  Do you have a full set of 
paper with you where you sit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before he does that.  Let us do the oath.  
Even though he is outside of the country’s borders but we 
will take the other precaution in due course.  Just to – just in 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 97 of 289 
 
case there may be challenges.  Okay.   
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry.  Mr Mieszala, can you hear 
us here? 
WITNESS:   Sorry, I did not hear the last question.  It is very 
low.  I do apologise for this. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are trying to swear you in as a 
witness.   
WITNESS:   I do.  I do swear. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  
WITNESS:   I am afraid I cannot see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon, Mr Mieszala.  The 
registrar will now administer the oath or affirmation to you.  
Please listen to him and he will ask you questions and you 
will answer each question in accordance with the sequence 
of the questions.  Okay.  Please proceed. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   Can I – what am I supposed to say?  I am just 
swearing in by you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear us? 
WITNESS:   I did not hear the last question.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay can you hear me well? 
WITNESS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear me well? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 98 of 289 
 
WITNESS:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It does not look like that. 
WITNESS:   Chair, I wonder if I can place myself [break in 
transmission – speaker unclear]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
WITNESS:   [break in transmission – speaker unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
WITNESS:   May I place myself on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I think we will take an adjournment 
just to make sure that he can hear us properly.  If this can be 
10 
improved.  If it can be improved.  And for my registrar to 
explain to him what questions he will put to him and hear 
what the procedure is with the swearing in.  Mr Chaskalson, 
that seems to be necessary to ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, we do need to sort out the 
connection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If that is possible Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And then the issue of the oath 
can – the registrar can explain to him so that when the 
20 
questions are put to him, he knows what questions will be 
put and he is clear about the answers, whether it is 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, I think the problem is – I am 
sure it is just the connection. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 99 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, not...  Okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that I heard him say, at some 
stage:  Am I supposed to say I do or something.  But maybe 
because of the connection.  So let us adjourn for five 
minutes.  If it takes longer, you will just call me so that the 
connection can be sorted out.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.

ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We think so.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We think so Chair.  Chair, before 
we go further.  I forgot to ask if you could let Advocate 
Cockerel SC and Van Zyl SC place themselves on record.  
They are also here remotely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let them do so.  They can do so, 
either from where they are if the microphone is working or

know you are on record and when we get to that, you can 
just place yourself on record again but it is fine. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Yes.  May I be excused from this and 
come back later? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine.  As long as you will be 
able to know when we get to your client...  I do not know

between yourself and the Commission’s legal team, you 
might be able to work out something for you to be there 
when we start.

JEAN-CHRISTOPHE MIESZALA:  [d.s.s.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did I pronounce his surname correctly 
Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am not sure Chair.  I think...  
Mr Mieszala, have I pronounced your surname, broadly, 
correctly there? 
MR MIESZALA:   Ja.  [laughs] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you, Mr Mieszala.  
Okay.  No, that is fine.  Thank you.  You may start

EXAMINATION BY ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, 
Chair.  And we will be in Bundle 7 and 8 today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Mieszala, you have furnished a 
statement to the Commission which appears at page 6 of 
Bundle 7.  Can you confirm that that is your statement? 
MR MIESZALA:   I do confirm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And do you confirm the correctness 
of the contents of that statement? 
20 
MR MIESZALA:   I do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Mieszala, I will be taking 
through certain parts of your statement to begin with just to 
sketch and outline of what your evidence is.  And then I will 
be addressing some specific issues with more focussed 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 103 of 289 
 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do so Mr Chaskalson.  Can 
you confirm that his statement that starts at page, goes up to 
page 33?  Is that correct? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mieszala, is that correct?  Does your 
statement ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, Mr Mieszala’s signature is 
on page 22.  So the statement ends at page 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  I wanted to make sure 
10 
that we... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   21 Chair.  I apologise 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 21.  So that is your signature on page 
21 Mr Mieszala?  Is that correct? 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
alright. 
 
You 
may 
proceed 
Mr Chaskalson.  You want me to admit it as an exhibit? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Please Chair.  Can it be BB6? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Mieszala, at ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Let 
me 
just 
admit 
it 
formally.  
Mr Mieszala’s statement that starts at page 6 and goes up to 
page 21 is admitted as Exhibit BB6. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 104 of 289 
 
STATEMENT AND OF JEAN-CHRISTOPHE MIESZALA IS 
ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB6 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, in fact, there are a long 
range of annexures to that statement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the exhibit should go longer 
than page 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that includes the annexures. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ANNEXURES 
TO 
STATEMENT 
OF 
JEAN-CHRISTOPHE 
FORMS PART OF EXHIBIT BB6 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Mieszala, at paragraphs 1 and 
2 of your statement, you briefly described who you are and 
what role you play within McKinsey and Company.  Can you 
tell the Chair? 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly Mr Chair.  And first, I would like 
to thank the Commission to accept my evidence remotely, 
given the pandemic here in Paris.  But I want to say on 
20 
record that I stand, of course, to accommodate any requests 
you may have for me to come to South Africa.   
 
As I was saying I am a French National and based in 
Paris.  I am senior partner at McKinsey and on the Board of 
McKinsey I play the role of Chief Global Chief Risk Officer 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 105 of 289 
 
which means that I oversee our legal compliance risk, 
security or cyber functions.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Mieszala.  And just 
so that the Chair knows what is within your personal 
knowledge and what is not within your personal knowledge.   
 
Would it be correct to say that the underlining events 
that took place in relation to the McKinsey contracts with 
Eskom and Transnet and SAA are not facts of which you are 
personally aware but that you conducted an investigation 
into some of those facts after the event? 
10 
MR MIESZALA:   That is correct Mr Chair.  I was appointed 
as Global Chief Risk Officer early 2018.  I, myself, have 
never been working in South Africa.   
 
Therefore, I have never been based in South Africa but I 
have always seen our investigations since 2018 and I am 
happy to record and answering questions related to those 
investigations.   
 
And I have also been in charge of drawing the 
implications and the learnings from those events and to 
implement those in the broader context of my firm. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Mieszala.  And 
although it is not in your statement, I do want to draw 
attention to the fact that you were personally responsible for 
one very important letter in this saga which is at Volume 7, 
page 550.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 106 of 289 
 
 
Can I ask you to go to page 550 and just confirm that 
the letter that we see there was a letter that you signed?  It 
is the letter that informed Trillian that they could not be 
McKinsey’s Supply Development partner. 
MR MIESZALA:   It is correct and I do confirm.  At that time, 
I was chairing the Risk Committee session at the firm level, 
actually, that concluded and decided that we were not going 
to work – to partner with Trillian.  And secondly, we did 
inform Trillian but also Eskom, our client.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And for the record Chair.  I think 
10 
that letter is the first recorded letter we have from any 
company, telling Trillian that they will not do business with 
them.  Mr Mieszala, at paragraph 1.3 of your statement, you 
talk about the role that you played in McKinsey’s decision to 
commit 
to 
repay 
fees 
to 
Eskom 
on 
the 
turnaround 
programme.  Can you describe that role to the Chair? 
MR MIESZALA:   Absolutely.  So our firm made the 
commitment publicly in November 2017.  I believe it was one 
of your client’s statement in front of the parliament or in the 
parliament inquiry, that we would take any responsibility for 
20 
repaying for all the fees that we have earned relating to 
situations that would be a matter of concern. 
 
In this context, when we were made aware in 2017 that 
the Eskom, the turnaround programme/contract was filled 
with irregularities, we decided to return those fees.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 107 of 289 
 
 
More precisely, we have been told by Eskom that the 
National Treasury had approved and was cited with – in 
respect of this contract.  When we learnt that was not the 
case, we decided to return the fees.  Then – but there was a 
process with Eskom.   
 
Ultimately, it was resolved in high court.  I believe it was 
in July 2018 and we returned the fees to Eskom related to 
our turnaround programme. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Mieszala, you have 
recently been involved in the decision of McKinsey to repay 
10 
the fees that it earned on projects with Regiments Capital at 
Transnet and SAA.  Can you tell the Chair about that? 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, Mr Chair.  It is true.  As I was saying, 
we do recognise our errors and we believe we do the right 
thing when we are presented with Neve evidence that is 
related to those contract.   
 
The Commission has approached us for our testimony 
and that was over the last month and shared their findings 
and their investigations.  Our teams and the teams of the 
Commission compared notes, our own findings and the 
20 
findings of the Commission.   
 
But those new evidence that were brought to us and 
showed that there were improper actions on the part of 
Regiments, in particular, gave us the confidence that we 
should return the fees related to the contracts at Transnet 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 108 of 289 
 
and South African Airways when McKinsey was working 
alongside Regiments.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Mieszala.  At 
paragraph three point...  Oh, sorry 1.5, 1.6 and 3.4 of your 
statement, you give McKinsey’s general perspective on the 
State Capture Inquiry.  Can you address the Chair on that? 
MR MIESZALA:   Let me go to...  You said three point what? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Starting with 1.5, I think.  It is 1.5 
on page 4. 
MR MIESZALA:   Oh, 1.5.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Page 6. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, certainly.  So our firm is very 
committed actually to work with all the authorities in the 
country and other countries to go to the bottom of those – of 
the things and all the events that took place and which are 
called the State Capture.   
 
We have been following and I have been personally 
following closely the work of the Commission.  We engaged 
with the Commission when it was – since it was established 
in August 2018.   
20 
 
I, myself, went to South Africa several times to oversee 
our 
own 
investigations, 
to 
meet 
with 
clients, 
with 
communities, with my colleagues to also try to get to the 
bottom of these things.  We take it very seriously.   
 
In particular, we want to also thank the work that was 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 109 of 289 
 
done by journalists, that was done by honest people and the 
country to try and bring everything to the light.   
 
And we want McKinsey to be part of this and helping find 
the truth.  And allow everyone to take responsibility on these 
matters.  I hope that I did answer your question. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, you did.  Certainly.  Maybe 
you can also just tell the Chair what you set out in 
paragraphs 1.6 and 3.4. 
MR 
MIESZALA: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
believe 
here 
Mr 
Chair, 
Mr Chaskalson refers to statements that I made here and 
10 
that my firm has made several times and that is that it is – it 
was a source of regret and embarrassment for our firm that 
we have been associated with those events.   
 
It does - be a source of pain, not only for the 150 
colleagues in South Africa but also for all the partners and 
the colleagues worldwide of McKinsey.   
 
It is certainly not a situation that we feel good about it.  
We have expressed our regrets but also our scourges(?) for 
all the process mistakes, the lapses of judgment and the fact 
that our name and our brand has been used in these events. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Mieszala.  Can we 
then talk, just broadly to set out the extent of your 
cooperation with the Commission?  It is an issue that you 
address at paragraphs – or briefly at paragraph 1.4 but 
maybe at paragraph 4.9.7.  And then we can then possible 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 110 of 289 
 
come back to 1.94. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes.  So as we have said before Mr Chair.  
Our firm has initiated a very thorough investigation and we 
have done this ourselves with two applicable law firms, but 
more so with Forster and Norton Rose.  We have also hired a 
forensic firm.   
 
All in total, we had collected monumental documents 
that were close to 65 attorneys or document reviewers the 
whole time to collect and review all the evidence that were in 
our possession.   
10 
 
I am happy to talk more about our findings.  But more 
importantly, we have engaged with the Commission.  We 
have shared with the Commission, as we have with other 
authorities, all our findings.  We had always been ready to 
turn all the pages related to meetings, to documents.   
 
We also recorded any concerns that we had unveiled as 
part of our findings.  The Commission, over the last weeks, 
in forward to share evidence that they have uncovered 
themselves.   
 
I do believe that it was – they were coming from 
20 
Regiments’ servers but sharing with us evidence that were 
not in our possession, related to, on one hand, actions that 
were taking place between Regiments and other Gupta 
related companies.   
 
But also related to emails that were to in our possession 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 111 of 289 
 
in respect to one of our former colleagues.  So we have 
worked with the Commission extensively in comparing all 
these different facts.   
 
But I believe it is also in the possession of the 
Commission – the Commission is in possession of all the 
documents, we have also handed to them in respect to our 
own investigations. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Mieszala.  I can 
confirm that certainly from the side of the Commission, that 
we have no complaints whatsoever about the – the way in 
10 
which McKinsey has interacted with us.   
 
We found McKinsey to be very transparent in its 
interactions with us where we have asked for materials.  We 
have always received them and sometimes where we have 
not asked, we have received them to.   
 
Can I – just to clarify one issues?  The evidence that 
you are referring to does not, in fact, come from...   
 
Well, it originally came from Regiments Service but it 
comes from Trillian’s service which included materials which 
were taken from the Regiments’ server by people who left 
20 
Regiments to Trillian.   
 
So we do not have access to the Regiment Service but 
we do have access to the copy of the Trillian Server.   
 
Can you briefly tell the Commission which other South 
African 
inquiries 
and 
investigations 
McKinsey 
has 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 112 of 289 
 
cooperated with? 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly.  So we have cooperated with the 
Parliamentary Inquiry.  My colleague, Dr Wise – by Dr Weiss 
testified in front of the Commission – of the parliament, 
sorry.  We have also collaborated with the National Treasury 
Inquiry which I believe is called Pamensky(?) Inquiry.   
 
We have also collaborated with Eskom as part of our 
effort with Eskom to return our fees from March to July 2018.  
We have also collaborated with Transnet.   
 
We 
have 
collaborated 
MMS 
Attorneys 
that 
were 
10 
commissioned to review some of the contracts and the work 
at Transnet.   
 
We then also collaborated with Transnet in 2019 in 
reviewing the work that McKinsey has been doing at 
Transnet and the impact of its work.   
 
And 
we 
have 
also, 
of 
course, 
collaborated 
with 
authorities like the NPA when we did record in answering the 
questions 
and 
recording 
about 
the 
findings 
of 
our 
investigations.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Getting back to McKinsey as 
20 
opposed to McKinsey’s investigations.  Can you maybe just 
sketch for the Chair a brief background of McKinsey’s 
presence in South Africa?   
 
And then we can move on, briefly, to describe the – an 
overview of the work that McKinsey did with Transnet, Eskom 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 113 of 289 
 
and SAA.  But starting first with McKinsey’s history in South 
Africa. 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly.  I mean, we are a global firm and 
the partnerships are present in over 66 countries and 100 
locations.  One important location is South Africa.   
 
Our firm is a global firm that on a matter of principle has 
decided not to open an office until 1995.  We had to wait 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
apartheid 
regime 
and 
then 
we 
established an office.   
 
I guess Mr Fine and Mr Weiss can answer more 
10 
questions if you wish so about the history of our office.  He 
was one of the first local South Africans to be hired by 
McKinsey.  Today we have about 150 colleagues.  Sixty 
percent are black South Africans.   
 
Over these 25 years, we have conducted about a 
thousand projects in the country.  We have enforced South 
African companies, including SOE’s.   
 
I believe that there were about 350 engagements for 
South African SOE’s.  So we do have an extensive 
experience working across different sectors.   
20 
 
And if you allow me to say so.  We take great pride of 
the work or the role we have done in and with that country 
over these last 20-years despite the regret, as I have said 
before, of all the events that we have been associated to 
with respect with the State Capture. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 114 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you briefly describe because 
you were not there but just give the Chair an outline of 
where we will go today.  What particular work McKinsey has 
done at Eskom and then at Transnet and then at SAA? 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly Mr Chair.  So we worked at these 
Free State owned enterprises for many years.  We started 
working with those companies either in 2005 or in the case 
of SAA, it was 1999.  We worked across a – we worked in a 
broad range of topics, ranging from organisation, operational 
improvements, strategy, procurement.   
10 
 
These pre-sectors are clearly important for the country 
and for the growth and the prosperity of the country.  Our 
firm, in working with these firms, bring the expertise that we 
gained from working in these similar sectors and similar 
companies in other countries and this is how we have been 
working since 2005 or since 1999 with South African 
Airways, Transnet or Eskom.   
 
And the reason I am pointing this is also to highlight the 
fact that our work at these institutions by no way are linked 
to the Regiments and we have been working with these 
20 
companies before.   
 
Now, I believe that my colleagues, Mr Fine and Mr Sagar 
are scheduled to testify in front of the Commission.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Mieszala.  You said 
Mr Sagar.  I think you meant doctor ...[intervenes]  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 115 of 289 
 
MR MIESZALA:   I am sorry.  I do apologise.  Mr Fine and 
Mr Weiss are scheduled to testify in front of the Commission.  
And then themselves have been working and serving these 
companies.  So I think that they can also speak very locally 
and much more greater detail than myself about the work 
that was done with these companies. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Again this is a matter that we will 
be go into in a bit more detail with – I think it is Dr Fine and 
Dr Weiss.  But can you speak briefly to the Chair just to set 
the 
scene 
about 
McKinsey’s 
approach 
to 
Supply 
10 
Development obligations and the transition from Letsema 
who was the original primary Supply Development partner of 
McKinsey to Regiments.  And then the issues of the start of 
the move from Regiments to Trillian.   
MR MIESZALA:   Yes.  So McKinsey has been working with 
Black Empowerment entities.  We started working, I believe, 
it was with Letsema and we had a long record of working 
with Letsema and that was primarily between the years 2005 
and 2012.   
 
Again, Mr Fine who is scheduled to testify in front of the 
20 
Commission, he himself would be able to provide more 
details if you so wish.  And I also referred you to the 
documents that were annexed to my statement.   
 
McKinsey began working with Regiments in 2012 and 
I believe that relates to a project that was submitted by – we 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 116 of 289 
 
started working with Regiments in August or September in 
making a proposal to Transnet.  The – depends on how all of 
this happened again, Mr Fine can answer these questions 
in greater details when he appears in front of the 
Commission but the logic, the way I do understand was to 
also help and work with other supply [indistinct] 00.00.18  
companies and help them grow. 
In addition to this, our understanding was also that 
it was suggested by Transnet where Regiments was 
working also before independently although our own firm 
10 
and finally they had the relevant expertise to carry the 
work.  But again, Mr Fine should be able to provide more 
details that related to that transition. 
Our 
work 
with 
Regiments 
ended 
up 
in 
February/March 2016.  We did a review back then because 
there were some concerns and we decided to stop any 
partnership, any future work with Regiments and that was 
communicated to the management of Regiments by then. 
With respect of Trillian, there was a –we look into 
whether or not we would be working with Trillian – again 
20 
and let me state this very carefully because I know that 
there has been I misunderstandings or allegations, we 
never had any partnership with Trillian.  The origin of this 
was that we thought that Regiments – my colleagues 
thought that Regiments was not devoting enough resources 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 117 of 289 
 
from their consulting home, there was an attempt to set up 
a new company names Trillian and we were approached on 
whether or not to establish a partnership in the context of 
the BBBEE framework. 
What happened then is that we commissioned, we 
did a diligence, it was part of our policy back then.  I 
personally oversaw parts of those diligences with other 
colleagues and we concluded that there were concerns and 
we 
could 
not 
partner 
with 
Trillian 
and 
that 
was 
communicated to Trillian, that was communicated to Eskom 
10 
as well and therefore we never worked and never partnered 
with Trillian.  Trillian, my understanding is, that they 
worked – the firm worked for Eskom on -  separately of 
McKinsey but McKinsey never worked with Trillian, Trillian 
was never an SDP of McKinsey. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you elaborate on the due 
diligence that persuaded you not to agree to contract with 
Trillian?  What were the issues? 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly.  So the main – one of the main 
issue was related to the lack of transparency with respect 
20 
to what the company was, who were the owners, how the 
company was set up and we on multiple times were asking 
questions related to these issues and we never got 
answers or 
we were getting 
answers that were not 
satisfactory, so after several weeks, not getting the proper 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 118 of 289 
 
answers and while our diligence was continuing with 
respect to other matters, we just took the decision actually 
that it was going nowhere, we were not in confidence and 
therefore we decided to stop any attempt to partner with 
Trillian. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   As I understand it there were 
two broad issues, one was the lack of transparency about 
ownership but there was also a second issue about 
conflicts.  Do you recall that issue and can you address the 
Chair on it? 
10 
MR MIESZALA:   With respect to Trillian or with respect to 
Regiments? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no, with respect to Trillian. 
MR MIESZALA:   I believe that Mr Weiss(?) can better 
address this question in his testimony later on. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We will ask Dr Weiss.  Can I – 
very briefly to come back to the investigation that you have 
conducted into the events at Transnet and Eskom, can you 
broadly – well, first of all, have you found any evidence of 
corrupt payments made by McKinsey to Transnet or Eskom 
20 
officials? 
MR MIESZALA:   Mr Chair, the answer is simply no, we did 
not find any such evidence. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Have you found evidence that 
nevertheless concerns you even if it falls short of corrupt 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 119 of 289 
 
payments 
made 
by 
McKinsey 
to 
Transnet 
or 
Eskom 
officials? 
MR MIESZALA:   Forgive me, I did not hear well you 
question, would you mind repeating? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Have you evidence that falls 
short of corrupt payments but nevertheless gives you 
cause for concern? 
MR MIESZALA:   So when we were doing our own 
investigations – and I will leave aside the evidence that 
was brought forward to us by the Commission itself, as I 
10 
said we reviewed 9 million – we collected 9 million 
documents, 
we 
conducted 
interviews 
with 
about 
160 
people.  We did not find any evidence that there was any 
attempt on the side of McKinsey to instigate any form of 
corruption, we did not find any evidence of money and 
payments that would be a source of concern and they were 
not related well-established contracts and we did not find 
any, I would say, improper attempts to influence or benefit 
from I would say connections that we should not -   had 
been used. 
20 
 
We did find in our investigations several facts that 
were a source of concerns and which we have reported 
with respect to professional behaviours and with respect to 
our own internal processes.  I am happy to elaborate with 
respect to these findings but let me again repeat, these 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 120 of 289 
 
were related to professional standards or conduct or 
violations of our own internal policies. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you maybe tell the Chair 
about the issues that you address at paragraph 7.2.1 and 
7.2.2 of your statement. 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly, Mr Chair.  So these are some 
of the – these are the concerns that we did – we they did 
find, as I was saying, these are true violations of our code 
of conduct or our professional standards.  They relate to 
our former senior partner, Mr Vikas Sagar, I believe that is 
10 
why I misused his name previously and these issues were 
first an assistance to Mr Gama at Transnet for his MBA, so 
helping him on his MBA.  That was late 2015 and early 
2016. 
 
Now when we found this in 2017, as part of our 
investigation, we decided to make a Section 34 report in 
terms 
of 
the 
Prevention 
and 
Combating 
of 
Corrupt 
Activities Act.  That is a clear violation of our internal 
policy. 
 
The second source of concern was the I guess now 
20 
famous February 9, 2016 letter.  It is a letter that was sent 
by Mr Sagar to Eskom on February 9, 2016.  This letter 
was – which was related to another project at Eskom than 
the MSA or turnaround project was related I believe  to the 
corporate plan was poorly written, had factual errors 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 121 of 289 
 
including the fact that, you know, that it inaccurately 
referred to Trillian as a subcontractor of McKinsey, which it 
was not and, by the way, Trillian was not involved on the 
corporate plan. 
 
So 
this 
letter 
was 
– 
had 
mistakes 
and 
was 
confusing.  This is one of the multiple – this is one of the 
reasons why our firm also did apologise in July 2018. So 
that is a second area of concern. 
 
There was a third area of concern which is when we 
were doing our investigations in the [indistinct] 11.21 of 
10 
2017, we found also evidence that Mr Sagar had used a 
software tool named CC Cleaner to wipe his computer.  
Now we could not recover the parts that were deleted by 
that tool.  That was a source of concern as well in itself 
and we also decided to report that act to authorities. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you tell the Chair about Mr 
Sagar ’s departure from McKinsey?  When did he leave 
McKinsey in what circumstances? 
MR MIESZALA:   Mr Sagar – do you allow me to drink a 
little bit of water? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, Chairperson, so Mr Sagar, departed 
McKinsey in October 2017.  Given the facts, the evidence 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 122 of 289 
 
that I was just sharing related to his conduct, February 
2016 letter, the MBA assistance, our firm decided to launch 
a disciplinary process against Mr Sagar.  I have to report 
also that I was part of this process and of the [indistinct] 
13.14 that overseas this disciplinary process in our firm 
and we have decided to terminate Mr Sagar. 
 
Mr Sagar appealed that decision, that is part of our 
own internal processes and while he was appealing, he 
decided nevertheless to leave our firm.  That was October 
2017. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now thus far we have been 
talking only of evidence that your evidence revealed.  Just 
over six weeks ago the Commission exchanged or showed 
some of the evidence in relation to Mr Sagar that it had 
uncovered and you address that at paragraph 7.2.4.2 of 
your statement at page 17.  Can you tell the Chair what 
was of significance in relation to the – well, the two emails 
of 16 and 18 November that the Commission shared with 
you. 
MR MIESZALA:    Certainly, so Mr Chair, these two emails 
20 
are the following, one is an email dated November 16, 
2015, this email from Clive Angel is written to Mr Sagar 
and Mr Wood copying Mr Salim Essa and the emails 
suggests that, at least in our eyes, that Mr Sagar would 
have been aware that Mr Essa was involved at Trillian. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 123 of 289 
 
 
That email, even though it was to a McKinsey 
address, was not on our system, so it was not part of the 
documents and emails that have been collected.  I can only 
speculate that the email must have been deleted at some 
point and before it was copied onto our systems, but the 
fact that Mr Sagar was aware that Mr Essa was involved at 
Trillian is, of course, a contradiction, I mean, is not 
appropriate and was in contradiction to anything that he 
had reported to us. 
 
There is a second email which is dated November 
10 
15, 2015 …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Mieszala, can we just 
pause at that point?  Can I ask you to go to volume 8, 8A, 
page 393, just to identify that email to which you have just 
been referring?  393, volume 8. 
MR MIESZALA:   393, let me see. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But it is not the volume that your 
statement is in, it is the next volume. 
MR MIESZALA:   I have to find it, sorry.  I do not think I 
have the volume 8 in front of me. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, you do or you do not have 
volume 8? 
MR MIESZALA:   I do not find the volume 8 in front of me. 
Is this my bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The reference bundle, yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 124 of 289 
 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, let me see. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It may be described as VV9.  I 
am hoping it has the same pagination.  Page 393. 
MR MIESZALA:   My volume goes until page 182. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not that one. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
Well, 
maybe 
you 
can 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, do you want him to look at the 
spine of the file, if he is using a file.  I do not know if he is 
using a file like me. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I have a concern that the 
reference bundle may not have been sent through to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because my one says Flow Funds 
bundle 08A and is exhibit – ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Which has got at page 393 an email from 
Clive Angel to Mr Sagar. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Mieszala, maybe we can cut 
through the – we are actually going to run into a problem 
at a later stage because I will need to refer to a series of 
20 
documents in this bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you need time to…? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, maybe if we could take a 
five minute adjournment.  On a worst case scenario we can 
arrange for a file therefore so that Mr Mieszala has them 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 125 of 289 
 
electronically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, we will take a short 
adjournment to enable Mr Chaskalson to attend to this.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair, sorry about 
that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Mieszala do you now have 
10 
that document, the email that we are talking about, 16 
November 2016 at ...[intervenes]  
MR MIESZALA:   I do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...Bundle 8A 393.   So that’s the 
document that you – can you just confirm that that’s the 
email to which your – you were referring the Chair when 
you spoke about that email a short while ago in the context 
of indicating that Mr Sagar was aware that Mr Essa stood 
behind Trillian? 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes Chairperson this is the email I was 
20 
referring to, so it is F0839, it is a memo dated November 
16 2015 written by our – sent by Clive Angel to Vika Sagar 
and Eric Wood, copying Salim Essa.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if you can go while 
you’re in that file to FO8, page 395, is that a second email 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 126 of 289 
 
that was furnished to you by the Commission that gave you 
cause for concern. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, so this second email is an email 
between Mr Angel Clive and Eric Wood and in this email Mr 
Sagar appear under his personal email, so it is not a 
McKinsey email.   Now the fact that he was using a 
personal address with respect to clients or professional 
matters is something that is prohibited under our policies, 
but more importantly I see this that his intent was to move 
his communication to a personal email as a way of hiding 
10 
this to anybody within our firm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And is there anything else about 
these two emails that the Commission made available to 
you that gave you cause for concern in relation to Mr 
Sagar? 
MR MIESZALA:  Yes well of course one could argue that 
the new documents, ...[indistinct] documents related to 
discussions that would not have been out of the ordinary at 
that time in terms of arrangements between ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Mieszala.  
20 
MR MIESZALA:   Can you hear me. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Mr 
Chaskalson 
I 
wonder 
whether 
particularly the one at page 393 there are certain features 
that you wanted to read first before commenting on them. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair we will come back to these 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 127 of 289 
 
emails later, at this stage I just want to lead Mr Mieszala 
on his own statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that’s fine.  Mr Mieszala I 
interrupted you, please proceed.   I interrupted you please 
proceed. 
MR MIESZALA:    Yes Mr Chair, I was saying that one 
could 
argue 
that 
the 
new 
documents 
as 
with 
other 
documents relate – could relate to discussions that would 
have not – that would not have been out of the ordinary at 
the times in terms of business arrangement between 
10 
companies serving the same client.   However, however my 
role is not to defend Mr Sagar and I have absolutely no 
desire to do so.  
 
In all our views actually it is a matter – it is a 
source of concern.  This is adding to the sources of 
concerns we already have with respect to Mr Sagar and Mr 
Sagar ’s behaviour, in particular to us it is clear that Mr 
Sagar has not been truthful when engaging with our 
internal counsel, our external counsel and his colleagues 
and we see these emails as another proof that he was 
20 
hiding, that he was aware of Mr Essa’s connection to 
Trillian, which he never reported to us, and secondly the 
use of personal emails as a way of apparently trying to 
hide things from us which of course is a matter of concern, 
it is difficult to trust anybody who is behaving in this 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 128 of 289 
 
context.    
Now it is not for me to infer more out of this, it is 
not my role but clearly it is validating the decision that we 
took to terminate Mr Sagar on the ground of professional 
conduct and professional standards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson maybe you will deal with 
this at some stage, I will be interested to knowing why Mr 
Sagar would want to us – or I would be interested in 
knowing whether in whatever he was doing it involved now 
it seems using his personal email address whether he was 
10 
going to benefit personally from some of those activities, 
because I am wondering whether if he was no to benefit 
anything personal  but the company was going to benefit, 
why he would decide to use ...[indistinct – loud buzzing on 
audio] 
that 
might 
be 
something 
that 
you 
intend 
to 
...[indistinct]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes Chair what I can say is that 
we – we don’t have access to any bank records of Mr 
Sagar so we cannot ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
you 
don’t 
know 
whether 
he 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We don’t know whether he did or 
didn’t benefit personally but maybe I can put some 
questions to Mr Mieszala.  I do want to come back to these 
emails 
a 
little 
later, 
and 
maybe 
it 
would 
be 
the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 129 of 289 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   At the moment I just want to 
lead Mr Mieszala on his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I am fine with that, as long as it 
is not staged. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We will certainly raise those 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If not with Mr Mieszala with some other 
witness if possible, okay. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC: Mr Mieszala you set out in your 
statement why McKinsey has decided to repayment the 
fees both, one  McKinsey originally decided to repay the 
fees to Eskom and has now decided to repay the fees to 
SAA and to Transnet.  Can I ask you to take the Chair 
through that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are moving away from this bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We are moving away from 8A for 
a while Chair and back to 7.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am thinking of paragraphs 8.1 
and 2 in – at page 18 of Bundle 7, and then the specific 
statements that you make in relation to Transnet and 
Eskom at – both at paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 and 8.3 – sorry 
Transnet and SAA, 2.4 and 2.5 and 8.3 and 8.4.  Can you 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 130 of 289 
 
take the Chair slowly through that and McKinsey’s rationale 
for repaying the fees? 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly so you said 2. ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think maybe to start 8.1, 8.2, 
8.3, 8.4 and if there’s anything else that remains – that you 
would want add from 2.4 and 2.5 feel free to do so. 
MR MIESZALA:   Ja, certainly so Mr Chair we made the 
decision to repay the entirety of the fees for our work at 
Transnet and South African Airways, work related that was 
done with or alongside Regiments.  This decision is based 
10 
out of the evidence that was brought forward to us by the 
Commission.  The reason we do this is a matter of 
principle, so it is not because we feel that it is a legal 
obligation or whatsoever but it is a matter of principle that 
we have said in November 2017 we do view the situation of 
State Capture as a source of concern, a very serious 
matter.  Our firm does not want to benefit from anything 
that was related to State Capture.   
 
So that is the rationale for us to decide to return 
those fees obviously we have to work out the proper legal 
20 
framework to do that correctly and ...[indistinct] but it is a 
commitment that I want to reaffirm here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And you talk also with reference 
to the public statement that the then head of McKinsey, Mr 
Kevin Sneader made in 2018 about the acknowledgement 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 131 of 289 
 
of mistakes that McKinsey made in this period around 
2014, 2015, 2016. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am looking at 7.3 of your 
affidavit at page 18 and – that Mr Sneader ’s statement is 
something more detailed at pages 40 to 44.  Can you talk 
to the Chair about what mistakes McKinsey has actually 
identified as having given rise to the problems or given 
rise to the situation where it has now decided to repay 
fees?  
10 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly although we did – have 
identified several mistakes and there are also lessons that 
have been learnt, and the reason I speak about lessons 
learnt is independently of mistakes there are also that in 
retrospect now you learn that it is worth doing things 
differently, even if they don’t relate to specific mistakes.   
However ...[indistinct] specific Mr Chair when we talked 
about our mistakes it is for instance the February 2016 
letter it is not a correct letter, it led to confusion, it had in-
corrections and we have ...[indistinct] and we apologise for 
20 
this.  The fact also that we worked at Eskom and we 
worked along Trillian again without Trillian being our 
partner but nevertheless along Trillian before we had 
concluded our investigations.  We stopped any and we 
communicated about our investigation when we made the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 132 of 289 
 
decision but in retrospect we should not have worked on 
this contract before that investigation was concluded in 
February 2016. 
 
As we have done before I want to apologise again 
for the fact that we were slow in responding to Advocate 
Budlender for instance, maybe we ...[indistinct] reason but 
nevertheless 
it 
is 
something 
that 
should 
not 
have 
happened. 
 
Now these are some of the mistakes and crosses 
gaps that I was mentioning.  I want to also highlight some 
10 
of the lessons that we have learnt and that are very 
important and some of these lessons are not specific to 
South Africa, what I mean here is that we learnt them and 
decided then to implement them across our entire firm.  I 
can highlight for instance ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Mr Mieszala I would like 
you to spend quite some time on this and possibly follow 
your – the structure of your statement and amplify what 
you say in this statement where you feel this is appropriate 
because those sorts of corporate governance are issues 
20 
with which the Commission is very concerned. 
 
Can I ask you maybe to go to paragraph 9.2 at page 
20 and deal first with the changes that you have made to 
the way you do business in South Africa and then to move 
to 
the 
changes 
that 
you 
have 
made 
worldwide, 
in 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 133 of 289 
 
paragraph 9.2.2, so start at 9.2.1 and then 9.2.2. 
MR MIESZALA:   Certainly, so Mr Chair Mr Chaskalson 
refers to the changes we made in South Africa first and so 
what we did was to strengthen our legal compliance 
finance and risk teams locally.  The second thing is that we 
have established a regional risk committee, ...[indistinct] 
or a global committee what we decided to was actually also 
to establish a regional one to make sure that our local 
office was also properly equipped in terms of governance 
for discussing and reviewing risk and compliance related 
10 
matters. 
 
We 
have 
contracted 
several 
anti-corruption 
trainings with respect to our South African office.  We have 
also taken a different look at our supply development 
partners for the future and the lessons learnt clearly is that 
we should have or we – I just wish in retrospect that we 
would have known what we are dealing with and so moving 
forward we are going to be – to apply a much higher level 
of strictness in partnering with such firms. 
 
This is in the broader context of us also beefing up 
20 
our diligence requirements and capabilities with respect to 
third parties and partnering with their ...[indistinct] so we 
have established a central team now and we are keeping, 
adding more resources, we are talking about fifteen to 
twenty people ultimately by the global level to conduct 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 134 of 289 
 
diligence on any third party before we contract with them 
and those diligences we hope are exhausted now, we are 
viewing not only just media statements but also looking at 
individuals, ownerships, and any other label information 
that is – that we might have on these companies.   
 
This is now a requirement, it is of course very 
applicable in the context of South Africa but it is also 
something that we have generalised more globally.   
 
Do you wish me to talk also about the measures we 
are taking, we have taken at a global level? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Please do yes, and I presume 
these measures would apply equally to South Africa, they 
are just not special South African measures? 
MR MIESZALA:   Absolutely those – the measures I was 
just mentioning are specifically South Africa.   Now more 
globally we undertook major initiatives and efforts over the 
last two to three years, I was mentioning diligence 
requirement and capabilities with respect to third parties 
but that also applies to our clients so we made compulsory 
now to conduct diligence with any new client and then 
20 
regularly with existing clients, again we had established 
this global central capabilities to conduct such diligences, 
so they are done in an independent manner, those teams 
had access also to external sources, external companies 
that can also supplement them in terms of diligences.  We 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 135 of 289 
 
do these diligences on the institutions, we do them as well 
on the individuals executives or board members or owners 
of those companies. 
 
We have also established a framework policy for 
our client selection, that establishes the lines in – before 
deciding which client to serve on which topic, there are 
lines where we are clearly saying these is not work that 
McKinsey will ever do, it is just forbidden and there are 
lines where we say for that type of work or that type of 
institutions in those ...[indistinct] it does require an 
10 
approval by a separate risk committee that will thoroughly 
review the contracts, the conditions, to make sure that our 
work is both ...[indistinct] but also has all the conditions 
for impact. 
 
I could if there are no further questions elaborate 
on this but that was quite an extensive effort that I oversaw 
myself over these last years.   There are also specific rules 
that we have strengthened with respect to our work with 
the public sector and SOE’s.  For instance, and without 
being exhaustive we have now decided again based on our 
20 
South African experience to put caps on our fees, there is 
also a requirement for a very clear statement of work at the 
outset before we start any work and there is a requirement 
also to jointly discuss and agree on the impact of the work 
at the end of the engagement so that there is no dispute 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 136 of 289 
 
with respect to our work. 
 
We had also established a global hotline, if I may 
say, so anybody ...[intervenes]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry I do, I would want you to 
talk about the global hotline but one of the specific 
initiatives that you refer to in your statement relates to 
sole source public sector work.  Can you tell the Chair 
what the McKinsey policy is in respect of sole-source 
public work. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes Mr Chair so we were confronted with 
10 
situations where the public sector or SOE’s where sole-
sourcing work and I hope that most of the time that was, 
there 
were 
good 
reasons 
and 
it 
was 
appropriate.   
Nevertheless it became clear to us that we could not just 
rely on our partners to decide whether or not that was 
appropriate or not and so any situation that is a sole-
sourcing situation actually requires now a review by our 
legal department and our legal department is looking 
whether or not it is appropriate and if all the conditions are 
in place given the local regulatory framework for that sole-
20 
sourcing, so we are much more thorough we hope in 
probing whether or not that sole-sourcing is appropriate 
before we undertake any work. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Mieszala, you 
were talking about a global hotline?  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 137 of 289 
 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, so we established a global hotline 
and we do encourage anybody who has concerns or 
anything to report to contact that global hotline.  The 
global hotline guarantees of course anonymy, I guess you 
say anonymy in English, I do apologise for my poor English 
but people are kept anonymous and they are protected if 
that is needed, and we do incentivise our people to report 
any concerns.   The reason we did this is also because it is 
pretty clear to us that people may watch or see things and 
we want to encourage a culture where they feel safe to 
10 
report on concerns. 
 
Now most of the time those concerns may not be 
relevant or may not be what the people think but it is an 
inference to help us detect anything that would be wrong 
otherwise. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And any other ...[intervenes]  
MR MIESZALA:   Excuse me? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, I interrupted. 
MR MIESZALA:   Ja, I was going to give other examples of 
measures that we undertook over the last two to three 
20 
years.   Obviously training and awareness is an important 
component in enhancing corporate responsibility so we 
have actually doubled-down on our training programmes, 
the different matters related to our policies but also just 
legal or regulatory matters such as anti-corruption for 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 138 of 289 
 
instance. 
 
Speaking of anti-corruption so we did have a policy 
that was now in place in 2016 but we strengthened this 
policy, 
we 
established 
again 
a 
global 
and 
central 
capabilities for instance to review if an employee of 
McKinsey wants to for instance either give a gift or invite a 
client or actions like this, which could be perfectly 
legitimate but there is now a central capability to review, 
advise, and vet if necessary those kind of actions.    
 
And of course we have also strengthened our 
10 
consequence management, our vision is to hold our 
colleagues to the highest possible standards, professional 
standards.  We praise ourselves for the values and for the 
purpose of our firm and we have to hold our colleagues 
responsible 
vis-a-vis 
these 
values 
and 
professional 
standards.    
 
So this is just a bald review if you want of several 
of the actions that we have undertaken over the last two to 
three years, some of which have been nurtured and 
informed by our experience in South Africa. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Mieszala is there 
anything else that you would like to add to what we have 
canvassed already before I go to very specific issues? 
MR MIESZALA:   To add with respect to what sorry? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Anything in your statement that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 139 of 289 
 
you would want to add or amplify before I take you to very 
specific issues to address with you. 
MR MIESZALA:   I wish to only just add one thing if I may 
so, which is accountability is not the easiest thing but it is 
the right thing to do so I hope that, I would like to thank 
the Commission for the opportunity to bring forward our 
incidents but also to thank the Commission for having 
shared with us the evidence that they had and I hope that 
our commitment to return the fees in question related to 
our work at Transnet and South African Airways is seen as 
10 
a commitment to be a good corporate citizen and to be 
held accountable and it is not anything else than that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Mieszala.   I want 
to focus on a range of very specific issues now but before I 
do so I just do need to put on record that although my 
questions that follow may sound critical from time to time I 
do believe that of all of the companies that we have 
encountered who have in some ways been involved in 
contracts that were tainted by State Capture McKinsey has 
done far better than most, possibly far better than all, and 
20 
I should place on record two things, the first is that to the 
best of my knowledge McKinsey terminated relationships 
with Regiments and Trillian on probity grounds before 
anybody else had, so nobody else had seen fit to terminate 
relationships or to tell or in the case of Trillian to say we 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 140 of 289 
 
are not going to go into a relationship on the probity 
grounds by the time that McKinsey did and I think the 
second point which is a very, very important point is 
McKinsey has repaid far more than anybody else in relation 
to these contracts. 
 
Having said that I do need to ask some questions 
that are a bit more difficult to answer so let me get to 
them.  The first is that if I understand your statement and 
also the speech of Mr Sneader that broadly three areas 
where McKinsey identified errors in the – out of the 
10 
experience in South Africa in 2014, 2015, 2016. 
 
The first relates to issues of governance, the 
second relates to issues of charging fees that are too high 
and the third that Mr Sneader emphasises is a failure to 
say sorry quickly enough and clearly enough.    
 
Now I think that McKinsey has certainly been saying 
sorry for quite a long time, I don’t want to address that 
one, and it does seem to me that the changes that you 
have introduced in relation to the issue of the fee that was 
too high on a risk based fee at Eskom which is what Mr 
20 
Sneader specifically identified would be covered by your 
new policy of capping risk based fees.  Can you talk a little 
bit about this policy of capping risk based fees? 
MR MIESZALA:   Definitely so risk based is maybe it is 
worth explaining a little before what it is and what was the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 141 of 289 
 
intent and then I move to answering more specifically to 
the question of the cap.  Risk based the intent is to 
basically say that the consultant or consulting firm is 
aligning its own interest with the interest of the client, 
meaning that if there is the impact or the work was 
delivered then there is a payment, if that is not the case 
there is no payment and it is aligning the interest in terms 
of intent to also make sure that the consultants are striving 
to do their best to maximise that impact in the interest of 
their client.   
10 
 
Now obviously if you say so it may sound like good 
intent but it also raises questions which is why we decided 
to kind of step back and have a different look at those 
situations.    
 
The first one is you have to make sure that your 
client understand exactly what it is, what it leads to, what 
are the implications.   
 
The second one is you have to be thoughtful about 
whether those arrangements do make sense, and those 
arrangements for instance could make sense if there is a 
20 
genuine doubt whether or not something can be delivered 
because for instance does the consulting firm have the 
proper skills to achieve what is intended to be achieved for 
instance, but you need to be thoughtful about where those 
types of arrangements also do make sense and the third 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 142 of 289 
 
thing as it was implied by our statement in 2018 is that it is 
wrong to appear as being greedy and trying to benefit from 
a situation, in particular if your client for instance is 
struggling in acquiring help, that is morally wrong. 
 
So the reason we do that via those caps is a little 
bit of a combination if you want of this different analysis 
again which is to learn from experience, step back from 
these situations and despite the good intent understand 
the limitations or the pitfalls you could end up with such 
arrangements and this is why we decided to put some 
10 
guardrails around the use of such arrangements. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Mieszala.   So we 
talked about too high fees, we talked about apologising, 
you have given us quite a lot of detail in relation to 
governance.  I want to put to you that there may be a 
separate issue where there was a problem and I would be 
interested just in response to this, because it is – when I 
look back on the events of 2014 to 2016 that affected – 
well in which McKinsey was involved in South Africa, my 
reading of a part of what was going on is that there may 
20 
have been too much of a premium on bringing in business 
and bringing in fees and an inadequate balancing of that 
against the imperative not to compromise on principles, 
and I see this less as an issue of governance as an issue 
of culture and I think the examples are examples to canvas 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 143 of 289 
 
with Mr Fine and Dr Weiss but maybe if I can illustrate 
what I am suggesting to you with reference to an example 
that you actually referenced yourself. 
MR MIESZALA:   Please do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if you go to page 18 of your 
report at – sorry 18 of your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   His statement yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Your statement, bundle 7, page 
7.2.5, paragraph 7.2.5, that is the paragraph at the top of 
the page that doesn’t have a number because it starts on 
10 
the previous page, there you mentioned that when you 
conducted 
your 
investigation 
in 
February/March 
2016 
individuals raised concerns about potential procurement 
irregularities related to the award of ...[indistinct] contracts 
at Transnet and when we look back one of the things that 
is very striking to us is that just at the point at which 
Regiments 
gets 
involved 
as 
McKinsey’s 
supply 
development 
partner 
there 
is 
then 
an 
extraordinary 
succession 
of 
sole-source 
contracts 
awarded 
to 
the 
Regiments / McKinsey Consortium, but at the same time as 
20 
this 
is 
happening 
fees 
at 
Transnet 
are 
growing 
exponentially for McKinsey and if you go there to Bundle 8, 
page 475 you can see the illustration, so if you go to 475. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the first of the sole-source 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 144 of 289 
 
contracts to McKinsey comes in 2013, McKinsey and 
Regiments, they then continue through 2014 and 2015 and 
if one looks at that paper the fees paid by Transnet from 
2012 onwards and I might add that 2012 was a better year 
for McKinsey at Transnet than 2011 or 2010.  The fees 
from 2012 to 2013 when the sole-source contract, when the 
first 
sole-source 
contract 
is 
concluded 
go 
up 
very 
significantly, probably about 70%.  They then more than 
double from 2013 to 2014 and 2014 is when the sole-
source contracts come thick and fast and by 2015 they 
10 
have increased again, and what I want to put to you is that 
for a person concerned within McKinsey about – and I am 
just using the example of sole-source, you have now got 
...[intervenes]  
MR MIESZALA:    I am sorry, but you are breaking up.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh sorry.   What I want to put to 
you is that for someone to raise questions about sole-
source contracts at Transnet, not when there was an 
investigation in 2016 but at the time that those contracts 
were being handed out it requires a particular culture that 
20 
would facilitate that because what you are doing in the 
process is you are threatening a very ...[intervenes]  
MR MIESZALA:   Sir [audio breaking up] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a problem with the technology? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Mr Mieszala can you hear 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 145 of 289 
 
me at this stage? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like he – are you back Mr 
Mieszala. 
MR MIESZALA:   I am sorry to interrupt.    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Mr Mieszala I am not sure 
if you can hear us I am not sure if anybody else can hear 
us because the problem may be on our side not on Mr 
Mieszala side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear us?   Mr Mieszala?  It 
looks like ...[intervenes]   Is it his counsel speaking? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That’s Alfred yes. 
COUNSEL:   Yes Chair I am sorry to interrupt my learned 
friend but the witness has been saying for a few minutes 
that we have lost sound unfortunately, the witness can’t 
hear my learned friend’s question and I can’t hear it either, 
it keeps breaking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so?   Okay, should we 
...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:  And the problem started about two minutes 
ago Chair, I certainly ...[indistinct] that I lost the sound 
20 
then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Should we adjourn a bit or

ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think we – I don’t think we can 
continue without trying to repair the connection, I don’t 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 146 of 289 
 
know if we can it will be good but ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   There seems to be an indication that it 
is going to be sorted out quickly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I don’t know how quickly, whether 
that’s five minutes or two minutes it looks like five minutes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Let’s take five Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A five minute adjournment so that the 
problem can be addressed.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see Ms – Mr Mieszala is not there yet on 
the screen? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No he is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not on mine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think your – your screen must 
have been disconnected in the process Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If somebody is able to connect – 
reconnect it without us adjourning that would help.  Okay the 
picture is back.  Can you hear me Mr Mieszala? 
20 
MR MIESZALA:  I do hear you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Mr Mieszala.  I will go 
back to the start of that question and what I was suggesting 
is that aside from governance issues where McKinsey’s 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 147 of 289 
 
clearly placed a great deal of effort and has introduced a 
range of new measures which would prevent a lot of the – or 
the potentially – the potential problems that may have arisen 
in 2014 to 2016. 
 
 
I want to put to you that there is a culture issue and 
how I framed the culture issue is that at the time when I 
looked from the outside it appears to me that at the time 
there was too much of a premium on bringing in business 
and an inadequate balancing of that imperative against the 
need not to compromise on principles.  And that the waiting 
10 
between bringing in business, bringing in fees and staying 
true to your principles was not – was not correctly struck. 
And I want to give you this example and would be interested 
in your response to it. 
 
If you go to page 18 and it was 7.2.5 the unnumbered 
paragraph at the top of page 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that of his statement? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Of your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is Bundle 7. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 7 Chair.  So what page is 
20 
that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Page 18 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You mention that when you 
conducted the investigation in February/March 2016 you 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 148 of 289 
 
refer to the fact that Dr Fine came forward and advocated for 
the firm to stop working with Regiments and Trillian due to 
the results of the due diligence.  Then you say other 
individuals raised concerns about potential procurement 
irregularities related to the award of sole sourced contracts 
at Transport – at Transnet.  So in 2016 there were people 
who for the – I would imagine for the first time were raising 
concerns about sole sourced procurement at Transnet and 
those sole sourced contracts actually took place 2013/14/15 
those were the sole source awards.  And if we go to look at 
10 
the fees on – in Bundle 8 at page 475 we see how 
dramatically the fees increased over the period where a 
stream of sole sourced contracts was coming in from 
Transnet.   
 
So if we start at 2012 before there were any sole 
source contracts and I mention the 2012 was better than 
2011 and 2010 at Transnet although you do not see it on that 
page. 
 
2013 when the first sole source contract starts 
coming is about 70% better than 2012. 
20 
 
2014 where there is a string of sole source contracts 
I think certainly four maybe five is even double what the 
good year of 2013 was. 
 
And as those sole source contracts carry on and are 
supplemented by another sole source contract in 2015 there 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 149 of 289 
 
is a very substantial improvement on 2015 in terms of fees 
coming in. 
 
And what I – what that says to me is that there were 
people who were concerned about this process but were not 
able 
to 
express 
their 
concerns 
vocally 
until 
your 
investigation came in in 2016 and started asking – started 
essentially inviting people to – to express concerns. 
 
And that I would submit is an issue of corporate 
culture and rather than an issue of governance.  There may 
be governance issues that you can put in place that will 
10 
mitigate that but there is also a culture issue about the 
difficulty of speaking up at the cost of fees. 
 
Can I give you another example and then maybe you 
can comment? 
 
Mr Sneader says in his statement that one of the 
things that McKinsey did wrong was to start work at Eskom 
while the – alongside Trillian while the due diligence had not 
been completed. 
 
When the due diligence was completed they made it 
very clear to Eskom that they will – to Trillian that they would 
20 
not contract with them and to Eskom that Trillian could not 
be a supply development partner.   
 
But Mr Sneader makes clear that it was wrong even 
to start that the work should not have started until there was 
clarity – until the due diligence process had been completed. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 150 of 289 
 
 
If one goes back to that table at page 475 once sees 
maybe why that mistake took place.  If one looks at the fees 
that – that were generated by that Eskom contract they dwarf 
anything that McKinsey had earned at Transnet or Eskom. 
 
If one looks at 2016 one sees R806 million.  And it 
takes a very courageous person in those circumstances to 
say no we are not going to start work we may even have to 
forego this contract entirely but we have to finish our due 
diligence first. 
 
And 
unless 
the 
culture 
of 
the 
organisation 
is 
10 
designed to foster that sort of a stand these sorts of 
problems cannot necessarily always been addressed at the 
level of governance.  Is my submission to you and I would be 
really interested in your responses. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes Mr Chair if in advance you forgive me 
for giving a probably too long answer but I will since you 
[00:08:17] a couple of questions within the question I will try 
to address each of them. 
 
I would like also to say that with respect to Transnet 
and the work that was done at Transnet and the conditions 
20 
for that work at Transnet I would like to also have the 
commission have this dialogue with Mr Fine who I think will 
be a – also able to provide more details with respect to the 
conditions and that – in that work. 
 
 
Before I go to the issue of the culture in raising 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 151 of 289 
 
concerns if I may just set in terms and put things in terms of 
context. 
 
For many if not most of our clients actually there are 
bursts of activities.  We do not work with annuities where our 
fees tend to be constant every year and there are bursts of 
activities.  Now there is bursts of activities are driven by or it 
can be driven by unique conditions that our clients do face. 
 
There could be crisis, there could be an acquisition, 
there could be just a fact that every five years a company 
decided to step back and to conduct a strategic review. 
10 
 
So whether or not fees sort of go up and down 
throughout 
the 
years 
in 
itself 
there 
could 
be 
many 
illegitimate – legitimate reasons. 
 
The underlying question the way I see it is a question 
of are we looking for impact and the conditions for impact?  
Are we bringing value independently from the fees and the 
fees themselves. And I think this is a fair question.  It is 
definitely our aspiration to be impact partners and to bring 
impact and to bring value not just people who come for the 
fees and to – and to spend in the case of Transnet over 
20 
these years that we are talking about there was 700 
consultants or 140 partners who had worked at Transnet so 
there was activity.  I think the right question is probably in 
my humble respect of what was the impact and the value of 
that – of this work and I think that Dr Fine will be better 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 152 of 289 
 
placed than me to answer those questions. 
 
It was by the way an essential part of the [00:10:59] 
review that was done with Transnet over 2019 and my take 
from having been in some of these meetings and having 
seen the proceeds of this review was that the impact had 
exceeded actually our fees. 
 
Now you mentioned the context of sole sourcing and I 
– I did I hope address this question on how I think about sole 
sourcing it is a fair question.  At that time my colleagues 
would probably say that there was a long established 
10 
relationship between Transnet and McKinsey that went back 
to 2005 and that probably the sole sourcing did not create – 
raise any concern at the time of 2013 or 2014 while there 
was this sole sourcing. 
 
Now of course in hindsight as I have said the lessons 
that we drive from the situation is that we have to be 
suspicious and we have to be suspicious in particularly in 
dealing with certain companies and we have learnt from 
these lessons and changed our [00:12:19] and our policies 
with this respect. 
20 
 
If I turn now to the question of people raising 
concerns if I am not mistaken the concerns were raised after 
we had conducted our investigations.  People have raised 
concerns in the context of the investigation about Regiments 
and Trillian as they have said Dr Fine played an essential 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 153 of 289 
 
role in this respect and this led us to decide not to work with 
these companies. 
 
After that some people came forward to express 
concerns based on what they were reading or hearing 
including in the media.  All the time we took I hope we 
managed 
to 
take 
all 
of 
this 
seriously 
and 
we 
have 
incorporated those into our investigations.  People were 
interviewed by our external counsel. 
 
Having said that I think that you stressed a very 
important point which is how can organisation make sure that 
10 
there is a freedom to speak up, there is a freedom and an 
obligation to descent if there is a need to.  It is a journey. 
We have as part of our values an obligation to descent it is 
something that 
we train 
or teach to 
anybody joining 
McKinsey and we have had these values for decades.   
 
Nevertheless it is not enough just to put that on a 
statement and part of the values and it is what we can put in 
place to ensure that there is – there are conditions for 
people to speak up. That is what matters.   
 
And this is one of the reasons that we established 
20 
this whole client for instance it is also a reason why we have 
stressed 
multiple 
times 
including 
in 
our 
internal 
communication that people have an obligation to descend as 
an obligation to listen to [00:14:38] failure to treat correctly 
concerns that are raised by people would be considered as a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 154 of 289 
 
violation of our professional standards and people could be 
sanctioned for this. 
 
So I do agree with you that these are essential 
values and elements and we are [00:15:02] on a journey to 
keep us strengthening the processes that can lead for people 
to descent and you know I hope that I therefore address your 
question. 
 
But again with respect to this situation at Transnet I 
would defer to my colleague Mr Fine to provide a little bit 
more details. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I find out before Mr Chaskalson asks 
the next question whether there would have been an 
arrangement at McKinsey in terms of which the performance 
of the South African office or its South African company 
performed would be monitored so that if its performance in 
terms of finance, generating fees was too poor a decision 
would be taken what to do with its future.  And also if its 
performance in terms of generating fees suddenly increased 
astronomically somebody would be there to pick this up and 
ask the right questions.  Why is this so?  What has caused 
20 
this astronomical increase in the fees?  The past few years 
you were bringing in fees that were less than R100 million 
and suddenly you are over R100 million in 2013.  In 2014 
you are over R200 million.  In 2015 I think it is about over 
R300 million.  Somebody must be able to pick this up at the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 155 of 289 
 
– at some high level?  Was there not a system like that and 
if there was was this picked up and were the right questions 
asked 
to 
establish 
what 
was 
responsible 
for 
this 
astronomical increase in the fees in the South African 
company? 
MR MIESZALA:  So to my knowledge it is not something that 
was picked up nor certain actually that you view it in the 
aggregate the South African office was coming as unusual 
for with respect to the amount of fees.  We are talking to you 
about discreet companies so that is a fair question and I will 
10 
go back to this.  But within an office for within a geography 
situations tend to level out between different clients and 
different situations.  So really see this kind of burst when 
you are looking at numbers in aggregated ways. 
 
Having said that Mr Chair I take your question as a 
fair question which is should we be more [00:18:44] I would 
say in terms of activity with the more granular levels forgive 
me with specific questions. 
 
As they said there can be very and most of the time 
actually very good reasons and very valid reasons for this 
20 
but the question is the way I understand it what are the 
mechanism and the processes for somebody to look into this 
and who is independent from the partners serving this client 
or even independent from an office? 
 
I mean clearly part of the lessons learnt or the – in 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 156 of 289 
 
South Africa over the last years for us is to be more vigilant 
when it comes to this.  And the way we tried to address this 
type of situation in general and I am by no means saying that 
it was the case of Transnet.  Again I would like to refer to Mr 
Fine to explain the impact of our work and the nature of our 
work there but to address the question of how do we make 
sure that such situations actually could not – would not 
occur in a non-legitimate way I would say. 
 
The first thing is that as part of our evaluations of 
individuals we have stressed more systematically – it was 
10 
already there but we have stressed more systematically in an 
understanding and a review of what was the impact.  Was 
the work legitimate?  Was there impact?  Was there a reason 
for this? 
 
Now of course you can imagine the complexity of 
such an aspiration but nevertheless it is one of the core 
elements of us evaluating partners. 
 
The second thing is that we are global partnership 
meaning that we tend to – that helps avoiding having an 
office or a single partner actually to be accessibly [00:20:58] 
20 
to the activity or the fees that that office or that partner may 
contribute to.  We are a global partnership so we tend to 
arbitrate.  It may not be perfect but it is actually pretty 
unique we think and that helps also – it has a lot of reasons 
for this but that helps also making sure that there is not too 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 157 of 289 
 
much perception by individuals or group of individuals that 
there is a direct connection between what they do and 
forgive my French how much they make.  Again these 
systems are never perfect but we – this is the way we try to 
solve this. 
 
Now having said that in my humble experience is that 
most of the time people would not do the right things and I 
am speaking here in terms of judgment I am not speaking in 
terms of legality not necessarily for financial reasons but 
also for other reasons that leads to [00:22:07] and especially 
10 
when you have people who are over achievers it can 
generate bad behaviour and this is why we have to be 
vigilant and it is pretty clear that the South African situation 
has taught us a lesson and we are very humbled by that 
lesson and we hope that we incorporate the learnings from 
that lesson in the way we keep adjusting not only our 
processes but as you rightly said also the way we make sure 
that our culture is in line with our own inspirations and 
values. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see it is possible that when there is 
20 
such a high increase of annual fees there could be a 
legitimate reason for it but it is also possible that there could 
be an illegitimate reason for it.  Okay. 
 
So I would expect that if there was somebody senior 
at 
McKinsey 
sitting 
somewhere 
whose 
duty 
included 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 158 of 289 
 
monitoring the performance of the South African entity of 
McKinsey whether it was doing badly or doing well I would 
expect that he or she would ask the relevant people at the 
South African entity the right questions. 
 
So do you know whether there was such a person 
who had the responsibility to ask questions but did not ask 
because he thought there could be all kinds of legitimate 
reason for this substantial increase or is the position that 
you do not know whether there was such a person.  Or if 
there was such a person you do not know whether that 
10 
person did ask the questions that seems to me should have 
been asked.  Or whether that person left matters simply on 
the basis that generally speaking there could be all kinds of 
legitimate reasons but did not ask.  And if he or she asked 
was she given an untrue explanation?  Was he or she given 
the right explanation – the true explanation? 
MR MIESZALA:  Right so what I can answer is that there are 
people – persons in our organisation in our governance who 
are in charge of overseeing offices.  There is an office 
manager, there are regional leaders and ultimately there is 
20 
of course you know a body of – a corporate body I would say 
for the governance of our firm. 
 
So to the first question which is are there people who 
are overseeing and should ask questions the answer is no.  
Probably ask the question what was exactly said and so I 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 159 of 289 
 
cannot answer that is not to my knowledge.  I was not 
directly involved into this so I am sorry I cannot answer for 
that part of the question. 
 
Whether or not it was legitimate or not this is a 
question that we looked backwards if you want as part of the 
investigation when we looked at our work at Transnet for 
instance and whether or not that work – this work was 
legitimate. 
 
Now the question of legitimacy this is a tricky word 
because you can read it from different angles.  One of the 
10 
angle that we looked into was that was there real work and 
what was the impact of that work?  And my colleague Mr 
Fine can talk about this.  This is why we conducted this joint 
review together with Transnet to make sure that there was 
work and what was the nature of the work, what was the 
nature of the impact and was there actually an impact there? 
 
Is the work legitimate in the sense that was it 
contracted correctly or not and so on I would refer to all the 
investigations that were done not by us necessarily but also 
by other parties that looked into this question. 
20 
 
My understanding is that there was a process that 
was followed even if in the cases of the sole sourcing.  Again 
I refer to Mr Fine testimony to provide more details when it 
comes to this.  My take from the MNS findings was that if 
there was any wrongdoing it was more on the side of the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 160 of 289 
 
companies 
that 
were 
having 
this 
process 
rather 
than 
necessarily us. 
 
Now is this something that could have or should have 
triggered any concern on our side?  As I said we take this as 
a fair question and as part of the lessons that we have learnt 
to be much more suspicious about such situations especially 
when it comes to sole sourcing situations especially when it 
relates to SOE’s and this is why we made those changes to 
our policies, to our processes and to our governance to 
make sure that these kinds of situations would lead us to be 
10 
suspicious and to be much more vigilant in asking questions, 
in probing, in triangulating if you allow me I think this is a 
word in English in probing in these things. 
 
This is the best way I can answer the question Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you say there were no people 
overseeing 
the 
South 
African 
entity 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
performance outside of South Africa in McKinsey? 
MR MIESZALA:  Well there – there is a – there was a – 
there is a South African location [00:29:08]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So but outside of South Africa McKinsey 
did not have anybody overseeing how the South African 
entity was performing is that what you said? 
MR MIESZALA:  No, no I said there was – there is a chain of 
command if you want. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 161 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
MR MIESZALA:  I said yes there is – there is a location, 
there is South Africa, there is Africa, there is a region. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MIESZALA:  Which includes Africa and other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay is the position that what you did not 
know or what you do not know is whether those people did 
ask questions. 
MR MIESZALA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether they just regarded these 
10 
substantial increases in fees is something that could be due 
to legitimate reasons and did not see them as red flags.  
That is what you do not know? 
MR MIESZALA:   It is correct Mr Chair.  And to my 
knowledge, the numbers that they would have, if you go back 
– if you frame it in terms of numbers, would be aggregated 
numbers.   
 
So it would not actually at the level of somebody who is 
outside of Africa looking at the numbers, it would not be the 
numbers at the level, or at least at that time, they would not 
20 
necessarily be that glamorous.   
 
And you know, looking at an office for a region, you 
would not see the kind of things that you are referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Looking at these figures now, 
are you able to take a view whether or not, on reflection, 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 162 of 289 
 
they should have served as a red flag to those who were 
overseeing the South African entity?   
 
At least to say:  Let us find out whether there were 
legitimate reasons for these substantial increases.  Is that a 
view you take now on reflection or that you can express or is 
it something you are not – is that a view you are not able to 
express, looking back now?   
 
And in the light of McKinsey’s attempts to try and 
establish how they got to where they are. 
MR MIESZALA:   Well, I would say it is quite difficult for me 
10 
to be very specific cases of Transnet.  What I can answer is, 
is to say that.  We have decided to be much more vigilant 
and paranoid, especially in respect to our work with the 
public sector and SOE’s.   
 
We have established rules, such as independently from 
those variations in a way that you are referring to.  We will 
also conduct and we have to conduct much more frequent 
review of our work and our diligence at such institutions.   
 
So we are strengthening the fact that we are reviewing 
our work more frequently, more thoroughly, independently 
20 
from variations in a way.   
 
And the second angle is to conduct more frequent 
diligences because even if you have long established 
relationships with some institutions, there can be changes in 
those situations that you may not capture.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 163 of 289 
 
 
So that is enough of a, I would say lesson to lead us to 
decide to do these diligences on a regular basis, even when 
we are talking about longer established situations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are the chances that with the 
measure that you have now put in place, you would – 
McKinsey would be able to pick up if – to identify any 
illegitimate 
reasons 
for 
a 
substantial 
or 
astronomical 
increase in fees if this were to happen in the future? 
MR MIESZALA:   Well, I just said.  Before starting any work 
of a certain significance, that work is very likely now to go in 
10 
front of our committees from different angles in terms of 
financial aspects, in terms of risk aspect, in terms of risk 
reputation aspects and so on.   
 
So that will be now way more systematic, as I have 
explained earlier, with our current service policy.  The 
second thing that I ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just come in there and just 
ask?  I presume these committees now would be committees 
with people whose own performance bonus would not be 
affected by the work itself.  They will be independent 
20 
committees. 
MR MIESZALA:   That is correct.  That is entirely correct.  
Under good corporate governance, when I was speaking of 
people who are independent, that means they have no 
conflicts of interest and particularly when it comes to real 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 164 of 289 
 
perceived interest as you have said.   
 
So it will typically be people who will be outside of the 
region, who are outside of the industry, whatever, to make 
sure that there is no wrong incentive.  So that is a principle I 
would say that is a good corporate principle.  It is a principle 
that we always had.   
 
What we have is that we made it just more systematic to 
have a review and assessment of those situations.  I would 
like to stress also that any partner – any person at McKinsey 
and especially any partner at McKinsey is being evaluated 
10 
and reviewed every year by somebody who is not at all in 
that geography and has not connection and no interest.   
 
So as a senior partner at McKinsey, I am being 
evaluated.  I am held against the same standards.  And my 
evaluator has no connection to me and no interest.   
 
And that person will review what I do, what was my 
impact, whether or not I was upholding our values, our 
contribution in terms of social responsibility and so on.   
 
All of these would be part of my own evaluation for 
instance.  And it would be done by somebody who has no 
20 
interest aligned with my own interest. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
You 
may 
proceed 
Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Mieszala.  In relation to 
these specific event.  I can point you to at least two of the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 165 of 289 
 
governance – two more of the governance interventions that 
would have gone a long way to stopping them and which 
have now been introduced.  The first is your source scrutiny.   
 
So you have now got a system where if a succession of 
sole source contracts or not even a succession, one sole 
source contract comes to McKinsey’s Johannesburg office, 
then there is a legal review that is performed by McKinsey, 
just to check that that sole source contract is in order.   
 
You have also got a system in place now that calls for 
much more due diligence and scrutiny of supply development 
10 
partners where previously you did not have a formal 
structured due diligence mechanism for Supply Development 
partners because it was a peculiarity of the South African 
situation.   
 
So I think even those two in addition to what you 
previously described, would have gone quite somewhere 
towards flagging issues or possible identifying issues in this 
case 
that 
happened 
before 
those 
mechanisms 
were 
introduced.   
MR MIESZALA:   This is correct and if I can add two other 
20 
points, which is, because it is South Africa, public sector and 
SOE’s, any engagement in projects would have to be 
reviewed and approved by our Risk Committee.   
 
And so far, we have decided, as we made it known I 
think, not to serve SOE’s in South Africa.  And so this is still 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 166 of 289 
 
– it is still a position that we have currently.   
 
And the other thing that I would add is that.  You are 
entirely correct.  And these are the strengthening mechanism 
that we have identified and put in place.   
 
Now having said that.  I want to be very humble in the 
sense that I am always afraid of what we do not know and so 
this is why we are saying that we are on a journey, a 
continuous journey to always learn about how can we best 
know what we do not know.  And that is my role as a Chief 
Risk Officer. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I...  Before leave this topic.  
Can I put something out there for you to consider as Chief 
Risk Officer and maybe respond to?  Although you seem to 
have a practice of repaying fees when you find out expo 
facto that there was some sort of taint to the contract, 
whether – even if it was independent of McKinsey.  You do 
not seem to have a policy to that affect.  Is that correct? 
MR MIESZALA:   It is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I put it to you that in terms of 
the culture issues that I was raising earlier.  That a policy on 
20 
those lines may be a very useful device because it would 
serve as a counterbalance to any undue emphasis on 
generating fees.   
 
Because if people knew within a company that if, at the 
end of the day, they – the contract from which the fees was 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 167 of 289 
 
generated have been set aside, those fees were going to be 
have to be paid back.  That may affect the way they act 
primitively.  Anyway.  Feel free to comment on it or if you 
just want to ...[intervenes]  
MR MIESZALA:   Just a very quick comment. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja. 
MR MIESZALA:   A very quick comment if I may, which is, we 
work on any situation.  Having said that.  If there was 
anything that was not legitimate, we would take sanctions 
anyway.   
10 
 
So 
independently 
from 
a 
pure 
problem 
say 
as 
I 
understand it.  We would anyway consider that if there was 
anything that was not legitimate.  We would take disciplinary 
actions and sanction those individuals actually that either did 
not apply the right professional standards or may have had 
very poor judgment. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you off this topic and 
onto another one which is, I want to go back to what the 
Commission showed McKinsey and what McKinsey knew and 
did not before its engagement with the Commission.   
20 
 
And the crucial chronology I think is the one that starts 
at Bundle 8, page 199 where there is a chronology of events 
that the Commission put together from what it could see 
together with what McKinsey had furnished to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the ...[intervenes]  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 168 of 289 
 
MR MIESZALA:   You said 199? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   199.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Page 88.  It includes the two 
emails or it refers to the two emails that we looked at earlier.  
And in that context, if I can make a correction on that 
chronology because there is one error on the chronology 
which we do need to correct.  It is...   
 
If one goes down to page 205 at paragraph 52 of that 
chronology, the chronology says there is an entrance in 
10 
Segar’s electronic diary for a meeting with Essa and Wood.  
The entry was not in Segar’s diary, it was in Wood’s diary.  
And that, in fact ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  You are reading 
from page 199.  What part of it? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, sorry.  Paragraph... Page 205. 
CHAIRPERSON:   205? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   205, paragraph 52.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the entry was in Wood’s diary, 
20 
not Segar’s diary.  And in fact, if you go to Annexure 2, it is 
reflected there.  The error was just in the chronology itself.  
Would it be ...[intervenes]  
MR MIESZALA:   We will be correcting this. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   With the assistance of your legal 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 169 of 289 
 
team, we have established that none of the calendar entries 
in Mr Segar’s electronic diary, which was the electronic diary 
to which McKinsey had access.   
 
At the time that it was made available to McKinsey, none 
of those entries referenced meetings of Mr Segar and Mr 
Salim Essa after 3 September 2014.   
 
3 September 2014 was the last meeting between Mr 
Segar and Mr Salim Essa that was recorded on his electronic 
diary 
or 
what 
remained 
of 
his 
electronic 
diary 
when 
McKinsey was given access to it.   
10 
 
So 
before 
the 
Commission 
engaged 
McKinsey 
approximately six weeks ago, McKinsey would have had no 
way of knowing about any of the meetings between Mr Segar 
and Mr Salim Essa after 3 September 2014.  Is that correct? 
MR MIESZALA:   It is correct.  The calendar entries that are 
listed in a Annexure 2 and that identify Salim Essa as a 
participant from September 3, 2014 are not resident on 
McKinsey’s files and system but he starting in a way that 
were friends with Mr Essa.  So therefore, it would not have 
been in our own knowledge. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And with the exception of some 
email exchange or two emails exchange between Mr Segar 
and Mr Essa in 2014 around the valuation of a mine, and that 
is not relevant for present purposes, McKinsey also had not 
access to any email exchanges between Mr Essa and Mr 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 170 of 289 
 
Segar. 
MR MIESZALA:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And McKinsey found out about 
this, the 2014 email exchange between through the Gupta 
leaks because it was there.  It was not on McKinsey 
...[intervenes]  
MR MIESZALA:   That is right.  It is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So based on what McKinsey could 
find in its investigation.  I am putting to you that it may have 
been reasonable for McKinsey to had some suspicions about 
10 
the conduct of Mr Segar particularly in relation to his use of 
that secretly known programme to remove files from his 
laptop.  But you had no facts upon which you could conclude 
that Mr Segar had acted improperly. 
MR MIESZALA:   That is correct.  We had concerns and 
suspicions and which is the reason why we took disciplinary 
actions in deciding to terminate Mr Segar and why we 
decided 
also 
to 
report 
to 
authorities 
those 
findings.  
However, at the same time, we did not have the facts that 
could help us reach any conclusions such as the one you 
20 
just laid out. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But now you have been provided 
with new evidence by the Commission.  And what concerns 
me about your statement in relation to principles and 
accountability is that in your statement McKinsey does not 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 171 of 289 
 
seem 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
full 
nature 
of 
Mr 
Segar’s 
impropriety because McKinsey characterises it as an issue of 
Mr Segar violating McKinsey’s policies.  Mr Segar lying to 
McKinsey but it does not go further than that.   
 
And I want to put to you that, when one looks at all the 
evidence that the conduct of Mr Segar is improper not just 
against McKinsey but also against Eskom and probably 
against Transnet too.   
 
And you can respond now or if you want me to take you 
through why I make that submission to you before you 
10 
respond.  You can choose. 
MR MIESZALA:   Please do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if we start with those emails 
and the email is at – the 16 November email, it is an email 
itself in Bundle 8, page 393.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Page three, nine...? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Page 393 of Bundle 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So we had Clive Angel emailing 
Segar on the 16t h of November and also Eric Wood and 
20 
copying Salim Essa.  And I want to emphasise for present 
purposes that Salim Essa is copied at his Gmail address, 
salimessa@gmail.com.   
 
And it is a fairly lengthy email.  What I want to 
emphasise is the second full paragraph as it were.  Well, let 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 172 of 289 
 
us read from the top. 
“Morning.  Hope you had a great weekend.  I just 
want to touch base on a few things.” 
 
This is the passage I want to emphasise. 
“We are still waiting that the financial spreadsheet 
be the proposed aggregate 50/50 fee split and 
timelines. 
As mentioned last week, Salim needs this in 
advance of setting up a meeting for you and Alex 
with Brian.” 
10 
 
Now when I read that in context, it seems clear to me 
that Alex is Dr Weiss, Alex Weiss and Brian is Brian Molefe.  
And what I – or this email makes absolutely clear is that 
contrary to what he told the McKinsey’s investigators, Segar 
knew that Salim Essa was behind Trillian.  That much you 
seem to accept.   
 
The second point is that Segar was dealing directly with 
Salim Essa in relation to the proposed appointment of 
McKinsey and Trillian at Eskom.  You accept that? 
MR MIESZALA:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you hear that Mr Mieszala? 
MR MIESZALA:   No, the sound...  The sound wave broke 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Mieszala.  My second 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 173 of 289 
 
proposition is that what we see from this email is that Segar 
was dealing directly with Salim Essa in relation to the 
proposed appointment of McKinsey and Trillian at Eskom.   
 
Maybe for that proposition, I should read further down 
because he then goes into some lengthy details about...   
 
He says: 
“Alex mentioned in our meeting last Thursday that 
McKinsey 
had 
detailed 
project 
scope 
and 
specifications 
for 
each 
of 
the 
current 
agreed 
mandates.” 
10 
 
That would seem the mandates that McKinsey had 
agreed with Eskom. 
“We need to receive copies of these in order to plan 
our staffing for each project. 
Further to this.  Once we have had an opportunity to 
review the specifications, Bianca... 
 
That would be Bianca Goodson who was the, I think the 
CEO of Trillian or maybe the COO. 
“...needs to meet with each of your specific project 
leaders 
to 
discuss 
and 
plan 
the 
project 
20 
implementation, staffing and timelines.” 
 
And on it goes, the lines and a whole series of 
engagements that need to be made in relation to the 
prospective Eskom appointment that relate to Trillian and 
McKinsey and it includes Salim Essa or that are in an email 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 174 of 289 
 
that is addressed or copied to Salim Essa.   
MR MIESZALA:   Sorry, you broke again. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So what the emails suggests...  
Well, not what the email suggests.  I want to put to you what 
the email makes clear, is that Segar was dealing directly 
with Essa in relation to the proposed appointment of 
McKinsey and Trillian at Eskom.   
 
He is actually dealing directly with Essa.  It is not just 
that he knew that Essa was behind Trillian.  He was dealing 
with Essa when it came to that appointment or proposed 
10 
appointment. 
MR MIESZALA:   Hallo? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he...  There is a problem again with 
the connection. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I wonder if we can try and do this 
exercise again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I can still adjourn for another five minutes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I think, it is not 
satisfactory but I think it is the only option we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, then let us do the best we can.  So 
20 
let me adjourn for another five minutes.  Let us see if the 
connection can be fixed.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I hope it has permanently sorted out, the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 175 of 289 
 
problem, Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think it is a recurrent problem, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think we do have connection 
problems in this venue today, so... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But hopefully we will have a 
window of opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, but let us continue for now, 
10 
it has been sorted. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So, Mr Meiszala, what I was 
putting to you is that it is clear from this email that Sagar 
was dealing directly with Essa in relation to the proposed 
appointment of McKinsey and Trillian at Eskom and… 
MR MIESZALA:   And…? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do not know what your 
comment to that is.  Do you accept that?  Do you take issue 
with that? 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes, I see this email and clearly this 
20 
email is concerning, as I have said.  It is concerning on 
multiple accounts, is concerning because, you know, why 
is Mr Essa actually copied or cc’d to this discussion.  
Clearly would we have known or seen such an email it 
would have raised questions and the fact that, as I said, 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 176 of 289 
 
as part of our investigation, Mr Sagar had hidden from us 
that he knew that there was this connection between 
Trillian and Mr Essa was definitely a lie.  So therefore it is 
a source of concern. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes and I want to make it 
absolutely clear, I do not for a minute suggest that 
McKinsey should have been alert to this before six weeks 
ago.  So I am not – I am talking about – I am talking about 
his only now in the context of what the Commission has 
shown McKinsey and principles of accountability. 
10 
 
Let me go a little bit further.  If we read this email, 
what Angel says is: 
“As mentioned last week…” 
So there was a presumably a meeting last week. 
 
“Salim..” 
That is Essa. 
 
“...needs this.” 
Namely 
the 
financial 
spreadsheet 
with 
the 
proposed 
aggregate 50/50 fee split and timelines. 
“...in advance of setting up a meeting for you and 
20 
Alex with Brian.” 
And that, to my mind, is even more disconcerting because 
what it suggest is not only that Sagar was dealing with 
Essa but also that Sagar knew that Essa had some 
influence over Brian Molefe and Eskom and that Sagar was 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 177 of 289 
 
trying to exploit that influence in relation to McKinsey’s 
position at Eskom.  He wanted Essa to set up a meeting for 
him and Weiss with Brian Molefe.  Can you respond to that? 
MR MIESZALA:   Well, I read that Mr – and again, I was not 
part of those facts so it is difficult for me to comment on the 
elements of context or – and whatsoever.  What I read here is 
that yes, Mr Vikas Sagar was – copies email with a reference 
to Mr Salim Essa being part of a meeting or setting up a 
meeting with Mr Brian Molefe.  Whether or not Mr Sagar 
needed this meeting and for what purpose, is not something 
10 
that is clear from reading this email.  Well, maybe the 
Commission has more evidence related to this but at least it is 
clear that the question of why would Mr Essa been part of such 
a meeting is it itself an element of concern. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What I can put to you for context 
and it may be better to raise this with Mr Weiss who will have 
personal knowledge of the context but at this point McKinsey 
had been negotiating with Eskom for several months for a 
letter of appointment for the top consultants programme that 
was going to become the MSA at Eskom in 2016 and those 
20 
negotiations had not yet got over the line so McKinsey would 
have a very strong reason for wanting a meeting with Brian 
Molefe, they were trying to nail down a contract on the top 
consultants’ programme.  But that I do not expect you to 
respond to that because you have no knowledge of that. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 178 of 289 
 
 
Can I take you to the next email which is at page 395. 
MR MIESZALA:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is the email that is 
forwarded by Angel to Wood with the attachment, which is the 
spreadsheet with that – it is called 2015 11/01 Cash Flow 
Ramp Up Partner V2 XLSX which is in fact the McKinsey 
document setting out what Angel had called the proposed 
aggregate 50/50 split in timelines but the important part of that 
is what is forwarded.  Angel is forwarded an email at Sagar, 
sends from his private email, to hide it from McKinsey to 
10 
Angel but he sends it to Essa’s clandestine email, not 
SalimEssa@gmail.com that we saw on the last email but 
businessman infoportal1@zoho.com. And again, I do not 
expect you to have knowledge of this but what I can say to you 
is that that email address, infoportal1@zoho.com was an 
address that Essa used only for clandestine business and an 
address that he shared only with parties to clandestine 
business and it was not the address that was on the original 
email, so it means that Sagar had that address independently.  
Would 
you 
accept 
that, 
that 
he 
had 
the 
address 
20 
independently? 
MR MIESZALA:   I do accept. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that, to my mind, is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what was the answer?  What 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 179 of 289 
 
was your answer, Mr Mieszala? 
MR MIESZALA:   Excuse me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your answer to the question 
whether you would accept the proposition that Mr Chaskalson 
put to you? 
MR MIESZALA:   Okay, Mr Chair, I said I do accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So that means that Essa had 
shared his clandestine email address with Sagar which was, to 
the best of our knowledge, and email address he only used in 
10 
relation to clandestine activities most of which appeared to – 
well, not most of which, clandestine activities that were of a 
nature that he wanted to keep extremely secret and that were 
tainted with illegality in most cases or impropriety in most 
cases.  Now you – I cannot ask you to comment on that 
because you do not – I mean, you are not party to that 
information but what it – what is says to me at the Commission 
is that a relationship between Sagar and Essa went way 
beyond an improper relationship with respect to Sagar’s duties 
to McKinsey, it actually involved impropriety towards Eskom 
20 
and it implicates Sagar, if not McKinsey, because I do not for 
a minute suggest that anybody else at McKinsey was aware of 
this, but it does implicate Sagar in state capture linked 
wrongdoing in relation to Eskom.   
 
Now I cannot ask you to – all I – I can ask you that if 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 180 of 289 
 
you accept my propositions: 
1. That the address was a clandestine address used 
by Essa, and 
2. That it was an address that was no shared by Essa 
beyond a circle of his conspirators. 
Would you accept that this email now takes on a much more 
sinister [indistinct – dropping voice] if you accept those 
propositions, I am not asking you to comment on them. 
MR MIESZALA:   I do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Because then if we go back to the 
10 
chronology, what we see on the chronology, and again this is 
not evidence that McKinsey was aware of or could have been 
aware 
of, 
is 
that 
Essa 
was 
definitely 
involved 
in 
the 
introduction of Regiments as McKinsey supply development 
partner at Transnet and he was paid 50% commissions on all 
of the Regiments fees that Transnet paid Regiments arising 
out of Regiments’ position as supply development partner to 
McKinsey.  So let me take you to that in the document.  Can 
I ask you to go to page 202? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of bundle 8? 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Of bundle 8.  And in fact – I am 
sorry, let me take you not to the chronology but actually to 
the underlying document.  So I if I can ask you to go to 295 
which is the email of 15 August. 
MR MIESZALA:   295? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 181 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   295. 
MR MIESZALA:   And that email is an email from Eric Wood 
on 15 August 2012 to Kuben Moodley who was the go-
between between Regiments and Essa, he had a company 
called 
Albatime 
and 
he 
would 
take 
5% 
when 
Essa’s 
companies would take 50% and he says to Kuben Moodley, 
who I presume is not anyone who McKinsey had ever come 
across.   
 
“Hi Kuben, as discussed with Niven, the following  
mandates are being worked on with yourselves and 
10 
the third bold mandate is Transnet, JV appointment 
with McKinsey for programme at Capex plan, 300 
billion Capex.” 
So Wood was in some sort of arrangement with Moodley for a 
mandate to be appointed in a JV with McKinsey for 
programme management of the Capex plan at Transnet.   
 
And the link to Essa becomes clearer if we go down 
to page 308 and there what we see is an email that Wood 
sends to Essa on 11 September 2020 saying: 
“I have attached the spreadsheet as discussed.” 
20 
And if we go to the spreadsheet which is on page 309 we see 
that it is a collection of appointments at various organs of 
state but the three of the first four involve appointments with 
McKinsey at Transnet.  The first one is Capex Management 
with McKinsey under the heading Transnet. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 182 of 289 
 
“Establishment of the project office PMO for the 
management and optimization of the Transnet 300 
billion Capex over four years.  Projected revenue per 
annum, 20 million.  Timeline, in September.” 
We know, as a matter of fact, that Regiments were brought in 
on the PMO contract.   
“The locomotive management with McKinsey, project 
management 
and 
optimisation 
of 
Transnet’s 
locomotive acquisition and refurbishment programme.  
Projected revenue per annum, 30 million.  Timeline, 
10 
in September.” 
We know that Regiments were, as a matter fact, brought 
into the 1 064 locomotives contract as McKinsey to replace 
Letsema. 
 
Group swot analysis with McKinsey.  The former 
swot analysis on the entire Transnet business, 30 million is 
the projected fees, again in September, and we know that 
Regiments 
were 
brought 
in 
as 
McKinsey 
supply 
development partner on the swot contract. 
 
Now I am not suggesting that anyone at Regiments 
20 
would have known about this but what this does point to is 
the clear role of Salim Essa in bringing Regiments in as 
McKinsey’s supply development partner at Transnet. 
 
And then we have independent evidence that shows 
that Essa was paid 50% of what Transnet paid Regiments 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 183 of 289 
 
on these McKinsey supply development contracts.  So if I 
take you to page 466 we see a spreadsheet that is an 
internal Regiments spreadsheet and I will turn in a minute 
to 
discuss 
who 
it 
gets 
shared 
with, 
but 
what 
this 
spreadsheet lists is all of these contracts, many of them, 
the bulk of which are contracts which are contracts on 
which 
Regiments 
was 
supply 
development 
partner 
to 
McKinsey. 
 
These 
are 
Regiments 
contracts 
and 
the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 446? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   466. 
CHAIRPERSON:   466, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the column – so there is 
column which says – so you have the client, which is 
always Transnet on the first couple of pages, the month, 
date of the invoice, the invoice number, the project, and if 
you measure – if you cross-check those projects against 
the ones where McKinsey had Regiments as a supply 
development partner you will find that the bulk of them fall 
into that category.   
20 
The amount is set out there and then there is a 
column Chivita/Homix, that is the kickback that goes to 
Salim Essa’s shell company and if you go – and then the 
shell companies start changing when in order to launder 
funds after Homix has been exposed, he has to use new 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 184 of 289 
 
ones called For Sure and Hasta(?) and then there may 
even be over the page another one called Meju(?) these 
are 
Salim 
Essa’s 
shell 
companies 
that 
launder 
his 
proceeds of these contracts and if you go down you will 
see that 50% of what Regiments is paid gets laundered on 
to Essa’s companies and a little 5% cut goes under the 
column Albatime which is the company of Kuben Moodley 
who we saw right at the beginning, I think brokered the 
arrangement between Essa and Regiments and that was 
email that Wood said these mandates were working on and 
10 
on it goes. 
But it gets worse than that.  Again I am not 
suggesting that McKinsey would have been alert to this. If 
one goes to page 471 we see that these very kickback 
schedules 
are 
being 
emails 
to 
successive 
CFOs 
of 
Transnet, so if one  - sorry, let check that I have got the 
right – if you look at the name of that file that we have just 
looked at, it is advisory invoice tracking 2015/2016, it is a 
running 
reconciliation 
of 
these 
kickbacks 
along 
with 
amounts due from Transnet. 
20 
On the 18 May Wood emails that to Anoj Singh at 
Transnet just at the point that Anoj Singh is about to move 
over to Eskom.  Her was possibly anxious that he would 
lose his point man at Transnet but he should not have 
worried because by the 5 August, if we go to page 874, he 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 185 of 289 
 
is emailing it to Anoj Singh’s successor, Gary Peter. 
So what we have – and this is not evidence 
McKinsey could have been aware of more than six weeks 
ago, is that you have evidence of Sagar dealing directly 
with Essa in relation to an appointment of McKinsey with 
Trillian, a proposed appointment of McKinsey with Trillian 
at Eskom and seeking to use Essa’s influence at Eskom. 
You 
also 
have 
evidence 
that 
whether 
with 
McKinsey’s knowledge or not, Essa was responsible for 
putting Regiments in the position as supply development 
10 
partner to McKinsey at Transnet but Essa took a 50% cut 
of the proceeds of those appointments for Regiments and 
that Regiments kept a running reconciliation of this which 
from time to time it would email to the CFO of Transnet, 
two successive CFOs. 
And if you look then at the conduct of Sagar, in the 
light of those facts – you see, a lot of conduct that up 
until six weeks ago may have seemed neutral, but now it 
takes on very different colour, Sagar claimed not to have 
any relationship with Essa that was linked to McKinsey’s 
20 
contracts with Eskom or Transnet.  We know that was a 
fraudulent misrepresentation of Sagar ’s to McKinsey.  
That was an out and out fraud on McKinsey. 
Sagar used CD cleaner to wipe incriminating – or 
to wipe evidence off his laptop.  I mean, it looks now that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 186 of 289 
 
that is an incriminating act.  Sagar was the one inside 
McKinsey 
who 
motivated 
for 
Regiments 
to 
replace 
Letsema when Letsema were conflicted.   
Sagar had a succession of regular meetings with 
Wood and Essa going back to April 2013 on the day of the 
adoption of the 1 064 business case and then at key dates 
thereafter through the McKinsey/Regiments relationship.  
It is in that report. 
Sagar had a series of earlier meetings with Essa’s 
partner, Igbal Sharma, also around key dates in the 
10 
McKinsey/Regiments relationship.  Sagar was the one who 
within McKinsey motivated for Regiments replacement by 
Trillian in relation to the Eskom job.   
And then Sagar is the one responsible for the 9 
February 2016 letter which was written unauthorised by 
McKinsey to Trillian but assisted Trillian to be paid by 
Eskom and for present purposes what I want to emphasise 
is the point that you made earlier but that letter, was used 
by Trillian to get paid for work on the business plan when 
Trillian was not involved in any work on the business plan, 
20 
it was written by Sagar. 
So it is in that context that I want to come to the 
current dispute between McKinsey and Transnet over 
paying back interest or not paying back interest, paying 
back the fees with interest or not with interest and the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 187 of 289 
 
starting point is that McKinsey, when it chose to pay back 
the fees at Eskom, paid back the fees and then paid back 
the interest on those fees.  Is that – I mean, that is 
correct, is it not? 
MR MIESZALA:   In respect of Eskom, yes, it is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what did McKinsey do that? 
MR MIESZALA:   At Eskom? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   At Eskom.  At Eskom, yes. 
MR MIESZALA:   You mean about the interest or why did 
it repay fees? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, I know why the fees were 
repaid and I do commend McKinsey for that.  But I am 
asking why did McKinsey pay back – why did McKinsey go 
further and pay back interest to Eskom? 
MR MIESZALA:   Well, the Eskom situation, the way we 
looked at it, was – at least at that time, again, now talking 
about evidence that were brought forward just a few 
weeks ago, but at that time the main point was the fact 
that those contracts that we got from – with Eskom, were 
not legitimate and we were lied about in the context of the 
20 
National Treasury approval, which was not the case there. 
 
So also at the same time these were large 
contracts as we have discussed, these addressed, and 
those contracts were not actually carried all the way 
through with all the impact.  So that led us to decide that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 188 of 289 
 
we would repay the interest as well.  I hope I answered 
your question. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes but on that point, your – if 
the impact was not carried through, because it was risk-
based fee, the fee would not have reflected what the full 
impact may have been because you only charged for the 
impact that had been carried through.  That is correct, is 
it not? 
MR MIESZALA:   As [indistinct] 24.08, yes, but at the same 
time the contract was not supposed to be terminated that 
10 
early and theoretically they suppose you do all the work 
and then there is a time needed to see the – and 
materialise the impact.  So, I mean, I do not understand 
your question well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The point I wanted to put to you 
was that the fee was a proportion of the impact that was 
capable of being measured at the time that the contract 
was prematurely terminated.  That is correct? 
MR MIESZALA:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You see, if I look at the Eskom 
20 
scenario – and I really must commend McKinsey for the 
stand that it took in relation to Eskom – from your 
perspective in relation to Eskom at the time that you took 
this decision, you were dealing with, what on the face of it 
was vis-à-vis McKinsey, an irregularity in contract of 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 189 of 289 
 
which McKinsey was entirely innocent and was a fairly 
neutral 
irregularity 
about 
the 
absence 
of 
Treasury 
approval that was necessary for a contract like this.  That 
was Eskom’s problem – or it was Eskom’s fault and 
McKinsey was innocent.  McKinsey in fact had been the 
victim of a misrepresentation  from Eskom who said there 
was Treasury approval.  That is correct, is it not? 
MR MIESZALA:   It is true, plus the fact also that, as we 
have said as well, we did not feel, when we had to 
express 
our 
regret 
for 
the 
way 
the 
contracts 
was 
10 
happening, the fact that we were rushing to do the work 
before a diligence was done and so on.  So but the core 
issue is exactly the one that you presented. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And in fact when Mr Fine 
announced that decision in parliament - I think that may 
have been the first time it was announced, I may be 
wrong, but certainly how Mr Fine put it is that because the 
contract was invalid, McKinsey would pay back the fees 
because McKinsey did not want to benefit from any valid 
contract, that was how Mr Fine characterised it and 
20 
presented it on behalf of McKinsey. 
MR MIESZALA:   And it is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And in that case you paid back 
the fee plus the interest.  Now, I …[intervenes] 
MR MIESZALA:   In the case of Eskom, yes we did, yes. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 190 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Ja.  I would have thought that 
the current cases with South African Airways and Transnet 
are [indistinct] 26.55 cases when compared to the Eskom 
case and let me put to you why.   
The taint to the SAA/Transnet contract, which we 
have 
not 
discussed 
today, 
is 
not 
about 
a 
neutral 
irregularity like the absence of Treasury approval, it is 
about an out and out bribe to distort a tender process.  
Admittedly a bribe to which McKinsey was not party at all, 
it was Regiments, McKinsey’s supply development partner 
10 
on that contract that was guilty of the bribe.  McKinsey 
may well have been – or I have every reason to believe 
McKinsey was completely innocent and ignorant of that 
bribe, but McKinsey was also innocent and ignorant of the 
relatively neutral irregularity in relation to the Eskom 
contract.   
A contract is procured with a bribe seems to me to 
be a much more problematic situation than a contract that 
is procured in breach of a Treasury regulation given that 
in both case McKinsey is ignorant of the wrongdoing or 
20 
the flaw.  What is your comment on that? 
MR MIESZALA:   Well, I do agree, I just want to underline 
the fact that as far as I know, McKinsey did not commit a 
bribe there but I do agree totally in – with what you say.  I 
hope that you are not concluding that …[intervenes] 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 191 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, no, no, no, I …[intervenes] 
MR MIESZALA:   …we should not have repaid this even(?) 
Eskom. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No.  No, no, no, no, absolutely 
not.  I am not suggesting for a minute that McKinsey was 
party to bribe that Regiments paid Mr Ramosabudi at SAA 
or knew about it but the point that I am making is that in 
Eskom McKinsey was ignorant of the irregularity in the 
contract which was a fairly neutral irregularity.  In SAA 
McKinsey was ignorant of the taint in the contract which 
10 
was not a neutral taint, it was a really problematic taint.  
But let me go to Transnet …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, do you not want an answer of that 
before you move on or has he answered? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think Mr Mieszala has – Mr 
Mieszala and I both agree one, that McKinsey was not – 
did not know about the problems with either the Eskom 
contract or the SAA contract, I think that is presumably 
correct.  Mr Mieszala? 
MR MIESZALA:   Eskom, I did not hear your words there. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I said Mack had no knowledge 
problems in the Eskom contract at the time and it had no 
knowledge …[intervenes] 
MR MIESZALA:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it had no knowledge of the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 192 of 289 
 
problems in the SAA contract at the time. 
MR MIESZALA:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   My second proposition was that 
objectively the problem in the Eskom contract is relatively 
neutral when compared to the problem of an out and out 
bribe in the SAA contract.  Do you accept that?  Given that 
McKinsey has no knowledge of either? 
MR MIESZALA:   Well I do accept not knowing if there was 
not any bribe actually even in our situations there, but I do 
accept that statement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I just want to make sure I 
understand your answer because I think the proposition 
that Mr Chaskalson is putting to you is quite important.  
His proposition is in regard to the Eskom contracts the 
irregularity was neutral or less serious compared to the 
problem in relation to the Transnet contract because in the 
Transnet contract…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chair the Eskom contract 
not the Transnet contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay is it the other way around.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The SAA is the bribe Eskom is 
the Treasury regulation.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
in 
the 
Eskom 
contract 
the 
irregularity was neutral or less serious compared to the 
problem in the SAA contract because the problem in the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 193 of 289 
 
SAA contract was a bribe and out and out bribe accepting 
that McKinsey might or did not know that that there was a 
bribe.   
Once it is told that there was a bribe that is a more  
serious situation and I suspect if he has not done so Mr 
Chaskalson would say he would expect that in regard to 
the contract where the problem is a bribe there will be a 
greater determination or preparedness on the part of 
McKinsey to pay back even the interest because they were 
prepared to pay back interest in regard to a contract where 
10 
the irregularity was neutral or less serious.  What do you 
say to that would you agree with that logic?    
MR MIESZALA:   I do agree Mr Chair bribery is a very 
serious matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Chaskalson.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if we go to the 
Transnet contract what we see is a corrupt scheme again a 
corrupt scheme to which no one at McKinsey with one very 
important possible exception, no one at McKinsey is aware 
that it is a corrupt scheme to channel public funds from 
20 
Transnet to the Gupta Enterprise through shell companies 
controlled by Salim Essa with running reconciliations of the 
kickbacks being emailed to successive chief financial 
officers of Transnet.   
And then evidence shows that Mr Sagar who was a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 194 of 289 
 
senior partner at McKinsey knew about the influence that 
Salim Essa could exercise over State owned enterprises 
sort to use to advance McKinsey’s position at Eskom and 
had been meeting Salim Essa regularly through this period 
where all of these kickbacks were being paid at Transnet 
and we submit was most probably aware of the broad 
outlines of this corrupt scheme.  I am not suggesting that 
anybody else at McKinsey was probably aware of it but my 
submission to you is that if you look at the facts as a whole 
the inference is fairly compelling that Mr Sagar would have 
10 
known what was going on at Transnet.  Now I presume that 
you would accept that if Mr Sagar did know…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I think he wants to respond to 
your proposition.  Mr Mieszala you want to respond to the 
proposition that Mr Sagar probably knew of what was 
happening with regard to SAA?   
MR MIESZALA:   Well Mr Chair it is not my role to defend 
Mr Sagar as I said we have our suspicion and our concern 
with respect to Mr Sagar and I have no desire to defend Mr 
Sagar.  However, if I follow those two things those 
20 
concerns about where Regiments and there are things and 
I totally agree with what was said including about the 
bribery and so on which is exactly why we made this 
decision to return our piece.   
Then there is the question of what did Mr Sagar 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 195 of 289 
 
know and when about Mr Essa and Regiments.  From what 
I have seen but maybe I have overlooked documents I have 
seen that indeed and I do agree with the statement that Mr 
Sagar knew about the improper relationship and role of Mr 
Essa with respect to Regiments in I believe this was in 
2015 kind of emails.  What did or should have Mr Sagar 
know in 2012 I think this is when you went back that I 
would not know.      
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I absolutely accept that Mr 
Mieszala and I want to emphasise that McKinsey has not 
10 
had the information that the Commission gave it for any 
length of time and has not had an opportunity to consider 
it.  But I would urge McKinsey to look very closely at it and 
to ask why in the light of that information and if McKinsey 
needs any further information from the Commission we 
would be happy to give whatever we have.   
Why in the light of that information McKinsey would 
not want to make the same restitution to SAA and Transnet 
as it is made in the relatively neutral case of the violation 
of the Treasury regulation at Eskom.     
20 
MR MIESZALA:   Okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do not expect an answer now 
and I would urge McKinsey to take its time and really 
consider that.  
MR MIESZALA:   I am happy to give you already an 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 196 of 289 
 
element of answer I think I understand now better where 
you were heading to and let me rephrase and make sure 
that I understand your question.  You are asking whether or 
not McKinsey intends to repay also the interest related to 
those contracts of South African Airways and Transnet and 
the lot as it has with Eskom, is this your question?  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well that was the last question, 
yes.  
MR MIESZALA:   Got it so as I think we have said we made 
a decision on principle to return our fees.  We have to work 
10 
out with the institutions the SOE’s but also with the 
authorities all the details of what this would be and how it 
will be done.  So please do not consider that any statement 
that was made about the details of that repayment is 
definitive.   
The second thing that I would also like to coin but 
again it is not a – I am here at the level of principles so it 
is not about arguing on a legal basis or whatsoever but it 
is in the case of Transnet I could also argue which is 
different from Eskom that there was real work that was 
20 
done with benefits incurred by the SOE’s who have also 
not only benefited from the impact of the work but also the 
interest of that impact of the work McKinsey has also 
incurred cost.  
Now I am not saying this as an element you know 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 197 of 289 
 
would sort of steer by no means you know what is our 
intention here but I just wanted to coin this two elements 
which is we have to look into all these facets and we 
intend to work with the authorities as well as with the 
SOE’s on all of the details and the modalities on how to 
return these funds.  But what we wanted to do today is to 
share which I think is your proposition which is the 
evidence that was shown to us clearly laid out improper 
actions and we do not want to be associated with these 
actions and we are committed to be responsible and took 
10 
responsibility so that we are returning all the revenues that 
we derived from those contracts.           
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Mieszala my one 
response to that would be and I mean something that we 
will 
take 
up 
with 
Mr 
Weizz, 
Eskom 
sorry 
McKinsey 
committed 
very 
substantial 
resources 
at 
Eskom 
and 
achieved very substantial results at Eskom as well.  I have 
always understood McKinsey’s position not to be, is there a 
legal obligation?  Did we deliver value?   
It to be we do not – when we see this sort of thing  
20 
we want nothing to do with it and certainly that is how I 
understood it at Eskom and I do not and maybe this is 
something to raise with Dr Fine later but I think I mean I do 
not and we running late and I think this questioning should 
probably end.  But I do want to say – I do not want it to 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 198 of 289 
 
end on the wrong note because my own view and I want to 
place it on record here is that McKinsey has been 
unjustifiably criticised in relation to State Capture in South 
Africa.  
And I do want to emphasise that to the best of my 
knowledge and the knowledge of my investigation team it is 
points I have made already but I want to emphasise it 
again.  McKinsey was the very first company in South 
Africa 
to 
terminate 
relationships 
with 
Regiments 
and 
Trillian on prohibited grounds no one else had done it by 
10 
the time McKinsey did.  I would also like to emphasise that 
no present partner or employee of McKinsey was to the 
best of our knowledge party to or aware of any corruption 
to McKinsey’s contracts at SAA, Eskom or Transnet and 
finally I would like to emphasise that McKinsey has already 
repaid far more than any other party in fees on contracts 
stated by State Capture, but I do want to emphasise all of 
that but having said that McKinsey has always presented 
itself as a leader on issues of corporate governance and 
corporate citizenship.   
20 
So I would ask McKinsey not to measure itself by 
what other companies have done but rather by what 
standards it sets for itself and so although it has done 
more than most other companies in South Africa in relation 
to State Capture I would urge it to look again at the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 199 of 289 
 
question of interest and also look again at the question of 
accountability in relation to Mr Sagar who is no longer part 
of McKinsey but who was at the time.  Sorry that was a 
speech not question.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if you are not going to comment on 
the speech Mr Mieszala I do have a question that I want to 
put to you.  You do not intend commenting on the speech?        
MR MIESZALA:   I do not intend to comment on the 
speech.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright maybe the fact that you do 
10 
not want to comment on the fact what Mr Chaskalson says 
is a speech should give me an indication of what your 
answer is going to be to my question but before I put the 
question I want to say the following.  One, feel free to say 
you would not like to add or qualify the answer you gave 
earlier on at this stage.   
Feel free to say you would not like to answer this 
question until you have reflected on it further.  Feel free to 
say you would not like to answer this question until you 
have spoken to your advisors and you are not being 
20 
pressurised to make any decisions or to say anything.  Is 
that clear?    
MR MIESZALA:   It is clear Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay in the answer you gave earlier on 
to Mr Chaskalson did you mean that in principle McKinsey 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 200 of 289 
 
does not have a problem with paying interest as well in 
regard to SAA and Transnet but it is the figures and the 
amounts that need to be worked out or did you simply 
mean to say it is something that McKinsey must still reflect 
on in the light of the evidence and matters that Mr 
Chaskalson has put up and there is no finality yet.   
MR MIESZALA:   I was responding Mr Chair on the 
principle now having not studied all the potential legal 
financial fiscal implications and so on.  I prefer not to go 
into the details so I prefer to respond that we committed to 
10 
take 
responsibility 
to 
work 
all 
these 
elements 
in 
a 
constructive manner with an open mind together with the 
authorities and the SOE’s.     
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no I think that is – I understand 
that answer thank you very much, Mr Chaskalson.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No I do not have any questions 
thank you Mr Mieszala.  I do not have any further 
questions Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Mieszala thank you very much 
for your evidence unless your counsel wishes to re-
20 
examine you we are done and I am ready to release you 
but thank you very much for your evidence and I am sure 
that the cooperation that McKinsey has given to the 
Commission is going to continue in regard to whatever 
matters must still be dealt with.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 201 of 289 
 
MR MIESZALA:   Thank you Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Your counsel I am sure they do hear me, 
do they intend, is he intending re-examining you - I am 
sure he is going to tell me.  
ADV COCKEREL SC:  Just to confirm I have no questions 
for Mr Mieszala, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you very much, thank you 
very much for that Mr Mieszala is now excused.  
MR MIESZALA:   Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair the next witness is Dr 
Fine, I wonder if we might just take two minutes with 
yourself Chair and the legal representatives how we going 
to proceed and how we should try and schedule timing to 
finish both outstanding witnesses tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will adjourn for five minutes 
and then you will see me in chambers. We adjourn.   
REGISTRAR:   All rise.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay are you ready Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. Do you want the witness to be 
sworn in? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Let us put this – it’s Dr David Fine.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 202 of 289 
 
Can we? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay please administer the oath 
affirmation.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
DR FINE:  David Robert Fine. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
DR FINE:  I don’t. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
10 
DR FINE:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will 
give, it will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else 
but the truth?  If so please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
DR FINE:  So help me God. 
DR DAVID ROBERT FINE:  [duly sworn, states] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated Dr Fine.  
Please continue Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Dr Fine can we start by confirming 
20 
the correctness of your statement?  Chair you will find that 
statement at page 189.  And in fact there are two 
statements.  There is a statement at page 189 of bundle 7 
and also one at page 230.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, just to confirm, we are still using 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 203 of 289 
 
the same bundles that we were using with the previous 
witness? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  And right now you are 
referring to bundle 7? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the one statement is at page 189 
and the other one is on page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  230.   
CHAIRPERSON:  2-3-0. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Dr Fine can you just confirm 
that the statement at pages 189 to 225 is your statement?  
And you confirm the correctness of it?   
DR FINE:  I do Chair.  There are two corrections which I 
just need to, to point out if I could.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FINE:  On page 194, FOF07194, the black text.  Under 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  In which paragraph? 
DR FINE:  Paragraph 20 the last sentence.  It should say, 
20 
in 2009 Mr Singh and not 2011 Mr Singh.  And then the 
second correction, is on FOF07-210, on paragraph … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In which paragraph first? 
DR FINE:  Paragraph 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  56. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 204 of 289 
 
DR FINE:  The sentence should say, Regiment’s replied by 
way of its letter of 22 n d August 2014, not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  56, Is it the 
opening part of 56?  Or is it … 
DR FINE:  It is the opening part of 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
DR FINE:  The first sentences should read, Regiments 
replied by way of its letter of 22 August and not 28 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not 28. 
DR FINE:  Apologies for those corrections.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I could have helped if there can just be 
one paragraph a few sentences of supplementary affidavit 
to, to be put in to make the corrections.  Otherwise they 
are not ...[indistinct].   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  And then Dr Fine 
there is also a statement that you made to the South African 
Parliament.  It starts at 230 and has – ends, well includes an 
annexure which is a chronology of the 10/64 procurement 
that ends at 245 I think.   
DR FINE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
And 
can 
you 
confirm 
the 
correctness of, of that statement? 
DR FINE:  I can correct that, confirm that statement.  
There was one small error in that statement which I will 
correct at a later point during my testimony.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 205 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you.  Well maybe correct it 
now because … 
DR FINE:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We may not necessarily get there. 
DR FINE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR FINE:  Let me do that.  Apologies, it was – I actually 
had it in front of me.  On page FOF-027-239. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s page 239. 
DR FINE:  239.  The third line. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Third line of the top paragraph?   
DR FINE:  From the top paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR FINE:  The sentence says, in addition Mr Saga and I 
met with Eric Wood on 5 March 2016.  It should be 1 March 
2016.  It was incorrectly stated in my statement in 
parliament.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes.  That is the supplementary 
affidavit can deal with all of them.  Okay. 
DR FINE:  Thank you Chair.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Then Dr Fine, can you briefly 
describe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry Mr Chaskalson, do you 
want me to formally admit them? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry, I do Chair.  And again I 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 206 of 289 
 
think I’ve lost track of the, of the annexure numbers.  Can 
we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The first one has got VV7.  I don’t know 
if that’s correct, exhibit VV7, that statement. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t know if that ...[indistinct]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The second statement is an 
annexure to the first statement, so it does not need its own 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And  yes, so it can be admitted at 
VV7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The statement of Dr David Robert 
Fine starting at page 189 is admitted to ...[indistinct] and 
its annexures and will be marked as exhibit VV7? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  VV7 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  VV7.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Dr Fine can you begin by telling 
the Chair who you are and what your positions and 
responsibilities 
at 
McKinsey 
have 
been 
particularly 
in 
20 
engagements with SOEs in South Africa? 
DR FINE:  Thank you Chair.  My name is David Robert 
Fine, I am a South African citizen as you can hear from my 
accent.  I started at McKinsey 25 years ago in the South 
African offices, the first local McKinsey hire in, in Africa.  I 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 207 of 289 
 
am currently the global leader of McKinsey’s public sector, 
social sector and health systems practice which role I 
currently have in London.   
And before that position I also served in the region 
as the head of the public sector, social sector and health 
sector for the region we call EMO which goes from Russia, 
all the way through the middle East to South Africa.  In 
terms of Transnet and perhaps referring to a couple of 
points from paragraph 14 onwards, McKinsey does engage 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
and 
in 
states 
on 
enterprises 
10 
extensively and typically a McKinsey team at any one of 
these 
clients 
consists 
of 
partners, 
senior 
partners, 
associate 
partners, 
project 
managers 
which 
we 
call 
engagement managers and other.   
And we obviously do this work by bringing together 
the best skills and expertise we can for the appropriate 
project, from cities around the world and in 65 countries.  
Just to clarify for the Chair, I never worked with Eskom.  
So my testimony is predominantly focussed on Transnet 
with the exception of the termination of Trillion which I was 
20 
directly involved with.   
And perhaps just to give by way of a short 
background on, on Transnet, there were many partners and 
senior partners and colleagues who worked at Transnet.  I 
was one of, of many.  At least there were throughout the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 208 of 289 
 
period a consistent set 13 partners and six senior partners.  
And I have described those in my statement for you.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then Dr Fine, you talk about 
the – maybe let’s start at the end rather than the beginning, 
because I do want to get this out of the way.  I must 
apologise for that.  But you make clear in your statement, 
maybe if you can go to pages 190 to 191, paragraphs eight 
to nine where you deal with the fact that you have had no 
contact with Salim Essa, Kuben Moodley and the like.  Can 
you just make, read that into the record? 
10 
DR FINE:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.   
“A couple of key points.  I wanted to first of all 
confirm that I am not aware of any corruption that 
McKinsey has been part of.  I have neither met nor 
had dealings with Mr Essa and Kuben Moodley, 
Clive Angel, Mark Pamensky, Stanley Shane and 
Clive Chipkin or any of the Guptas.  I stated this in 
my 
parliamentary 
testimony. 
 
I 
was 
briefly 
introduced to Igbal Sharma at a party, was a 
function celebrating South Africa’s 20 t h anniversary 
20 
of its democracy.  There were many people present.  
It was a brief discussion and I do not recall meeting 
him at any other time.  The other thing which I 
thought I should confirm in the record Chair, is that 
I have no knowledge of any improper dealings 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 209 of 289 
 
between Mr Saga and anyone of Levin Pillay, Eric 
Wood, Salim Essa, or Kuben Moodley and I was 
uninvolved, unaware of Mr Essa’s involvement and 
Mr 
Moodley’s 
involvement 
in 
Regiments 
and 
subsequently in Trillion until my investigations in 
2016.”   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Dr Fine.  Can I then ask 
you to go to page 196 where you describe the various 
contracts that McKinsey was involved in at Transnet under 
your period, well in the period 2012 to 2016?  And can I ask 
10 
you to take the Chair very briefly through those contracts? 
DR FINE:  Okay so by way of context I first just want to 
explain that McKinsey had a long working relationship, 
both at Eskom and at Transnet which went back to 2004, 
2005 time frame.  McKinsey had originally worked on a 
program the Vulendlula(?) program during the time that 
that Ms Ramos, Mr Van Niekerk and Mr Wells were part of 
Transnet.   
I was the lead partner at that time for negotiating 
the scope and arrangements.  It was a large program.  The 
20 
professional fees were substantial over a three year 
period, of around 900 million rands.  So it was substantial 
but there was clear governance and structures in place and 
a lot of valued had arrived.  Subsequently we had much 
more moderate work which I think has been presented 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 210 of 289 
 
before the Commission already.   
And then in about 2009 the government changed its 
policy and it implemented what they called or described a 
developmental state when Mr Molefe came to Transnet, he 
then described what he called the market demand strategy, 
which was a difference from the past.  An important 
distinction to understand was before Mr Molefe’s and this 
developmental state, Transnet only invested in its capital 
projects if there was proven demand.   
Mr Molefe’s strategy said that Transnet should 
10 
invest ahead of demand because South Africa had not 
benefitted from the commodity boom because it had 
constrained infrastructure.  As a consequence the work 
McKinsey predominantly did in the early stages which I will 
talk about now, was focussed on projecting volumes and 
helping 
Transnet 
then 
align 
and 
allocate 
its 
capital 
accordingly so that it could invest in this capacity without 
necessarily having any issues further down the line.   
There were three projects between 2012 and2014.  
And all of them were on a competitive basis.  The first 
20 
project which you see in 28.1 it is a combination of two 
projects, but they’re essentially one theme.  What was 
called delivering the market demand strategy and the 
results management office.   
The market demand strategy which was done with 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 211 of 289 
 
Letsema(?) was an attempt to support executives to 
develop and clarify very specific plans which would allow 
them to meet the strategic objectives and their financial 
commitments that they have made.  There was what was 
called a gold standard developed which ensured that each 
of the divisions was supported in putting their plans into a 
very structured process.   
Of course in addition the plan is great, but it needs 
to be followed up.  And so the second part of that project 
was around what was called the results management office 
10 
and its objective was to track and measure whether or not 
the commitments that the various divisions had made would 
actually be effected.   
A second part of this project which was very 
important is that it recommended three new functions 
should be created, because after Mr Van Niekerk left 
Transnet and there was no chief operating officer, there 
were three functions that needed to be created in our view.  
The first, there was not a proper planning function for 
finance, which we recommended.   
20 
The second as I have talked about is the - what was 
called the result management office to track and manage 
Transnet’s initiatives.  And the third and most important in 
my view was that all the projects, capital projects were 
dispersed in the organisation and so we recommended that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 212 of 289 
 
they should create something called the group capital 
integration and assurance function, which would then 
provide oversight on all the capital projects in Transnet, to 
ensure that they were properly delivered.   
The second project I will rather talk about in 
subsequent discussion which is the locomotive 1064 tender 
which has particular relevance for the Commission.  And I 
know that that the evidence leader would like to go there at 
some point in time.  And then the third project which was 
called, describes what one, it was a – I am not even sure 
10 
why it was described that way, but it was a bit in a context 
of SWAT and American colloquialism of a fast moving and 
very targeted effort.   
And its objective was to do three things.  Firstly it 
needed to define what was called the platinum standard for 
how projects should be defined, managed and, and key 
decision in governance around those projects.  Page, date, 
etcetera.  The second was, it was the first attempt to 
actually bring all these dispret(?) projects together and try 
and work out how they were interconnected.   
20 
As an example, one of the issues that was identified 
through this project was that there were a number of 
projects happening in different divisions of Transnet, in 
freight rail, in engineering, in the ports, in the authority on 
manganese, but they were not actually brought together 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 213 of 289 
 
under one individual what we called program.   
It was an interesting process because at the end of 
this project we actually determined which nobody knew 
beforehand that the second biggest project in Transnet was 
actually the manganese project, which no one had been 
managing on an integrated manner.  And the third objective 
was to begin the methodology of the defining the project 
portfolio, forcing the business to actually look at what the 
costs and benefits were of these different projects and 
through that identify opportunities for improvement.   
10 
And actually through that process there was about 
45 billion rand in the capital portfolio that was identified as 
not necessary within a reasonable time frame that could be 
deferred or moved.  So that was what I would call the 
phase between 2012 and 2014.  And before the Single 
Source Awards which were discussed earlier.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you then go to paragraph 33.1 
and discuss the Single Source Awards? 
DR FINE:  Yes.  I think it’s very important though to give a 
little bit of context for the Single Source Awards because 
20 
there questions around, around them.  And the context is 
as follows very simply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry.  One second Dr Fine.  You said 
53.1 Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  No, no, 33.1.  Page 200.  33.1. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 214 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 220? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  200.  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
DR FINE:  But Chair I am going to start at 30 and just give 
a few context points.  I will do it briefly given the time 
constraints. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine.   
DR FINE:  Which is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Correct. 
DR FINE:  On page 198.  So the context is important 
10 
because in early 2014 four different factors came together 
to create a serious financial risk to Transnet.  The first was 
that the external market environment changed dramatically.  
If people recall at that time, during the 2008 financial 
crisis, South Africa was actually not that affected for some 
period of time.   
But 
domestic 
demands 
started 
to 
slow. 
 
The 
Chinese economy then went into a slowdown which was 
unusual and that dramatically affected export coal and 
steel from South Africa.  And was combined with some 
20 
external events which were more force, ...[indistinct] 
things, there was a flood, there was a problem with the 
Tiplat Majuba.  So those were six of external issues.  In 
addition Transnet was under performing on its volume and 
had done so consistently for a couple of years.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 215 of 289 
 
It was under performing in terms of delivering on its 
volume by as much as 12 percent versus its plans.  The 
third issue is that there were serious capital project delays 
and excesses.  And just to give you one example, in fact 
I’ll give two.  The national product pipeline was envisaged 
to start in 2008 and to be completed in 2010 for eight 
billion rand.   
At this point in time it was 23,4 billion rand. And 
they were still asking for another five billion rand to 
complete it.  The manganese project as I discussed already 
10 
had significant issues, because they were projecting that 
they needed 21 million tons.  Whereas the analysis that 
McKinsey conducted said there was no more than 18 or 17 
or 
16 
million 
tons 
worth 
of 
potential 
demand 
for 
manganese.  So there were serious issues.   
But there was, there was serious capital issues.  
And then lastly Transnet conducted and concluded the 
locomotive acquisition.  These five factors, the external 
issues, the slow down domestically, the lack of volume 
delivery by Transnet, the capital project delays and the 
20 
local acquisition came together to essentially create a 
rapidly deteriorating financial position for Transnet.   
And in fact at that point in time and I’m talking 
around 
February, 
March 
2014, 
if 
you 
projected 
how 
Transnet’s financials, it would have breached its cash 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 216 of 289 
 
interest cover or is key loan governance.  And in fact that 
could have triggered potentially issues in the South African 
debt markets because of the sovereign support that South 
Africa had provided and underwritten to Transnet.   
So I just want to give that context because there 
are lots of questions at the time around, was there a sense 
of urgency.  From my personal perspective at that time 
there was a real sense of urgency.  So then coming to the 
specific projects that were awarded, I think it’s also 
important as a last piece of context to say, these were not 
10 
projects while, while they were awarded to McKinsey in a 
batch on the 9 t h of February.   
They 
were 
desperate 
projects 
that 
had 
been 
discussed over multitude periods of time.  For example, the 
pipeline had been discussed from 2008 with Transnet on 
the issues of pipelines.  The manganese project arose out 
of SWAT 1.  And so I just wanted to give that context, 
because there is an assumption that there was neither a 
sense of urgency, and that a lump of projects arrived but in 
reality these were desperate projects and because of the 
20 
urgency Transnet chose to award them through their 
governance in one lot size.   
So let me go through the various projects very 
briefly and my role and perhaps Chair when you read my 
statement, 
you 
will 
see 
my 
role 
was 
predominantly 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 217 of 289 
 
focussed at the corporate centre and on capital because I 
had a problematic relationship with Mr Gama and was 
therefore unable to really work on any projects that were 
related to the rail system.  So in 33.1 the first project was 
what we called SWAT 2 which was an extension of SWAT 1.   
And it’s objective was to reduce capital spending by 
a further 64 billion and a defer it, one of the objectives or 
outcomes of that project is that there was a big project in, 
in Durban at the time called the Durban Dig Out Port and 
what we showed was that through a variety of operational 
10 
issues and by ...[indistinct] deepening, that project could 
be avoided completely.   
On manganese, first of all an operational system 
was implemented, which essentially avoided the capital 
expenditure they needed to do.  Because there were ways 
in which they could reconfigure their operating system 
without investing in capital.  And there was a contract 
negotiation which you have heard about before, but in that 
a set of terms were introduced, which when manganese 
demand fell, improved Transnet position by 400 million 
20 
rand.   
On the national multi product pipeline, the MNPP, 
we helped them to implement new construction methods so 
that they could achieve their objectives in time.  And to 
reduce their cost overruns or projected cost overruns I 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 218 of 289 
 
should say, by five billion rand.  What’s important to also 
note on this one Chair, is we withdrew from that project.   
And this is important because there are questions 
about whether McKinsey actually did exercise independent 
thought.  And on this particular project as one example, 
and there were others, we felt because management kept 
changing priorities all the time which is very difficult when 
you are trying to accomplish capital projects, that we could 
no longer provide the advice and we withdrew on that 
project.   
10 
On the coal line, we had done extensive work in 
during Vulendlela on the coal line and demonstrated it had 
a lot of extra capacity.  We worked with Transnet to, to 
improve that and in that financial year there was eight to 
nine million tons more coal delivered which translated into 
about 
980 
million 
rands, 
more 
operating 
profit 
from 
Transnet.   
On Kumba iron ore, there was a mixed result.  And 
the first was, there was an intention to negotiate prices, 
re-price the Kumba iron ore.  This was an issue because 
20 
the historical prices were not sufficient to be able to cover 
the costs of future investment.  That did not materialise.  
They renegotiated iron ore.   
However there was three to five million tons more, 
sorry seven million tons more of capacity identified through 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 219 of 289 
 
operational improvement, which Transnet has subsequently 
captured.  And then there were two other projects.  One 
which was very small, it was called the Gasfield strategy in 
33.6 Chair.   
And that was really a projection on gas fuels and 
gas demand that was obviously the context of the pipeline 
and a lot of discussion at that time about the gas finds in 
Saldanha 
of 
the 
Mozambican 
coast 
and 
what 
the 
implications might be for Transnet.  I think it was a very 
short six week project.  And then the last project which we 
10 
worked on and which we withdrew from, was the general 
freight contract which was actually a Regiments contract.   
They were the prime contractor.  The rational 
explained to us at the time is that at some point a supplier 
development partner needed to be capable enough to be a 
prime contractor and not a sub contractor.  And then of 
course because we terminated our work with Regiments, 
our work on that projects ...[indistinct].   
So that was the portfolio projects between what 
2014 and 2016 when we ended our work with Regiments 
20 
and subsequently as a consequence with Transnet.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Dr Fine can  you move then to your 
initial due diligence?  Actually I do not need to address the 
initial due diligence of Regiments.  Can you move to the 
deterioration and ultimate termination of the Regiments 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 220 of 289 
 
relationship?  It’s a topic you address from page 212 of 
bundle 7.   
DR FINE:  Sorry Chair I wonder if I – there was one 
important issue I left out if I could and that relates to 
paragraph 36.  Sorry 38 apologies, my eyes are deceiving 
me.  I just wanted to reiterate that in 2019 McKinsey did 
enter into a discussion which I know Mr Mizale(?) referred 
to with Transnet on the historical review of all the projects 
we had done, it was a very detailed process.   
It was run by Mr Silinga who was the group general 
10 
counsel for Transnet at that time.  We provided all our 
documentation.  They checked during that period of time 
with all the colleagues who had been involved in the 
projects, if the benefits had been derived or not.  And what 
we concluded at the end of that detailed process was that 
Transnet was satisfied that the projects performed by 
McKinsey except the iron ore project where the objectives 
were only partially met, they accepted that the projects had 
delivered value.   
That there was an invoicing error which we agreed 
20 
at that time we would pay interest on.  And they agreed 
that the benefit Transnet received were well in excess of 
any of McKinsey’s fees.  It was approved arrangement with 
the executive committee.  I understand when it went to the 
board it was not concluded, but it is memorialised in an 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 221 of 289 
 
attachment, in an annexure for your records.  Apology 
Chair, now we can move to your questions on Trillion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FINE:  And Regiments.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well let’s start with Regiments, 
yes.  When you are talking about the breakdown of the 
Regiments relationship?  From page 2 … 
END OF RECORDING 
 
 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
DR FINE:  Yes.  So I think it’s important to Chair to first 
20 
reflect that the process of supply and development was not 
an 
easy 
journey 
with 
Letsema 
or 
necessarily 
with 
Regiments.  When we began our journey with Letsema 
which ended up being a very, very successful supply 
development relationship, they became successful and 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 222 of 289 
 
large and even competed with McKinsey.   
There were times there were differences of opinion 
and issues.  And so we had to sit down and resolve them.  
And one of the, the reasons that’s important is that when it 
came to Regiments it wasn’t like it was not without its 
issues.  And so you know there were times when there 
were concerns and issues.  And there were attempts to 
resolve 
them, 
which 
I 
think 
is 
reasonable 
in 
any 
relationship between two parties.   
When the work began with Regiments, there was 
10 
these complexities and we got people together and we had 
a facilitator who helped us work through these issues and 
then proceed.  But in mid 2014, on the 24 t h of July there 
was an article and I am now referring to paragraph 54 in 
the Mail and Guardian, where Mr Nivan Pillay who was a 
shareholder in Regiments was named.   
And 
the 
allegation 
was 
there, 
was 
of 
some 
impropriety.  We were deeply, deeply concerned about this.  
And so myself and another senior colleague of mine Mr 
Norbette Dorr, immediately escalated this matter to our 
20 
global 
general 
counsel 
Ms 
G 
Malino 
who 
wrote 
to 
Regiments, calling for a response to these allegations.  And 
whether or not, and in fact insisted on whether they were 
compliant with the relevant anti-corruption practices, both in 
South Africa and in other jurisdictions as well.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 223 of 289 
 
Regiments did reply by way of a letter which I have 
now corrected for you on the 22 nd of August in which they 
actually said that the allegations were baseless.  They put in 
place the right policies for the promotion of honest and 
ethical behaviour.  They had a corporate governance 
framework.   
And they suggested that Mr Pillay who was only an 
individual of Regiments and not Regiments itself, would be 
removed from the work with McKinsey.  The letter is attached 
then in DF9.  I did actually inquire with external people and I 
10 
refer to that in my statement who said they didn’t personally 
think there was an issue.   
Mr Dorr and I did raise the issue with Mr Singh and 
Mr Peter at Transnet in a meeting where Mr Saga was 
present.  And they said that they would seek the same 
assurances from Regiments.  We had a problem … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry Dr Fine, can I just clarify 
because once we go into that report, the report was based 
on asset restraint proceedings brought by the NPA.  Is that 
not correct? 
20 
DR FINE:  That’s my recollection.   
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC:  And in the asset 
restraint 
proceedings the NPA had alleged that Mr Pillay had made a 
corrupt payment to the then MEC for housing in Gauteng, Mr 
Brian Hlongwa.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 224 of 289 
 
DR FINE:  That’s correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So it, it went a little bit beyond the 
newspaper report.  It was actually the NPA had sort of used 
this allegation as part of an application on the basis of which 
it successfully froze assets.   
DR FINE:  At the time, at that moment in time at least my 
recollection is also that the Mail and Guardian printed or 
reprinted the article or reissued the article with a very 
strong denial from Mr Pillay.  It was also unclear whether 
Regiments health, it was a separate company and not part 
10 
of Regiments capital was involved.   
And the most difficult situation that we had, which I 
outline in 59 and was one of the key learning’s was that 
when we looked at the consortium agreements between 
McKinsey and Regiments it did  not permit a cancellation of 
that 
consortium 
agreement, 
absent 
and 
un-remedied 
breach.   
And as I understood it from our lawyers at that time, 
the fact that Regiments was prepared to confirm in writing 
their compliance to certain issues, to remove themselves 
20 
from Pillay from our work, constituted a remedy.  And of 
course in addition we were currently under way with very 
urgent projects at Transnet, so it was a very difficult 
situation.   
And one of the lessons we learned from that and 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 225 of 289 
 
was implemented immediately subsequent to this issue, 
was actually having a breach clause in all our contracts 
with 
any 
supply, 
development 
partners. 
 
So 
it 
was 
complicated.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sir can I, can I ask if that situation 
arose today, you’d have a contractual remedy ...[indistinct]. 
DR FINE:  If that arose today we would have contractual 
elements in place which would allow us for immediate 
termination without cause.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thanks. 
10 
DR FINE:  And in fact was a direct consequence of that.  
And so at the time what was proposed then, accepted by 
McKinsey is that Mr Wood would assume Mr Pillay’s role as 
the primary contact person with McKinsey.  And Mr Saga 
would continue as him, as the primary contact between 
McKinsey and Regiments which had been in effect.   
And to a certain extent actually the work improved 
and the quality of work improved and when issues arose, 
which they do in these things, they were resolved.  And so 
during that period of time between 2014 and mid 2015 
20 
things actually were going very well and we felt that they 
were capable people doing good work.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  When did things start to break 
down? 
DR FINE:  So in late 2015 we started to get concerned.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 226 of 289 
 
We were concerned first of all because the quality of work 
by the Regiments personnel was deteriorating.  It did not 
seem they were able to actually be the prime contractor on 
this general freight contract.  We had to provide extra 
resources.   
They had subcontracted the work to others for 
including Letsema and a company called A-company and so 
our colleagues were getting concerned that the ability to 
deliver what had been committed, was deteriorating.  The 
second issue was that many of the leadership of Regiments 
10 
who used to participate in the steering committees that 
happened every Friday did not represent South Africa’s 
demographics.   
And so we were naturally asking questions in 
McKinsey about how is it possible if we are in the supply 
development partner do we not see the transformation of 
the leadership team.  And it was at this moment in time 
that we actually had a discussion about finding alternative 
supply development partners.   
Mr Saga who was the primary liaison as I have said 
20 
with Regiments said that Regiments was intending to split 
itself into two parts.  It’s financial advisory business where 
Mr Pillay and Mr Nyonye would continue.  And a consulting 
business which was going to be called Trillian management 
consulting which would seek investments in building a pre-
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 227 of 289 
 
eminent black owned South African consulting firm.  We did 
have a discussion in McKinsey.   
Given the issues that had been identified we 
decided we would pursue identifying a number of different 
potential partners of which Trillion might be one, but they, 
they would need to pass a proper due diligence process.  
And, and that was agreed.  It unfortunately Chair then got 
a little more complicated.  And what I said in parliament is, 
Regiments didn’t have many chances.   
But we concerned because on Friday the 11 t h of 
10 
December when I arrived at a steering committee meeting 
at Transnet which normally consisted of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is 2015? 
DR FINE:  2015 Apologies.  I am on line, paragraph 65.  
On Friday the 11 t h of December 2015 when I arrived for the 
steering committee which normally consisted of Transnet 
finance management, Regiments’ leadership and McKinsey 
leadership, I on occasion asked where Mr Bobat was 
because he was normally a regular participant in all these 
discussions.   
20 
And on inquiring this with Mr Wood, he said that Mr 
Bobat had left to go and work for Minister Van Rooyen as a 
financial advisor.  And I was quite taken aback.  I, I had no 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was Mr Wood telling you that? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 228 of 289 
 
DR FINE:  This was Mr Wood telling me that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FINE:  I wasn’t at that moment in time concerned 
around any of the state capture issues that we talk about 
today, but it just seemed unusual.  The reason I was partly 
comfortable is I also knew that Regiments had worked 
closely in the finance industry.   
They had relationships at treasury.  And I had been 
told which I was not present at, that at their tenth 
anniversary party, Mr Nene was present.  So I assumed 
10 
they had relationship with the national treasury and this 
was in the normal course of events.  But something was 
piquing my curiosity.  And so on the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I’m sorry.  What you were told about, 
about Mr Nene you were told by Mr Wood as well? 
DR FINE:  I was told by Mr Saga who attended that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FINE:  Event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that would have been when?  As far 
as you understood? 
20 
DR FINE:  My recollection is it would have been around 
late 2015 time frame. So maybe within that period.  Maybe 
October, September time frames. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
DR FINE:  I do have the date somewhere but I can’t … 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 229 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
DR FINE:  Recall the exact ...[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was the end of 2015. 
DR FINE:  I never attended so I don’t … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was towards the end of 2015.   
DR FINE:  It was towards the end of 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR FINE:  But there clearly was something nagging in my 
conscience and if one read the social media at the time 
there was a lot of speculation.  Particularly after Minister 
10 
Van Rooyen left in the Twitter feeds etcetera around the 
association between Mr Van Rooyen and the Guptas.   
And I had an occasion to be at a private function on 
the 23 r d of January 2016, and to be present with a senior 
person in national treasury.  And I asked the question 
about what was this experience with Mr Van Rooyen and 
his advisors.  And at some point I just asked plainly if Mr 
Bobat was in any way connected to the Guptas.   
It was at the end of the evening you know, we had 
all had a couple of drinks, but the answer was an 
20 
affirmative.  And that set off a very serious … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The answer was? 
DR FINE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
DR FINE:  The answer was yes.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 230 of 289 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the question had been whether Mr 
Bobat had been appointed as Mr Van Rooyen’s advisor? 
DR FINE:  The question I asked, no was more explicit.  I 
said, is Mr Bobat connected to the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, yes. 
DR FINE:  And the answer that I got back, was yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FINE:  And that worried me deeply. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was giving that answer? 
DR FINE:  It was a senior official of the national treasury 
10 
who I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR FINE:  Was with at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
DR FINE:  So shortly thereafter there was a partner 
meeting.  I was in the Ukraine at the time, because of my 
responsibilities, but I was on the telephone to discuss the 
– what was happening with Eskom and the potential 
partnership with Trillion, etcetera.   
And in that meeting I raised my concerns very 
20 
strongly and clearly that we needed to get an external due 
diligence firm to now investigate fully Regiments and 
Trillion and understand what was going on.  And this was 
actually agreed in that partner meeting.  And in fact that 
was enacted on the 18 t h of February 2016 when that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 231 of 289 
 
mandate was awarded to conduct that.   
Of course shortly afterwards on the 15 t h of February 
Africa Confidential published an article which stated at 
least with some flair full of confidence about the link 
between 
Mr 
Bobat 
and 
the 
Gupta 
family. 
 And 
so 
immediately on that day and in consultation with my 
colleagues, my colleagues and I instructed Mr Saga on 
behalf of McKinsey to write to Mr Wood was still the, 
despite the separation between Trillion and Regiments, it 
had not been fully effected, so he was still the primary 
10 
liaison to Regiments, to write to Mr Wood and seek 
clarification confirming Mr Bobat and what the relationship 
of Regiments was.   
And so at that point in time as I say Mr Wood was 
still forming Trillion and it was Regiments, and it was a 
little bit of a grey zone.  And that letter was sent.  Despite 
that and before we even had confirmation on the 18 t h of 
February we had a meeting of the Transnet client service 
team, the partners.   
And we raised these concerns and we decided 
20 
immediately even before the due diligence was concluded 
that we would terminate our relationship with Regiments.  
We obviously understood the consequences where that we 
may end our work at Transnet but we felt very strongly that 
we needed to do that.  And on the 22 n d of February we had 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 232 of 289 
 
a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  By the meeting of the 18 t h 
February … 
DR FINE:  Sorry, who was? 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the meeting of the 18 t h of February 
had Mr Wood responded to the letter that you had written 
to him? 
DR FINE:  Not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter mentioned in paragraph 69? 
DR FINE:  No, he had not responded yet. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Did he ever respond? 
DR FINE:  Yes.  I will get to that in a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright. 
DR FINE:  It’s rather unusual response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine.  Okay. 
DR FINE:  And but, but I think at that point in time we just 
had enough.  And what I said in parliament, it is not like 
Regiments 
had 
three 
strikes. 
 There 
was 
the 
2014 
Regiments issue with Mr Pillay and this matter and we just 
decided it was time to end this.   
20 
So we communicated this to Mr Peter in a telephone 
call that I had with Mr Saga as well, that we would be 
issuing a letter. And on the 23 r d of February we issued a 
letter which was very, very clear and when you have a 
moment, if you read it, it was also submitted to parliament 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 233 of 289 
 
which 
is 
clear 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
our 
termination 
of 
Regiments and for what reasons.  And very clear that we 
would not work with Trillion or consider them unless a very 
detailed due diligence was conducted.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So can I just intervene at this 
point?  Dr Fine because I do think it is important to 
emphasise Chair that this is the first recorded instance that 
we are aware of, of anyone terminating with Trillion or 
Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  On probity grounds.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So I have said it several times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it’s important, ja. 
DR FINE:  Thank you Chair.  And I also want to state that 
there was clearly, there was a lot of speculation in our 
decision making, but we felt we had sufficient information 
to make a decision.  We did get a response, interestingly 
on the 26 t h of February 2016.  It was received actually from 
Bianca Goodson had signed the letter.  It is on a Trillian 
20 
letterhead which is interesting.   
And it denies that Bobat has any relationship with 
Regiments, which was at odds with the social media search 
I had done on Bobat which still stated that he was part of 
Regiments at that point in time.  And as you heard in the 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 234 of 289 
 
evidence that was led this morning, it appears that Mr 
Bobat may not have been completely separated from 
Regiments at that time.   
So that reconfirmed not only the decision but 
further raised my personal concerns and issues, given the 
fact that there were inconsistencies.  We did then meet 
with Mr Ngonye and Mr Pillay.  I was present with Mr Segar 
and that was on the 17 t h of March.  The letter is 
memorialised as you will see attached.  It looks like quite a 
nice, it reads very nicely.   
10 
We did want to end and terminate this in an 
amicable manner so that there weren’t any second order 
consequences.  And there were contractual issues that had 
to be worked out and so the tone of that letter as you read 
it, does come across as amicable and that was the 
intention not to have you know massive issues because 
Regiments was, was known at the time for being quite 
litigious.   
And we were obviously concerned about that.  What 
I did subsequent to that meeting on the 18 t h of March 2016, 
20 
I initiated a comprehensive review of all McKinsey’s work 
at Transnet, with Regiments.  All of our work, which 
included how we were procured, whether the work that we 
delivered had impact.  And a full review of, of a very highly 
reputable external legal firm.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 235 of 289 
 
I 
did 
hand 
that 
over 
to 
our 
legal 
and 
risk 
colleagues.  And it was now legal and compliance matter.  
But I did follow up consistently with those colleagues to 
confirm that if they found any wrong doing it was reported 
to the relevant authorities.   
The intention of that review was to cover everything 
from – well I wasn’t a forensic auditor at the time, but what 
I subsequently learned it was a comprehensive review 
which would have included email reviews, diary searches, 
included interviews of all the people, reviews of all the 
10 
contracts, etcetera.  And that was in March 2016.  I also 
informed the Minister of finance that we had concerns with 
working with Regiments.   
And so we had a meeting with the national treasury 
on the 31 s t of May 2016.  I was joined by my colleague Mr 
Jorge De Vaux(?) who was the Africa Office Manager and 
responsible for all the Africa offices and Ms Nonfumela 
Magwenshu(?).  And at the meeting were the director 
general, Vuzile and the chief procurement officer Schalk 
Human and the minutes of that meeting are annexed for 
20 
your perusal.   
We were very clearly asked, did we receive the 
work.  Were we induced or was it a requirement that we 
would do the work if – would we get the work if we didn’t 
work with Regiments.  And we said we absolutely not, we 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 236 of 289 
 
were never forced in any way to do that.   
And were asked directly if we had evidence that 
Regiments was connected to the Guptas.  And at that point 
in time we did not.  And we stated as such.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You spoke about termination with 
Regiments.  Can you talk about termination with Trillion? 
DR FINE:  Yes.  By matter of context and as I’ve explained, 
we were looking for new supply development partners.  We 
were going to look at a number of them.  And one of the 
recommendations from Mr Saga had been we should 
10 
consider Trillion.  And Mr Woods business.   
However I had asked multiple times, well who is 
Trillion and who are these people that are going to be part 
– because it is Mr Wood, he’s a nice white guy, creating a 
black consultancy who are these owners, these black 
owners that he’s going to be building this, this firm with 
and there was no answer forthcoming.   
So eventually on my insistence and on behalf of 
McKinsey I together with Mr Saga attended a meeting with 
Mr Eric Wood.  It was held at Tussers, Melrose Arch on the 
20 
1 s t of March.  I had asked him directly who were the 
owners.  The only person he had offered previously was 
somebody called Max Jusep.   
I had asked people if anyone had heard of a Max 
Jusep and nobody knew a Max Jusep.  So I was curious 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 237 of 289 
 
who these other colleagues he was going to have around 
him.  And I asked flatly who they were.  And Mr Wood 
offered some names as you see them in paragraph 78.  He 
offered up Advocate Linda Makathini, Ms Jemimani, Mark 
Chipkin, Clim Angel and again a Mr Max Jusep.   
I was very concerned after he mentioned those 
names.  There was, there were rumours circulating on 
social media that Mr Mani in some ways was connected to 
the Guptas.  So this raised my concerns.  And so I 
immediately called up the external firm that was doing the 
10 
due diligence and asked them to include their names, 
these names as part of their due diligence so that we could 
review them.   
I then because of my own personal concerns Chair 
started to investigate matters a little bit on my own.  I 
looked through the CIPC database over a weekend to try 
and find Trillions and there were numerous of these 
Trillions and I went through each single one of them 
looking at the directors and googling the directors to see 
who they might be.   
20 
And what I found in one of them was a Mr Salim 
Essa.  And in another was a Mr Eric Wood.  And the CIPC 
data searches are actually annexed for you.  But that 
obviously made a direct connection now between Trillion 
and Mr Essa.  Secondly, with my rather naïve investigative 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 238 of 289 
 
skills I went on face book which I am a member on, and I 
looked up a Salim Essa and the page came up and lo and 
behold on the page was a Mr Max Jusep.   
So I took a picture of that which is annexed for you 
as well, which concerned me.  In fact I provided and 
forwarded this particular face book picture to Mr Saga 
directly and he never responded to it.  The third thing is, I 
looked up Mr Max Jusep on all my social media platforms I 
was member of, and in Linkdn I found a Mr Max Jusep.   
I do not know if it is the same Max Jusep, but in the 
10 
Max Jusep was a Mr Vikas Sagar.  And so – and that’s also 
attached in the annexures.  And so I was deeply, deeply 
worried.  I immediately provided this to McKinsey’s legal 
counsel and the external firm that we were using, the two 
external firms.   
As a consequence I had clearly for myself, whether 
this was immediate and direct evidence or not, convinced 
myself that Trillion in some ways was directly connected to 
Mr Essa and as a consequence to the Guptas.  There was 
a meeting on the 14 t h of March which my colleague Mr 
20 
Mizalla(?) chaired.   
I attended in my capacity as leader of the public 
sector in the Ema region as I explained earlier.  The due 
diligence report was offered including the inputs that I had 
provided, which showed this link.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 239 of 289 
 
I made a very strong recommendation that we 
should terminate and McKinsey terminated that relationship 
which is memorialised in the correspondence that you’ll 
see in the annexures and obviously also bares Mr Mizalla’s 
signature.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thanks Mr Fine, we’re a little bit 
short of time.  So I think what I would want to do is leave 
reflections and lessons learned and maybe just refer the 
Chair to your statement to parliament at page 239 to 241.  
But maybe talk about the 1064 locomotive project, because 
10 
that is a particular interest to us.  So can I ask you to go 
page 221 of your statement?   
DR FINE:  Yes, and in order to avoid the lessons learned 
Chair perhaps just to say that Mr Mizalla lead that process.  
Personally it was an excellent process.  I participated in it 
and I think that the process and procedures that were 
recommended would absolutely avoid these kinds of issues 
from occurring again.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You said we should go to 220? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  221 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  221. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is where we will deal with the 
1064. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you take us through your 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 240 of 289 
 
statement from paragraph 92.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Chaskalson, just in case – I do not 
remember whether you, you asked him to confirm that the 
contents are correct, so that they are under oath even if 
we do not touch on them.  Did you ...[indistinct]? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We have.  Both, both, this 
statement and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other one. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The parliamentary statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you. 
DR FINE:  And Chair for your comfort there, parliamentary 
statement was also given under oath, formal oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja, okay, alright.  Yes you may 
continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So Mr Fine can you go to page 
221? 
DR FINE:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Paragraph 92. 
DR FINE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Which takes you in, we are leaving 
aside the procure – the appointment to the 22 – to the 1064 
… 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Contract and the juggling of the or 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 241 of 289 
 
the removal of Letsema and Nedbank.  But there you talk 
about what your role as McKinsey embraced in relation to 
that appointment.   
DR FINE:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the two phases. 
DR FINE:  So Chair let me first start by saying that I was 
not directly involved in this project.  I – except for being 
involved in the discussion on the withdrawal predominantly.  
The reason was as I explained before that projects related 
to freight rail were not projects which I could easily 
10 
participate in.   
And so what I give you are the key facts.  But also 
in preparation for parliament and obviously because of the 
issues that have been in the press, I read that business 
case extremely carefully, applied my mind to it to try and 
understand what had actually happened.  And so you know 
the reflections aside from the withdrawal which I can talk 
about from my own personal experience, I am giving you 
McKinsey’s view.   
There were a couple of key points I just want to 
20 
stress upfront.  McKinsey predominantly was involved in 
the business case and that business case did confirm 
Transnet’s numbers of 38,6 billion including and to be 
precise 
including 
foreign 
exchanged 
and 
including 
escalations.   
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 242 of 289 
 
I was not aware what the 38,6 would have had at 
that point in time, but subsequently and having reviewed 
the business case I was concerned there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So just to tie that back to some 
evidence we have had from Mr Ramo Sabudi(?), built into 
that 38,6 billion price, was the cost of forex hedging? 
DR FINE:  Absolutely, it is built in what was called the 
funding costs, but the hedging costs and the escalations, 
both 
the 
Rand 
escalations 
and 
the 
Dollar 
based 
escalations 
were 
included 
and 
in 
my 
parliamentary 
10 
statement and annexure I refer specifically to the elements 
in the business case where that is actually explicitly 
stated. 
 
The second thing I just want to confirm before I go 
through the paragraphs is that McKinsey did withdraw from 
his project before the award was given.  So at the time it 
was 38.6 the award was given at a number which was 
greater and…[intervene]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry can I just clarify that at 
the point that McKinsey withdrew which is 4 February 2014 
20 
the price at which McKinsey withdrew was still 38.6?  
DR FINE:   Including…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Including inflationary cost and 
Rands and Dollars.  
DR FINE:   Yes, correct Chair.  So now let me just go 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 243 of 289 
 
through the project to help you understand the process.  
So the first part – the project was divided into two phases 
the first was what was called the business validation 
phase.   
There had been numerous issues that had been 
raised as I understand it by the board and the public 
enterprises that the quality of business case was not 
sufficient in order for approval.  For example, it did not 
include what the benefits to South Africa would be as a 
consequence phase one was a process by which McKinsey 
10 
was verifying the assumptions within the business case 
Transnet had developed and improving the quality that 
would have been looking at issues like the volume 
projections, the kinds of locomotives they needed for those 
commodities we had experts etcetera, etcetera in order to 
do that.  That was concluded in about April 2013 and then 
within a short period of time Transnet was…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I am going to take you back 
just for a second.  McKinsey withdrew in February of which 
year?  
20 
DR FINE:   2014 I am coming to the withdrawal.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I was making a note here I just 
wanted to make sure.  
DR FINE:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I got the right, okay continue.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 244 of 289 
 
DR FINE:   So I am in 2013 so McKinsey concludes the 
business case work in April 2013 and Transnet was then 
supposed to do two things.  One get the relevant Board 
and DP approvals to proceed to issue a tender which was 
the second part which was to prequalify bidders.   
That was supposed to be concluded by September 
2013 but that dragged on and so what happened was the 
phase two which is where the procurement process was 
supposed to happen instead of it starting in September, 
October 2013 started in January 2014.  The key issues 
10 
there that I just want to highlight is that Transnet indicated 
to us that this had to be concluded in an extremely short 
timeframe.   
Apparently in the way in which the tender was 
issued although this is not my recollection the project 
needed to be concluded, the awards had to be concluded 
in a certain timeframe otherwise they had to reissue the 
tender which would cause further delays and so within a 
very tight timeframe of six weeks they expected us to 
provide this procurement advise.   
20 
We were concerned about this, this is a very large 
transaction, 
a 
very 
complicated 
transaction 
and 
the 
timeframe was very, very short.  So we wrote to Transnet 
to say we had these concerns we might consider doing it 
but we would immediately need access to the following set 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 245 of 289 
 
of information.   
I think that letter was sent on the 31 s t of January, 
the information was not forthcoming and we had a very 
active discussion within McKinsey on what to do and we 
decided that we would withdraw our portion of the work on 
this locomotive procurement event because there was no 
way in the timeframe we were going to be able to add 
value.  Some of the factors which were involved included 
issues like they had already agreed for providers.  They 
had already agreed best and final offers so it was very 
10 
difficult to negotiate and make adjustments. They had 
agreed many of the specifications so it is very difficult in a 
short timeframe and as well once things have already been 
agreed to add value.                    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just take you to your 
withdrawn memo for February which is at page 731 
because I want to make a very specific point there.    
DR FINE:   One moment, yes 721 or 731? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry the point that I want to 
make is at 731 it is in the middle of the withdrawal memo.  
20 
You just said that they had already agreed prices but the 
point that is made at the first bullet point of your 
withdrawals memo at 731.  You have got 731? 
DR FINE:   About to get there, apology.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Is that the prices of the best and 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 246 of 289 
 
final offer you say current pricing proposals are already 
below business case benchmark levels.  
DR FINE:   So Chair this is a very important consideration 
for the Commission and in the workmen’s report there is a 
memo which is not part of my submission but I can provide 
but it is available in the Commission’s records which is the 
memo from I think it is the 22 n d of May if my memory is 
correct from Mr Molefe to the Board to explain the increase 
in price from 38.6 to 54 and if my recollection is correct at 
least based on press articles this was probably supported 
10 
by Regiments in terms of the preparation of that memo.  
What is important and what I shared with the Commission 
previously with advocate Pretorius and Mr Swarts and I 
think this was in about October 2018 was that when you 
look at that memo it starts off at the best and final offer for 
a locomotive of around R30billion when you add all the 
locomotives together.   
I think that was the McKinsey business case number 
I think their number was about R29billion.  That is if you 
take the number of locomotives and you multiply by the 
20 
price you get in their case to R29billion if my memory 
serves me correctly and in McKinsey original business 
case or review case it was about R30billion.   
Then what happens is on top of that in order to 
justify the increase in what they call the ETC to R54billion 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 247 of 289 
 
is a whole lot of adjustments.  It includes the issue of 
Forex which we have talked about before.  It talks about 
the fact that…[intervene]    
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry you have lived this and I 
have sort of lived it for a couple of years but I think the 
key point there is that you then add a Forex cost which is 
already incorporated in the original business cost.  So you 
double charging, is that correct? 
DR FINE:   Well let me just for precisions so that we do not 
– so if you took the McKinsey business case number and 
10 
you added the Forex and the escalation you get to 38.6.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes.  
DR FINE:   If you take the R29billion that is in that memo 
and 
you 
add 
the 
Forex 
escalation, 
the 
Forex, 
the 
escalations they then talk about changes because of 
timeframes they add changes and specifications a whole 
lot of factors that are extraneous to the price of the 
locomotive the best and final offer you get to 58.4 and I 
provided these calculations to the Commission where we 
compare our calculations from that business case those 
20 
memo calculations and then MNS, Fundudzi etcetera I am 
happy to provide it again.   
But in essence what this memorandum is telling you 
is that the escalations were not in what I would call a price 
of a locomotive or the anticipated price of a locomotive.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 248 of 289 
 
The escalations are in terms of a whole lot of extraneous 
factors which in many cases are impossible to explain.  In 
fact, they are not explainable.       
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask just because we not 
going to see you again can I ask that you furnish a 
supplementary affidavit just covering that memorandum 
and going through it we should really have canvassed it 
with you today because it is such a critical point.     
DR FINE:   I am happy to do so Chair.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So…[intervene] 
10 
DR FINE:   It may be a brief supplementary statement with 
some calculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that?  
DR FINE:   I said I am happy to do so Chair it may be a 
brief supplementary statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ja okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So you withdraw on 4 February 
2014.   
DR FINE:   Correct.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this escalation to R54million 
20 
certainly there is an escalation to R52million that the 
BADC approves already in March and by sometime in 
March Transnet is issuing press statements that it has now 
concluded 
its 
biggest 
procurement 
ever 
for 
these 
locomotives at R50billion, were you aware of those press 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 249 of 289 
 
statements?  
DR FINE:   So just to confirm that our dates are the same 
my recollection is that on the 4 t h of February we withdrew 
on the 17 t h of March the press statement is issued by 
Transnet saying that they have acquired locomotives for 
R50billion but sorry on the 4 t h of March, the 4 t h of February 
2014 we withdraw from the project.   
On the 21 s t of February I was asked to sign the 
locomotive contract and having questions on that my 
recollection is that there had been a negotiation process 
10 
happening 
between 
Transnet 
and 
McKinsey 
in 
2013 
between their legal people and our legal people and a Mr 
Ashwin Salagar. The contract had not been signed we have 
obviously withdrawn from our work that needed to be 
finalised and so on the 21 s t of February I signed that 
contract it was witnessed by our general counsel and I 
dated it on the date of the 21 s t of February when I signed 
it.  On the 17 t h of March the Transnet issues…[intervene]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Mr Fine can I take you 
back a little bit because you withdrew on the 4 t h also on 
20 
the 4 t h are you aware of a document in which Eric Wood 
purports on behalf of Regiments to amend a contract which 
has not yet been signed by McKinsey in relation to the 
1064 locomotives.   
DR FINE:   I am not aware of that but I am aware of a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 250 of 289 
 
document which I think it was in Mr Mohammed’s statement 
which shows that Regiments was negotiating to assume 
control of this contract in January 2014 when McKinsey 
had not even yet withdrawn.   
So I was very concerned when I saw that because 
obviously 
that 
implied 
that 
there 
was 
a 
set 
of 
conversations 
happening 
with 
Regiments 
that 
were 
unbeknown to McKinsey who were still the owners of the 
contract and had still not yet made the decision to 
withdraw from that work.  So I am not aware of the 
10 
document 
you 
referred 
to 
but 
I 
am 
aware 
of 
Mr 
Mohammed’s statement.       
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I refer you to an annexure 
to Mr Mieszala’s statement at page 58 to 59 of the bundle 
it is actually McKinsey’s response to the Fundudzi report. 
DR FINE:   I do not have that documentation with me but 
Chair I would be happy to…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There should be a copy – if you 
look for…[intervene] 
DR FINE:   Ah behind me.

ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In fact it will be in the same file 
as yours.  It is in the same file as yours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one in front of you I guess.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 7.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no on your desk.

ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Dr Fine just to your left.  
DR FINE:   This bundle says Bundle 7.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes that is good.  
DR FINE:   Exhibit BV6 Mieszala, is that correct? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That should be good yes.  If you 
go to page 58 of that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it Bundle 7?   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 7, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, you said he must go to what 
page? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   58.  
DR FINE:   58.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we should have had the 
actual document to show you but you will see there this is 
a response of McKinsey to one of the two the Fundudzi 
report, and if you look under paragraph [c] Inaccurate 
Recounting of parties to relevant contracts:    
“In the draft report there was significant confusion 
about who was party to certain contract addendums.  
While some such areas were corrected in the report 
20 
several of these areas regrettably remain.   Most 
notably the report fails to accurately note that an 
addendum to the 1064 advisory services contract 
was signed in February 2014 by Transnet through 
Anoj Singh and Regiments through Eric Wood in his 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 252 of 289 
 
capacity as a Regiments director.  Contrary to the 
description in the report McKinsey was not a party 
to this addendum and had no involvement in it.  Mr 
Wood has never been a McKinsey employee and his 
signature does not in any way purport to be on 
behalf of McKinsey.” 
The report says the following about the parties to this 
addendum.  Addendum to McKinsey agreement dated 
February 2014: 
“We 
determined 
that 
Transnet 
and 
McKinsey 
10 
represented by Singh and Wood concluded an 
addendum on 4 February 2014 referred to as the 
third 
addendum 
in 
respect 
of 
1064 
advisory 
services, Annexure D24.  It determined that Wood 
was a representative of Regiments, not McKinsey at 
the time of signing the addendum.  We further 
determined that McKinsey’s name was cancelled out 
and replaced by Regiments name next to Wood’s 
signature. 
 
 
According 
to 
the 
addendum 
the 
signature warranted that Wood was duly authorised 
20 
to sign the third addendum   Singh and Wood 
initialled 
their 
signatures 
next 
to 
the 
said 
cancellation.   Based on the said findings Wood 
signed McKinsey’s addendum whilst he was a 
Regiments representative.” 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 253 of 289 
 
Were you aware of that document, does it ring a bell? 
DR FINE:   It does not ring a bell. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay well we will then introduce 
the document another way, but there is another document 
that I would like to refer you to, and if you stay in the same 
bundle and go to page 758. 
CHAIRPERSON:   678? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   758. 
CHAIRPERSON:   758. 
DR FINE:   Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this is a document dated 16 
April 2014, it is signed by Vickas Sagar and it purports 
retrospectively to cede all of McKinsey’s rights under the 
1064 locomotives appointment from which McKinsey on 4 
February it purports to cede those on 5 February to 
Regiments, are you aware of this document? 
DR FINE:   Chair I have become aware of this document, 
as I was preparing both for this Commission and previously 
I honestly when I read this letter I don’t understand it, I am 
not a lawyer but when I read this letter it is a confusing 
20 
letter.   I can only say the following, McKinsey withdraws 
from the work because it doesn’t believe it can add value.  
There is a  memorandum which I have annexed for you 
where – which Transnet has an internal document on the 
16 t h of April where they have actually decided and they 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 254 of 289 
 
memorialised what happened after McKinsey’s withdrawal 
from a technical perspective.    
 
They still needed to conclude their negotiation, that 
still required certain pieces of work to be concluded, first 
they needed a negotiating team, second they needed 
lawyers to conclude the contracts and thirdly the work 
which was originally envisaged which was the funding 
strategy still needed to be completed. 
 
So as McKinsey removes itself from the work and as 
the prime contractor of course this work has to continue 
10 
because it is urgent, it has to be concluded, so it is not a 
huge concern to me that let me call it the contract is 
transferred to somebody else. 
 
Having said that – and by the way sorry to 
illustrate, Transnet assumes the role of the negotiating 
team and it deploys Mr Gama, Mr Vallyhoo, Mr Singh and 
Mr Peter to be the primary negotiators of this contract.   
My recollection is this negotiation actually happens at 
Weber Wentzel’s offices, it is recorded and actually in the 
17 t h of April press release there is extensive descriptions 
20 
around how much corporate governance and internal audit 
controls they put around this to make sure there was 
nothing wrong with it. 
 
I cannot however explain this particular letter, I 
haven’t seen – I wasn’t part of drafting the letter and it 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 255 of 289 
 
doesn’t – it is not entirely obvious to me for example 
there’s statements in here that say that the work related to 
and in respect of the mandate was conducted by Regiments 
Capital and not McKinsey Incorporated is the last line in 
that letter.   I don’t understand what that honestly means 
and I was not part of drafting or part of that process. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But what we do have is we have 
Regiments in January trying to take the place of McKinsey, 
before McKinsey has even decided to withdraw.  We then 
have – I mean you haven’t seen it but we have a strange 
10 
document where Wood purports to amend the agreement on 
the day that Regiment withdraws which – sorry that 
McKinsey withdraws which is 5 February, sorry 4 February, 
4 February, and then we have an expo poste facto letter 
from Sagar saying that with effect from 5 February 
everything was ceded to Regiments. 
DR FINE:   So Chair the only thing I can say is that I think 
it is important that people like Mr Wood and Mr Singh and 
Mr Sagar should come and account for the many issues 
that I think have been identified as part of the evidence 
20 
that you have collected and that you have led.  I cannot 
explain all these elements because I wasn’t part of them.  I 
– you know when the 50billion number was announced first 
I wasn’t sure what was in the 38.6billion at that time 
because I was not privy to that whole process. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 256 of 289 
 
 
Secondly because McKinsey had withdrawn we 
weren’t privy to what was included in the 50billion and in 
these kinds of contracts all sorts of things can be included.   
First of all the timeframe changed, a number of bidders 
changed, it could have included maintenance and services 
which can be up to 30, 20/30% of a contract award, so 
there are many, many factors that could have been 
included in the 50billion which was not obvious to me at 
that time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   When did you find out what was 
10 
included in the 50billion or the 54billion? 
DR FINE:   So Chair my preparation for Parliament 
because there had been so much in the news I applied 
myself to reading their business case in a great amount of 
details and trying to understand and distil what were the 
key recommendations.   The key recommendations which 
are in my submission are very clear, they talk about the 
38.6 including escalations and including foreign exchange.  
They are very clear in saying that Transnet would negotiate 
a flexible arrangement because volumes go up and down 
20 
and it is a very sensitive driver of the overall costs.   
 
It does say you need 1064 locomotives but it says 
you may need them in five years, you may need them in 
seven, you may need them in nine years and you should 
therefore have this flexibility built in and there are a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 257 of 289 
 
number of recommendations that are in there and that is 
the timeframe at which I applied myself to the business 
case 
issue 
and 
obviously 
identified 
the 
severe 
discrepancies between what I would call the 38.6 number 
and the 54. 
 
Now you could say why – what figure that – what 
figure that was that when I first read the business case, 
and in the executive summary there is a line at the end 
that says 38.6billion excluding all these factors and yet 
when I read the business case it was very clear that the 
10 
business 
case 
included 
all 
those 
factors, 
and 
that 
obviously triggered by curiosity and my investigations into 
the matter. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Did you or anybody else at 
McKinsey interrogate the 50 or 54billion figure back in 
2014? 
DR FINE:   Not that I can recall but prior to my appearance 
in 
Parliament 
I 
did 
call 
a 
number 
of 
ex-McKinsey 
colleagues who were part of that project to try and 
understand that specific line in the business case and none 
20 
of them could recall that particular line and how it was 
introduced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you able when you applied your 
mind to that business case or was it a subsequent 
memorandum that added that line, were you able to come 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 258 of 289 
 
to any conclusion based on whatever enquiries you may 
have made on what the chances are that the author knew 
that these other costs were included in the business case 
but may have deliberately decided to write their memo on 
the basis of – or business case memo on the basis that 
that had not been included or is that something that you 
could not determine when you applied your mind? 
DR FINE:   I could not determine that Chair, but it is – I am 
absolutely certain and I refer to it in my Parliamentary 
statement and annexure where to find it in the business 
10 
case, that the effects of inflation and foreign exchange 
were absolutely included in the number so that even if – 
even if let me call it that was an error a board member or 
executive of Transnet who had applied themselves or for 
that matter an official in the public enterprises who applied 
themselves and probably read that document should have 
been under no illusion whatsoever, it is very clear that 
those factors are included. 
 
I would also say that what is unusual about the May 
2014 memo to the Board which explains escalation is the 
20 
basis for all the escalations is that particular line in the 
business case, but I have to leave it to you to find the 
evidence to determine that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I would imagine that certainly 
when this became an issue whether this clause had been 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 259 of 289 
 
included or had not been included whoever had written that 
line would have gone back to starting the previous 
documentation and the business case and should then 
have been able to see that these had been included or 
would you not be able to say that? 
MR FINE:   Chair all the people that I spoke to had already 
left McKinsey and so the access to the information and 
what they were part of had been lost and this was in 
November 2017 when I spoke to them and obviously the 
work was conducted in let’s call it between January and 
10 
April 2013, so it is a long period of time and there weren’t 
the records that were present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I take you to what you said 
about this in your statement to Parliament.  Can you go to 
page 259 of Bundle 7. 
DR FINE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the last paragraph on that 
page when we heard about the 54billion price change 
...[intervenes]  
20 
DR FINE:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We did ask questions as to why 
the number and timeframe was different and the answer we 
got back from Mr Singh and Mr Peter I think – I think it was 
Mr Peter at the time, was that they had a different view on 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 260 of 289 
 
the inflation and on the hedging and on the contractual 
terms 
and 
therefore 
they 
negotiated 
a 
different 
arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Sorry, 
you 
are 
reading 
from 
whereabouts, at page 259? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The very last paragraph on the 
page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Does that ring a bell? 
DR FINE:   It rings a bell. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Who is the we you are talking 
about and when does this happen?   
DR FINE:   So my – well it is not my recollection because I 
went back and I reviewed the documentation that was 
available to me, and what I have is the following sequence 
of events Chair.   So the – and Transnet announces that a 
R50billion locomotive transaction on the 17 t h of March 
2014, Vickas Sagar has a meeting with Mr Singh on the 
24 t h of March 2014, he has this meeting alone and he 
reports back to McKinsey that you know there is a need for 
20 
this capital re-base lining process to happen because of 
the variety of these urgent financial issues and the 
locomotive transaction. 
 
On 
the 
Friday 
the 
28 t h 
of 
March 
I 
have 
...[intervenes]  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 261 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, can I just stop you there, 
is that Sagar report to McKinsey documented anywhere, 
after the meeting with Singh? 
DR FINE:   In an email yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay, it would be good if we 
could get a copy of that email. 
DR FINE:   Then my understanding is that in one of these 
Friday Steering Committee meetings that we had shortly 
after that, because there was this regular meeting to 
ensure governance of the projects, that the issues were 
10 
ventilated and discussed, including you know the urgency 
around the financial – you know at least that is to the best 
of recollection.  And of course the number the R50 billion 
would have been factored into that.  So when I say we which 
is to your question it would have been to we as in a group of 
people sitting around a table and saying in the context of 
this transaction there are serious issues and when the 
question and I honestly the – you know now we are talking 
about a substantial period of time even between when I 
wrote this Parliamentary statement but to the best of my 
20 
recollection when we asked well this – how does this fit and 
how does this work?  This was the answer that was provided 
at the time.  I did not have any reason to doubt it.  As I said I 
did not even at that time know what was included in the 38.6 
number. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 262 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But there would have been people 
around the table. 
DR FINE:  There would have been people. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Who did know what was included 
in the 38.6 both from Transnet’s side and from McKinsey’s 
side. 
DR FINE:  There may have been people around the table I 
cannot recall who would have been in that meeting but 
certainly you know there – the constituent members of the 
client service team including Mr Sagar potentially Mr Door, 
10 
myself and others but honestly I am now starting to try and 
recall something from a very, very long period of time ago 
where you know my recollection is the key issue was the 
financial distress and not specifically the debate – a debate 
and discussion on the R50 billion. 
 
The second thing that is important is McKinsey would 
not have had access to the details of that because we had 
withdrawn from the project.  And so we had no transparency 
into how that R50 billion would have been determined at 
least that is to the best of my recollection Chair. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But what I understand from your 
Parliamentary statement is that the issue of the escalation 
from 38 to 54 billion which is a figure you used there was 
discussed with and you say Singh or Peter around that time 
and an explanation was given? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 263 of 289 
 
DR FINE:  So Chair to the best of my recollection when the 
question was asked about the 50 billion in a very superficial 
manner the answer that was provided was this is due to a 
variety of escalations and factors which could have also 
included things like changing specifications etcetera.   
 
To the best of my recollection there was no level of – 
it was not specified and as I have said already there are 
many, many factors that could have been included including 
maintenance and services contracts and all kinds of things 
which could easily for example if you – a maintenance 
10 
contract on a locomotive that you buy as a service could be 
20% of the purchase price or 20 to 30% and so to the best of 
my recollection this did not trigger an immediate issue or 
concern for me. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  What you told Parliament was 
something slightly different and I think it is quite important 
that we go back to what you told Parliament because it was 
at least closer in time. 
 
First you say when we heard about the 54 billion 
price change so it is 54 billion we did ask questions to why 
20 
the number and timeframe was different and the answer we 
got back from Mr Singh and Mr Peter – I think it was Mr 
Peter at the time was that they had a different view on the 
inflation and on the hedging.  So it is back to inflation and 
hedging and on the contractor therefore they negotiated a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 264 of 289 
 
different arrangement. 
 
Would you accept that what you told Parliament is 
likely to be more accurate because it was at least two years 
closer to the event? 
DR FINE:  It is likely to have been more accurate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because it does seem to me that 
something very worrying went down in that month of – from 
the 5 February or the six weeks from the 5 February to the 
end of March2014.  I am not suggesting that McKinsey was 
responsible for it.  You left at a point at which you could not 
10 
add value to a business case of 38.6 billion and six weeks 
later 38.6 billion had become 54 billion maybe the value 
could not be added but it seems that value could have been 
destroyed.  Do you have a comment on that? 
DR FINE:  So as I said Chair it is hard to determine what 
was in that number.  I think the more worrying issue for me 
when I read this now is when Nedbank withdraw as our 
consortia member in fact they informed Transnet and for 
McKinsey because they wanted to be involved in the 
downstream funding of the locomotives.  They describe that 
20 
as a potential conflict of interest and therefore they needed 
to withdraw from the consortia.   
 
I think the question that I am left with which is 
actually leads back to the question of the funding process is 
that Regiments when you look subsequently for what they 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 265 of 289 
 
have been paid for and what is in the public domain did 
exactly what Nedbank said was a conflict of interest which 
was to be part of the whole funding – fundraising and 
funding process. 
 
I cannot answer the question about exactly how the 
50 and how it was you know uniquely described at that time 
except to say that having analysed it it is clear that the 
arguments that are presented in May are incorrect.  And I 
can absolutely say that if Nedbank had a conflict of interest 
and withdrew from our consortia and Regiments assumed 
10 
that role and then proceeded subsequent to February 4 to 
continue to do exactly what Nedbank and Transnet had said 
was a conflict of interest and where by the way a lot of the 
issues also reside in the swops and derivatives etcetera that 
is where the commission reply themselves and that is – but I 
think there are other people who should talk to that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We certainly will. 
DR FINE:  And I have noticed you have. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
But 
it 
– 
what 
was 
your 
understanding of the role and when I say – or first let me ask 
20 
about – you were not hands on in relation to this contract as 
I understand it. 
DR FINE:  I was not involved in any way with the contract 
except for the discussion on the termination meaning – not 
the termination the withdrawal of McKinsey’s work on the 4 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 266 of 289 
 
February. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right.  So we would have to speak 
to somebody else at McKinsey to find out what McKinsey 
understood the role of Regiments to be after Regiments 
apparently stepped in to take session of the contract from 
which McKinsey had withdrawn. 
DR FINE:  And my understanding which I put in my statement 
Chair is that there were essentially these three pieces of 
work in phase 2 which was supposed to be concluded during 
the procurement phase.  There was the negotiation, there 
10 
was the funding strategy and there was the legal support. 
 
When you read the subsequent memos that have 
been made publicly available it is clear that Transnet 
assumed the role of procurement in place of McKinsey.  
Regiments continued to provide its funding advice – the 
funding strategy and Weber Wentzel continued to provide the 
legal advice. 
 
How it was determined that Regiments instead of 
Webber Wentzel for example should have had the contract 
moved to them or transferred to them I cannot answer 
20 
because I was not part of that set of discussions or 
determinations. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But Regiments also appear to have 
been involved in helping the board motivate and explain the 
escalation from 38 to 54. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 267 of 289 
 
DR FINE:  I think Regiments seems to have been very 
involved 
in 
negotiating 
a 
contract 
outside 
McKinsey’s 
purview 
in 
being 
involved 
in 
a 
whole 
lot 
of 
other 
conversations but I think is for Regiments to come and 
explain. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes but earlier you testified about 
a memorandum on which Regiments apparently assisted 
Brian Molefe to justify the 50 – the increase to 54. 
DR FINE:  Correct and that is a memo of May 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And when did you find out about 
10 
Regiments role in that memo? 
DR FINE:  Oh only when the Werksmans Report was 
published and released. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay. 
DR FINE:  It was probably in 2018 if my memory serves me 
correctly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am just acutely aware of time at 
this point.  Can I – can we maybe leave this topic and just go 
to the issue of sole source procurement and can we go back 
to your – to your statement and page 198?   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 7? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 7.   
CHAIRPERSON:  198?  What – the page is 198? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 268 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And let us start with swat 1 on – at 
the top of 198 paragraph 28.3.  Now as I understand it swat 
1 
was 
confined 
to 
the 
McKinsey/Regiments 
Letsema 
consortium on 19 October 2012, does that ring a bell to you? 
DR FINE:  So Chair my understanding of swat 1 is different.  
Swat 1 was originally issued as a tender open tender which 
McKinsey applied for and actually won.  It was a competitive 
tender. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I just stop you there.  I mean 
McKinsey did win but the terms of the award were a joint 
10 
award to McKinsey and Deloittes is that not correct? 
DR FINE:  Chair if I can finish and I agree with where the 
evidence leader is going.  My understanding at the time is 
that Transnet determined that McKinsey had won but wanted 
to award it to McKinsey and Deloittes and was looking for 
McKinsey to cooperate with Deloittes. 
 
At that time we had severe concerns about working in 
that manner because we had had an experience where 
intellectual property from McKinsey had ended up with other 
advisers and in particular with Deloittes.  And so we 
20 
informed Transnet that we were not comfortable with that 
arrangement. 
 
My understanding is as a consequence Transnet 
withdrew the award and then issued it as a confinement to 
McKinsey and I can only assume that this is on the basis 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 269 of 289 
 
that we had legitimately won something and that the way in 
which they wanted to construct was not acceptable. 
 
At least that is my recollection of events at that time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay well – what we have seen in 
the meantime is that before the award of this tender an email 
had been sent from Eric Wood to Salim Essa indicating that 
this specific tender was one in which Salim Essa was going 
to place Regiments with McKinsey at Transnet.  That email I 
think was in a full month before the confinement award to 
McKinsey and it was in September. 
10 
 
But that is the first confinement award to McKinsey at 
Transnet over this period, that is correct is it not? 
DR FINE:  That is my recollection and because of these 
specific circumstances. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now we go down and … 
DR FINE:  Sorry I am not sure where we going down to. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry to page 201 paragraph 33.1. 
DR FINE:  Okay.  Yup. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  This is swat 2.  That confinement 
as I understand it – that was also an award by confinement 
20 
in October 2013. 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we go down again we get to 
NNPP we get to the four – the four awards that you have 
discussed. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 270 of 289 
 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  NNPP, confinement, the final 
memorandums 3 April 2014.  Coal line the confinement 1 
April 2014.  A gas fuel strategy you did not bid with.  It was a 
competitive tender but you did not bid with Regiments you 
bid without Regiments. 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The – sorry we have slipped – we 
had NNPP, coal line, Kumba iron ore. 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Another confinement. 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And manganese also another 
confinement.  I think manganese may have come a page 
earlier. 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  All around end of March beginning 
of April 2014.  Then we have GFB which you have discussed 
already and that was another confinement except this time 
Regiments was identified as the – as the primary party and 
20 
McKinsey was the sub-contractor.  
 
So on my reckoning what we have got is seven 
confined contracts all of them awarded to by confinement to 
McKinsey and Regiments in a period of less than eighteen 
months.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 271 of 289 
 
 
Now you have offered some explanation for that – 
that scenario but can I ask you have you ever previously or 
subsequently in a South African context come across as 
many 
contracts awarded by 
confinement to the same 
consortium in an eighteen month period? 
DR FINE:  Chair as I explained earlier the basis of 
confinement is not McKinsey’s determination.  This is 
Transnet’s determination. 
 
And 
I 
want 
to 
start 
on 
that 
basis 
and 
my 
understanding is that Transnet had proper governance 
10 
processes in place and that these contracts were signed off 
by the procurement governance.  In addition in our review 
with Transnet which we conducted we asked them if they had 
found any irregularities and in our external review with our 
external legal advisors … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but bear in mind the question Dr Fine. 
DR FINE:  The question is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is a factual one. 
DR FINE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you have come across in an 
20 
instances 
where 
so 
many 
contracts 
are 
awarded 
on 
confinement to the same consortium in the South African 
context. 
DR FINE:  Well if I think about the Vulindlela work that 
McKinsey did at Transnet there was a RFP process that was 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 272 of 289 
 
run.  I do not remember it being an open public tender so 
that was confined in some process and McKinsey ended up 
concluding a very important contract and I think which was 
approved by the board.  So I could argue that between that 
period of time that there were multiple projects happening 
simultaneously between 2005 and 2009.  I am not aware to 
answer the question specially though. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think the question was even much 
more narrower within an eighteen – eighteen month period 
Mr Chaskalson? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Eighteen months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it – the period – the question was 
whether within the South African context you had ever come 
across a scenario where an entity gives the consortium so 
many contracts on confinement factually? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I take it a step further 
because it is not just confinement it is actually confinement 
and sole source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because sometimes you can have 
20 
a confinement arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Where there is – are one or two 
competing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 273 of 289 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Extra parties but this was 
confinement award to a single consortium and each time. 
DR FINE:  I am not aware in the South African context but I 
have seen this happen elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You see I want to put to you and I 
appreciate we are looking at this all with the benefit of 
hindsight knowing what went wrong inside Transnet.  That 
this is such an extraordinary sequence of events that this 
may well have been – this ought to have been perceived as 
10 
some sort of warning sign at the time.  Seven contracts by 
confinement same consortium eighteen months.  Do you 
have a response to that? 
DR FINE:  Yes Chair I do as I have said I think there was a 
serious financial risk that Transnet was facing and it seemed 
urgent and serious to me and my colleagues and we work 
with clients around the world on serious and urgent matters 
and in some cases they do confine matters.  Having said that 
as Mr Mieszala has discussed and of course one of the key 
learnings was did we get the requisite assurances from 
20 
Transnet in writing that the way in which they had actually 
gone about this had included all the requisite approvals 
etcetera.  As I said it is not – while you may find it unusual it 
is not McKinsey’s determination whether or not McKinsey’s 
help is needed nor that McKinsey – it is Transnet’s 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 274 of 289 
 
determination and as I said this was urgent.   
 
The important timing I just want to emphasise 
because I think – I think that there are two other factors 
which I think matter here.  The first is that the financial year 
for Transnet starts in February – oh sorry in April 2014 and 
ends in May 2015.  
 
Many of these let me call it awards are awarded in 
April 2014.  The reason for that was that so that the benefits 
could arrive within that year so that the financial issues 
could have been resolved.  That is part 1. 
10 
 
The second is it was not obvious to me at that time 
that these projects in some ways were all interconnected in 
the way in which it has been described. 
 
They came from different and desperate discussions.  
A pipeline had been discussed since 2008 and had been a 
continuous discussion.  
 
Manganese 
became 
an 
issue 
because 
it 
was 
identified through during Swat 1.  Swat 2 was a natural 
extension of Swat 1 because the implementation of Swat 1 
needed to happen and Transnet did not have the technical 
20 
skills and they needed us to help them build the technical 
skills. 
 
The coal line was of unique condition because of the 
financial – so I can hear the – the scepticism in the question 
and I understand the scepticism I am just saying at that 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 275 of 289 
 
moment in time because of the urgency the fact that these 
projects did not seem connected in any way they were 
desperate they were just awarded in a similar timeframe that 
these benefits needed to be derived by Transnet within that 
financial year that for me and my colleagues this seemed 
like a reasonable issue. 
 
One could argue like we have with other clients that 
this was not just separate projects.  That this was what I 
would call one program to solve one particular issue and 
then other clients that happens frequently where you have a 
10 
program which has multiple projects just like Vulindlela. 
 
So I hear with the benefit of hindsight the scepticism, 
I have read the documentation and being following the 
commission’s work but at that time for me and for my 
colleagues this was not let me call it completely unnatural 
discussion to be having with a client in an urgent situation 
who 
needed 
a 
service 
provider 
who 
understood 
the 
organisation very, very well at the requisite capabilities and 
could get going immediately. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Let me just quickly move to 
20 
another topic.  And again you were not involved but can I 
take you to exchanges around those four contracts and in 
particular Regiments Supply Development budgets for those 
four contracts NNPP, Coal Line, Kumba and what is the last 
one, Manganese. 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 276 of 289 
 
 
Can you go to page 457?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 457? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry 457 of Annexure 8 not 
Annexure 7 sorry.  So sorry of Bundle 8 – Bundle 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Denel good day Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It has Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  457.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Maybe start at 459.  
DR FINE:  I just need to find exactly – there may be – I may 
be lost.  I am looking under Tab W – VV7. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Chaskalson it is necessary 
just for the record to identify what that document is. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So what this is is a – if we go back 
to an email chain that starts – there is a long email chain 
that starts at 449 which exchanges backwards and forwards 
between people at Regiments and people at McKinsey in 
relation to putting together the supply development budgets 
for those four contracts NNPP, coal line, manganese and iron 
ore. 
 
It seems that the key person on the Regiments side 
20 
was Indheran Pillay - Indheran Pillay and on the McKinsey’s 
side was Ashton Sologol.  And in the course of that exchange 
the spread sheets or the tabs that we see – the spread sheet 
with the four tabs that we see from page 459 are sent from 
Regiments to McKinsey.  This is Regiments saying to 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 277 of 289 
 
McKinsey we are putting together our – you want us to put 
together the bids or these four contracts and what our supply 
development obligations are going to be.  This is what our 
spend is going to be. 
DR FINE:  Sorry Chair I may need some help to find the 
documentation. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh sorry you may go... 
DR FINE:  Because when I look in the tabs I have 459 there 
is no resemblance to what you have. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Is it 08459 or 17459? 
10 
DR FINE:  O7. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh sorry go 08 it is probably that 
file to your left there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am at Bundle 7 as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Oh then I am terribly sorry it is 
Bundle 8 – Bundle 8. 
DR FINE:  Bundle 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR FINE:  Yes Chair I am familiar with these emails they 
were provided to McKinsey a few weeks ago.  I had not seen 
20 
them prior to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is 457 Bundle 8. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Now if – unfortunately the tabs 
have not been printed out so we do not know which is which 
contract but it is the four contracts.  If we – if we go to 459 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 278 of 289 
 
we see the first of the four contracts.  And this is Regiments 
proposed supply development partners.  And there is a list of 
them.  Two of them are Homix and Albertime.  Homix is going 
to get… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Chaskalson let me just make 
sure I am on the right page.  I am at 459 Bundle 8 and what I 
see looks like distribution of fees or something like that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is correct.  A spread sheet 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja a spread sheet ja. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So – so Chair if you go down the 
first setting involved is a supply development partner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I can see that. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the – there are a list of 
entities listed underneath that the fourth is Homix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Who apparently are in the job 
creation, preservation, new skills development and IPR 
20 
category of supply development? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And for whom Regiments will sub-
contract services from Homix for the project and provide 
them with skills development opportunities and process and 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 279 of 289 
 
methodology IPR that they can use in future assignments. 
 
Then we have Albertime job creation, preservation, 
new skills development, IPR, sub-contract services from 
Albertime for the project and provide them with skills 
development, opportunity process and methodology IPR that 
they can use in future assignments. 
 
And then there are values that are given there.  
Regiments is going to pay Homix 2.771 million and Albertime 
2.77 – 2.722 million. 
 
If we go down a page to 460 we see the second 
10 
contract and the same arrangement.  Homix and Albertime 
are again supply development partners.  This time Homix will 
get 10.858 million – Albertime will get 2.068. 
 
Next page a better deal for Homix.  This time they 
are going to get 32.069 million.  Albertime will get 3.993 
million. 
 
And on the last page Homix is going to get 33.6 – 
364 million – Albertime 4.085 million. 
 
Now if you add up all of these numbers Homix and 
Albertime between them on these budgets are going to get in 
20 
the region of R100 million. 
 
Now I appreciate you were not involved in this but 
you have previously testified that Homix and Albertime 
performed no services in relation to any of the contracts 
where McKinsey worked with Regiments.  You recall that? 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 280 of 289 
 
DR FINE:  I have – I have – I said that in Parliament yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  Now you were not to know 
this because you were not party to these proposals but 
should someone not at McKinsey have been a little bit 
alarmed that R100 million was being budgeted for people 
who later just did not turn up on the project. 
DR FINE:  So Chair maybe just to explain the context of 
Albertime and Homix in my testimony in Parliament.  While I 
was preparing for Parliament there is a very short duration of 
about eleven days and I was reading the documentation that 
10 
McKinsey had submitted in some of the proposals I came 
across Homix and Albertime and a couple of the proposals 
which are now referred to accordingly. 
 
I 
was 
obviously 
shocked 
and 
surprised 
and 
I 
disclosed this in Parliament because by that stage the word 
Homix was certainly well known because of the issue of the 
Neotel contract which had been in the newspaper. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry can I just put a date on that 
because I want my point to be very clear.  When this – when 
these documents were exchanged I am not suggesting that 
20 
anyone should have seen Homix and Albertime was a red 
flag because it was a good year before Deloittes had raised 
the issue about Homix on the Neotel financials.  So nobody 
knew that Homix was a – essentially a laundry facility for 
Essa and the Gupta’s but my point is that, you have got a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 281 of 289 
 
series of budgets from Regiments that are allocating a 
hundred million rands to two entities.  And those two entities 
just never appear on the contracts.  Oh, sorry.  Never appear 
on the projects.  That is what I put to you, should have been 
a warning sign being picked up by somebody. 
DR FINE:   I think it is a fair question to ask Chair.  I can say 
that 
the 
people 
I 
spoke 
to 
in 
preparation 
for 
my 
parliamentary testimony because I picked up the phone to 
ask some colleagues, for example on the coal line in 
particular, et cetera, where these – have they ever come 
10 
across any colleagues and they said no.   
 
They did say – they did talk about a company consulting 
which is on the list here.  I cannot answer the questions that 
I am being asked because I was neither part of these 
questions or not.   
 
I think it is a fair question to ask.  It is, and this is pure 
speculation, entirely possible that the way in which this was 
described, 
was 
that 
these 
were 
sub-contractors 
to 
Regiments.   
 
The people involved did not understand exactly what the 
20 
basis of this was.  And it is also a proposal and it was not 
necessarily what was going to be connected but I am now 
speculating which I think it unhelpful. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  Doctor, we have gone a 
hell of a long or a greater deal longer than we planned to go.  
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 282 of 289 
 
So I think at this point, I do not have any further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, maybe I have got one 
question.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry.  [laughs]  You have heard 
and you have seen the evidence that the Commission has 
uncovered in relation to Vicus Segar.  Are you satisfied that 
McKinsey now has systems in place that would go a long 
way to preventing a partner from being able to do what Vicus 
10 
Segar appears to have been able to do in that period of 2014 
to 2016? 
DR FINE:   So I am not going to cover what Mr Mieszala 
covered because I think he has talked about the process and 
procedures which I think would capture a substantial number 
of the issues. 
 
I think in the case of Mr Segar, there are – it is more 
complicated.  Firstly, he was a very liked person and a 
person who did competent work. 
 
Secondly.  So there was a degree of trust in him as an 
20 
individual.  You know, if he was doing things on a frolic of his 
own, 
it 
is 
very 
difficult 
for 
McKinsey’s 
systems 
and 
processes to immediately to identify those issues. 
 
I will say the following from a personal reflection – 
perspective and I thought a lot about it.  Mr Segar had a 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 283 of 289 
 
propensity to have individual meetings on an ad-hoc basis 
with Mr Wood and Mr Singh. 
 
This was an issue that Mr Dawn and I actually raised 
with him explicitly and said we are concerned about this 
because we were not sure what was being discussed.   
 
And by the way, we felt that Mr Sing was a very young 
Chief Financial Officer who also needed coaching and advise 
on how to lead his team.  His style and approach with his 
team was no helpful.  It was not going to help him to be 
successful over time.   
10 
 
Mr 
Segar 
always 
said, 
however, 
that 
Mr 
Singh’s 
operating model was ad-hoc.  That he would suddenly call 
meetings and they would attend them.   
 
And so while we had a very explicit discussion with 
Mr Segar and he said that we needed to trust him, with the 
benefit of hindsight, as an individual partner – and this is 
what I tell my colleagues all the time – I would not have 
allowed that to continue. 
 
And I would have been insisted that this was not – this 
ad-hoc behaviour with these individuals is not an accepted 
20 
professional practice and not bringing in the best expertise 
to the client. 
 
To your question, however, Chair.  I think we have 
processes and procedures in place which are much, much 
tighter now including, for example, on the sole source issues 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 284 of 289 
 
to really raise them, identify them and have the kinds of 
debates and difficult questions which I have been subjected 
to today, so that we do not enter into those issues. 
 
And I think those kind of systems will identify part of that 
system but if an individual in our own capacity is using their 
private email account in order to do – have discussions and 
arrange deals which – I understand the question and I think 
it is a very valid question.  I am just not sure whether an 
individual, who is not well-intended, with the processes and 
procedures, ultimately resolve those kinds of issues. 
10 
 
And you can see I am reflecting on the question.  It is a 
very difficult question.  I would say, in addition, and to the 
question that was posed to Mr Mieszala earlier.  And I do 
differentiate personally.  It is my own personal perspective.  
Different, 
probably, 
to 
my 
colleagues’ 
perspective 
at 
McKinsey.   
 
When I think of, let me call it the context of the single 
source arrangements and the magnitude at that time, for me 
it did not trigger issues.   
 
When I think about the massive Eskom project and the 
20 
kinds of emails that you have referred to going backwards 
and forwards earlier, very, very large numbers, substantial 
numbers.  Then I think that there do have to be processes. 
 
And I think the question was asked to Mr Mieszala to 
reflect on, on how the government’s framework in McKinsey 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 285 of 289 
 
then identifies that you suddenly have very large contract 
discussions taking place and an intervention is required. 
 
I personally think we have come a long way on that but I 
think it is a journey and I am giving you my own personal 
reflections, obviously, with the benefit of hindsight. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thanks very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Dr Fine.  Can I take 
it that there is no re-examination? 
RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Thank you, Chair.  
No re-examination. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
DR FINE:   Chair, I wonder if I could just say one or two very 
brief things at the end? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR FINE:   Because...  I will be very brief.  I know the time.  
But 
I 
was 
reflecting 
today 
after 
the 
announcements 
yesterday of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR FINE:   And Amilcar Cabral stated:  Tell no lies and play 
no easy victory.  It is a beautiful quote.  And you know, 
20 
giving testimony today, I have really tried to be – and to 
parliament – open and truthful.  It is a difficult journey 
because there is pain involved.   
 
And on the matter of no easy victories.  Since the 
announcement was made, there has been both positive 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 286 of 289 
 
responses 
and 
critical 
responses 
which 
is 
completely 
expected. 
 
But I just want to reinforce again that McKinsey did this 
not because of guilt.  They did not do this because of guilt.  
And not for an easy victory.  We did it because it was the 
right thing to do.   
 
And you know, the road to State Capture started with 
small steps.  The road out of State Capture is also a hard 
road but also requires small steps.  And I think that the steps 
that 
McKinsey 
took 
in 
parliament 
and 
took 
with 
the 
10 
Commission are steps that I am proud of.  I am proud of 
them. 
 
I think that we should be encouraged.  I hear the 
criticism but we should be encouraged because if McKinsey 
is encouraged then other companies will also be encourage 
to all come on the path with these small steps like the ones 
that have been agreed with you in order to rectitude South 
Africa. 
 
So I just wanted to leave that as thought for you Chair 
and perhaps for people in South Africa to consider as we 
20 
progress on these small steps to remedy the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine.  I think that, certainly 
from the point of view of the evidence leaders and 
Mr Chaskalson would confirm this and certainly, it is my 
expectation that while we, on the one hand, give credit 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 287 of 289 
 
where it is due, at the same time, we must ask the questions 
that we are required to ask as part of our work.   
 
There must not be a situation where it may appear as if 
because McKinsey has agreed to pay – to repay some 
money, questions that need to be asked are not asked.  So 
that is very important.  Okay.  
DR FINE:   And here us from the support.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay thank you very much Dr Fine 
for coming to give evidence.  I heard Mr Chaskalson said, we 
will not see you back here again.  So I take that it is unlikely 
10 
you would come back or you would give evidence but of 
course if something unexpected happens, I am sure that 
would be raised but thank you very much.  You are now 
excused. 
DR FINE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chaskalson, what do you propose?  
Well, let me say because we have to stop now unfortunately.  
Let me say that if in regard to the witness who is still 
outstanding.  If there is room for me to hear his evidence 
tomorrow at some stage, that can be explored.   
20 
 
But I now also say, if there is room and it is convenient 
to everybody for me to sit at some stage on Saturday, I can 
sit and hear his evidence.   
 
I had postponed witnesses that were going to give 
evidence on Monday and Tuesday to January.  But for 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 288 of 289 
 
purposes of finishing this part, I can make myself available 
on Monday at some stage if that would suit everybody.  
Failing that, we may have to then explore other dates.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I think I must speak to 
Dr Weiss’ legal team and just see if we can... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   My strong preference would be for 
tomorrow just so that we can – it gets done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are they available? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we maybe just have a brief 
discussion with each other and then come – report to you 
when we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, we can adjourn and we can do 
one of two things.  We can adjourn and you can talk for two 
minutes and see me in chambers or you can communicate 
with me sometime this evening as to the outcome of your 
discussion.  Which one do you prefer? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, it may involve getting hold 
20 
of Dr Weiss in Germany. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So I think, let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Let me get in touch with you 
10 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 322 
 
Page 289 of 289 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...once we can find out from this 
side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  It remains for me to thank
