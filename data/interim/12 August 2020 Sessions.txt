PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 12 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning everybody.  I have an 
application 
for 
a 
postponement 
brought 
by 
Minister 
Gordhan where he in effect applies for the postponement of 
his cross-examination by Mr Tom Moyane’s counsel which 
was supposed to happen today.  He says it should be – he 
applies for an order that he must appear on the 31 August 
2020 alternatively on a date to be agreed by all parties. 
 
Let me have the appearances.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC: Good morning Chair I am A E Franklin 
10 
SC the evidence leader for this segment of the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you Mr Franklin.  Hang on one 
second.  Do we have somebody who sanitises today?  If 
there is nobody who sanitises you can just speak from 
where you – you are.  Yes. 
ADV MBATHA:    Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV MBATHA:    I am Ms Mbatha and representing 
Minister Gordhan in this application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MBATHA:    I am from the office of the State Attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MBATHA:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
moving 
the 
application 
for 
a 
postponement? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 4 of 182 
 
ADV MBATHA:    I am.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this affidavit which has been 
deposed to not by the Minister himself by somebody. 
ADV MBATHA:    It is of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says she is the Minister ’s Chief of 
Staff. 
ADV MBATHA:    Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All it says is that the Minister is not 
available due to Cabinet commitments.  There does not 
appear to be any information about why those commitments 
10 
are more important than appearing before this commission.   
ADV MBATHA:    Chair those were my instructions that the 
Minister is not available due the commitments that he had 
at the Cabinet so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mere Cabinet appointments on their own 
cannot be more important than appearing before this 
commission.  There would need to be something more than 
just mere Cabinet commitments.  This commission has got 
a 
very 
limited 
time 
to 
finish 
its 
work 
and 
Cabinet 
commitments are work like everybody’s work commitments.  
20 
If everybody is going to say I have work commitments I 
cannot appear before the commission on this day then we 
are not going to finish this. 
ADV MBATHA:    With due respect Chair I think probably 
the application was not in – more into detail as to exactly 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 5 of 182 
 
what the Minister is doing or what held him up at the 
Cabinet.  But I am of the view that he does respect the 
commission and he has due respect for what is taking 
place here and his – he does want to come and give 
evidence if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what I do know is that the President 
has told me that he – he has told the Cabinet Ministers 
that whenever anyone is required to cooperate with the 
commission they must cooperate.  It may be that our 
solution is just to make sure that summons are issued 
10 
against anyone who must appear before the commission 
because there are just too many instances where people 
say they cannot appear before the commission on a 
particular day.  And I see here that the order sought is that 
his cross-examination should be … 
ADV MBATHA:    On the 31 s t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Postponed to the 31 August 2020 or to a 
date to be agreed by all parties.  I am not going to 
postpone this matter to a date to be agreed by all parties.  
Because if we are going to work like that we will not get 
20 
anywhere.  Lawyers are busy and if we are going to do that 
where we cannot do our job.  So I will postpone it.  I am 
not happy. I will postpone it to a date that I will fix that 
accords with the programme of the commission and I saw 
that Mr Tom Moyane’s position was that although his 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 6 of 182 
 
Counsel is not available from their side they say they are 
not asking for a postponement but they are – and they 
accept that their unavailability of counsel is not a good 
ground for a postponement.  I will postpone it – I will fix a 
date and if Mr Moyane does not use that opportunity he 
might forfeit his right to cross-examine but we will have to 
make sure that the Minister is here on the date that is fixed 
so that we can – we want to finish the work of the 
commission and we are only a few – we are a few months 
away from the end of the term of the commission so we 
10 
have got to use all the days that we have properly.  So – I 
think Mr Moyane’s Counsel – okay you may sit down. 
ADV MBATHA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might wish to say something.     
ADV MBATHA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just put on your microphone.  Not 
mask microphone, microphone ja.  No you – the mask – ja. 
ADV SIBOTHO: Thank you Chairperson.  My name is 
Mfesane Sibotho I am an advocate at duma Nokwe Group 
of Advocates.  I record my appearance on behalf of Mr Tom 
20 
Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SIBOTHO:  Our position is as simple as you have 
recorded Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 7 of 182 
 
ADV SIBOTHO:   That in principle we are not opposed to 
the application for the postponement.  Be that as it may we 
thought we would honour the opportunity we have been 
granted by the commission that if you take the position that 
we proceed today we are more than happy to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SIBOTHO:   But with that being said we understand 
the difficulty which is that Mr Gordhan is not in front of the 
commission for cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV SIBOTHO:   And in principle we accept that we are in 
your hands.  We are happy with the 31 August.  Be that as 
it may we want to place it on record as well that we are 
happy – we are at the hands of the commission.  I mean 
obviously there will be issues with the availability of lead 
counsel because you will understand given the length of 
the matter the involvement of counsel there might be 
difficulties having to find counsel within a short period of 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV SIBOTHO:   But with that being said we want to place 
it on record that we will avail ourselves at the date that the 
commission will decide and if alternative means have to be 
made, we are happy to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  No that is fine.  Thank you. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 8 of 182 
 
ADV SIBOTHO: Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Franklin do you want to say 
anything? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair nothing specific 
other than to echo the sentiments of the Chair that it is 
regrettable that the matter has to be postponed.  The 
practical solution as the Chair has already decided is to 
set another date and I understand that that will be done in 
communication between the Secretariat and the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is all I have to say.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you very much we – I will 
postpone it and a date will be determined soon and the 
date will give everyone enough time to make sure if they 
were not to be available, they make themselves available.  
The cross-examination of Minister Gordhan which was 
scheduled for this – for today is hereby postponed to a 
date that is yet to be determined.  Those who wish to be 
excused are excused.  Good morning Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you ready? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes we are.  Chairperson we have asked 
Mr Madimpe Mogashoa to give his evidence today.  You will 
recall that earlier in July we had intended calling Mr 
Madimpe – I mean Mr Mogashoa but he could not come on 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 9 of 182 
 
account of the fact that he was not feeling too well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think bring your microphone a little 
closer your voice. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes as you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Voice is going down. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well he – he gives evidence in 
relation to PRASA. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  That is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he will be giving evidence in relation 
to his role as the attorney for PRASA in regard to among 
others I guess – I do not know whether it is among others 
but the Siyaya claims or cases and his interaction with the 
PRASA legal team as well as with the Chairperson at the 
time Judge Makhubele now. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is what he will be giving 
evidence about. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  That is so Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson may I place on record at the 
outset that last night the commission received an objection 
from Judge Makhubele who said that she had been given – 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 10 of 182 
 
the notice that she had been given that Mr Mogashoa 
would be testifying today was too short place on record 
that she was given notice on Saturday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  I also place on record Chairperson that the 
decision to call Mr Mogashoa was made on Friday and that 
is when all the parties including Mr Mogashoa this was 
decided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well I must just indicate that the 
calling of Mr Mogashoa today or sometime this week 
10 
emanated from me in order to try and make sure that we 
use the time available as much as possible did not 
emanate from Mr Soni or anyone else.  And to the extent 
that Judge Makhubele might have been given short notice  
1. She 
will 
have 
access 
to 
the 
transcript 
of 
Mr 
Mogashoa’s 
evidence 
and 
actually 
the 
acting 
secretary should send her a letter indicating to her 
how to access the transcript of Mr Mogashoa’s 
evidence. 
And in this regard also it is to be noted that she has not 
20 
made any application for Leave to Cross-examine Mr 
Mogashoa.  Indeed, other than the fact that when she gave 
evidence 
she 
denied 
having 
asked 
or 
instructed 
Mr 
Mogashoa not to speak to the PRASA legal team about the 
Siyaya claims other than that as far as I know she has not 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 11 of 182 
 
filed any affidavit disputing anything in Mr Mogashoa’s 
affidavit.  Is that your standing as well? 
ADV SONI SC:  That is the position as I know it thank you 
Chairperson yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so other than that one denial 
she has not sought to tell us that she disputes Mr 
Mogashoa’s affidavit or at least she has not done that by 
way of filing an affidavit despite the fact that she has had 
Mr Mogashoa’s affidavit for a long time. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So I do not think that she should be 
prejudiced in any way other than that she could have come 
to sit here while Mr Mogashoa was giving evidence.  She 
would not be allowed to cross-examine him because she 
has not applied for Leave to Cross-examine.  All she would 
do is just listen and she will be able to read all the 
evidence in the transcript.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  The… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just thought I must clarify that the 
decision did not come from you.  It came from me. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  As it pleases Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  May we have the witness sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please administer the oath or 
affirmation.  
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 12 of 182 
 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Madimpe Thabo Josias Mogashoa. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR MOGASHOA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and 
say, I truly affirm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I truly affirm. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much you may be seated. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Mogashoa it is common cause that you 
are an attorney and that you have acted for PRASA in 
certain matters.  I am just placing that on record. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  In relation to the evidence you are about to 
give today have you made an affidavit? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes I have Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Have you that affidavit in front of you? 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes it is in front of me. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson the affidavit is in Bundle G it 
is 
marked 
Exhibit 
SS13 
and 
it 
starts 
on 
page 
1 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the bundle is? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 13 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  G. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle G. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
ADV SONI SC:  Exhibit SS13 it is the first… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Document in that bundle Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you would like Mr Mogashoa’s 
affidavit to be admitted as Exhibit  
ADV SONI SC:  SS13. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  SS13. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That affidavit of Mr Mogashoa does it 
appear on page 1 and goes up to page 19 if you look at the 
red numbers on the top right-hand corner of the pages? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that signature is your signature 
above the certification? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It is my signature Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Mr Mogashoa’s affidavit 
20 
is admitted as Exhibit SS13. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chair.  Mr Mogashoa could 
you very briefly tell the Chairperson how it came about that 
you made this affidavit – just very briefly. 
MR MOGASHOA: Okay Chair I received a call… 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 14 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mogashoa please bring the 
microphone a little closer to you. 
MR MOGASHOA:  This way? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do not know if it moves.  If it moves 
I want it to be a little closer even than that or maybe move 
your chair. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hear better when it is not too far away 
from you. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I received a call it must have been 
around April of this year from – from Ms Rangata who 
indicated that in the proceedings officials of PRASA came 
through to the commission to give their evidence in 
particular in relation to some of the matters that my firm 
Diale 
Mogashoa 
Attorneys 
just 
that 
Diale 
Mogashoa 
Attorneys was involved in and that they were particular 
matters in relation to the Siyaya what I see is referred to 
as the Siyaya Group of Companies.  She then asked that it 
20 
is only courtesy that she requests that I assist by making 
my own affidavit available.  I was subsequent to that given 
a copy of Ms Ngoye’s affidavit and I think at that time she 
was either still testifying or had just finished testifying but 
what I was given was a copy of her affidavit.  I am made to 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 15 of 182 
 
believe that it forms part of the documents I might be 
talking to this morning.  And – and I then received a letter 
from the commission explaining precisely what was needed 
from me and the firm I am part of and because the last time 
I was involved in the matters was way back in 2017/2018.  
I kept on indicating to Ms Rangata than I did it more times 
because I had to plough through documents most of which 
we have already archived.  But in hindsight to the question 
Chair that is how I got to eventually formulate and settle 
this affidavit that is before us now. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in regard to the contents of your 
affidavit was the commission legal team or anybody from 
the commission involved in formulation of your affidavit? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I formulated and settled the affidavit 
myself Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in your affidavit you refer to the 
affidavits by two PRASA officials Ms Ngoye whom you have 
mentioned and was there a second person whose affidavit 
you have received? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I received the affidavit of Ms Ngoye 
20 
initially when I was approached to be of assistance to the 
commission.  And I think subsequent to that but before I 
could settle the affidavit as requested, I was given the 
affidavit of Mr Dingiswayo.  I believe at that time Mr 
Dingiswayo had not come through to the commission to 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 16 of 182 
 
give his evidence Chair.  I – I may have been placed in 
possession of Ms Ngoye’s transcript but I have not seen Mr 
Dingiswayo.  But I believe he has given his evidence.  So I 
was in possession of the two affidavits at the time of 
formulating this affidavit. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in their affidavits – did you read the 
affidavits that were given to you? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I went through both affidavits that were 
given to me. 
ADV SONI SC:  In their affidavits they mention their 
10 
interactions with you and your firm and your interactions 
with PRASA in relation to the Siyaya matters.  Just in 
general what is your – what is your response to the 
averments made in their respective applications insofar as 
it concerns you and your firm? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay.  Let me start by explaining that I 
understand the – the – and I understood at the time I was 
asked to prepare an affidavit the role that I had to fulfil by 
offering explanations which Ms Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo 
may not have had enough information around.   
20 
As my affidavit says and in the normal ordinary 
course of accepting instructions from PRASA Chair which 
we acted for I received I think during the period of 2015 it 
must have been around September I could be wrong but 
the dates are in my affidavit.   
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 17 of 182 
 
I received about four summonses all by different 
companies which I see we refer to as the Siyaya Group and 
all of which were in respect of claims by the Siyaya Group 
against PRASA purportedly as a result of services rendered 
through a variety of contracts or agreements that PRASA 
and Siyaya may have gotten themselves involved in and I 
believe that in the beginning of 2016 the year that followed 
I was then instructed on two more – to defend two more of 
such summonses by entities that are perhaps part of what 
we call the Siyaya Group now.   
10 
Now my instructions Chair were that our firm should 
defend 
PRASA 
in 
as 
far 
as 
the 
summonses 
were 
concerned.  I recall very well that during 2015 just after we 
had entered appearance to defend in respect of the 2015 
case numbers which I speak of in my affidavits our 
opponents and I think my – my opponent colleague was Mr 
Mathopo of Mathopo Attorneys they – he represented the 
Siyaya Group of Companies.  They immediately proceeded 
to file an application for summary judgment in respect of 
all of the matters.   
20 
Now naturally through consultations with – with 
client it came out that client had a basis to want to defend 
those four matters at the time and that is what the legal 
team which our firm was a part of carried on to them file 
opposing papers in – in the defence of PRASA and in 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 18 of 182 
 
illustrating to the court at the time that PRASA had bona 
fide defences to – to defend the matters.  I suppose it is on 
record now that the summary judgment applications were – 
were successfully opposed and then the parties then went 
on to litigate as for instance I may have been instructed by 
our client to litigate in the manner that we did through the 
various stages of such litigation.   
And I think in 2016 when we received the two 
additional summonses, we went on to file our appearances 
to defend as instructed and my opponent I think in this – in 
10 
this case did not go on to file applications for summary – 
for summary judgment in respect of such matters. And we 
then went on to exchange pleadings and one can accept 
that in that respect there would have had to be many, many 
occasions during which my firm would consult with PRASA 
and PRASA officials and I think in particular it would be Mr 
Ngoye, Mr Dingiswayo and Ms Mokothini [?].  I received – I 
had received all of these instructions from Ms Mokothini [?] 
through I believe Mr Dingiswayo’s instructions.   
And the process of dealing with the litigated matters 
20 
it became apparent that the contracts that opponents relied 
upon made reference to arbitration as one way of having 
the matter adjudicated upon.  And I think the parties at 
some point during 2016 or 2017 agreed to then have the 
matters referred for arbitration.   
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 19 of 182 
 
My affidavit speaks about all processes thereabout 
and I think Ms Ngoye’s affidavit speaks about such 
processes 
thereabout 
and 
the 
parties 
agreed 
after 
obviously some – some bit of tiffing and towing about who 
the suitable arbitrator would be.  We eventually agreed on 
– on instructing retired Judge Fritz Brand.   
I recall that we subsequently had a pre-trial – pre-
arbitration meeting with Judge Fritz at which we then 
agreed on the many various steps that the parties would 
follow in preparing matters at the arbitration hearing.  And 
10 
if my memory serves me well, we had intended to sit 
around certain dates of September of 2017 so that we 
argue the cases as pleaded in the numerous documents that 
we had at our disposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Soni, quickly.  Important to let him talk 
to each plan to say what was it about and, I mean, the 
question of their defence is in the public domain because 
please were filed as I understand the position. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the defence was or defences were.  
20 
What... how much was claimed?  What was the claim for?  
What was the defence of PRASA?  Just briefly. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage. 
ADV SONI SC:  I will do that in a moment because he does... 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 20 of 182 
 
there is a report from Mr Makgahlela(?) [00:02:25] which I 
want to deal with him in that regard Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but it is important as, whoever is 
listening, as they follow, they know what claim you are 
talking about.   
ADV SONI SC:  Ja.  yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is easy for all three of us because we 
know, we have read this.  But somebody who is listening 
does not know what are these claims for, and if we go too far 
without explaining them, they are disadvantaged. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  I just wanted to cover a former issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Mogashoa, the question I had asked you, 
where you gave the history of the matter was, did you read 
Ms Ngoye’s and Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavits?   
 
They make a number of allegations.  And I am just 
asking, are you in agreement with those allegations they are 
making in their affidavits or do you disagree with them?  Just 
in general. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Chair, there will be certain aspects of 
20 
their affidavit or their affidavits that I disagree with.  And I 
do state that very clearly.  In my own affidavit where 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you are...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  ...I can...[intervenes]  
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 21 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  ...not quite capture the facts of the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  ...in line with what I know the facts to be.  
So every aspect of their affidavits that deviated from what I 
know about these matters, I would have dealt with it.  I 
would have had to deal with...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think your answer ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think your answer Mr Mogashoa should 
10 
be.  Your attitude towards... to the allegations made in Ms 
Ngoye’s affidavit is as reflected in the affidavit because they 
deal with that. 
 
Those that you admit, you made that clear where you 
think it is not... it does not give the full picture as you 
understand it.  You have also dealt with that.  Is that right? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And then Mr Soni can take you to 
those if it is necessary. 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I just ask you to look at paragraph 7 of 
20 
your affidavit Mr Mogashoa? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
ADV SONI SC:  Paragraph 7 on page 3 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  You say in the first sentence: 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 22 of 182 
 
“I had an opportunity to consider the affidavits of Ms 
Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo, as well as, the documents 
in the group...” 
 
And then, just read the second sentence, please. 
MR MOGASHOA:   
“I confirm that the averments contained in these 
affidavits are a correct recollection of the events that 
took place except where I otherwise in this affidavit 
proffered a better clarity and/or put issues into their 
proper 
perspective 
in 
areas 
where 
our 
firm’s 
10 
involvement was concerned...” 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, and then if you look at paragraph 8.  
You make one point about an allegation made by Mr 
Dingiswayo that the settlement that had been concluded in 
December 2017, was a secret settlement, and you say there 
was no secret settlement.   
 
Is that the extent of your dispute between yourself and 
Ms Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo except where something else 
appears in your affidavit? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Well, yes except where something else 
20 
appears in my affidavit.  I had to categorically state that the 
accession that the...  
 
In as far as our firm was concerned, the accession that 
the settlement or the settlement processes were done 
secretly, I did not quite think that that would be correct in the 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 23 of 182 
 
context of our firm’s involvement in the matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that when Mr Dingiswayo 
referred to a secret settlement or anything along those lines, 
to the extent that he may have meant that it was a 
settlement in which the legal department of PRASA of which 
he was part, had not taken part or had been excluded.  
Would you be able to comment on that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I would except that proposition Chair if he 
means it in a sense that perhaps the legal department was 
not aware ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
MOGASHOA: 
 
...about 
what 
was 
happening 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  ...about the settlement at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I do not have a problem with that 
proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  I am going to come back to that 
20 
Chairperson.  I do not want to be asking leading questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  But that is an important issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes, that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, in regard to the six matters that you 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 24 of 182 
 
have mentioned Mr Mogashoa.  Did you, at any stage, do a 
report for PRASA? 
MR MOGASHOA:  You mean in the ordinary... I just want 
clarity on your question.  You mean in the ordinary course of 
dealing with the matters or the dealing with the litigation 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Can I ask you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  ...as the case may be? 
ADV SONI SC:  Can I ask you to please look at Annexure 
MN4, to Ms Ngoye’s affidavit, please?  Ms Ngoye’s affidavit 
10 
Chairperson is in Bundle E1, Exhibit SS7B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOGASHOA:  At which page or what page? 
ADV SONI SC:  If you look at page 322.  That is MN4. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I have it in front of me. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now what is that document? 
MR MOGASHOA:  This is a report compiled by our office. 
ADV SONI SC:  From whom of your office? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I prepared the report with my colleague, 
Ncebakazi Mbebe. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  What is that report about? 
MR MOGASHOA:  We were, prior to this date, requested by 
the legal department to prepare a status report in respect of 
all of the matters our firm was defending to PRASA at that 
time.   
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 25 of 182 
 
 
I think in my discussions 
with Ms 
Ngoye 
or Mr 
Dingiswayo, I was made to believe that the board wanted to 
have a quick update on the status of the litigation of the 
matters related to the Siyaya Group. 
 
And in that way, we then... Ms Mbebe and I then 
prepared... went on to prepare this report.  I have it dated 
the 21s t of November 2017. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Now let us just put this into 
perspective.  This is a report you prepared for PRASA.  
Would that be correct? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  And what you say is that: 
“The purpose is to provide the client with an update 
on the background of the Siyaya summons, our office 
has been instructed to defend...” 
 
That is at paragraph 1.2. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in the rest of document, you then 
outlined each of the cases.  Would that be correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now let us look at the first one 
which... Chairperson, this is answering your question about 
what the plan is about and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Look at the one at paragraph 2.1 on page 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 26 of 182 
 
322.  What case number is that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  The report then refers to a matter with 
case number 73/934/2015. 
ADV SONI SC:  And who was the claimant in the matter or 
the plaintiff? 
MR MOGASHOA:  The plaintiff then is Siyaya DB Consulting 
Engineers (Pty) Ltd. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  And, obviously, it was a summons against 
PRASA. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And at paragraph 2.1.2, you indicate the 
basis on which that claim is... the claim is founded.  Can you 
just indicate what that was for?  What the basis was?  That 
is set out in paragraph 2.1.2. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  We say in our report Chair that: 
“The plaintiff alleges in his particulars of claim dated 
the 9t h of December 2015 that on or about the 
8t h of September 2014 
at 
Braamfontein, 
Johannesburg, the plaintiff who was presented by its 
managing 
director, 
Makhensa 
Mabunda 
and 
the 
20 
defendant represented by its group CEO, Lucky 
Tshepo Montana, concluded a written Consultant 
Agreement 
for 
the 
PRASA 
Rail 
Infrastructure 
Rehabilitation Programme Phase 2...” 
ADV SONI SC:  And in that paragraph 5.1... I am sorry.  At 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 27 of 182 
 
paragraph 2.1.3, you indicate what the contract price was.   
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And what was the contract price? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Our paragraph 5.1 of the report says: 
“The contract price was R 28 819 200,00 inclusive of 
VAT...” 
 
And I think we cross-referenced to Clause 1.11 of, I 
imagine, whatever agreement or document that was attached 
to the summons. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now, can I ask you to look at page 
10 
324?  And in paragraph 2.1.9, you set out the first defence 
that had been raised.  What was that defence?  Just very 
briefly.  You do not have to read it. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is paragraph 2.1.9.  I see here that I 
am making reference to it.  It mentions that it has to do with 
jurisdiction.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I am do not know if that is what you are 
referring to? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  I am just trying to articulate what the 
20 
issues were in this matter.  There is a claim and you 
indicated that you had said to PRASA that these claims are 
defendable and we just looking at the basis on which the 
claims were being defended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you deal with those at 2.1.9, 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 28 of 182 
 
2.1.10, 2.1.11. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  That is indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, just articulate them, the defences. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I mean it to look at them  ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You can ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  ...without reading Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can read these ones.  Ja, okay.  
Because ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, must I read it into the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Into the record, ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Oh, it is fine.  We say in paragraph 2.1.9 
that: 
“The amended plea raised the issue of jurisdiction in 
that Clause 20 of the agreement, upon which the 
plaintiff 
relies, 
a 
court 
provides 
that 
disputes 
between parties must be fair to arbitration and that 
the person in dispute had not been referred to 
arbitration...” 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  If you could just stop there for a moment? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
When 
you 
were 
summarising 
the 
developments 
in 
this 
matter, 
you 
indicated 
to 
the 
Chairperson that matters had been filed in court.  And then 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 29 of 182 
 
you indicated that eventually the matters were referred to 
Judge Brand as the arbitrator. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Was the appointment of Judge Brand 
connected with this defence? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It will be connected with this defence but I 
imagine that at that time the parties had not gotten into an 
arrangement that the matters be referred for arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This must be a point that you had raised 
when the matter was still in court and you must have raised 
10 
it successfully, even if it was not decided by the court 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  I would agree.  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...successfully in the sense that the 
plaintiff agreed that they should not have gone to court.  
They should have referred the dispute to arbitration. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, indeed so Chair.  It would be.  And 
we say there that it was included in our amended plea that 
there were jurisdictional issues in the sense that the matters 
ought to have been referred for arbitration instead of the 
20 
institution of an action ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  ...proceedings out of the high court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Well, was that point common to all 
the Siyaya claims that ultimately got settled or only in regard 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 30 of 182 
 
to this matter, as you recall it? 
MR MOGASHOA:  We agreed to have all of the disputed 
matters go for arbitration.  So in the agreement, it may even 
be so that not all of them had to be referred for arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  But I think when we were discussing all of 
them with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]  
MR MOGASHOA:  ...with our accountants and my opponent 
on the other side. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  We then arrived at the conclusion but 
because they are similar and they rely on agreements 
effectively entered into between PRASA and the Group of 
Siyaya Companies, that it would serve justice better that we 
then refer all of them for arbitration. 
 
So, yes Chair, in answer to your question.  There was an 
agreement to also refer the so-called settled matters for 
arbitration at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Maybe you can ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SONI SC:  I... then in answer... I will go through all of 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  But the answer to the question Chairperson 
without leading the witness, that is indeed the position that 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 31 of 182 
 
the jurisdictional point was taken in respect of all the claims.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Okay you are away from the mic. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a result, I cannot hear. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I did not hear.  Just repeat the point. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh.  The jurisdiction of point was taken in 
regard to all six claims. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All six claims? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you.   
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Then, Mr Mogashoa, if you look at 
paragraph 2.1.10, you indicate what the fitting defence was 
in the plea that had been filed in the high court.  What is that 
defence? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correctly.  We say in paragraph 2.1.10 
that: 
“The second defence raised in the plea is that the 
services indicated to have been rendered on the 
invoices upon which the 20 July’s are not of any of 
20 
the services listed in the Annexure BOC or POC3.  
In other words, the claimant claimed for about under 
these 
summons, 
are 
not 
authorised 
by 
the 
Consultant’s Agreement upon which the plaintiff 
relies and on that basis, the defendant is not liable to 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 32 of 182 
 
the plaintiff on such amounts...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, just to clarify that.  Would it be correct 
to say that PRASA’s defence in relation to this claim, as 
reflected in paragraph 2.1.10, was that Siyaya may have 
performed those services but those were not services that 
PRASA had asked Siyaya to perform? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and that ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...Siyaya could not claim from PRASA 
10 
payment for services that had not been agreed should be 
performed by Siyaya? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I... these things happened a long time ago 
Chair but I would imagine that... we had difficulties with the 
fact that what we came across as evidence of amounts that 
the Siyaya Group was saying were outstanding.   
 
The invoices... not the invoices, articulated by way of 
services 
rendered, 
were 
not 
in 
consonance 
with 
the 
agreement and in particular Annexure POC3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m-h’m. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  So this may have been confirmed by our 
client during the various consultations they have had with 
them but they had challenges with those invoices as they did 
not seem to relate to any of the services as may have been 
described by this annexure to the agreement. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 33 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then at paragraph 2.1.11, you articulate 
what the third defence was.  Can you indicate to the 
Chairperson what that was, even if you just read paragraph 
2.1.11 into the record? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay.  We are saying Chair in paragraph 
2.1.11 that: 
“The third defence raised in the plea is that the 
plaintiff is not entitled (I would imagine) to interest 
because they did not demand payment of such 
10 
various amounts on the date alleged in its particular 
of claim and therefore, they are not entitled to 
interest in effect from those dates...” 
 
I imagine it would the dates of the invoices themselves. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, in paragraph 2.1.12, you refer to a 
further defence that was raised.  Could you indicate what 
that defence was? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Chair, we say in paragraph 2.1.12 that: 
“The defence also relied on Clause 11.1 of its 
Consultant’s Agreement to allege that the invoices 
20 
upon which the 20t h of July, are not in accordance 
with the payment schedule contemplated in Clause 
11.1 of the consulted agreement due to the facts that 
the amounts claimed therein are not the amounts 
provided for the payment schedule contained in 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 34 of 182 
 
Annexure B to the consulting settlement.   
The premises insofar as amounts claimed by plaintiff 
are not in accordance with the amounts provided for 
in the payment schedule contained in Annexure B to 
the Consultant’s Agreement.   
The defendant pleads that the plaintiff is in law not 
entitled to claim such amounts in terms of the 
Consultant’s 
Agreement 
and 
the 
defendant 
is, 
therefore, not liable to the plaintiff in terms of the 
Consultant’s Agreement upon which the plaintiff 
10 
relies...” 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in paragraph 2.1.13, you raise 
the... a further defence in respect of reciprocal obligations.  
Can you articulate what that defence was even if you just 
read it out? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Chair, in paragraph 2.1.13, we say that: 
“The defence also relied on the fact that Clause 
1.12.4 
of 
the 
Consultant’s 
Agreement 
created 
reciprocal obligations between the parties. 
The clause provide that the plaintiff commits an event 
20 
of default if he does not deliver a certificate of 
occupation within a period of 20-days from the 
completion date. 
The plaintiff has not delivered the certificate of 
occupation referred to in Clause 1.12.4 of the 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 35 of 182 
 
Consultant’s agreement and it is for this reason to 
not, in the law, entitle to enforce the Consultant’s 
Agreement against the defendant...” 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in 2.1.14, you raise an even further 
defence.  What is that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  We say in 2.1.1.4 Chair that: 
“The plea also contested the lawfulness of the 
variation of the Consultant’s Agreement to the extent 
that it is not contemplated in Clause 23 of the 
agreement...” 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And in 2.1.15 indicates what your last plea 
to this claim was, and what was it? 
MR MOGASHOA:  We say there Chair that: 
“Lastly, the plea dealt with the defendant’s denial of 
the fact that the services the plaintiff alleges to have 
rendered are inconsonant with the services listed in 
POC of its particulars of claim...” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, earlier on you indicate that the claims 
were not consonant with POC3.  Was this a separate defence 
as well?  Because here you have it as POC2. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  I just want to read 2.1.5 again.  We 
seem... my understanding of this paragraph is that we seem 
to also deny that the services rendered are in line with the 
services as may have been listed in Annexure POC2 of the 
particulars of claim. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 36 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  I am just going... if you look at 
paragraph 2.1.10 on the previous page. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  You will see there is a reference to POC3.  I 
am just saying that it is appears as if there is... there were 
three sets of particulars of claim and that 2.1.10 referred to 
one and this referred to yet another.  
MR MOGASHOA:  I suppose you mean annexures? 
ADV SONI SC:  I am sorry.  Annexures, yes.   
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  So, yes.  So from the reading of my 
report, indeed there would have been POC annexures.  And 
we seem to be saying, both the reliance on POC3 and POC2 
were found to be one thing in our interpretation of the 
documents in the totality at that time. 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Mogashoa, let me just try and 
understand.  These defences were based upon on what?  In 
other words, how did this... how did it come about that these 
defences exist? 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  We would have had to consult. 
ADV SONI SC:  Well, you would have and I ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  We went on to arrange on many instances 
and occasions consultations with clients.  Documents were 
made available to us.   
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 37 of 182 
 
 
Information was shared with us by members of the 
particular unit which unit would have received such services 
as may appear in the allegations in the particulars of claim. 
 
So 
the 
defences 
were 
formulated 
as 
a 
result 
of 
consultations and as a result of documents that were availed 
to us as the legal team. 
 
And naturally that which followed was that we repeated 
all of these defences in the plea as may have been amended 
that we filed on behalf of PRASA. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, in regard to the drafting of the plea.  
10 
This is a claim for R 27 million.  Did you have counsel? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, we had counsel.  I think I do say in 
my affidavit that initially in 2015, we were instructed to brief 
Advocate Mike Maritz SC and with him Kenneth Solwane as 
his junior.  I think it was up to the point we argued 
application for summary judgment. 
 
But I think from then onwards, we were instructed to 
proceed with Advocate Solwane.  I cannot remember if, at 
the time, his status had been deferred but we proceeded with 
him and over time, we were instructed to get a junior 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  I am just trying...  Oh, sorry. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Ja.  At the time of filing these pleas.  Yes, 
Advocate Solwane and ...[indistinct] Basetti [00:29:30] 
ADV SONI SC:  I am just trying to find out whether counsel 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 38 of 182 
 
drafted the pleas. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It would have been counsel who drafted 
the pleas.  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Then let us look at the next case 
which you set out at paragraph 2.2 of Annexure MN4, and 
what case number is that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  We say here it is case number 73933 of 
2015. 
ADV SONI SC:  And who was the claimant in this matter? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The plaintiff in this matter is Siyaya DB 
10 
consulting Engineers (Pty) Ltd v PRASA. 
ADV SONI SC:  And in paragraph 2.2.2 you indicate what 
the basis of this claim was.  Could you read that into the 
record? 
MR MOGASHOA:    
“We summarise the plaintiff’s case to be that on or 
about the 4 December 2013 and at Braamfontein, 
Johannesburg, 
the 
plaintiff 
represented 
by 
its 
managing director Makhenza Mabunda and the 
defendant 
represented 
by 
its 
Chief 
Executive 
20 
Officer 
and 
that 
[indistinct] 
00.45 
accelerated 
infrastructure 
refurbishment 
project 
consulting 
agreement.” 
ADV SONI SC:  It may – I am just asking, if you recall, who 
was the Chief Operating Officer?  The defendant’s Chief 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 39 of 182 
 
Operating Officer? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Chief Executive Officer. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chief Executive Officer, sorry. 
MR MOGASHOA:   In 2013 it may have still been Mr Lucky 
Montana.  It may have still been [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, in 2013 it certainly would have 
been Mr Montana. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because he left in 2015, if I recall 
10 
correctly  or was it 2014?  But in 2013 I am sure it was still 
him. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And if you look, Mr Mogashoa, it if you turn 
to paragraph 2.1.2 it is on the previous page 323 and you 
look at paragraph 2.1.2 you do name the CEO there. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, that is indeed so. 
ADV SONI SC:  And who is the CEO then? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It says Lucky Tshepo Montana. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And that is – that agreement was 2014 
and the Chairperson is making the point that therefore in 
2013 it must have been Mr Montana as well.  I am just not 
whether we left information out, getting who the Chief 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 40 of 182 
 
Executive Officer at the time was or that this is just a 
caption of what the particulars then say. 
ADV SONI SC:  If you look at the next – the first line of the 
next page, that is page 326 and that is your paragraph 
2.2.3, you indicate what the purchase price – oh sorry, the 
contract price of this contract was.  What was it? 
MR MOGASHOA:   You see there the contract price was 
R4 978 000 inclusive of VAT, Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then from paragraph 2.2.8 on page 
327 you indicate the basis on which the plea was founded 
10 
and what is 2.2.8? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Chair, we say in paragraph 2.2.8 that: 
“The amended plea raised the issue of jurisdiction 
in that clause 19 of the agreement upon which 
plaintiff 
relies, 
provide 
that 
disputes 
between 
parties must be referred to arbitration and that the 
present 
dispute 
had 
not 
been 
referred 
to 
arbitration.” 
ADV SONI SC:  This is the point that the Chairperson was 
asking about, did all the contra – was the same jurisdiction 
20 
or point taken in respect of all the contracts?  Certainly, it 
was taken in respect of this contract as well. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Indeed so, Chair.  If the report confirms 
that because, I mean, the report was done when we still – 
when our firm was still seized with the responsibility of 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 41 of 182 
 
defending the matter [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SONI SC:   Because at the time you drew up this 
report you would have had everything. 
MR MOGASHOA:   We had everything in front of this, 
correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now 2.2.9 you indicate a further defence, 
what was that defence? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that: 
“The defendant also denied that the agreement was 
entered into by its Chief Executive Officer and as 
10 
well 
the 
correctness 
of 
clause 
3.2 
of 
the 
agreement.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And in 2.2.10 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV SONI SC:  I am sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On 2.2.9 is that defence one that 
disputed the validity of the agreement that was entered 
into by PRASA’s Chief Executive Officer at the time or was 
the defence that factually no agreement existed.  Do you 
remember?  Is that something you are not able to 
20 
remember? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I cannot quite remember, Chair, but just 
to assist.  If I give regard to paragraph 2.2.9, we either did 
not have an agreement at all or, alternatively, we had an 
agreement that did not bear any signature of the Chief 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 42 of 182 
 
Executive Officer and/or any other official from PRASA who 
may have been mandated to enter into such an agreement.  
So we disputed the existence of the agreement from my 
review of 2.2.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  As it pleases.  And in 2.2.10 you raise a 
further defence and what was that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We say there that: 
“The plea also alleges that the defendant is not 
liable to the plaintiff due to the fact that the plaintiff 
10 
failed 
to 
provide 
an 
occupation 
certificate 
as 
contemplated in clause 1.11 on the agreement.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  And 2.2.11?  What is the defence 
raised there? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We are saying there that: 
“The defendant  disputed its liability to the plaintiff 
in that the invoices upon which the plaintiff rely are 
not consistent with the provisions of clause 2 of 
annexure B to the agreement in that they do not 
set out the work for which amounts are claimed, 
20 
they are not for any of the amounts listed in clause 
2.1 of annexure B to the agreement.  They are not 
for 25% off the contract price as provided for in 
clause 2.2 of annexure B to the agreement and 
they 
are 
not 
accompanied 
by 
deliverables 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 43 of 182 
 
described for each of the invoices provided for in 
clause 2.2 of annexure B of the agreement.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in 2.2.12 a further defence is 
raised.  What is that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that: 
“The 
defendant 
also 
denied 
that 
the 
plaintiff 
rendered the services provided for in clause 8 of 
the 
agreement 
read 
with 
Schedule 
A 
of 
the 
agreement.” 
ADV SONI SC:  This seems to be similar to the plea in the 
10 
– or the defence raised in the previous one namely that 
the annexure PLC 2 and PLC 3 do not bear out the claims 
that were made by the plaintiff. 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in 2.2.13? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that: 
“The defendant also challenges the plaintiff’s claim 
that it is entitled to interest as at 25 March 2015 as 
no case had been made in the particulars of claim 
for the interest to be paid with effect from that 
20 
date.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And that is similar to the defence you 
raised in the previous claim, would that be correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:   In the previous case, that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in paragraph 2.3 you deal with 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 44 of 182 
 
the next claim that was made and would you in paragraph 
2.3.2 you indicate what the basis of that claim was? 
MR 
MOGASHOA: 
  
We say there that it is 
case 
74281/2015 and it is Siyaya DB Consulting Engineers 
(Pty) Ltd v PRASA.  In paragraph 2.3.2 of the report you 
say that: 
“The plaintiff in the particulars of claim dated 09 
September 2015 alleges that during or about 4 
March 2013 at Braamfontein, Johannesburg, the 
plaintiff represented by its managing director Mr 
10 
Makhensa Mabunda and the defendant represented 
by 
Dr 
Daniel 
Mthimkulu 
head 
of 
PRASA 
Engineering 
Services 
concluded 
an 
oral 
agreement, he is saying that is the material 
management and [indistinct] 10.10 agreement.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now you say that that was an oral 
agreement – well, that is what it was alleged.   
MR MOGASHOA:   That is what is pleaded in the 
particulars of claim. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  What was the amount that is claimed 
20 
– and I think you will find it at paragraph 2.3.6 on page 
329.   
MR MOGASHOA:    
“The plaintiff alleges that the defendant is indebted 
to the sum of R70 628 118.59.” 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 45 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in regard to the amount of the claim, 
the particulars of claim alleged that there was a R17 
million contract concluded by an organ of state of the 
basis of an oral agreement. 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is what the particulars of claim 
said. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then if you look at your defences, they 
start at 2.3.10, could you indicate what those defences 
are? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Chair, I am saying on paragraph 2.3.10 
10 
that: 
“The plea denied the conclusion of the alleged oral 
agreement 
between 
plaintiff 
and 
its 
representatives.  In the alternative, it is alleged 
that Mthimkulu was not duly authorised by the 
defendant  to conclude the agreement on behalf of 
defendant.  The defendant did not at any time 
represent 
the 
plaintiff 
that 
Mthimkulu 
was 
authorised 
to 
conclude 
the 
agreement 
on 
its 
behalf.  The defendant is in law not bound by the 
20 
agreement 
and 
the 
agreement 
is 
in 
law 
not 
enforceable against it and the plaintiff ought to 
have attached to its particulars of claim written 
part of the agreement and its failure to do so is 
prejudicial to the formulation of the defendant’s 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 46 of 182 
 
defence.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Before we go on with the rest of the 
defences 
may 
I 
make 
or 
raise 
this 
with 
you, 
the 
Chairperson had earlier asked you whether the question of 
the jurisdictional point was taken in respect of all the 
claims.  Why could it not be taken in respect of this claim? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I imagine it is because there was no 
agreement to refer to wherein such a clause existed that 
in the event of dispute the matter be referred for 
arbitration. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Which made it different from the other 
written agreement. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I imagine – ja, indeed so, this would 
be different from the others. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright, then in 2.3.11 you raise a further - 
- I mean, a further defence is raised and what is that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I am saying there that: 
“In addition the defendant pleaded that project 
charter 
attached 
to 
PMC1 
of 
the 
amended 
particulars of claim was not prepared by it but no 
20 
agreement was reached between the parties of 
getting extensions but plaintiff had no capacity and 
skills to render the services indicated therein and 
that plaintiff did not render any of the services for 
which payment is claimed.  
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 47 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Right and then in 2.3.12 – Chairperson, 
sorry, may I indicate, I understand it is teatime, I am just 
wondering if I should not finish this and then we could 
break for tea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is just another few clauses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  2.3.12. 
MR MOGASHOA:   In 2.3.12 I say that: 
“The 
defendant 
also 
admitted 
receipt 
of 
the 
10 
plaintiff’s invoices but pleaded that the plaintiff did 
not render services for which the invoices were 
rendered and that plaintiff did not deliver the 
deliverables 
contemplated 
in 
invoices. 
 
It 
is 
pleaded further that some of the invoices submitted 
by the plaintiff do not fall under any of what the 
plaintiff alleges was the scope of works that is 
contemplated in POC1 and POC2.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now this again harks back to what was 
said in respect of two other claims, in other words there is 
20 
a disjuncture between the claim and the annexures that 
the plaintiff had relied on. 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is indeed so. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 48 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Those are the defences in regard to this 
claim.  Mr Chairperson maybe this would be the [indistinct 
– dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I understood you to say you wanted 
to just wrap up the one before we …[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, those were the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja before we take the adjournment. 
ADV SONI SC:  There are no more... 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought let us take the tea adjournment 
and when you come back you finalise the remaining claims if 
10 
you have not covered all the ones you wanted to cover. 
ADV SONI SC:  I thought we would cover all the claims, 
Chairperson.  It has an importance in relation to the fact that 
an agreement was reached. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine, we will – all I am 
saying is, let us take the tea break now. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when we come back you can 
continue. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, [indistinct – dropping voice and 
20 
recording distorted] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  We will adjourn for tea now and it 
is twenty minutes past eleven.  We will resume at twenty to 
twelve.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 49 of 182 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Switch on your mic. 
ADV SONI SC:    Mr Mogashoa we were on, we just 
finished the third, the defences to the third claim you will 
recall before the tea interval.  Mr Mogashoa? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, I do recall.  
ADV SONI SC:   We go to the fourth claim which is 
reflected at paragraph 2.4 of MM4 which is your report on 
the Siyaya matters as at page 330.    
MR MOGASHOA:   Okay, I am on it.  
10 
ADV SONI SC:   What case number was this? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We have got case number 47598 of 
2016.  
ADV SONI SC:   And who was the plaintiff or claimant in 
that matter? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It says here that the plaintiff is Siyaya 
DB Consulting Engineers Ltd against PRASA.  
ADV SONI SC:   And what was the claim in respect of if 
you look at paragraph 2.4.2 of your report? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that the summary of their 
20 
claim is that on the 31 s t of March 2011 at Braamfontein, 
Johannesburg.  The plaintiff DB International GMBH and 
the 
defendant 
concluded 
a 
written 
memorandum 
of 
understanding in terms of where they agreed to cooperate 
according to the terms of the MOU in the field of integrated 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 50 of 182 
 
passenger and railway operations on the basis of the 
specific agreements for the benefit of the parties in order 
to improve various initiatives of taking current strategy 
cooperation in the following projects.    
ADV SONI SC:   Yes and in – now that is an MOU and then 
at 2.4.3 you indicate more specifically what the claim was 
based on.   
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that the plaintiff alleges 
further that pursuant the conclusion of the MOU the parties 
entered into a written agreement on the 30 t h of July 2013 
10 
with the plaintiff dually represented by Miss Zolani Vuma 
and the defendant represented by Mr Lucky Montana.    
ADV SONI SC:   Alright then you set out the defences 
which start at paragraph 2.4.8 on page 331.  
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, we then state in our paragraph 
2.4.8 Chair that the defendant’s plea indicated that in the 
light of the fact that the validity period of the consultancy 
agreement 
between 
the 
plaintiff 
and 
the 
defendant 
commenced on 15 July 2015.  It follows that such validity 
period came to an end by no later than 28 February 2014.  
20 
In the premise there was no longer an agreement between 
the plaintiff and the defendant in terms of which the 
plaintiff could lawfully render service to the defendant and 
in terms of which the defendant would be obliged to make 
payment.  To – I am sure he wanted to say to the plaintiff.  
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 51 of 182 
 
Due to the fact that the consultancy agreement upon which 
the plaintiff realised had come to an end by affliction of 
time by no later than 28 February 2014.  Accordingly, the 
defendant is not – in terms of the consultancy agreement 
upon which the plaintiff realised liable to the plaintiff for 
any services allegedly rendered by the plaintiff after 28 
February 2014 or for damages claimed in this proceedings.         
ADV SONI SC:   Right then you raised three other 
defences there in paragraph 2.4.9, 2.4.10 and 2.4.11.  
What are those? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   We – in those paragraphs say that the 
first one the plea also denies that the plaintiff ever carried 
out additional scope of work which was not contemplated in 
the consultancy agreement upon which plaintiff realised.  
Alternatively, that the work that the plaintiff alleges to have 
carried 
out 
was 
authorised 
by 
the 
defendant. 
 The 
defendant also denies that the plaintiff ever presented a 
concept design to the depot steering committee.  Secondly, 
we say that the plaintiff also raised a defence that by the 
time 
the 
motivations 
referred 
to 
in 
the 
plaintiff’s 
20 
motivations plan was submitted.  The term from the 
consultancy agreement had lapsed and that it was no 
longer 
competent 
for 
the 
plaintiff 
to 
submit 
a 
motivation/variation orders.  And lastly we say that the 
plea also alleges that the plaintiff acted in an unreasonable 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 52 of 182 
 
and negligent manner in believing that the services were 
rendered as contemplated in the consultancy agreement in 
that the variation orders were not authorised by the 
defendant and that plaintiff failed to realise that the 
consultancy agreement contract had lapsed.              
ADV SONI SC:   Then the fifth claim is reflected at 
paragraph 2.5, who was the claimant in that matter?  
MR MOGASHOA:   The claimant in that matter or the 
plaintiff is Siyaya Rail Solutions Pty Ltd against PRASA 
and I see that the reports says that it is under case number 
10 
47597 of 2016.  
ADV SONI SC:   Yes and if you look at paragraph 2.5.5 
then you will see what the amount of that claim is or the 
amount of the contract.    
MR MOGASHOA:   The paragraph states that further that 
the parties agreed that the plaintiff will render services to 
the defendant in terms of the aforementioned agreement 
whose 
contract 
price 
was 
an 
amount 
of 
R69million 
inclusive of VAT.  
ADV SONI SC:   And if you look at paragraph 2.5.8 that 
20 
reflects that is on page 333 the amount of the claim, and 
what was that amount? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Sorry Chair, which paragraph? 
ADV SONI SC:   At paragraph 2.5.8 at the top of page 333.  
MR MOGASHOA:   Okay our paragraph says that it as a 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 53 of 182 
 
result of this breach of agreement the plaintiff now claims 
that the defendant is indebted to it to an amount of R21 
626 138.00  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure you meant alleged breach 
there.    
MR MOGASHOA:   Well yes Chair I am sure, I am sure it is 
repeated in other paragraphs that it is an allegation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure Siyaya would have been happy 
to see that you did not say alleged you said breached.   
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Soni.  
ADV SONI SC:   As you please Chairperson and then at 
paragraph 2.5.10 you set out the first leg of the defence or 
the first defence.  
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that the defendant’s plea 
disputed the fact that plaintiffs current claim is based on a 
consultancy agreement and same as therefore irrelevant 
for purposes of this proceedings.  
ADV SONI SC:   Alright and at 2.5.11 you raise a further 
defence.  
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   We state there that the plea further 
denied the conclusion of the additional service agreement 
and in the alternative, we pleaded that in the event that it 
is found that the additional services agreement was 
concluded between the plaintiff and the defendant then in 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 54 of 182 
 
that event the defendant pleads as follows.  At the 
conclusion of the additional services agreement was not 
dually authorised by the defendant that Sonic Baltic was 
not dually authorised to conclude the additional services.  
Agreement that the defendant did not at any stage 
represent to the plaintiff that Sonic Baltic was dually 
authorised to conclude the additional services agreement 
referred to in paragraph 11 of the particulars of claim and 
lastly that the additional services agreement upon which 
the plaintiff realised it is not valid and binding upon 
10 
defendant and it is in law unenforceable against defendant 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
its 
conclusion 
was 
not 
dually 
authorised by the defendant.        
ADV SONI SC:   And then at 2.5.12 you raised a further 
defence is set out, what is that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that the defendant also 
alleged that the contents of Annexure S3 of the plaintiff’s 
particulars of claim does not indicate or suggest the 
alleged conclusion of a written agreement and that same 
cannot be construed to constitute a written agreement.      
20 
ADV SONI SC:   And paragraph 2.5.13? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We say there that the defendant’s plea 
admits Age AC did not submit a variation order but 
defendant denies that same is linked to the alleged 
additional service agreement.   
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 55 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:   And I think 2.5.14 and 15 you raised two 
further defences are raised, what are those?  
MR MOGASHOA:   We saying defendant also denied that 
the plaintiff ever submitted the report setting out services 
rendered and that the invoices submitted by the plaintiff 
were ever adequately explained to the plaintiff or by the 
plaintiff rather and we also say that the defendant denies 
that it made any representations relating to approvals 
authorisations 
and 
variations 
in 
relation 
to 
services 
allegedly rendered by the plaintiff.   
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Okay then the sixth claim is reflected at 
paragraph 2.6 but before I ask you to set out what that 
claim is can, I ask you please to look at paragraph 2.6.8 on 
page 334 in relation to that claim.    
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, I see the paragraph.   
ADV SONI SC:   What does that say? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The paragraph says that on the 13 t h of 
April 2016 we received correspondence from our opponents 
who informed us that there client had been paid the full 
amount that they were claiming and proposed that the 
20 
defendant 
tenders 
a 
cost 
of 
the 
proceedings. 
 
We 
thereafter sought instructions from client to no avail.     
ADV SONI SC:   But effectively what was the effect of the 
fact that payment had been made? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The matter in as far as the litigation is 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 56 of 182 
 
concerned was not proceeded with.  
ADV SONI SC:   In other words, it had become settled 
effectively.  
MR MOGASHOA:   It had become settled.  I believed that 
at some point the client confirmed that position and we 
went on to close our file.  
ADV SONI SC:   Now Mr Mogashoa in – what was the 
purpose of your drawing up of this report?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that it would appear that 
in all of these claims Siyaya claims that you have covered 
10 
in all except one the plaintiff was the same namely Siyaya 
DB and GBR Consultants Pty Ltd and the only one where 
the plaintiff seems to have been a different legal entity 
though also under Siyaya was the one called Siyaya Rail 
Solutions Pty Ltd.  Is my observation correct?  
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct it is indeed so.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV SONI SC:   So Mr Mogashoa what - to come back to 
my question what was the purpose of this memorandum 
report whatever one wants to call it?   
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   We were instructed by the legal 
department of PRASA to prepare the report and in my 
understanding the board or the chairperson of the board 
had called for it.  But I remember we were told that there 
was a need for us to urgently prepare a status report in 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 57 of 182 
 
respect of all of the Siyaya matters that we - or our firm 
was defending   
ADV SONI SC:   Now based on this report and based on 
the defences that had been raised and having regard to the 
instructions you had received.  What was your view you 
were 
the 
instructing 
attorney 
of 
the 
prospects 
of 
successfully defending these claims?     
CHAIRPERSON:   Before he answers if he is able to 
answer that it is fine I am just thinking that if you are 
involved in the matter you might have discussions with 
10 
your client and for whatever happens we might not want to 
tell other people what you told your client about the merits 
but if he feels comfortable that would be fine.      
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you understand that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it may well be an opinion on the 
prospects maybe based on the legal department of PRASA 
what they took or on somebody independent other than the 
person who was handling it but if he feels comfortable to 
20 
answer the question there is no problem.     
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson with respect here you have 
made a separate point that he is separately valid and that 
is we know as a fact that the claims have not been pursued 
since the Judge Tuckt ordered and it may be inappropriate. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 58 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SONI SC:   So I would rather leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay no that is fine.   
ADV SONI SC:   Now this is the report that is dated the 
21 s t of November 2017, is that correct Mr Mogashoa? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct that is the date of the report.   
ADV SONI SC:   Now let us go back to your affidavit which 
is SS13 in bundle G.  After you submitted this report what 
happened?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I interrupt you again…[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni do not forget your question.  I 
made a note in regard to this report Mr Mogashoa to the 
effect that it did not deal with the merits of the claims by 
which I meant it said nothing prospects of success.  And I 
think at the beginning of the report there is a note you 
made towards along the lines that it should not be read as 
constituting your advice on the way forward or that kind of 
thing.  Do you remember that note?     
MR MOGASHOA:   Would it be Chair on the first page of 
20 
the report we just went through now? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SONI SC:   If you look at paragraph 1.3 I think that is 
where we make the disclaimer there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I got the impression when I read that 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 59 of 182 
 
part that you did not want it.  Your intention was not to say 
anything about the prospects of success but it was just to 
say what has happened and where are we with regard to 
this litigation.  Is that correct?     
MR MOGASHOA:   That is indeed so Chair but I think my 
paragraph 1.3 if you look at it, it invites client to call for 
such a report if they need a report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they need it, ja yes.  
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the reason why I made that note 
10 
may have been that I read somewhere and I do not know if 
it was that Makubela’s document but I read somewhere I 
think where somebody said but the report does not deal 
with the prospects of success or the merits.  And I went to 
look at the report and I picked that up that it did not deal 
with that but I think I only saw the note at the beginning of 
your report when Mr Soni was pointing it out earlier.  So 
you did not intend in that report to express any view on the 
prospects of success but you expected client to approach 
you if they wanted such an opinion.    
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct Chair I think the update report 
as I understood the instruction at the time was that I 
provide a status report on the nature of the claims and 
what our attitude as PRASA is towards them and I think 
this is precisely what I did.  We all know as members of the 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 60 of 182 
 
same profession how challenging such requests from 
clients are when you are expected to almost give some 
idea what the court would do with the case in as far as the 
merits are concerned.  So I was to be comfortable about 
the information and evidence that is availed to us and 
advise of our clients that we are of the view that the 
defences would carry.  And we were at that point prepared 
to follow through with that instructions to defend PRASA in 
all of this matters given the information available to us at 
the time.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.    
ADV SONI SC:   Now as I say this report is there to the 
21 s t of November.  You thereafter there is a report here 
dated the 28 t h of October.  
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Well before we get to that report what led 
to that report being prepared by yourself?  
MR MOGASHOA:   After we dispatched with the report that 
we have just gone through the 21 s t of November I think a 
couple of days down the line I received a call and an email 
20 
from Mr Dingiswayo which has attached what we now as a 
memorandum from the chairperson of the board in which 
there were certain enquiries that the Chair had put to I 
imagine process legal teal or legal department.  And in 
respect of which Mr Dingiswayo request was that I 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 61 of 182 
 
comment on the arrears of the memorandum that made 
reference or to our involvement in the matters.  And I think 
this is firstly how I then considered the memorandum that 
as read to me and prepared the second report.     
ADV SONI SC:   But before we get to your second report 
let us look at the documents that you referred to that Mr 
Dingiswayo gave you.  Have a look at MN6…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of which bundle?   
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry there in Annexure 2 Miss Ngoye’s 
affidavit bundle E1 page 344.   
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, I am on it.  
ADV SONI SC:   Is this the memorandum you talking 
about? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry at what page is it? 
ADV SONI SC:   Page 334 Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   On the same bundle? 
ADV SONI SC:   Of Miss Ngoye’s…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   E1? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, E1 yes Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   If I am not mistaken, I may have 
attached what I received at that time and I am not sure if 
they are the same.   
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry, sorry I must apologise please look 
at MN5 not MN7. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 62 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is MN5?  
ADV SONI SC:   338.  
CHAIRPERSON:   338?  
ADV SONI SC:   Yes Chair.  
ADV SONI SC:   Is this the memorandum you received? 
MR MOGASHOA:   This is the memorandum I received.  If 
you do not mind me checking I may have referred to the 
memorandum I just want to see.    
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, it is at paragraph 23 of your affidavit 
Mr Mogashoa.  
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   But I touch on it? 
ADV SONI SC:   No you did not.  
MR MOGASHOA:   Okay that is fine.  
ADV SONI SC:   You referred to MN5 in paragraph 23.  
MR MOGASHOA:   No then that is fine then this is the 
memo, yes.  
ADV SONI SC:   Now we do not have to go through the 
whole memo jut certain parts that I want to go through.  
Who is the memo addressed to?  
MR MOGASHOA:  It says here that it is addressed to the 
20 
acting group chief executive officer Mr Zide.  
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, and from whom is it? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It says it is from the chairperson interim 
board advocated here in Makobelezi.  
ADV SONI SC:   And what is the date of the memo?  
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 63 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:   It says 28 November 2017.  
ADV SONI SC:   And what is the subject matter?  
MR MOGASHOA:   Siyaya Consulting Engineering Pty Ltd 
(liquidation) enquiry in terms of section 417 one and 418, 2 
of the companies active to that we submitted.   
ADV SONI SC:   Now this is a report, this is the section 
417 report that you refer to quite often in your affidavit.  
Would I be correct?    
MR MOGASHOA:   Well it may be so.  
ADV SONI SC:   I am not saying you I am saying the 
10 
reference is made to it.   
MR MOGASHOA:   I have made reference to it.  
ADV SONI SC:   Now until today have you seen that report, 
the liquidation report? 
MR MOGASHOA:   You mean the report that is a subject 
matter? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  
MR MOGASHOA:   No I was never placed in possession of 
a copy of that report. I knew it existed but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Face this side and do not be too far from 
20 
your mic, because I cannot hear you when you are too far 
from the mic and certainly when you’re looking away. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I am beginning to like Mr Soni better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see you are not the only witness who 
does that, I think a lot of witnesses like the evidence 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 64 of 182 
 
leaders more than the Chairperson.   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   I think they are more intimidated by you. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Thank you Chair.   To answer the 
question, I have not seen the report up until today.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now before we get to the report, and I just 
wanted to place it in context because that is the subject 
matter, this is addressed to Mr Zide, the memorandum from 
the Chairperson.  In your preparation for the Siyaya please 
and the developments thereafter, what communications did 
10 
you have with Mr Zide? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I think at that point in time none 
whatsoever, I had been engaging with the legal department 
and I think in the beginning I said Ms Ngoye, Mr 
Dingiswayo and Ms Makwete. 
ADV SONI SC:   Those are the people with whom you dealt 
in regard to the Siyaya matters? 
MR MOGASHOA:   In regard to the Siyaya matters, correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   And as at the date of this memo had you 
had any dealings with the Chairperson of the Interim 
20 
Board, now Judge Makhubele? 
MR MOGASHOA:   When you say dealings are you 
referring to whether I ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:   Interactions, personal interactions. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Personal interactions, yes when she 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 65 of 182 
 
was an advocate of the Pretoria Bar Council.   I have had 
to work with her when I was at the previous law firm, I used 
to be a partner at Geldenhuys Malatji. 
ADV SONI SC:   But in regard to PRASA? 
MR MOGASHOA:   In regard to PRASA at this stage no, 
not at all. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright.  Now this memo was sent to you 
by Mr Dingiswayo.   
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Let’s just have a look at what the memo 
10 
says if you look at paragraph 1, you could just read that 
into the record. 
MR MOGASHOA:   The memo says that I referred to 
various ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:   Sorry, could you see and identify to whom 
it is addressed? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It is addressed to Mr Zide. 
ADV SONI SC:   But the memo then starts off with 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:   Dear Mr Zide.   
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And paragraph 1 thereof says: 
“I refer to various discussions between us about 
this matter as well as our brief discussion with the 
Group Executive : Legal Risk and Compliance, Ms 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 66 of 182 
 
Martha Ngoye on 14 November 2017.” 
ADV SONI SC:   Then the next paragraph refers to your 
report which we have just been through, that is MN4, would 
that be correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes it refers to a – our report dated 21 
November of 2017.   
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. And then she makes the point that 
Siyaya DB had been placed under liquidation.  That is the 
last paragraph – the last sentence of that paragraph, would 
that be correct? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes I am aware that in our course of 
dealing with the group some of the companies went into 
liquidation, and at that time, which is November 2017, yes 
we were fully aware as PRASA’s legal representatives that 
there were liquidation proceedings that were – or had been 
conducted.    
ADV SONI SC:    Ja, if you turn to paragraph 3 you will see 
what the Chairperson says about your firm’s role in it, just 
read that into the record please.   
MR MOGASHOA:  It says it is not clear from the report of 
20 
Mogashoa Diale Attorneys whether they were subsequently 
appointed to present PRASA to deal with the liquidation 
matter.  As acting Group CEO such instructions would have 
come from you. 
ADV SONI SC:  Well if we could just pause there for a 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 67 of 182 
 
moment. Did you receive instructions from PRASA in regard 
to the liquidation matter? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes correct we did. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right and from whom in PRASA? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It would have been from legal either Mr – 
the three PRASA colleagues I have made reference to.  
Because they would instruct me interchangeable but when I 
communicate, I would communicate by – by to one and 
carbon copy the others.  So I cannot quite remember who in 
particular gave me the instructions but the instruction came 
10 
from either Ms Ngoye, Mr Dingiswayo or Ms Mokothini [?]. 
ADV SONI SC:  Would you copy Mr Zide there on those 
matters? 
MR MOGASHOA:  No I did not have to. 
ADV SONI SC:  And why do you say that you did not have 
to? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Because he had not been involved at any 
stage with any of the matters or in any of what we as legal 
representatives would have had to deal with on behalf of 
PRASA in defending the matter. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  How long had you been acting for PRASA as 
at the time of this memorandum which is November 2017? 
MR MOGASHOA:  You mean our firm or…? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, no your firm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Our firm has been doing work for – since 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 68 of 182 
 
2012. 
ADV SONI SC:  And during that period who were your 
communications 
with 
– 
yours 
and 
your 
firm’s 
communications? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It would have been with the legal 
department on what we call corporate matters or it would 
have been with the insurance department if it – if it is 
liability instructions. 
ADV SONI SC:  But in regard to the litigation with whom? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Corporate litigation it would have been Ms 
10 
Ngoye, Mr Dingiswayo or Ms Mokothini. 
ADV SONI SC:  And what role would the CEO play in that 
process? 
MR MOGASHOA:  We have not had to deal with the CEO in 
respect of the matters we were dealing with at the time. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then in paragraph 4 the Chairperson makes 
a point about the arbitration and she asks whether it 
happened before or after the liquidation application.  Look at 
paragraph 4. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Must I read it out? 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:   
“It also appears from the report that at some point the 
matters were referred to arbitration but what is not clear is 
whether these – this happened – consulting engineers went 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 69 of 182 
 
into liquidation or not.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And can you shed any light on that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I think in – if – we had agreed and I could 
be wrong but my recollection tells me that at the time we 
agreed as parties to refer the matters for liquidation. 
ADV SONI SC:  For arbitration. 
MR MOGASHOA:  For arbitration rather, information had not 
come 
forth 
at 
the 
time 
that 
there 
were 
liquidation 
proceedings in respect of the Siyaya Group of Companies.  
But it came out that way before we could have arbitration 
10 
proceedings to hear the matter that the Siyaya Group of 
Companies 
or 
some 
of 
them 
had 
volunteered 
to 
be 
liquidated. 
ADV SONI SC:  So the fact that there had been liquidation 
did not affect the – the referral to arbitration, would that be 
correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Not necessarily.  I think when I was – on 
our side and for our part we – we then encouraged the legal 
representative of the Siyaya Group of matters to give us the 
relevant Rule 7.1 authority to continue acting for them even 
20 
though there was – there may have been a provisional 
liquidation order at the time I cannot remember and which 
mandates we received from [indistinct 00:05:14]. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright then at paragraph 5 perhaps you 
should read that into the record. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 70 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Paragraph 5 states: 
“That you are aware that attorneys acting for Siyaya 
Consulting Engineers approached on or about 14 November 
2017 and that they provided me with a copy of an interim 
report of the inquiry in terms of the Company’s Act that was 
prepared by the Commissioner and dated 15 September 
2017.  They also attached copies of email communication 
between Mr Madimpe Mogashoa of Mogashoa Diale and 
Advocate Francois Botes SC.  The email communication is 
also attached in Mogashoa Diale Attorneys Report.” 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Now this interim report is the interim report 
in relation to the 417 inquiry, would that be correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I – I imagine so.  I cannot say with 
certainty but the subject refers to that inquiry in terms of 
Section 417. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes Mr Mogashoa let us get to – on a 
number of occasions in your affidavit you say I have not 
seen the report.  What report are you talking about? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It must be this report. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is this report. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  Well I accept that.  I saw the report only 
today.  So there will be challenges with – on my part to 
confirm with precision what all of this reports talk about and 
they talk about the interim report.  I saw it only today. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes okay.  Now in regard to this report 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 71 of 182 
 
referral is made to it here and then you thereafter met the 
Chairperson of the Board later and at that – we are going to 
come to it referral was made to this report as well.  What 
was your attitude towards commenting on the effect of the 
report on the litigation or the prospects of the defences 
exceeding? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I – whatever the report would be 
mentioned I would make the point that it would be difficult for 
me to comment on it in relation to the litigation without 
having seen it.  And I made the point that although we had 
10 
agreed at the conclusion of the liquidation inquiry hearings 
that the report be made available to us redacted as may be.  
The report was never made available to us.  I believe I made 
enquiries from our opponents whether they had received the 
report themselves or not.  I do not think I received any 
answer that was positive in that regard.  We may have also 
written to the Commissioner to enquire about the availability 
of the report and we never got a copy of such reports until I 
started hearing about it around November/December when 
we then were involved in meetings with PRASA represented 
20 
by the Chairperson of the Board. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in paragraph 6 she – the Chairperson 
refers to certain communications from PRASA members.  
Could you just read that into the report and we can deal with 
that in a moment? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 72 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  The report further reads on paragraph 6 
that in the report. 
“Diale Mogashoa Attorneys indicated that they became aware 
on 20 August 2017 after receiving communication from 
PRASA that certain members have received subpoena to 
appear in the liquidation inquiry.  They attended the inquiry 
but were not allowed to cross-examine witnesses.  They also 
alleged that the Commissioner has not provided them with 
the report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay and the paragraph continues on the 
10 
next page. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Oh does it? 
“That is continues to say you have noted from the bundle of 
the documents from Siyaya’s attorneys that these assertions 
may not be entirely correct.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now just – just pause for a moment. This is 
in – she is talking about the assertions that your firm made.  
That is what the Chairperson is talking about. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is what I understand her to be 
saying.  Correct. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Well would – are any of those assertions 
incorrect? 
MR MOGASHOA:  No they are correct.  Specifically, if – if it 
is about whether we had at the time received the report or 
the interim report or not. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 73 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  And then she continues on as if you could 
continue at paragraph 6. 
MR MOGASHOA:  alright it says: 
“However as acting Group CEO instructions with regard to 
the liquidation inquiry proceedings and handling of the high 
quotations would have come from you.  Kindly confirm the 
nature of the instructions that were given to Mogashoa Diale 
in this regard.  Please attach copies of such instructions.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And what is your reaction to that?   That the 
instructions would have come from Mr Zide? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  I think in the second report that I 
prepared we deal with – we deal with what is contained in 
the Chairperson’s Report and we clarify issues that may 
have at the time been of concern to us as a law firm.  So 
obviously instructions that our firm had been receiving up to 
that point were from legal.  There would not have been any 
interaction between us and the acting CEO when it comes to 
their group of litigated matters. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Then read paragraph 7 please. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It reads that: 
20 
“It is clear from the interim report of the Commissioner that 
the witnesses that testified at the liquidation inquiry include 
former and existing employees of PRASA.  These witnesses 
would have attended the inquiry with your knowledge and 
understanding of the evidence that they were going to 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 74 of 182 
 
tender.” 
ADV SONI SC:  And then paragraph 8. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It reads that: 
“Should the contents of the Commissioner’s Report be 
correct it is clear that the witnesses made major concessions 
with regard to the liability of PRASA in the civil actions 
launched by Siyaya Consulting Engineers now in liquidation?  
However, 
despite 
these 
concessions 
Mogashoa 
Diale 
appeared to still want to proceed with the arbitration 
proceedings.  They however did not address the prospects of 
10 
success at that arbitration proceedings in view of the 
evidence that has already been led at the liquidation 
inquiry.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And then it continues.  I want to ask 
you a few questions on paragraph 8.  Just finish paragraph 8 
please. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Alright it continues to say: 
“Kindly confirm if these are your instructions to Mogashoa 
Diale and the nature of evidence and witnesses that you 
intend to lead at the pending arbitration proceedings.” 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Now let us just deal with the assertion that 
the witnesses made major concessions at the arbitration and 
this is – these are the PRASA witnesses.  Let us get your 
role at the arbitration.  You were allowed to sit for part of the 
Section 417 inquiry, would that be correct? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 75 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And that would be in regard to the PRASA 
employees. 
MR MOGASHOA:  PRASA employees ja who were at the time 
still in PRASA’s employment. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Now in regard to them where the – 
where major concessions made and you sat in that inquiry? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It will be difficult for me to confirm 
whether they had made any – any concessions that were of 
any significance or not.  I can tell you how we then tie up the 
10 
proceedings as was the case at the time.  Questions were – 
questions we had never seen before they put to the 
witnesses.  We were not allowed to participate by asking 
questions of clarity or asking questions to the witnesses and 
so forth.  And this is why we immediately made the point that 
we would wish to be placed in possession of the report when 
it becomes available particularly where it refers to the 
testimony or otherwise of the PRASA officials because we 
would have had to then take instructions from our client 
thereabout.  Now the arrangements with the Commissioner 
20 
was that we as PRASA’s legal team should facilitate some 
communication between the PRASA officials who testified 
and Mr Makhensa Mabunda who I believe represented 
Siyaya.  In order to establish whether they would be any 
agreement that may lead to either settlements or resolution 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 76 of 182 
 
of the matters.  We then were engaged in numerous 
consultations 
with 
the 
same 
officials 
about 
what 
we 
understood at the Commissioner’s Inquiry or commission to 
have been about and there are reports that I filed that I refer 
to in the – in the – in my affidavit that confirms that we could 
not come up with any information which necessitated that we 
consider looking at the claims in the arbitration differently 
from what would have been the case before the liquidations 
inquiries. 
ADV SONI SC:  So in effect when you look at what happened 
10 
at the liquidation inquiry then you had these consultations 
and the idea as I understand it at the liquidation inquiry was 
that Mr Mabunda and these individual employees will get 
together to see if they could reach some figure. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  As to what PRASA is owing. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  You then wrote to the Commission, is that 
correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  And what was the thrust of your letters? 
MR MOGASHOA:  The thrust of our letters would be that we 
– we could not establish any facts that would have 
necessitated that we – we engage or witnesses engage with 
Mr Mabunda with a view to – within mind perhaps to 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 77 of 182 
 
establish whether there could be some agreement on the 
amounts still owed if amounts were still outstanding and all 
that a settlement be looked into seriously more than may 
have 
been 
the 
case 
before. 
 
We 
as 
PRASA’s 
legal 
representative could not find anything that suggested that. 
ADV SONI SC:  That the case that you had pleaded was a 
weak case? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That the case that we had pleaded was a 
weak case. I can give an example so that we – we get to 
some – we get somewhere in understanding what was before 
10 
us at the time.  When I was going through the – the report 
you may have picked up that for example we would say that 
PRASA is not liable because there was no authority for 
PRASA to enter into such arrangements as may have been 
pleaded.  The witnesses may have been interrogated on the 
same works that we as external legal representatives are 
disputing that we authorised.  So the – we will not be talking 
at the same level when I am defending the matters by raising 
for example defences like you know ultra vires or lack of 
authority when the commission was dealing with whether 
20 
those services as may have been disputed by us already 
were rendered or not.  Or whether the invoices … 
ADV SONI SC:  I was asking a diff – oh sorry. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Or whether the invoices were – it may 
have been an issue that dealt with whether invoices were 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 78 of 182 
 
submitted in return for services rendered when our case was 
– the invoices as presented to us are not in continents with 
the annexures or the schedules that describe precisely what 
their services should be.  So once again without having had 
the benefit of what value the report carried in as far as the 
alleged concessions were made it was almost impossible for 
us to make do of anything that may have – had to do with the 
inquiry itself. 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 Then 
at 
paragraph 
9.1 
she 
– 
the 
Chairperson says that she will contact – she needs a report 
10 
from you on the defence strategy.  Could you just indicate 
what she says specifically?  Paragraph 9.1 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes Paragraph 9.1 says: 
“I will only and if absolutely necessary and appropriate 
involve former employees that testified after receiving a 
report from you and Ms Ngoye as well as Mogashoa Diale 
Attorneys on your defence strategy particularly in view of the 
concessions by current employees during the liquidation 
inquiry.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  And then she says at paragraph 10 
20 
that you should be advised what was going to happen next 
and what was that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It says that: 
“Please advise Mogashoa Diale Attorneys that I have read 
the report dated 21 November and that we shall revert to 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 79 of 182 
 
them before the end of the week – of next week rather with 
instructions and a decision of further handling of this 
matter.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now did you receive instructions on the 
further handling of the matter? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That – what transpired after perhaps the 
conclusion of the second report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright before we get to the report. 
MR MOGASHOA:  In the context of what she says here we 
never received any further instruction particularly in respect 
10 
of – or with respect to what she says in this report and I 
think I deal with that in the affidavit. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Now in regard to this report – sorry her 
memorandum of the 28 November did you prepare a second 
report? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes subsequent one as requested by Mr 
Dingiswayo we – our firm prepared the second report. 
ADV SONI SC:  And is that the one marked MM7 and 
appearing at page 356 of Bundle E1? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  That would be the report. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Before we go into the report I just want to 
ask because this in a sense was intended as a response to 
what the Chairperson had raised in her memorandum to Mr 
Zide, is that correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Ja it – this report will speak to those 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 80 of 182 
 
areas that involved our firm and I think that is what legal 
through Mr Dingiswayo asked her to do. 
ADV SONI SC:  Asked you to do.  If you look at paragraph 
1.1 of MM7 that is what it says: 
“Given that the report was made available to us yesterday 
we can only accept that the date – well.” 
But that is the report that you are responding to. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Soni.  I think I have – I was 
10 
still focussing on something and you may have moved on to 
something else.  I note that in the – in the Chairperson’s 
memorandum that you have been dealing with she says in 
paragraph 9.1  
“I will only end if absolutely necessary and appropriate 
involve former employees that despite after receiving a 
report from you and Ms Ngoye as well as Mogashoa Diale 
Attorneys on your defence strategy particularly in view of the 
concessions by current employees during the litigation 
inquiry.” 
20 
Now that – this might not affect Mr Mogashoa but I raise it 
because it may be important.  In relation to her dealings with 
the legal department because it seems that as at the date of 
this memorandum, she is still asking Ms Ngoye among others 
to submit reports. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 81 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About what she refers to as their defence 
strategy and of course she refers to Mogashoa Diale 
Attorneys as well.  In relation to the question of her – of the 
allegation that she excluded the legal department it will be 
important to try and establish from when it is alleged 
exclusion happened. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because at this stage she is still wanting 
to involve the legal department. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least in regard to the report.  I think that 
it may be that in regard to giving instructions to the 
attorneys she may be saying those must be given by the 
acting CEO.  So I thought I must mention that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will need to try and establish from 
when did the alleged exclusion take place. 
ADV SONI SC:  EYs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  I am going to deal with that next 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay.  And of course, in the last 
paragraph she does say: 
“The reports from you” 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 82 of 182 
 
We have paragraph 12. 
“The reports from you, Ms Ngoye and the officials indicated 
in paragraph 9” 
That is the paragraph that I am talking about – I was talking 
about. 
“Must reach me on or before twelve o’clock on Friday 12 
November.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
“To enable me to report to the Board of Control on 1 
10 
December.” 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so there will be the question of 
whether apart from the report from Mogashoa Diale Attorneys 
whether there was a report from other people that she 
mentioned in the memorandum. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Mr Mogashoa will not know that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no she – I am just mentioning it for 
some other time. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  I would just – that is a matter that is 
20 
dealt with by Mr Dingiswayo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Where he on the 30 t h submitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  A report. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 83 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  In response to this request for a report from 
Ms Ngoye. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  I suppose because he was dealing with the 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  So – no that is fine.  I seem to 
remember a memorandum from him or a report that went to 
the acting Group CEO. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was meant for the Group – acting 
Group CEO to pass it on I think. 
ADV SONI SC:  To – onto the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is just important to link these two. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  But to come back to the question I am 
going to raise it in the context of what happened after this 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  If I could? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now after you submitted this report – I say 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 84 of 182 
 
this report meaning the report of the 30 November that is 
MM7 what happened next insofar as your dealings with 
PRASA were. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I think what happens next according to my 
affidavit is I was then called into a meeting at PRASA.  Let 
me just see exactly where I deal with that. 
ADV SONI SC:  At paragraphs 24 to 27 Mr Mogashoa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you back to his affidavit? 
ADV SONI SC:  To his affidavit sorry yes Chairperson.  That 
is SS13 in Bundle G. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what paragraph are we in now? 
ADV SONI SC:  24 to 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  24 to 27? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes at page 10 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Would that be correct Mr? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That will be correct yes that is what – 
what happened next is what I say in paragraph 24 of my 
affidavit. 
ADV SONI SC:  So let us – unless you want to read it could 
20 
you explain to the Chairperson what happened on the 4 
December? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we do that and I may have 
missed this.  Can we deal with what was different in their 
report of the 30 November? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 85 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To 2017 compared to the – because the 
earlier report had been done about what ten days before. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And what issues did it seek to 
address. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, sure.  Sure.  Sorry, we can we go back 
to Ms Ngoye’s affidavit, MN7? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Which page? 
ADV SONI SC:  At page 356. 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  This is your report of the 30t h of November. 
MR MOGASHOA:  356.  No, I am on it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  So, you then indicated in paragraph 2 
that... I am so sorry.  At paragraph ...[indistinct] [dip in 
recording]  The fact that you had received the Chairperson’s 
report 26t h(?) [dip in recording] of November.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I think it 28 of November. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  It is correct, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then you deal with the questions that 
she had raised in the email(?) [dip in recording] 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  The first question is:  The litigation 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 86 of 182 
 
and the voluntary... the litigation and the liquidation.  In 
other words, which came first?  You will recall she had asked 
that. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And in essence, what do you say? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I will just summarise the paragraph. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  Separating them through the main detail.  
Well, the introduction that I give there is, the fact that we 
had 
received 
instructions 
from 
PRASA 
which 
[dip 
in 
10 
recording] and that my opponent is... was at the time Mr 
Mathopa of Mathopa Attorneys.  
 
We summarised what was pleaded or we make reference 
to what was pleaded in the various sets of particulars of 
claim. 
 
And that... then I see I make reference to a letter 
marked Annexure A that makes reference to communication 
between the parties in respect of the need for the matters to 
be consolidated. 
 
And 
that 
we 
consider 
defending 
the 
matters 
for 
20 
arbitration.  I confirmed there on paragraph 2.3 that Judge 
Brand was appointed as the arbitrator in the proceedings. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in paragraph 2.6, you say that 
those 
that 
have 
been 
adjourned 
to 
the 
26t h 
to 
the 
29t h of March 2018. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 87 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Ja, but there were dates in September of 
2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, the dates that were in September 
were 11 to 22 September 2017. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes.  No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That appears at paragraph 2.5 of your 
report. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And as that time, that is now as at the 
beginning of December or end of November, it appears that 
10 
the matters, the arbitration was set down for certain days in 
March 2017. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  This then means that... I think 
around the time we were dealing with the liquidation 
inquiries there was a problem with the issue of readiness to 
proceed. 
 
I think we have deliberated and discussed it between the 
parties and I think Advocate ...[indistinct] [00:03:59] may 
have been instrumental in dealing with Advocate Botes about 
...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SONI SC:  But the long and short is ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  [Indistinct]  
ADV SONI SC:  ...it was postponed to the... to March 2018. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It was postponed to March 2018, yes.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 88 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Then in paragraph 3, you deal with 
the Section 417 Inquiry and you made a point in paragraph 
3.1 that you do not have the interim report.  
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, that is what I say in paragraph 3.1.  
But we do not have a copy of the interim report.   
ADV SONI SC:  Ja.  And you then comment on the fact that 
the chairperson had been approached by the attorneys of the 
other side, and what do you say about that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Is it paragraph 3.2. now? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  No, 3.1 still. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Alright.  I say: 
“It is surprising that our opponents have gone onto do 
so and that they went on further to hand over 
documents to the chairperson, which documents 
purportedly carried some weight in enabling the 
parties to assess the claims properly...” 
ADV SONI SC:  So what were you referring to there? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I was referring to the interim report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And the fact that the chairperson in her 
20 
memo had said that she had been approached by the 
attorneys. 
MR MOGASHOA:  The attorneys for the other side. 
ADV SONI SC:  For the other side, yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 89 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Now, do you make... you make the 
point that you do not have the report. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Then I make the point that I... I think 
despite numerous attempts in getting a copy thereof, I still 
did not have it at the time of finalising this memo. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Then in the rest of paragraph 3, you 
set out, more or less, what you have set out earlier about 
what had happened at the liquidation proceedings. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And then at paragraph 3.11, you 
10 
respond to the accession by the chairperson that what you 
had said may not be entirely correct, and what was your 
response to that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I am saying in paragraph 3.11 that: 
“To 
date, 
our 
office 
has 
not 
been 
placed 
in 
possession of any or all of the documents that may 
have been made available to the chairperson of the 
interim board. 
To this end, it is not certain to us under what or 
which context the chairperson that these assertions 
20 
may not be entirely correct...” 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  Then in paragraph 4 and in 
particularly in 4.1, you deal with the question of what the 
effect of the concessions or what effect the concessions 
might have on PRASA’s case.  What do you say about that? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 90 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  We say there that: 
“Although it has been PRASA’s position that it is 
liable to Siyaya despite of the proceedings of the 
inquiry, we, at this stage, submit that it would not be 
possible for us to comment on how the alleged 
concessions made would now affect the crux of the 
defence’s strategy in respect of each and every one 
of the defendant’s matters. 
We would need to have sight of the relevant 
documents 
that 
may 
have 
been 
given 
to 
the 
10 
chairperson including the interim report...” 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, were you ever given those documents, 
the relevant documents that you talked about? 
MR 
MOGASHOA: 
 
I 
was 
never 
given 
any 
additional 
documents, no. 
ADV SONI SC:  So that is the report that you sent on the 
30t h 
in 
response 
to 
the 
chairperson’s 
memo 
of 
the 
28t h of November.   
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in paragraph 3.2 of your report 
20 
that you have just dealt with now... that you and Mr Soni 
have just dealt with, you deny a statement made in the 
PRASA’s Chairperson’s memo in paragraph 5, where she 
says that, if I understand you... understand the...  
 
Ja, where she effectively says that your firm in your 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 91 of 182 
 
report... this is the first report, I take it.  No, I may be 
mistaken. 
 
Oh, so they also attached copies of email communication 
between Mr Madimpe... Oh, that is the attorneys for Siyaya 
who she is talking about, where she says: 
“They also attached copies of email communication 
between Mr Madimpe Mogashoa of Mogashoa Diale 
and Advocate Francoise Botes SC.   
The email communication is also attached in Mr 
Mogashoa, in Mogashoa Diale Attorney’s report... 
10 
 
Oh, she says that: 
“Email communication is also attached to your earlier 
report... 
 
You seem to respond to that in paragraph 3.2 by saying: 
“We would also like to clarify that our previous report 
of 21 November 2017 did not attach any of the email 
communication 
between 
Madimpe 
Mogashoa 
and 
Francois Botes and neither did the report make 
reference to any such communication.  We later in 
this report, however, to the relevant communication, 
20 
as may assist in clarifying some of these issues...” 
 
So you confirm that in your first report, you did not 
attach 
any 
email 
communication, 
such 
as 
the 
email 
communication 
that 
the 
PRASA 
Chairperson’s 
says 
in 
paragraph 5 of her memo, you had attached? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 92 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct Chair.  And I think in 
paragraph 3.2, we just wanted to clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So if she got any such email, it 
certainly was not from you? 
MR MOGASHOA:  They were not from my office, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson, if I can put in context?  Do you 
recall that the text annexed to Mr Botes’ affidavit is the 
liquidator’s report and the email communications that the 
chairperson is talking about. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m-h’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  So that is... So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is she... maybe she could be saying... 
she might not be saying the email communication was 
attached to their report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she might be saying, the email 
communication between them and either Mr Botes or Siyaya 
Attorneys was attached to that report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Attached to that report, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  Because that is the report, she received 
from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that that last line of paragraph 5 
of her memo says: 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 93 of 182 
 
“The 
email 
communication 
is 
also 
attached 
in 
Mogashoa Diale Attorney’s report..” 
ADV SONI SC:  Which she... with respect, she does in fact 
say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  But...but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So what I was seeking to confirm is 
whether that is factually true. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I read paragraph 3.2 of Mogashoa 
10 
Diale Attorney’s second report as denying that. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding in line with yours? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes.  It is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And Mr Mogashoa, you confirm that 
to the extent that she says in her paragraph 5, to the extent 
that she may be meaning that in your first report you had 
attached such email communication.  You say that is not 
true? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, I was trying to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously, if she means something else, 
that is different. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ja, sure. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 94 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  We ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  I was just trying to make the point that there 
is no dispute that she received that from Mr Botes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Because that... Mr Botes said so in their 
meeting of the 14t h of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
Where 
he 
handed 
her 
the 
report 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course, she says this email 
communication was attached to their report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the only report that she could be 
talking about at that time is the first report. 
ADV SONI SC:  The first report ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Mogashoa says that is factually not 
20 
true. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is correct.  Now, you say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that we have gone past one. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 95 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would like us to finish if we can. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought we would finish before twelve or 
around twelve but the matter we have dealt with are 
important. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think we should be able... I do not 
know what your own assessment is.  In 30-minutes time or 
so? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  I... that is my assessment Chairperson, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So let us continue. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you need... if anybody needs a 
comfort break, we can take that but if we can move on and 
try and finish by half-past, let us do so. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, on the 4t h of December, if we could just 
summarise these aspects please Mr Mogashoa.  What 
20 
happened on the 4t h? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Around the 4t h of December, I got a call 
from Mr Zide whom I believe was acting Chief Executive 
Officer of PRASA at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Speak closer to the mic again. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 96 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Apologies about that Chair.  I received a 
call from Mr Zide who indicated to me that the Chairperson, 
Ms Makhubela, wanted to see me about issues related to 
this, Siyaya Group of matters. 
 
My colleague and I, Ms Mbebe, and I went to PRASA’s 
offices.  I imagine it, it was in the... during the same day.  
We were ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  At paragraph 25, you say what the purpose 
10 
of the meeting was.  What was the purpose of the meeting? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  I say there that at the meeting 
the chairperson raised concerns about the fact that my firm 
was involved in formulating responses to her memo of the 
28t h of November when she, in fact, had wanted the Group 
CEO to respond and perhaps with the assistance of the 
internal legal department in that certainly ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  No, but sorry Mr Mogashoa. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  I understand you are making a different 
20 
point.  If you read paragraph 25.  Her unhappiness stemmed 
from the fact that it was distributed to you. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  I think I am saying the same 
thing. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 97 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, that she expressed some discomfort 
about the fact that the memo was distributed to me. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now in regard to that memo, what did 
she want? 
MR MOGASHOA:  She did not say anything further than the 
fact that she expressed unhappiness about the fact of the 
memo ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Well, if look at para... the rest of paragraph 
25, you say she wanted you to hand the memo back. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, I can finish my point on that. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:  So she expressed her unhappiness about 
the fact that I was... I had been given the memo, and she is 
aware that there may have been a report that I prepared in 
response thereto and that she was not interested in that 
report. 
 
She asked that I hand back the memo but I made the 
point that I had received the memo electronically but if she 
wanted our firm to discard of the memo, we would do so 
when we get to the office. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that you say in that paragraph, you 
say that she said she was not going to accept your report of 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 98 of 182 
 
30 November 2017 that responded to the memo, to her memo 
insofar as your firm was concerned, given that her memo 
was not meant for you in the first place. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did she say that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is what she said, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your recollection quite clear? 
MR MOGASHOA:  My recollection is quite clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did that not surprise you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  Well, I ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...given her memo even though it may not 
have been meant to you, because in that memo we just had 
a look.  She wanted a report from a number of people but 
those people included yourselves.   
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, but if you look at the memo Chair... if 
you look at the memo, she... although she made reference to 
our firm in as far as some of the issues she was grabbling 
with, may have been concerned.   
 
Her point to me at the meeting was that the memo was 
meant to be dealt with internally, and that she did not 
20 
understand why legal thought it fit to pass on the memo to 
me to speak on even if it is on the very same issues that 
perhaps concerned our firm at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I just want to check because my 
understanding, and I think it was paragraph 9... no, it is not 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 99 of 182 
 
paragraph... ja, it was 9.  She says: 
“I 
will 
only 
and 
if 
absolutely 
necessary 
and 
appropriate involve former employees that testified.  
After receiving a report from you and Ms Ngoye, as 
well as, Mogashoa Diale Attorneys on your defence 
strategy but when in view of the concessions by 
current employees...” 
 
What was your... what is your... you saw this report even 
though she said it should not have come to you?  What was 
your understanding of this paragraph or have you no 
10 
recollection of how you understood it at the time? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I understood Chair that legal was looking 
for assistance from my firm in as far as explaining perhaps 
with more detail what the liquidation proceedings were about 
and what we made of them as PRASA’s legal representatives 
which was requested by legal. 
 
I did not suspect was untoward.  We had given them the 
first report.  If more detail was required around issues to do 
with the liquidations inquiry, that is what I thought legal 
would have wanted us to assist them around. 
20 
 
But at the meeting... fine, she took the point that the 
memo was not meant for our firm.  And then in that respect, 
we did not even have to discuss the memorandum of the 
30t h of November because her position was the memo was 
not meant for us. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 100 of 182 
 
 
So that report we had drafted, we were not supposed to 
have drafted in the first place.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Of course, did your report of the 
30t h of November, dealt 
with what she 
called “defence 
strategy”?  Because it seems that she wanted Mr Ngoye and 
your firm to deal with in terms of paragraph 9. 
 
But again, she was saying: 
“I 
will 
only 
and 
if 
absolutely 
necessary 
and 
appropriate involve former employees...” 
 
So, I think she was saying, “If I am to involve former 
10 
employees, I first need to have a report from Ms Ngoye and 
Mr Zide and PRASA’s Attorneys, Mogashoa Diale Attorneys, 
telling me what the defence strategy is...” 
 
Is your understanding the same as mine on what she 
was saying? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It is.  The only thing is.  Up to that point, 
the only request I had received was from legal to comment 
on those areas of her memo that concerned our firm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I will come to that. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to check.  Is my understanding 
of what she was talking about, the same as yours in that 
paragraph? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It can be Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If she was to involve former employees, 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 101 of 182 
 
she would need a report from Mr Zide, Ms Ngoye and 
Mogashoa Diale Attorneys on what the defence strategy is.  
We are on the same page? 
MR MOGASHOA:  We are on the same page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now, were you asked by either Mr 
Zide or the Legal Department of PRASA to prepare a 
document that dealt with PRASA’s defence strategy in regard 
to the Siyaya matters? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Not at that point of the 4 t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, not around that time. 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  Not around that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not after, actually. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Not ever after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  And just to confirm.  
Your report of the 30t h of November did not deal with that?  
Did not deal with the defence strategy that she was talking 
about? 
MR MOGASHOA:  No, it did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  And then she 
20 
pointed out that she was not going to look at the memo of 
the 30t h of November that you had prepared. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think if we call it a report, let us be 
consistent. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 102 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Ja, sure. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Otherwise, 
somebody 
will 
read 
this 
transcript.  After some time, we will think there is also a 
memo of 30t h November and the report of 30t h November. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now, forget the fact that the memo, her 
memo of the 28t h was not meant for you.  You take the 
trouble, having received instructions from legal, to prepare a 
report.   
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  That is what happened. 
ADV SONI SC:  I think that is the point the Chairperson is 
making that the chairperson now says, “I am not looking at 
it”.  Did that not surprise you? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I was surprised. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  If we take it that she was not 
interested in your second report and that, therefore, she did 
not look at the report.   
 
Are you able to say what perspective or knowledge she 
20 
deprived herself off in regard to understanding these... this 
matter better or would you not be able to say?   
 
Because your report would have dealt with certain 
issues, and I take it, there would have been a need for such 
issues to be clarified, given that you had such prepared 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 103 of 182 
 
another report. 
MR MOGASHOA:   
“I kept telling her I am under serious constraints to 
prepare the second report.  And for me, in the context 
that I understood her memo for have been asking for 
a bit more information, I thought that would have 
been information relevant to some of the inquiries 
she had made albeit that she did not expect that I 
would add to her memo.   
But I thought they were relevant submissions to bring 
10 
anyone onboard about or regarding the issues that 
were confronting all of us in respect of the Siyaya 
matters...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  And from the PRASA’s side, only you and 
counsel had read... had attended the Section 417 Inquiry.  
Would that be correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It would be my team, meaning Ms Mbebe 
and myself and the counsel team and, of course, the officials 
of PRASA or from PRASA that... 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  But they were witnesses. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Ja, they were the witnesses. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Otherwise, it will be us.  Ms ...[indistinct] 
[00:28:07] may have come for a short period, either on the 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 104 of 182 
 
first day or the second day that we appeared but she came 
very briefly, and I could be wrong in suggesting so.  But she 
may have come through to...  
ADV SONI SC:  Now, in regard to the, again the interim 
report of the insolvency inquiry.  What transpired or what 
discussion transpired at this meeting of the 4 t h December? 
MR MOGASHOA:  At the meeting of the 4t h of December, I 
do not believe that we got to the details of that report.  I 
think what I was then told by the chairperson was that the 
board would take a view on how to proceed with these 
10 
matters and if needed what our firm’s further involvement 
would be. 
ADV SONI SC:  Did you explain to the chairperson the 
disadvantage you were under as a result of the fact that you 
did not have the report? 
MR MOGASHOA:  The discussions did not go that far 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  ... Due to the fact that she did not want to 
get into the details of my report of the 30 t h of November. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you tell her that you had not seen the 
interim report? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Let me just refresh my memory because I 
think paragraph 26 says something of my affidavit about the 
report.   
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 105 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  If you look at the third line from the top... I 
mean, from the bottom.  “I made the point...” 
MR MOGASHOA:  Alright.  Then it means... she mentioned 
the report.  And I am saying I made the point that I did not 
have the report she was referring to despite I have may have 
called for it, for a reply to our meeting. 
 
She first sets out her concerns about how PRASA was 
now going to deal with the report in the arbitration 
proceedings which at the time had been postponed too much 
giving the evidence of the employees of PRASA. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Right.  And then the last sentence of that 
paragraph, again, four lines from the bottom, you started 
with:  “I made the point...” 
MR MOGASHOA:   
“I made the point to Ms Makhubela at the meeting 
that it was not going to be possible for me to 
comment on her concerns without the benefit of 
having of having seen the contents of the interim 
report and the insolvency inquiry myself...” 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  How did the meeting close? 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  I think it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, maybe before it closes.  I am not sure 
you have dealt fully with these issues of the interim report in 
terms of what transpired between you and the PRASA 
Chairperson and I realise that you needed to refresh your 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 106 of 182 
 
memory.   
 
Do you want to just to tell me again, how did the interim 
report come up in the conversation?  What did she say?  
What did you say?  If you need to refresh your memory, you 
may refresh your memory but I just want to hear fully what 
transpired at that meeting. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay.  At the time I was dealing with this 
issue earlier, I was under the impression that the report 
was discussed at the next meeting that followed but I see 
that paragraph 26 and maybe 27 makes reference to the 
10 
fact that she raised the issue of the report at a meeting.  I 
indicated that I had not seen the report, I was never placed 
in possession of that report and that therefore it was going 
to be difficult for me to make any comments about the 
value that and the weight that the report carried in the 
context before the arbitration that had been intended to 
follow in March of 2018 and that I had no to offer her other 
than that perhaps if the report were (indistinct – recording 
distorted) act on it and consider it and do, it would have 
been necessary for me as the legal representative to do 
20 
given the contents of the report and I think it did not go 
any further than that except that – but that I must point out 
that we then were told as a firm that PRASA will revert 
back to us as soon as she has some idea about what 
PRASA’s attitude is towards the report and the matters in 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 107 of 182 
 
the entirety. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was this your first meeting with her in 
regard to PRASA MIS? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It was my first meeting with her, yes, on 
the 4 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please.  Now who all was present 
at that meeting? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It was myself, it was Ms Mbebe from 
our office, it was Mr Zide and the Chairperson, [indistinct – 
10 
dropping voice] 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay, so would that mean that nobody from 
the legal department but particularly Ms Ngoye or Mr 
Dingiswayo was present? 
MR MOGASHOA:   They were not present at that meeting 
of the [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SONI SC:  Would that surprise you? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well, yes, it did.  It did surprise me that 
they were not part of [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it from what you have said about 
20 
what transpired at that meeting that you did not expressly 
ask the PRASA Chairperson to let you have a copy of the 
interim report.  
MR MOGASHOA:   I did put it to her that it would be 
helpful that I be placed in possession of the report. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 108 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
MOGASHOA: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
did 
say 
in 
the 
meeting…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did say that, yes.  Yes and did she 
then offer you a copy of the interim report? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Not at that stage, I was told that PRASA 
will get back to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   As a firm on what the decision is in 
dealing with the matters. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   About going forward. 
MR MOGASHOA:   So at that point I did not receive or I 
was not given a copy of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  So did you get the impression then that 
this decision was going to be made without any further 
input from you? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well, you can accept that at that point, 
Chair, I was not aware what decisions PRASA was likely to 
make.  I was told that I would be contacted as soon as 
20 
there was some idea to getting what to do with either the 
report or the matters and that is precisely what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is quite clear from what you have said 
in regard to I think that meeting but also in regard to the 
PRASA Chairperson’s memo of 28 November that she 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 109 of 182 
 
believed that certain employees of PRASA had made major 
concessions with regard to the Siyaya claims and it would 
seem that she was – it would seem that she implies that 
what she regarded as major concessions made by those 
employees would play quite a significant role in the 
decision about the way forward.  That is the impression I 
get from her memo and from what you tell me.  Is that an 
impression that is the same as the impression you had then 
or not at that stage? 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is the impression I got, that she 
10 
was worried about what leg then PRASA stand on in further 
continuing to defend the matters given the contents of the 
report and this is why I repeated on many occasions that it  
- without the benefit of the internal report there could not 
have been any more that our firm could say other than to 
accept that there is a report in existence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, in her memo of the 28 
November she specifically made reference to requiring to 
be told by Mr Zide, Ms Ngoye and your firm what the 
defence strategy, what PRASA’s defence strategy was to 
20 
the Siyaya claims, is that right? 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she did not at the meeting of the 4 
December, as I understand your evidence, say to you what 
I would like from you is to tell me either now or to furnish 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 110 of 182 
 
me with a document that tells me what your defence 
strategy of PRASA is.  She did not say that, did she? 
MR MOGASHOA:   No, no, Chairperson, she did not say 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the meeting of the 4 t h. 
MR MOGASHOA:   At the meeting of the 4 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and …[intervenes] 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was not asked to make any further 
representations about my impressions of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the defence. 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   Of the defence with or without the 
report or the interim report of the Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was not asked to make further 
representations around that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Just one final question on the persons who 
were present.  Did Ms Makhubele ask at that meeting, ask 
Mr Zide where the members of the legal team were? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Not to my recollection.  If she did 
20 
perhaps, I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not during your presence. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Not during  my presence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 111 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you told anything about why they 
were not there? 
MR MOGASHOA:   No, nothing was explained to me but 
you would see that in paragraph 27 of my affidavit I do say 
that I called them immediately thereafter because I had to 
– it was the first time that I was interacting on the matter 
at PRASA with PRASA officials other than them.  So I 
called them to say to them at the meeting, the Chairperson 
is not happy about the fact that other firm was asked to 
comment on the memo and that I was told that PRASA 
10 
would get back to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then there was a further meeting between 
you and Ms Makhubele. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  And when was that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   On paragraph 28 of my affidavit I make 
reference to the fact that on the 14 December I called – I 
received a call from Mr Zide who implicated …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Soni and Mr 
20 
Mogashoa. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just looking at the last part of your 
paragraph 27, when you told Ms Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo 
and Ms Khoteti about your meeting with the PRASA 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 112 of 182 
 
Chairperson and Mr Zide on that day did they say anything 
about their absence at the meeting or did they seem to 
know that they know about the meeting at all or is that 
something you cannot remember? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It is something I cannot remember 
because I think – I placed emphasis on reporting back to 
them that the Chairperson must have been happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And that I was informed that the 
members of the legal then would have to explain to her 
10 
what happened, much as I was told at the meeting that 
PRASA will get back to us, as a firm, that need be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  Alright, then the next meeting you say took 
place on the 15 December? 
MR 
MOGASHOA: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
got 
called 
on 
the 
14 t h 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:  By whom? 
MR MOGASHOA:   By Mr Zide that the Chairperson wanted 
a meeting with us on the Siyaya matters the next day. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Now did that meeting take place? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, the meeting took place on the 15 t h, 
I did not state the time because I cannot remember what 
time the meeting was and I think present at the meeting 
was the Chairperson, Mr Zide and myself.  I cannot 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 113 of 182 
 
remember that anyone else was there. 
ADV SONI SC:  But certainly not Ms Ngoye and Mr 
Dingiswayo. 
MR 
MOGASHOA: 
 
 
Certainly 
not 
Ms 
Ngoye 
or 
Mr 
Dingiswayo. 
ADV SONI SC:  Did Ms Makhubele ask Mr Zide where Ms 
Ngoye or Mr Dingiswayo were at that meeting while you 
were there? 
MR MOGASHOA:   If there was ever that conversation, I do 
not have any recollection. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And if had taken place would you have 
remembered it? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I would have perhaps, I would imagine 
so. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now, anyway, at this meeting, if you 
could just briefly summarise what happened there? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Alright, Chair.  I got called into the 
meeting, got into the meeting with my files – and by files, I 
am referring to the reports because I thought that the 
meeting would be about the two reports that I had 
20 
prepared.  I think two keys things were tabled as agenda 
items.  The first one was that after having given regard to 
a variety of issues and factors and in particular the 
evidence as may have been contained in the interim report 
that PRASA’s attitude was that there be some attempt at 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 114 of 182 
 
settling the matters and we then went into the  - I must 
then obviously at this point say that well, if those would be 
PRASA’s – if that would be PRASA’s attitude I would 
accept it but I made the point further, I think at that 
meeting, that I do not know – I would not know what the 
considerations are given the fact that still at the time I did 
not have the report or the interim report but that I would 
accept PRASA’s position if it now prefers that it settles the 
disputed matters with the Siyaya Group. 
   
We then got into some bit of detail on what PRASA 
10 
thought it wanted to do and this is through obviously the 
Chairperson and Mr Zide.  I speak about it on paragraph 
31, subparagraphs 31.1 …[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:  Well, before you go to paragraph 31 please 
go back to paragraph 29. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  You were told that – well, were you told 
who would be dealing with the matter from now on? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Alright, what I said, two issues, Chair, 
earlier on, one of the issues that was raised was that I 
20 
then would have to accept that the matter was no longer 
the responsibility of legal and that the board was now 
seized with the responsibility of dealing with the matters 
further.  I was given instructions that from that point 
onwards I would have to deal with Mr Zide. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 115 of 182 
 
 
I cannot remember whether at the time he was still 
the Acting Group CEO or he had reverted back to his 
original position of the company secretary but I was told 
that the matters would be dealt with by the board and 
communication to my office will be through the office of Mr 
Zide and that at that point was advised that there was no 
need then for me to continue discussing the matters with 
the legal department. 
ADV SONI SC:  With regard to Mr Zide’s position at that 
time, you do not need to go there. 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ms Ngoye in her affidavit says that Mr Zide 
from the 7 t h was no longer the Acting CEO.  Mr Malope 
became the Acting CEO and Mr Zide reverted to his earlier 
position of Chairperson of the board.  I am just placing that 
on record. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Oh, yes, yes.  But the instruction was 
that whatever communication between our firm and PRASA 
would be through Mr Zide and Mr Zide’s office. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now in regard to the fact that you were no 
20 
longer to communicate with PRASA legal, what was your 
reaction to that?  Not expressed necessarily but I am just 
saying, your personal reaction to it? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well, perhaps let me respond by saying 
that it is not unusual that we receive such instructions in 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 116 of 182 
 
our firm given the profile of some of the clients we have.  
So it has happened before that the CEO of an institution 
would request us not to deal with legal perhaps because 
legal was the subject of whatever investigation we had to 
carry out.  It is not unusual for the board consult with us 
and provide us with instructions to that centre around 
investigations of a CEO of a company.   
 
So to that extent – and when I was told that the 
board has decided to take responsibility for such matters I 
was not overly perturbed by that instruction.  It was 
10 
followed by another instruction that communication should 
happen through the company secretary, it is not unusual 
that 
company 
secretaries 
would 
carry 
that 
or 
such 
responsibilities as and may be required by the board. 
 
So in that sense, I was not overly perturbed by the 
Chairperson’s position that the matter was now in the 
hands – the matters were now in the hands of the board for 
the board to take. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, you were not perturbed at all? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was not perturbed at all, yes, correct.  
20 
Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just notice you were saying not overly 
perturbed but I thought your explanation must mean you 
were not perturbed. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was not perturbed because we do 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 117 of 182 
 
receive such instructions from the institutions we carry out 
for from time to time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Would you get to know in other 
instances why, for example, the legal department would be 
required not to communicate with the legal department or 
to get instructions from them but rather the CEO or would 
you just been told – would you have just been told that 
from now on it is the CEO’s office that will deal with you 
without being told anything else like, well, there are some 
investigations about concerning the legal department or 
10 
anything like that. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well, other than that there would be 
…[intervenes]\ 
CHAIRPERSON:   Some explanation? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well, or that whatever investigation or 
instruction related to a member or members of the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Legal department 
MR MOGASHOA:   Legal department or the head for that 
matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   We then find ourselves dealing with 
other functionaries other than legal in such. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And we do understand that. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 118 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Some of the matters we would do on 
behalf of boards, would be matters that have to with 
boards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And they contain information that relate 
to functionaries which the board did not wish that the 
functionaries gain access to at the very least through us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   So we …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it does happen. 
MR MOGASHOA:   It does happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  But this was unusual and I am going to 
suggest to you why.  Immediately after the meeting you 
phoned Mr Dingiswayo and told him about that [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, immediately after the meeting I 
called Mr Dingiswayo and I mentioned to him that ours 
(indistinct – recording distorted) in the boards hands and 
20 
that there was no need for me to be discussing them 
further with legal. 
ADV SONI SC:  Well, I am going to suggest, Mr Mogashoa, 
that that is quite different from the examples you have 
been giving us.  You were told do not consult with 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 119 of 182 
 
(indistinct – recording distorted) talk to them.  That is 
exactly what you do.  I am asking them about your reaction 
to that instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that question let me get 
clarity as to what precisely the Chairperson told you with 
regard to any further dealings between yourself and the 
legal department PRASA.  At one stage I think, you know, 
in your affidavit you say something to the effect that she 
said there was no need for you to deal with the legal 
department of PRASA or to take instruction from them but I 
10 
think elsewhere you put it more like an instruction.   
 
Now if she says there is no need it might not be an 
instruction not to deal with them, it might simply be that 
you will not have to get instructions from them, you will 
now get the instructions from us, so if you talk to them, I 
do not see any need why you would talk to them but I am 
not saying do not talk to them but if you say it was an 
instruction not to talk to them then it has a different 
connotation.  Precisely what was it?  What did she say? 
MR MOGASHOA:    Just to assist you, Chair, it was an 
20 
instruction and this is precisely why I contacted Mr 
Dingiswayo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I contacted him for two reasons.  The 
first being that I wanted to manage legal department’s 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 120 of 182 
 
expectation of me telling them what further instructions I 
have from the board and secondly, because I at the time 
was dealing with many others of the instructions.  I did not 
want to find myself in a difficult position where we now get 
in to discussing the Siyaya matters because when I was 
when I had been given an instruction not to discuss the 
Siyaya matters with them and we – so I do not know what I 
have done here – and we continued to interact on the other 
matters or in respect of other matters without necessarily 
getting into the issues to deal with the Siyaya matters. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is important because I meant 
to ask you later on whether the Siyaya matters were the 
only matters you were handling on behalf of PRASA 
whether there were other matters.  From what you have 
said now it seems that there were other matters on which 
you had instructions from PRASA other than the Siyaya 
claims. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct, Chair, there were other matters 
that I was dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to say it was two or three?  
20 
Are you able to say it was a number of them?  
MR MOGASHOA:   It was a number of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was doing quite a fair number of 
litigation matters on behalf of PRASA Corporate. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 121 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you might not be able to be precise 
in terms of the number but are you able to give an estimate 
more or less?  Ten?  More than ten or…? 
MR MOGASHOA:   There may have been at the time six, 
seven or eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Matters. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Other unrelated matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is apart from the Siyaya 
matters. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Apart from Siyaya. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   That were in arbitration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Forums or – that they were litigated out 
of the High Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And mostly we, acting as defendant.  I 
cannot imagine …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so PRASA had been sued. 
MR MOGASHOA:   PRASA was being sued, correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just or the sake of completeness, did 
the PRASA Chairperson at any stage ever interact with you 
in regard to the other matters you were handling on behalf 
of PRASA other than the Siyaya claims? 
MR MOGASHOA:   No to my recollection, Chair, I think to 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 122 of 182 
 
assist you further with your question, I do not believe that I 
have since the meeting of the 14 t h that I had any further 
interaction 
or 
engagements 
with 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I am also asking even before 
that meeting of the 14 t h whether you had any interaction 
with her with regard to claims against PRASA that you were 
handling on behalf of PRASA other than the Siyaya claims? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was called to come and discuss with 
them only the Siyaya matter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Only the Siyaya claims. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other ones that you were handling 
were also pending in either court or arbitration. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct, that is indeed so, some of 
them are still very much alive to this day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but you – going back to the earlier 
question are you quite clear in your own mind that what 
20 
she gave you in that meeting was an instruction not to 
discuss with the legal department not to discuss the Siyaya 
claims with the legal department of PRASA?  Are you quite 
clear?  Is your memory quite clear on that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   My memory is quite clear, I called Mr 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 123 of 182 
 
Dingiswayo.  I see Mr Dingiswayo speaks about it in his 
sworn affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   But if you look at the fact that our firm 
then strictly started communicating with the office of Mr 
Zide only, that as well would confirm that the instruction to 
me was clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   That I should communicate with only 
the office of Mr Zide. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Or through the office of Mr Zide. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:   If I put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni? 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please, Chair.  What was Mr 
Dingiswayo’s reaction to that communication that look, I 
have been instructed not to talk to legal? 
MR MOGASHOA:   He was surprised, we did not have a 
lengthy discussion but he was quite taken aback by my 
20 
having said to him that the Chairperson has instructed me 
to deal with the board through Mr Zide’s office only. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright, then at paragraphs 30, 31, and – 
sorry, paragraphs 30 and 31, you make the point that at the 
end of the day the Chairperson again raised the question 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 124 of 182 
 
of the 417 Inquiry, the adverse effect it would have on 
PRASA’s prospects of success for defending and then you 
say that you were told to settle four of those claims. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Is that what happened? 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is what happened. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now I am not going to go into the 
settlements now be you later on say that there was a 
written instruction on precisely how the matters were to be 
settled.  We will come back to that.  Then at paragraph 32 
10 
you make the point that you were given an instruction 
about how the settlement agreements, what to include in 
the settlement agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Soni.  You said you are 
going to skip this settlement agreement because later on 
he talks about a letter. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it not better to deal with it 
because now in 32 he is talking about a clause that was 
meant to be in the settlement agreement or the issue of 
20 
confidential but we don’t know yet that he has been 
instructed. 
ADV SONI SC:    That is so Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think logically we should hear that, 
he gets instructions to settle on whatever terms and then 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 125 of 182 
 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:    Yes, as you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SONIC SC:   So in paragraph 31 you set out the 
manner in which you were to settle each of the four claims 
that – where I mentioned there, is that correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright let us look at 31.1 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, are you still at 
that one dealing with what transpired at the meeting of the 
10 
15 t h of December, it looks like.  Are you still in paragraph 
31 dealing with what transpired at the meeting of 15 
December? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   Okay, deal with that. 
ADV SONI SC:   So at this meeting now you are told that 
four of the matters are to be settled and you are given the 
figures at which you must settle, is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Soni.  What did Ms 
Makwela say about the settlement of the Siyaya matters at 
20 
that meeting? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Chair I am not sure I follow but 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to, did she say anything 
about the Siyaya claims being settled at that meeting, I 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 126 of 182 
 
just want you to tell the story. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Okay, alright, okay, I think I understand 
what you ...[intervenes]    
ADV SONI SC:   You deal with it at paragraph 30, the last 
part of paragraph 30. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Paragraph 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can refresh your memory but I 
just want you to relate to me the story. 
MR MOGASHOA:   The summary – I can summarise 
paragraph 30 to be that the Chairperson put to me that 
10 
given the contents of the interim report and perhaps other 
factors plus I had decided that it will be in its best 
interests that the – it attempts to settle the matters with 
the Siyaya Group, given that she was concerned about the 
fact that we may not have evidence that is adequate or 
sufficient to sustain proper defences in light of the fact that 
the interim report suggested to her that there were 
concessions made by the PRASA witnesses and I think I 
made the point to her once again that I cannot comment on 
the report, but I do hear what she is saying about PRASA’s 
20 
intention of negotiating a settlement with the Siyaya Group 
for the reasons she advanced and I said to her that our 
firm as a creature of instructions would then need to be 
instructed in writing about what offers PRASA wanted to 
make to the Siyaya Group. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 127 of 182 
 
 
We – and I don’t want to get ahead of you Mr Soni 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no right. 
MR MOGASHOA:   We discussed the four matters that 
PRASA said it was in a position to make offers on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Soni can take it from there. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, as you please Chairperson.  And then 
she indicated a figure at which each of the matters must be 
settled, would that be correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:   She indicated figures which she thought 
10 
would represent offers to be made. 
ADV SONI SC:   So have a look at 31.1 and that dealt with 
which case number? 
MR MOGASHOA:   31.1 dealt with case number 47597 of 
2016. 
ADV SONI SC:    And what was the amount that was in 
respect of which a tender had to be made?   
MR MOGASHOA:   The amount here is R17 178 853. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Don’t lower your voice. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Oh yes Mr Chair, okay.   I may be 
20 
beginning to run out of energy, but I am still okay to 
continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then at 31.2 what case number? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It is case number 47598/2016, and the 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 128 of 182 
 
amount thought of at the consultation was R15 371 739,87. 
ADV SONI SC:   And the one at 31.3? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It is case number 73933/2015 and the 
figure that PRASA thought of at the time was R8 096 950. 
ADV SONI SC:   And 31.4? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The case number is 73934/2015, and 
the figure that PRASA had in mind at the time was 
R7 098 491,66. 
ADV SONI SC:   So in essence orally now your instructions 
were to settle at those amounts.    
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is what I was told that PRASA 
wanted to do, make offers in these amounts. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that you would do in writing to the 
Siyaya Attorneys. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I didn’t get the question sir?  
ADV SONI SC:   I say those offers would be made in 
writing to Siyaya’s attorneys? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well the point about the – that things 
be in writing was the point I made at the meeting that I 
would prefer to be – I was just taking sketchy notes of 
20 
what I was told because I said I would act on written 
instructions as soon as I received written instructions from 
PRASA regarding what it had intended to do.  
ADV SONI SC:   So although this had been given to you 
orally you were requiring that PRASA puts in writing what 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 129 of 182 
 
the amounts are and what the terms of the offer are? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright, but at paragraph 32 then you 
make the point that the Chairperson required a particular 
clause in regard to the settlement agreement? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, I make the point that we were 
asked to include a confidentiality clause in the offers that 
we were instructed to make and that such offers be made 
without admission of liability, even that they were purely 
for settlement purposes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni I know that we wanted to finish 
earlier and I know that at some – at one o’clock we thought 
we would be finished by half past but we haven’t and it is 
not anyone’s fault but maybe we should just take the lunch 
adjournment. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mogashoa I see you certainly would 
like us to finish before I am just realising that we at two 
o’clock and I think that we might find ourselves getting to 
three o’clock without lunch.   Mr Mogashoa have you got a 
20 
consultation set up for three o’clock? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well I don’t know how much longer Mr 
Soni is of the view but I am – if I were to speak for my part 
I am still comfortable to continue, because I would rather 
have us finish the proceedings so that then I can head off 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 130 of 182 
 
to do what I still can, but I am not opposed to lunch being 
taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, no certainly we will finish 
today, it is a question of whether we take the lunch now so 
I think we have tried to finish so that when we take the 
lunch break we don’t come back, but we haven’t succeeded 
and it is not anybody’s fault.  So maybe let us take the 
lunch adjournment, come back at three o’clock, hopefully 
fresher and then that might even assist to speed up 
because I think we might all be a little exhausted after 
10 
sitting from about half past ten, quarter past ten except for 
the tea break.   Let’s take the lunch adjournment and then 
we will resume at three o’clock. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV SONI SC:  Dingiswayo had said that there was a secret 
agreement. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes I remember we debated it. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  And you made the point but it was never 
secret.  But I just want to point out that in a sense I suspect 
that is what he was talking about that the agreement was not 
to be made available to anybody but parties involved and in 
particular legal. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 131 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Quite correct it may have been in that 
context actually. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I am looking at it that way for the first 
time yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  I just – I just thought in fairness to him that 
it was not as if he was making a wild allegation. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes.  I fully understand. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright now you were then waiting for 
instructions from them.  Did you get written instructions? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes I believe it may have been on the very 
same day on the 15 December. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That I received written instructions from 
PRASA I think it will be my very first annexure. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes I deal with it on paragraph 33 of my 
own affidavit. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes and that is at page 21 of the bundle – of 
your bundle that is MM1 am I right? 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct this is the one. 
ADV SONI SC:  So these are the instructions, the written 
instructions now that you received. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they were coming from Mr Lindikhaya 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 132 of 182 
 
Zide and I see that he signed there as Group Company 
Secretary? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  The letter came from his office 
but I suspect it was transmitted through to us by his 
secretary or PA Lebogang Matsimela [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SONI SC:  But I think the Chairperson was emphasising 
Mr Mogashoa that the capacity in which Mr Zide signed was 
as Group Company Secretary? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct I see that on page 23. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And the perhaps relevance of that is 
you might remember that in the earlier communication on the 
28 November in her memorandum she wrote to Mr Zide in his 
capacity as CEO you might remember.  I am just taking you 
back to that. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I remember that. 
ADV SONI SC:  And she made the point as CEO you would 
have given those instructions. 
MR MOGASHOA:  She made that point, correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright so now we have got Mr Zide’s letter 
20 
to you and are those the instructions you have received? 
MR MOGASHOA:  These are the instructions I received – 
that is indeed so Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And were they in line with what you had 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 133 of 182 
 
been told at the meeting of the 15 December at that meeting 
where you were told about the amounts for settlement? 
MR MOGASHOA:  The – the amounts may differ slightly and 
perhaps a bit more significantly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  In some instances.  But – because I left 
the meeting with my own written notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I accept that the written instruction then 
represented properly what PRASA wanted me to do. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Make an offer on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well it may be important for record 
purposes to just indicate that this letter from Mr Zide and 
that in paragraph 2 he say, he confirms that at the meeting 
of 15 December 217 between yourself and the Chairperson 
of the interim board you were instructed as follows.  So the 
letter seeks to or purports to confirm what Mr Zide believes 
you had been told at the meeting. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is indeed so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then they – and – and the first group 
of cases relates to Siyaya DB Consulting Engineers and in 
regard to the one matter 74 – case number 74281/2015 your 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 134 of 182 
 
instructions were to hold that matter in abeyance pending 
further instructions.  Is that right? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  I just want to point out if you look at 31.1 on 
page 13 of your affidavit there Mr Mogashoa and keep – 
keep your finger on page 22 you will see the case number 
there is 479595 – 597 at 31.1. 
MR MOGASHOA:  You mean the first case? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright and you will see that that is reflected 
as 2.6 on page 22? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is indeed so. 
ADV SONI SC:  And I would just like you to tell the 
Chairperson what the amount is in 31.1? 
MR MOGASHOA:  The amount in 31.1. is R17 178 853.00. 
ADV SONI SC:  And the amount that you were now 
instructed to settle at? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It is – the amount as reflected in 
paragraph 2.6 of the instruction letter is R19 583 778.42.  
20 
But I see here – so in the letter of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is including VAT. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Of instructions it says it is VAT inclusive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In your affidavit does it say excluded – 
VAT excluded? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 135 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  I do not say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not – it does not – oh. 
MR MOGASHOA:  No I do not say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I think it – there was no such distinction 
made when we were in the meeting of the 15t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  And the other amounts appear to be the 
same from 31.2 to 31.4 and the ones at 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 on 
page 22. 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  That appears to be so yes the amounts 
seem to be the same.  The three remaining amounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there anything unusual about the 
terms on which you were instructed to settle these matters in 
your experience or was there nothing unusual? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I am not sure if Chair is referring to the 
figures themselves or the computation thereof or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever it is if there was anything you 
found unusual in relation to being instructed to settle the 
matter on these – this matters on these terms.  Is there 
20 
anything you found unusual in your experience as an 
attorney? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Well I would avoid talking about the 
computation of the figures but the – the – it does not happen 
often that we would be instructed to stipulate in an offer we 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 136 of 182 
 
make that – that it carries some confidentiality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  And I am – and I would not be sure what 
the considerations were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  At that time but PRASA thought it proper 
that it places such a condition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  On the – on the tender – on the tender 
itself although as I say it has happened before in some of 
10 
the matters I have had to deal with in the past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That especially if it is an – if it is an offer 
purely to settle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Or if it is an offer of compromise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  That the details especially if there are 
other related claimants for example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  That perhaps emanate – whose claims 
emanate from the same course of action. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It is not unusual or completely unusual for 
a defendant to want to have separate if one may say 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 137 of 182 
 
confidential settlements with each of the parties as the case 
may be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  We do not – we do not – I do not get to 
prepare. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Tenders and say they are confidential if 
there is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I can count the time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And what was the relationship 
between the amounts on which you instruct – which you were 
instructed to tender to the other side and the amounts that 
may have been claimed by the Siyaya Companies in their 
summons – summonses?  Did you take the trouble to check 
whether – what – how they compared? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It was my observation Chair that the 
figures were more or less the same.  I mean… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  You did not have a situation where R15 
20 
million was claimed and R3 million was tendered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Just by looking at the figures and you 
compare them to what the total amount claimed is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 138 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  In particulars of claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  This may have been amended so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  The settlements were close to what was 
claimed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  And I can safely say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In your experience is that quite 
normal when you talk about a settlement?  In your 
10 
experience – how many years have you – had you been in 
practice by then? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I was admitted in May 2000 so it is 20 
years now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So you had about 17 years at the time 
of the settlement more or less? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In your experience was it quite usual 
– has it been usual in your experience to settle – to have 
matters settled on a basis in terms of which the defendant… 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  Is being sued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pays or tenders to pay either the exact 
amount claimed or very close to it.  Is that something that 
you have found quite common in your experience over the 
years? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 139 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Settlements would in my view be a 
product of negotiations between the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  If I were to speak about the extent of our 
firm’s involvement that did not happen.  I was not asked – or 
let me put it differently.  I was not involved in the 
computation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Of the final figures and therefore it will be 
difficult to say now this amount should not have been 
10 
tendered but that should have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I did not do the exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  After I was given such instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Because I accepted that PRASA was 
satisfied or where the instructions came from relevant 
officials were satisfied that what they wanted me to tell them 
is what they thought PRASA was liable for. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  I was asking a 
different question and that is where I want you to assist me. 
MR MOGASHOA:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not been in practice – I left practice 
about 23 years ago.  
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 140 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and when it comes to settlements as 
you know Judges normally do not get told what the 
settlement was.  So – but my reaction when I noticed that 
the amounts you were instructed to tender seemed to be 
exactly the same amounts claimed in the summons at least 
that was my impression.  That did not strike me as – as a 
settlement as one would normally expect.  But maybe it is 
because I have not been in practice for over the past 23 
years maybe things have changed.  Are you able to assist 
10 
me to say well things have changed you do not know what is 
happening out there now, this is normal?  My experience was 
that there would be a kind of – if you talking of a settlement 
you would be looking at about a very different amount from 
the amount claimed. 
MR MOGASHOA:  We generally say that a good settlement 
is a settlement out of which none of the parties are happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Which means your plaintiff does not get 
quite what they may have been looking for. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Or you defendant does not pay – they find 
themselves paying more than what they may have bargained 
for.  So yes Chair you – you would find that we do not 
ordinarily normally pay what is claimed for. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 141 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  In the particulars of claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  So one. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Mr 
Soni 
must 
- 
might 
have 
better 
experience because he is still in practice. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes I can say that law has not changed 
since you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  There is just one other clause that I would 
10 
like us to look at Mr Mogashoa.  It is at page 22 under C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe – maybe you might or might not 
be able to say it – to comment on this Mr Mogashoa.  I am 
sorry Mr Soni. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Dingiswayo if I am not mistaken 
said in his affidavit or maybe also in his evidence that this 
was not a settlement it was capitulation.  Do you want to 
comment on that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I remember seeing that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I remember seeing that.  Well if you 
compare the – the figures of the tender to the figures as they 
may appear in the particulars of claim one would look at it 
that way that it is a capitulation. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 142 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  And I think it is – it is even more 
confusing when such matters have had some life of being 
defended.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  And then after two or three years then it is 
a settlement and it is a settlement of the full amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It can create some uncertainty Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Of course, what one cannot deny is 
10 
that if indeed PRASA had no defence to the claims it may 
well have been a reasonable thing to pay at that time and 
save all the legal costs that would come with the arbitration, 
is it not?  That is if PRASA had no defence. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I agree, I agree fully with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  If we could not find anything wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  With the invoicing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  Or the figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I accept that that yes one would have to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR MOGASHOA:  Make that kind of a settlement. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 143 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   I am sorry I interrupted you Mr 
Soni you had a question. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is – no I have got my point again 
Chairperson.  If you look at paragraph C you might 
remember the Chairperson asked you was there anything 
unusual 
and 
you 
have 
debated 
that 
issue 
with 
the 
Chairperson. But have a look at paragraph 2.7 regarding the 
interest that was to be payable.  2.7 on page 22. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct I see that. 
ADV SONI SC:  What does it say? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:  Well it simply says that interest must be 
calculated on the date of issuing the summons instead of 
being calculated from the date of the issuance of invoices. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  Now based on this instruction what 
did you do – this written instruction? 
MR MOGASHOA:  What would I do? 
ADV SONI SC:  No what did you do? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Oh yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe before that.  So to sum up your 
instructions are tender it is either the amounts claimed in the 
20 
summons or something more or less the same and tender 
interest from the date of summons – or the date of – ja from 
the date of summons that is what it says.  So – so far it 
looks like the only thing that is not mentioned on your 
instructions is costs.  Is that right? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 144 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  That is – that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It looks like the instruction letter said 
nothing about costs? 
MR MOGASHOA:  The instruction letter indeed did not say 
anything about costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay Mr Soni asked you a question 
about the interest.  You might wish to repeat that question 
about the interest here. 
ADV SONI SC:  Sorry, I was asking about what happened 
next Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, what happened.  Yes, ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Oh, yes Chair.  What then happened is, I 
then formulated the tenders in line with this letter of 
instruction.  And I may have sent out the tenders on the 
same day or the day thereafter. 
 
I remember we produced two documents.  One in respect 
of the Siyaya Rail Solution’s matter, the nineteen-thousand... 
the 19 ...[indistinct] [00:20:42] tender and separately from 
20 
that and in respect of the three claims under the Siyaya DB 
Consulting Engineers, we issued another tender. 
 
So it was two tenders.  One with details of the three 
claims and the other one with the details of just this one 
claim under case number 47/597/2016. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 145 of 182 
 
 
I do not know whether I despatched with the tenders the 
same day on the 15t h or the next day on the 16t h but I 
remember we then managed to structure the tenders in line 
with the instructions and transmitted them electronically to 
our opponents. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And what did they respond to the 
tenders you have been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not have your letter in which you 
made the tender, hey?  I do not see it here.   
ADV SONI SC:  No, it is not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not have.  Okay.  Alright.  But you 
tendered?  You made a tender in accordance with your 
understanding of your instructions? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  That is exactly what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  And I think I do say in my affidavit that a 
day or two thereafter I received a letter which I probably 
referred to my... in my affidavit. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is at paragraph 34, MM2. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, in which my opponent acknowledges 
20 
receipt of the tenders made but then they went on to issue... 
to raise an issue to do with interest because I had not 
included interest in the amounts that were part of the first 
tender.  I mean, first tenders went out. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  So that their address in paragraph 3 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 146 of 182 
 
of their letter which is at page 25 of annexures to your 
documents? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Correct.  That is what the letter is. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now just read that paragraph out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you at 25? 
ADV SONI SC:  At 25 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  And this the opponent’s response to Mr 
10 
Mogashoa’s tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are now dealing with Annexure 
MM2 which is... which appears at page 24 and it is a letter 
from Mathopa Attorneys dated 18 December 2017.  Yes.  
Before you read what, Mr Soni says you should need to read.  
I see in paragraph 1.1 of that letter, that Mathopa Attorneys 
say: 
“We represent Siyaya DB Consulting Engineers (Pty) 
Ltd in liquidation and Siyaya Rail Resolution Pretoria 
Limited herein after collectively as our client...” 
20 
 
I thought that there different attorneys for the liquidators 
and different attorneys for Siyaya Rail Solution.  Was that 
not the position? 
MR MOGASHOA:  No, that was not the position.  Chair, you 
would recall that ...[intervenes]  
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 147 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was or that was not? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It was not the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:  You would recall that earlier on, I did 
mention that soon after gaining information that the Siyaya 
DB was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Under liquidation. 
MR MOGASHOA:  ...under liquidation.  We then asked for 
the requisite mandating our authority from Mr Mathopa in 
order that we get satisfied that he continues to act for Siyaya 
10 
DB even when it is under liquidation and we were provided 
with such mandates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So roundabout when would that have 
been?  You were now talking about 17 December 2017. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It may have been around May or June of 
2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, much earlier? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Much earlier.  Soon after we became of 
the liquidation process against or in respect of Siyaya DB, in 
April, around middle April. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I think we do say that on the 17t h of April 
or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I thought Mr Botes, when he gave 
evidence here and I thought I read in the papers, that at the 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 148 of 182 
 
time he was talking to the PRASA Chairperson, at the time 
Mr Botes was talking to the PRASA Chairperson and there 
was communication about settlements, which I think would 
have been around November/December.   
 
Around that time.  I thought Mr Botes said there was a 
Mr Crouse or somebody who I thought represented the 
liquidators. 
 
And the impression I had was that Crouse Attorneys 
represented 
the 
liquidators 
and 
Mathopa 
represented 
another entity.  That is why I am picking this up and I so 
10 
surprised by it. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR 
MOGASHOA: 
 Yes, 
but 
we... 
soon 
after 
gaining 
knowledge of the fact that the DB or Siyaya DB aspect of the 
Siyaya 
Group 
of 
Companies 
had 
been 
placed 
under 
liquidation, we, naturally, approached Mr Mathopa and 
enquired from him if he continued to act on their behalf, 
given that they may now be under a different ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Under somebody else’s control. 
MR MOGASHOA:  ...legal personality.  Under somebody 
20 
else’s control and so forth.  And I think after a while, he 
came back to us.  I just do not have the documents in front 
of me. 
 
But I remember very well because we were not going to 
move on litigating with him in circumstances where our client 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 149 of 182 
 
was not satisfied that he continues to enjoy the mandate of 
the Siyaya DB Consultancy which under liquidation at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is the position that earlier on Mathopa 
Attorneys represented all the Siyaya companies that are... 
were involved in these claims initially? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That has always been the case.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you say, at a certain stage, April 
2017, 
you 
became 
aware 
that 
Siyaya 
DB 
Consulting 
Engineers was under liquidation and you sought proof of 
10 
authority and that was supplied in due course? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It was made available.  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now, does that mean there are no 
other attorneys that, as far as you know, ever represented 
one of the Siyaya or one of the Siyaya companies in regard 
to these claims while you were involved with PRASA? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Around the time, subpoenas were issued 
by the Liquidation Commission or Insolvency Commission as 
we may we want to call them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The inquiry, ja. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:  There was a law firm that had issued 
those letters on behalf of the liquidators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOGASHOA:  But our office continued to communicate 
with Mr Mathopa’s office on the basis that his firm still 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 150 of 182 
 
represented the company in the liquidation at Siyaya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MOGASHOA:  The Siyaya Rails Solutions Company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Botes was... had been briefed by 
Mathopa Attorneys? 
MR MOGASHOA:  That was my impression. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:  But if you look at communication around 
the time the offers were accepted, Mr Botes seems to now 
make a distinction between the company in liquidation and 
10 
Siyaya Rails Solutions. 
 
And I suppose he went on to provide us with two 
different accounting details or bank account details into 
which PRASA would have had to pay the amounts. 
 
And this was simple because he says that the other 
company ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
That 
is 
what 
I 
understood 
there 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  ...had to be paid through a different trust 
account than Mathopa’s as they have been the case in the 
20 
Siyaya Rails Solutions case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m-h’m. 
ADV SONI SC:  Well, Chairperson you have picked up 
something very important and I must apologise for not 
picking it up but if we look at page 27, you will see that this 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 151 of 182 
 
letter from Mathopa says that: 
“The amounts must be paid into Mr Crouse’s trust 
account...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  At the bottom of page 27 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Both the amounts must be paid into Mr 
Crouse’s trust account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are both amounts ...[intervenes]  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is very strange. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is.  And I am sorry I did not pick that up 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Can you see that Mr Mogashoa? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I can see that, yes.  It phase in both 
instances the account of Crouse Trust Account.  It may be 
different account numbers, although I do not know.  But yes, 
I see paragraph 9, 9.1 and 9.2. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Would 
you 
know 
whether 
Crouse 
Incorporated were attorneys or was it a firm of liquidators or 
20 
what?  Would you know that or not? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I am not sure about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You never dealt with them directly? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I have not dealt with them until that time 
that we attended the Commission’s inquiry hearings in 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 152 of 182 
 
August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Ja, it is really strange. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ja, it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normally, attorneys would let payment be 
made into their trust accounts to pass the matter to the 
client. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or, otherwise, I guess it would go to the 
10 
client but Crouse is not the client. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  But a distinction is made because if you 
look at paragraph 9.1 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR MOGASHOA:  It says here DB in liquidation.  So it is not 
clear, I suppose to all of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Paragraph 9.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see, paragraph 9.1 relates to a 
20 
company that was in liquidation.  Paragraph 9.2 relates to a 
company that was not in liquidation but payments to both 
companies was to be made to the same entity, entity’s trust 
account, Crouse Incorporated. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, I see it. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 153 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is strange that in relation to the 
litigation, Mathopa Attorneys acts for both and yet when it 
comes to payment, payment has to... in regard to both, must 
go to somebody else that appears or seem to know nothing 
about.  At least, you knew nothing about it.   
MR MOGASHOA:  I take note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Crouse Incorporated. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I take the point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SONI SC:  Perhaps I should look a little more carefully 
10 
at the papers for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Because I know there is a letter that Judge 
Makhubele referred to from Crouse Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Saying that she had received a letter from 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  I just cannot put my finger on where exactly 
it is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, we might to have to go and check.  Ja, 
ja.  Yes? 
ADV SONI SC:  I just want to go to paragraph 3 now Mr 
Mogashoa at page 25.  Because this is what Mr Mathopa 
writes to you.  Could you read that into the record? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 154 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  He says on paragraph 3 of his letter. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   
“Your client, PRASA, did not instruct you to submit an 
offer or tender to our clients in respect of the capital 
amounts only.  
Your client specific and express instruction to you, 
was to submit to an offer or tender to our clients 
which provides for payment of interest a temporary 
rate at a rate of 9% per annum, calculated from the 
10 
date or dates upon which the respective summons 
were served on the clients...”  
ADV SONI SC:  What was your reaction upon receiving that 
letter?  You had been instructed to issue a tender which you 
did and now you are told that the tender is not in terms of 
your instructions.  Well, what was your reaction to that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  In fact, I mention in my first ...[intervenes]  
ADV 
SONI 
SC:

deal 
with 
it 
in 
paragraph 
34 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes.

ADV SONI SC:  ...off your affidavit. 
MR MOGASHOA:  And that is on page...? 
ADV SONI SC:  At page 14.  Just after MM2 which is in bold.

MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, yes, yes.  It is the paragraph... 
paragraph 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You are speaking away from 
the mic. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Start afresh, so that what you say will be 
recorded. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay Chair.  Must I continue now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just... but start your response 
afresh, because I do not think it was captured.  Whatever 
10 
you said, I do not think it was captured earlier. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Okay.  Paragraph 34 of my affidavit... I 
think on the paragraphs, I am simple summarising what I am 
saying was a bit of a challenge for me in that I had made a 
tender and when my opponent writes back to counter-
propose, so to speak, reference is made to the effect that my 
tender is not in line with the instructions I had expressly 
received from my client. 
 
But I think I made the point as well that I said to my 
opponents that I would, in any event, irrespective, just go 
20 
back to my client and confirm their instructions in as far as 
the issue of interest is concerned. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, but I am raising a slightly different 
point. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 156 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:  How would they know what your client had 
instructed you to do?  I mean, just... we know now that they 
did know.  Did you ever find out? 
MR MOGASHOA:  I was equally taken aback by that.  You 
may see that at the end of paragraph... I am not sure if I 
took that issue up with them. 
ADV SONI SC:  I do not think you did.  Not... certainly not 
on your affidavit.  
MR MOGASHOA:  I do not think I did in writing.  Or maybe it 
is correspondence I did not want to at the time deal with. But 
10 
yes, I found it a bit troublesome that a... that my client’s 
instructions were not only known to me but from the reading 
of the letter of Mr Mathopa, they as well had been placed in 
possession of the same letter that was addressed to me. 
ADV SONI SC:  So, can I give you some background to that?  
When Mr Botes gave evidence, he said that this letter had 
been Whatsapp’d to him.  He received this letter via 
Whatsapp from the chairperson of the board.  That was his 
evidence. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Well, okay.  Alright.  I did not get to see 
20 
any of the submissions he made. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no, no.  I understand. 
MR MOGASHOA:  It explains how the letter got to the chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Now, having received that letter, the 
MM2 from Mr Mathopa, what did you do? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 157 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:  I then immediately approached Mr Zide, 
client and I indicated... I mean, I may... if you allow me to 
get to number 3? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Because I may have said to client that it 
is concerning. 
ADV SONI SC:  That is at page 29.  MM3 was at page 29.  
And your email is the second email on that page. 
MR MOGASHOA:  Alright.  I think the attachment does not 
quite deal with the concern I had. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:  I may have simple forwarded the letter to 
client and client then gave me instructions to investigate how 
to incorporate the interest that is referred in their initial 
letter of instructions. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  And did you do that? 
MR MOGASHOA:  Yes, we then went on to instruct our 
accountants to give us a table of such figures as we... it was 
required that they include interest.  They made such table 
available to us and I forwarded the figures to Mr Zide with 
20 
recommendations that I have or I had satisfied myself with 
the interest incorporated. 
 
And his instructions were that I then should proceed to 
revise the offers to include the interest that then was 
calculated on the basis of the particular amounts. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 158 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Now that offer then was sent to Mathopo 
Attorneys. 
MR MOGASHOA:   We then sent the offers to Mathopo. 
ADV SONI SC:   What was the response to the offer?  
Well, firstly, from whom did you get a response to that 
offer? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I may have received a response from Mr 
Botes. 
ADV SONI SC:   If you look at MM4 on page 30, this is the 
top half of MM4, page 30. 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now that is an email from Mr Botes dated 
when? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Dated the 21 December. 
ADV SONI SC:   And to whom is it addressed? 
MR MOGASHOA:   It was addressed to Tshepo Mathopo 
but we are carbon copied. 
ADV SONI SC:   Well, just read the names of all the people 
who are carbon copied. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Okay, people who are carbon copied 
20 
are Tshepo Mathopo, Nxola Zimbebe, Madimpe Mogashoa, 
T A M Makhubele. 
ADV SONI SC:   And who was that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   This would be the Chairperson. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 159 of 182 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  And you will see there is also Mr 
Krause who is …[intervenes] 
MR MOGASHOA:   Mr Krause is cc’d there as well, yes.  
And Hannes from [indistinct] 41.44. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  Now in essence what does Mr Botes 
say in regard to – well, it is a strange thing, the email is 
from Mr Botes but if you look at the bottom, who signs it? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, I see it says Mr Botes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  Now what is the essence of that 
email? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   I see that it refers to the offers we 
made.  The first point they make, the email makes is that 
PRASA’s settlement offers are accepted.  The email further 
makes reference to the issue of interest and I think it 
repeats the same debate I had had with Mr Mathopo around 
interest and inclusion of interest in the figures.  Mr Botes 
goes on to suggest that payments be made into Krause 
Inc’s trust account and that he hopes that our client will 
expedite the payment issue. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  Now what was the next thing that 
20 
happened in regard to those communications and you will 
actually find that on – in MM5 at page 31.    
MR MOGASHOA:   Alright, what I see on page 81, if I may 
proceed? 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 160 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:   What I see on page 31, annexure MM5 
is that on the same day I received an email from the 
Chairperson in which he says that: 
“Dear Madimpe, thank you for the update.  Mr 
Mogashoa please attend to finalise the matter with 
regards to payment.” 
And this may have been – her email was in response to 
mine that I had sent earlier. 
ADV SONI SC:   Is that the email just under that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, in which I say – oh, but this is an 
10 
email address to Mr Botes. 
ADV SONI SC:   I am sorry. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And everyone else but if I send this in 
reply to Mr Botes then the Chairperson would have 
received it. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Because she was carbon copied. 
ADV SONI SC:   I should have referred you to – go back to 
page 30 and in the bottom half you will find an email from 
yourself. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   Oh yes, that is MM4. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  And what does that say?  Well, it 
does not say to whom it is addressed, it seems it was sent 
from your iPhone. 
MR MOGASHOA:   It could be it says: 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 161 of 182 
 
“Good morning, sirs…” 
That is the 10/23 email. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   It says: 
“Good morning, sirs, attached are revised offers in 
respect of matters, case numbers…” 
And it is the four case numbers in respect of the offers we 
made.   
“Kindly obtain instructions from your clients and 
revert.” 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   And it is in response to that offer that Mr 
Botes says we accept the offer. 
MR MOGASHOA:   So then I think then Mr Botes’ email of 
11/21 is in response to mine at 10.23. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Then I then see that I – what happened 
here?  I am looking at the last, last email on page 30, 
11/25. 
ADV SONI SC:   Ja, that email is incomplete, it is not… 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  At any rate, let us not get bogged down.  
What we do know was that the offers were accepted and 
the Chairperson told MR MOGASHOA to deal with the 
question of payment.  
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 162 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mathopo Attorneys raised the issue of 
interest in regard – in response to your first offer or tender 
but I thought that the instructions you had received did 
include that you must tender a payment of interest from 
date of summons.  Is the position that your first tender did 
not deal at all with interest or is it that you said interest 
would be calculated from a date other than the one that 
Mathopo Attorneys understood you to have instructed to 
work on. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I did not, the offers did not at all deal 
10 
with interest and I think it was just inadvertent on my part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because …[intervenes] 
MR MOGASHOA:   Not to include interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I may have missed that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   When I formulated the offers at that 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, but subsequently you saw that 
it was there? 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   I saw that it was there but you would 
see that I contacted clients to say look, this is what my 
opponents are saying, I will just rework to include interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay.   
ADV SONI SC:   Alright, then you says that at paragraph 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 163 of 182 
 
36 on the 8 January you received a letter from Mr Mathopo 
indicating that they have a proposal in respect of the 
matter that was not included in the settlement.  Remember, 
there were five matters, four were settled. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   What did you do with that offer? 
MR MOGASHOA:   You mean the letter? 
ADV SONI SC:   I mean that letter. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I sent it to client. 
ADV SONI SC:   And what was the response from client? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   Let me see where my [indistinct – 
dropping voice] that.  And I believe that the offer made 
proposals on how we could deal with that particular case, it 
is case 74281/2015.  I say that: 
“Despite that this letter was forwarded to PRASA for 
their 
consideration 
and 
instructions 
no 
communication has since come forth from client.” 
ADV SONI SC:   Okay.  Now the rest of paragraphs 37, 38 
and 39 – oh, sorry, 38 and 39, deal with the fact that 
certain 
communications 
were 
made 
to 
the 
arbitrator 
20 
relating to these offers. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, that is the case. 
ADV SONI SC:   And then in paragraph 39 you deal with a 
message you received from MR MOGASHOA.  What was 
that in connection with at paragraph 39? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 164 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:   Okay, Chair, the point you made earlier 
about the fact that the rest of the paragraphs, 37 and 38, 
dealt mainly with the communication between my office and 
that 
of 
Mr 
Mathopo 
and 
further 
with 
communication 
between Mr Mathopo’s office and that of retired Judge 
Brand.  Then come into flow with what I say in paragraph 
39.  In essence, Mr Mathopo was getting frustrated with 
the fact that PRASA 
was not making the payments 
following the acceptance of the offers and he then started 
engaging with the judge in order that we make – and in 
10 
anticipation of course, further, of the arbitration dates that 
we are approaching in March, he suggested that we – the 
parties approach Judge Brand and present to him that the 
parties have arrived at settlements in respect of some or 
most 
of 
the 
matters 
and 
that 
they 
wish 
that 
such 
settlements be made arbitrator ’s awards.  I imagine at the 
time the thinking was that they then go on to make them 
orders of court if the issue of nonpayment continued. 
ADV SONI SC:   Alright, so that communication is sent to 
you, they want to make the settlement into arbitration 
20 
awards. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct, so it will be communication 
with Judge Brand but I am cc’d and copied. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  What did you do when you were 
copied? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 165 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:   So every time I would received such 
communication I would forward all of the communication to 
MR MOGASHOA, so …[intervenes] 
ADV SONI SC:   And in regard to that communication what 
was the communication from him to you? 
MR MOGASHOA:   In paragraph 39 I then deal with – I had 
been – Judge Brand was in Gauteng at some point and I 
think he had other matters he was running with.  Mr Botes 
or Advocate Botes managed to arrange that the parties see 
him on one particular day. 
10 
 
Now it has always been my position that I was not 
going to act or do anything unless I am instructed.  So I 
think it is a text message that I am referring to in my 
paragraph 
39 
that 
I 
received 
from 
Mr. 
Mogashoa 
complaining that that day I was then instructed to proceed 
and participate in submissions to Judge Brand and make 
the settlements arbitrator ’s awards as consented to by both 
parties. 
ADV SONI SC:   Okay.  Have a look at page 41, that the 
message you referred to at paragraph 39, page 41. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct, the first message. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes and what is that message show? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The message was from Mr Zide and it 
was addressed to me and it says that yes, Mogashoa 
should confirm that the settlement be made an order and 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 166 of 182 
 
proceed with a question on the one that had outstanding 
issues. 
ADV SONI SC:   And in his …[intervenes] 
MR MOGASHOA:   Mr Zide goes on to say that that is from 
the Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   So what did you understand from that? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I understood that my instructions were 
that I proceed to see Judge Brand with Mr Botes and make 
the settlements the arbitrator ’s award or consent thereto 
and further, that we – I present to the retired Judge that 
10 
the only outstanding matter that the parties had to deal 
with, perhaps at the schedule arbitration was that that 
parties consent. 
ADV SONI SC:   And from whom was that instruction that it 
be made an order – I mean and arbitration award? 
MR MOGASHOA:   From Mr Zide’s email, the text that I am 
looking at here, annexure MM9, the message by him to me 
may have been from the Chairperson.  It is from the 
Chairperson because he says that – he says that it is a 
message from the Chairperson. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   From his second text to me. 
ADV SONI SC:   So in a direct answer to my question, from 
whom was the instruction that it be made an arbitration 
award? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 167 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:   From the Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Then you say that there were further 
instructions given to you and these were at paragraph – I 
am sorry, at page 42, MM10.  Oh sorry, not instructions, 
but you then received applications to make the arbitration 
awards orders of court. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, I think the issue of …[intervenes] 
MR MOGASHOA:   That you deal with at paragraph 40. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes, the issue of nonpayment continued 
10 
and then we were served with the - on behalf of PRASA we 
were served with the applications to make …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure Mr Soni you can jump, go to 
that strange feature about that because none of that is 
disputed. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What happened, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was just the strange feature about 
20 
the authority.  I think that is the only thing. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as I can think of that is of 
importance, ja. 
ADV SONI SC:   Ja.  I just do one small thing and then I 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 168 of 182 
 
will explain why I am going there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:   At paragraph 41 you say you received a 
call from Mr Dingiswayo. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, on the 5 March. 
ADV SONI SC:   And what was that call about? 
MR MOGASHOA:   He said to me that he had received – I 
think he was talking to a colleague, not at PRASA though, 
on issues unrelated and the colleague made him aware that 
Siyaya had enrolled four matters …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   Well, those are the matters that you had 
sent to PRASA that we had just talked about. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I sent the four applications to PRASA 
already, to Mr Zide’s office to say here are the applications 
what do you want to …[intervenes] 
ADV 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 After 
your 
conversation 
with 
Mr 
Dingiswayo did you and he hold a meeting? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, Mr Dingiswayo then asked for 
copies of the applications which I forwarded to him 
accordingly and then I was invited to a meeting at which I 
20 
think Mr Molepo, who was the Acting CEO at the time, was 
present and Ms Ngoye was present and Mr Dingiswayo was 
also present there.  I went to [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV SONI SC:   You say in paragraph 42 Mr Zide was also 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 169 of 182 
 
present.     
MR MOGASHOA:   Mr Zide was part of the meeting, yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  And what happened at that meeting? 
MR MOGASHOA:   At the meeting legal presented to Mr 
Molepo that the settlements may have been referred to in 
the applications themselves that had been entered into 
without 
legal 
involvement, 
one. 
 And 
two, 
that 
the 
Chairperson did not have the authority to get PRASA into 
such settlements as may have been alluded to in the 
applications themselves. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   And what …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was this on the 8 March 2018 in terms 
of timeframe?  I see it seemed to say so around that time. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, ja, I think the date of the meeting 
is 8 March 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR MOGASHOA:   According to my affidavit. 
ADV SONI SC:   And all of this happened on the 8 March 
that you were talking about now. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I may have received Dingiswayo’s call 
20 
earlier but the meeting took place on the 8 March. 
ADV SONI SC:   On the 8 t h.  Yes, you say you met him on 
– I mean, you got a call from him on the 5 t h. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Oh yes. 
ADV SONI SC:   So this is the 8 t h.  Now in light of the fact 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 170 of 182 
 
that you had been part of the settlement on the basis of 
instructions you received from the Chairperson, what was 
your further involvement in this matter? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Ms Ngoye made a valid point at the 
meeting that another law firm be instructed to carry on with 
the instructions, more so because there was a need for 
them, an identified need at the time for them to oppose the 
applications which the applicant had enrolled in respect of 
the 
four 
matters, 
I 
can’t 
remember 
what 
the 
date 
was…[intervenes]. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:   It was the 9 t h. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Ja the applications to be heard because 
obviously I was – I’m the one who had been instructed in 
all of the processes that led to that settlement at the 
time…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   And what was the conclusion at the end, 
regarding your involvement? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The conclusion was that another law 
firm would be briefed and that I should assist with handing 
over my own set of papers to this law firm, I think it was 
20 
Bowman’s and that is exactly what our firm did. We filed 
the relevant notices of…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   And you withdrew formally? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We withdrew formally correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   You have no further knowledge of what 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 171 of 182 
 
happened, 
I 
mean, 
no 
personal 
knowledge 
of 
what 
happened in this matter in Court? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well if my recollection serves me well, 
there may have been denied, I think the opposed – the 
applications but orders were granted, I believe, but they 
rescinded such order or orders, subsequently and I’m not 
sure where the matters are now, as we speak. 
ADV SONI SC:   We’ll get to that in a moment but when the 
application to make the arbitration awards orders of Court 
was made you were not representing PRASA? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   I stopped representing PRASA on the 
8 t h…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   On the day before. 
MR MOGASHOA:   The applications were in our possession 
already. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  
MR MOGASHOA:   And then PRASA opted to instruct 
another law firm to proceed…[intervenes]. 
ADV SONI SC:   No, no I understand we’ve been through 
that, I’m just asking in the Court process itself, on the 9 t h, 
20 
you had no role in it? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We were not involved. 
ADV SONI SC:   And that’s all – that’s the extent to which 
your personal knowledge relating to the Siyaya matters 
extends? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 172 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:   That is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:   Now, you make the point right finally that 
all of this is based – what’s contained in your affidavit is 
based on the documents that were in your possession at 
the time you made this affidavit? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct, I had to pull-out certain 
portions of the files from archives, in order to prepare the 
said evidence. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson that is – those are the 
questions I have for Mr Mogashoa, having regard to the 
10 
fact that, effectively, from the 8 t h, he played no further role 
in this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine, I think I – it didn’t occur 
to me that at the time of the application before, I think an 
acting Judge, that he was no longer involved. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, when I referred to that special 
feature, I was talking about something that happened in 
Court, thinking he would have still been part of it. 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, so he wasn’t.  Now, you withdrew, 
either on the 8 t h of March as the attorney before Court for 
PRASA in regard to the Siyaya matters or soon after the 8t h 
of March? 
MR MOGASHOA: It may very well be that we filed our 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 173 of 182 
 
withdrawals on the same day.  If Mr Soni is right in 
suggesting that the applications were to be heard on the 
9 t h.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think that’s what we have been 
told.  Now, when had you last interacted with the PRASA 
Chairperson by then?  Did you interact with her after the 
meeting of the 15 t h of December, between that date and 
the 8 t h of March? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The only interaction with her would be 
this email that she wrote to me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Correspondence ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correspondence ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there was no meeting? 
MR MOGASHOA:   No there was no…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And no speaking on the phone with her? 
MR MOGASHOA:   We did not speak on the phone either. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not speak on the phone? 
MR MOGASHOA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What made you accept, discussing the 
Siyaya matters with the Legal Department on the 8 t h 
20 
despite the fact that you had been instructed by the PRASA 
Chairperson, previously not to discuss those matters with 
the Legal Department? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I think part of it would be – would have 
been the frustrations I was experiencing in getting to know 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 174 of 182 
 
from PRASA what the firm was to do with the four 
applications because up until that point, I had not received 
any 
indication 
of 
any 
kind 
whatsoever 
what 
PRASA 
intended to do with the applications and I had no reason 
not to want to cooperate with Mr Dingiswayo, when he 
called and asked about the applications because we had 
the applications in our possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what I’m  talking about is, I would 
have expected that given the instruction that you told me 
about, which you said came from the PRASA Chairperson 
10 
to you, not to discuss the Siyaya claims with PRASA’s 
Legal Department people, I would have expected that when 
Mr Dingiswayo approached you and sought to make an 
arrangement, you would have gone back to the PRASA 
Chairperson to say, you said I mustn’t talk to the Legal 
Department, they’ve phoned me, they want a meeting, do I 
stick to that instruction or has something changed? 
MR MOGASHOA:   At the time…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Dingiswayo knew that as well 
because you told him. 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   Yes, at the time, Chair, and I think it 
must be taken into account that I was not talking to the 
Chairperson 
directly, 
whether 
in 
writing 
in 
email 
correspondence or otherwise.  I had been communicating 
with or through the office of the Group Company Secretary, 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 175 of 182 
 
Mr Zide [?], it would have been irresponsible of me when, 
at the time, I received a call from Mr Dingiswayo, it would 
have been irresponsible of me to completely ignore what 
he had called me about, given the fact that I wasn’t 
receiving any instructions.  I was actually relieved that 
someone from PRASA called me about the matter.  We – I 
obviously may have asked him what was going on because 
I wasn’t receiving any feedback or instructions from the 
channel or channels that I had gotten used to between 
December and March when I started talking to him again 
10 
and as I say, I then decided to forward the applications to 
him 
without 
asking 
any 
further 
questions 
because 
I 
expected him, as someone I knew, was still at PRASA, to 
take responsible decisions around the applications.  I had 
not been briefed on any aspect to do with the applications, 
I 
was 
worried 
that, 
then 
PRASA 
was 
going 
to 
be 
unrepresented because I was not going to go to Court the 
next day without specific instructions on what my verbal 
address needed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We know that the acceptance of the 
20 
settlement agreement or the settlement offer was made 
around 17, 18, 20, 21 December, is that right? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, after the offer had been accepted 
there was that communication about payment, Matjoko 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 176 of 182 
 
saying, you know, please attend to payment urgently and I 
think you would have sought instructions from the Company 
Secretary, is that right? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe, let me clarify that.  Initially 
you were meant to communicate with the Board through the 
office of the CEO when Mr Zide was the acting CEO, is that 
right? 
MR MOGASHOA:  At the meeting of the 15 t h of December I 
was not aware that Mr Zide had stopped acting as the – 
10 
sorry 
Chair, 
as 
the 
Group 
CEO 
of 
PRASA 
but 
the 
instruction 
to 
me 
by 
the 
Chairperson 
was 
that 
any 
communication must be through Mr Zide’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, my understanding is that when that 
instruction – or let me put it this way, when that instruction 
was made, was Mr Zide not acting CEO anymore? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was under the impression that he was 
but I think Mr Soni…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it not on the – was it not at the 
meeting of the 14 – of the 4 t h of December? 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   At the meeting of the 4 t h of December 
he was still the acting CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but when you were given this 
instruction, was it not at that meeting, or was it at the 
meeting of the 15 t h? 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 177 of 182 
 
MR MOGASHOA:   It…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, it was at the meeting of the 15 t h, 
I think because you then phoned Mr Dingiswayo on the 
15 t h, I think.  I think you said that, that instruction was 
given to you at the meeting of the 15 t h. 
MR MOGASHOA:   It was given to me at the meeting of the 
15 t h not before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you are saying that, at that 
time, you were under the impression that Mr Zide was still 
acting CEO? 
10 
MR MOGASHOA:   I was under the impression that Mr Zide 
was the acting CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Still acting ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:   But I know him, I know him to be the – 
to have been the Company Secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOGASHOA:   So, when the Chairperson was giving 
instructions on how communication would be dealt with, I 
think, to me it was more Mr Zide as the person who works 
with the Board, more than it was important for me to make 
20 
that distinction whether he was still acting as the Group 
CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Or he had reverted back to his original 
position. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 178 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but from January had you asked for 
any 
instructions 
from 
PRASA 
and 
you 
didn’t 
get 
a 
response? 
MR MOGASHOA:   The – I think Mr Soni took me through 
one attachment which I received by text, that’s the meeting 
between – the meeting that the parties had decided to hold 
with Mr Brandt to confirm some of the settlements but 
otherwise I would – so I would – those are the instructions 
I received because I had to take instructions on what 
PRASA wanted me to do with the fact that the plaintiff 
10 
wanted to make those settlements arbitrators awards.  The 
other normal communication would have had to be about 
payments that the Siyaya Group was complaining were not 
forthcoming and then the next big thing then was the 
applications themselves which I forwarded to PRASA 
through the office of Mr Zide and what then transpired was, 
Mr Dingiswayo’s call and then the handing over of such 
applications to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting of the 8 t h of March, you say 
it included Mr Zide? 
20 
MR MOGASHOA:   Mr Zide was present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so – you see I was just concerned 
that you didn’t go back to the Chairperson when, now it 
seemed that you were going to meet with – to discuss 
Siyaya matters with people that he said you mustn’t 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 179 of 182 
 
discuss them with but there was Mr Zide who was there 
and that is what – that made a difference to you. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Mr Zide was present then yes, it made a 
difference to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, no that’s fine. 
MR MOGASHOA:   And possibly when – and I’m probably 
correct in making this suggestion, when Mr Dingiswayo 
asked 
that 
I 
forward 
the 
applications, 
we, 
in 
all 
probabilities, CC’d Mr Zide because I had no reason to 
want to not have him know that legal had asked for those 
10 
applications from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, did you ever deal with Mr Molepo, I 
think he was the acting CEO after Mr Zide ceased to be 
acting CEO. 
MR MOGASHOA:   No, no, no I just – the first encounter 
Chair, was that meeting and nothing ever since. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, was he present at the meeting of the 
8 t h? 
MR MOGASHOA:   He was, I think the meeting was called 
by his office. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Mr Molepo? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Ja, well seemingly at the insistence of 
Legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Which had become aware about the 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 180 of 182 
 
publications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, are you able to tell what his 
attitude was to this settlement – this settlements that had 
happened or are you not able to tell from the discussions 
at the meeting of the 8 t h or the whole topic was different by 
that time? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I think he was concerned because he 
did not have any trouble having legal proceed with the 
opposition that they had intended mounting against the 
applications. So, in as far – well to that extent one thinks 
10 
that he agreed or he was in agreement with legal that a 
different approach would be taken. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
settlement 
agreements should be made arbitration awards, was that 
part of the settlement agreement, was there a clause in the 
settlement agreement that said that?  It just seems strange 
to me that, unless it’s included in a settlement agreement, 
it seems that I’m going to agree that I’m going to pay you 
and we sign and then I also agree that, let’s make this an 
order of Court but if, at the time we made this settlement 
20 
agreement that was part of the settlement agreement that 
may be different because otherwise if it’s not part of the 
settlement agreement if I have agreed that I’m going to pay 
you, then I pay you within the time that I’ve agreed to pay 
you and of course if I fail to pay you, you might have cause 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 181 of 182 
 
to want to make the settlement agreement an arbitration 
award or order of Court but normally you’d wait until you 
see whether compliant.  I just find it strange that PRASA – 
you were instructed to agree to having the settlement 
agreements made orders or arbitration awards. 
MR MOGASHOA:   I think if you look at the timelines, 
Chair, if we accept that the settlements were agreed to 
around the 21 s t of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   December ja. 
MR MOGASHOA:   This is now beginning of February that 
10 
Mr Matjoko is beginning to complain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That the period of payment had expired? 
MR MOGASHOA:   Well reasonable period had expired 
although…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Was 
there 
not 
a 
specific 
period 
mentioned, like 30 days? 
MR MOGASHOA:   I doubt that the tenders had stipulated 
any period because otherwise we would be making a lot of 
reference to the periods referred to in the tenders.  So, 
they probably thought that whatever number of days that 
20 
may have lapsed since they accepted the offer were 
enough to have them start complaining about the fact that 
they’re not getting paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine, anything arising? 
ADV SONI SC:   Nothing else. 
12 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 249 
 
Page 182 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing else, thank you very much Mr 
Mogashoa for having come to assist the Commission, we 
appreciate that you may have been like us, you thought 
this might have taken two hours, it ended up taking the 
whole day but we appreciate that you came and you have 
given your evidence, thank you very much. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Thank you Chair and I’m glad that I 
could be of some assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are excused. 
MR MOGASHOA:   Thank you very much.

CHAIRPERSON:   We are going to adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow the sitting will start at ten, we adjourn.
