PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 04 DECEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Chaskalson, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We are Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Holden.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I wonder on my way in this 
morning I saw some disconcerting banner headlines and I 
wonder if we might just clarify what seems to be a 
10 
misunderstanding in the public eye. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because the banner headline say 
R800 million stolen – how R800 million was stolen or 
something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So if we can – can I just clarify 
what Mr Holden was R800 million of public funds stolen 
from Estina Dairy? 
MR HOLDEN:  No it was not. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  How much in public funds went 
into Estina Dairy in total? 
MR HOLDEN:  It was R280 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Indeed.  And what does the R800 
million refer to? 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 4 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:  The R800 million refers to the aggregate 
deposits that is all of the deposits that have taken place 
into the Estina account and the importance of the figure is 
that we can show that all of the transfer that constituted 
that R800 000 the vast majority were drawn from the 
original 
R280 
million 
deposited 
by 
the 
Free 
State 
Government. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So that R280 million went in over 
time into the Estina account and then parts of it were taken 
out and then circulated within the Gupta Enterprise and 
10 
then put back in so that it looked like instead of a total of 
R280 million being deposited in there as R800 million 
depositing – deposited in? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But the total amount of public 
funds was R280 million? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
Chair 
when 
we 
adjourned 
20 
yesterday we had reached the end of part 3 of tranche 0 on 
the diagrams and I indicated that to speed things up we 
would not be looking at every single transaction we would 
just taking a fairly high level overview of the movement of 
money.  And so if I can ask Mr Holden to go back to the big 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 5 of 130 
 
overview of tranche 0 which is at page 672? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly and just to correct you.  We did 
not actually complete part 3.  We reached step 5 of … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Step 5 – step 5 of part 3. 
MR HOLDEN:  Of 7. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry step? 
MR HOLDEN:  Step 5 of 7. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Step 5 of 7?  Okay well we – we 
can go back to part 3 just to – on the big picture to – to 
finish it off but if we go to page 672.  To orient the Chair 
10 
for where we will be going forward 672 is a high level 
overview of tranche 0.  We have done part 1 can you 
highlight part 1 on the screen?  Or maybe it is easier to 
refer to it by your code.  What – what do the black arrows 
reflect? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  The black arrows reflect the 
internal South African based accounts that is part 1 of 
tranche 0.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then the red arrows? 
MR HOLDEN:  The – I do not think we to the red arrows.  
20 
We have the pink arrows which is part 2 over here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry I have some colour reading 
issues.  The pink arrows are part 2 okay.  And the green 
arrows? 
MR HOLDEN:  The green arrows are part 3 and it – it is a 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 6 of 130 
 
little bit complicated to trace but it goes – so – so as … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am afraid for the purposes of 
the record because we all going to come back to read a 
transcript you going to have to describe what you mean by 
and so and so because we will not see the video. 
MR HOLDEN:  Oh dear. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The video at the same time. 
MR HOLDEN:  Okay.  The green arrows refer to part 3 as I 
call it of the – of Tranche 0 which is deals with the 
dissipation of $400 000.00 from Gateway Limited through 
10 
to a number of different accounts.  We have a movement 
down on the 23 September 2013 of $400 000.00 into Global 
Corporations, Standard Chartered, Dubai Vest, US Dollar 
accounts.  That is then – takes a downward leftward loop 
further down into Global Corporations, Bank of Abu Dhabi.  
Durham based account on the same day if I may just zoom 
in.  That amount then goes up and that is a 1.7 million 
Dirham cash withdrawal on the 24 t h and there is two 
streams that flow from that cash withdrawal.  The first 
stream which I will focus on here is a transfer that we 
20 
spoke about yesterday that goes from the cash all the way 
to the right and then takes an upward trajectory and then 
again left and that is the 367 245.00 Durham which we 
suspect went to Hawala currency exchanges.  The 
 
The second stream of cash 1.3 million Durham is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 7 of 130 
 
transferred also on the 24 t h it goes to the right and then up 
and 
then 
to 
the 
left 
again 
to 
enter 
into 
Global 
Corporations, 
Bank 
of 
Baroda, 
Dubai 
based 
Durham 
account.  Of that amount immediately after it is received 
$100 000.00 dollars which is equal to 367 450.00 Durham 
is then paid into Fidelity Enterprises Bank of Baroda Dubai 
based US Dollar account.   
 
It – at this point it co-mingles with the whole series 
of other parts of this tranche to fund a transfer that moves 
downwards to the left of $900 000.00 that is made to 
10 
Oakbay 
Investments, 
Bank 
of 
Baroda 
Johannesburg 
account 024/034 and I will explain exactly how that amount 
is funded very shortly. 
 
The remainder of the cash part of it has been 
deposited 368 750.00 Durham is transferred on the 7 
October and it goes upwards to the left and it is says Cash 
given to Vikus in the ledger.  I suspect that this was most 
likely an employee of the Gupta Enterprise called Vikus 
Chaturvedi.  And Vikus Chaturvedi was an employee who 
was based in India who is responsible for amongst other 
20 
things 
logistical 
exercises 
for 
the 
Gupta 
Enterprise 
organising visas and plane tickets and sort of odd job 
duties on the ground. 
 
If I may return? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Please do. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 8 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:  To the way in which the 900 000 which I am 
indicating here.  I am going to try and zoom in to make it a 
bit clearer.  This $900 000.00 transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what page is that – that 
diagram? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is 672 which is the big 
overview of part 1.  If – to look at it in closer detail – sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No my 672 [talking over one another] red.  
That one has three reds.  Mine does not.  My 672 does not 
have three red destinations as – my 672. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  671 I am sorry Chair. 671. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  671. 
MR HOLDEN:  Okay, okay alright.  Okay.   
MR HOLDEN:  So to return this $900 000.00 transfer that 
is paid from Fidelity Enterprises Bank of Baroda account 
into Oakbay Investments that is funded from three different 
sources of funds. 
 
$100 000.00 of that we have just described and that 
comes from the original $400 000.00 deposit that started 
20 
part 3 of tranche 0.  R750 000.00 of that is drawn from a 
payment in here which is actually one of the few times we 
see a transfer in from an outside source in relation to 
Estina and it is an amount of $754 755.46 pennies and that 
was also transferred on the 24 September 2013 into 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 9 of 130 
 
Global’s Bank of Baroda Dubai based US Dollar accounts 
and it is reflected on the spread sheet as JJT.  We will 
explore in quite a bit more detail in further sessions the 
exact identify of JJT suffice the note here that JJT was 
wholly owned by the Worlds Window Group and was one of 
the 
entities 
that 
entered 
into 
a 
series 
of 
kickback 
agreements relating to the Transnet Flow of Funds. 
 
I cannot definitively state at this point based on the 
documents available to me that this 750 000 definitely 
derived from the Transnet payments because at the same 
10 
time as those payments were being made to JJT and 
onwards 
onto 
the 
Gupta 
Enterprise 
they 
were 
also 
undertaking a whole series of other transactions at the 
same time around money laundering. 
 
So unfortunately we cannot say definitively that this 
is from the Transnet contracts but we do know definitively 
that it is from JJT. 
 
That is then – in this account when we move to a 
further – further part 4 there is $50 000.00 that remains in 
the Global Corporation Bank of Baroda Dubai account 
20 
which brings the balance to $800 000.00 once the JJT 
amount has been paid in.  And that $800 000.00 is then 
transferred to Fidelity Enterprises to join the 100 000.00 
that had been paid in by Global Corporation and that is 
then 
paid 
onwards 
as 
the 
$900 000.00 
to 
Oakbay 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 10 of 130 
 
Investments. 
 
So correctly speaking we can say that from tranche 
0 funds that were paid in by the Free State government of 
the $900 000.00 that is paid to Oakbay Investments here 
we see 100 000.00 from his part – from part 3, 50 000.00 
from part 4 and as I will describe in a little bit more detail 
later 100 000.00 from part 5 – from part 5 and a certain 
amount from tranche 2 as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can you then again very quickly 
but so that people can follow what you are doing also 
10 
zooming in – can you take the Chair through tranche 0 part 
4? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Certainly.  So tranche 0 part 4 is 
the blue lines on the diagram and that is initiated the day 
after the $3 million is transferred into Gateway Limited 
Standard Chartered account.  $1 million is transferred from 
Gateway Limited to Standard Charter US Dollar account 
and moves down on the diagram to Global Corporations, 
Standard Chartered US Dollar account.  Of that 750 000.00 
Durham which is equal to roughly $200 000.00 is then 
20 
transferred down on the 8 September 2013 into Global 
Corporations Standard Chartered Durham based account.  
On the same day that amount is then withdrawn in cash 
which we can see going down.  On the – again on the same 
day the 750 000.00 Durham in cash is the paid into Global 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 11 of 130 
 
Corporations Bank of Abu Dhabi Durham based account 
and then again on the same day $200 000.00 is then 
transferred on the 8 September 2013 into a ledger entry 
that just says Shivani – Ashla Gupta and as we described 
earlier that is the wife and the sister of the Gupta brothers. 
 
So 200 000.00 here is slightly less than 750 000.00 
Durham.  The remainder of that $1 million … 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Before you move off there can 
you just indicate to the Chair how we see another cash fire 
break here? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  Absolutely.  So as we have seen in the 
previous tranche at this point here which I am highlighting 
on the screen you see the 750 000.00 Durham withdrawn in 
cash. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well can you go even higher up 
because it is the same entity all the way through. 
MR HOLDEN:  Absolutely.  It is Global Corporation which is 
receiving the funds and as we can see with the third part 
that was transferred into Global Corporations Bank of Abu 
Dhabi to then facilitate the fire break.  In this case the 
20 
750 000.00 Durham is transferred to a Standard Chartered 
Account owned by Global then withdrawn in cash and then 
transferred further onto Global Corporations Bank of Abu 
Dhabi account.  So without access to – if you were 
Standard Chartered for example and you were looking at 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 12 of 130 
 
this funds flow you would only see that 750 000.00 Durham 
in cash has been withdrawn.  You would have no idea 
where that 750 000.00 Durham went to.  You would need in 
order 
to 
trace 
this 
the 
bank 
statements 
for 
Global 
Corporations accounts across all of their banks that they 
hold so that obviously makes it very difficult for compliance 
departments for example for banks to pick that up. 
 
Shall I describe the remainder of that – that part? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Please do – please do. 
MR HOLDEN:  Okay.  So of 1 million that is transferred on 
10 
the 
5 
September 
2013 
700 000.00 
of 
that 
is 
then 
transferred upwards to the right on the – that is two days 
after the payment is received.  R700 000.00 on the 7 
September gets paid into Global Corporation Bank of 
Baroda Dubai based US Dollar accounts. 
 
Of that amount $145 000.00 is transferred into 
Fidelity Enterprises Bank of Baroda Dubai based US Dollar 
account which moves sort of [00:15:43] to the right.  And 
then finally the following day. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry just again for the record 
20 
purposes to emphasise on part 4 of tranche 0 we are 
looking at blue arrows? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct blue arrows.  And then finally 
with this stream we see on the following day on the 9 
September $142 000.00 which is transferred to an entity 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 13 of 130 
 
that is recorded in the ledgers as Batia Share Purchase.  
We do not – we cannot – as we cannot see the exact 
recipient account number I cannot confirm exactly what 
Batia that refers to but it is worth nothing that in the Gupta 
Leaks 
files 
there 
is 
quite 
an 
extensive 
set 
of 
correspondence indicating a Joint Venture was entered into 
between a certain Gupta Enterprise Companies and an 
Indian based coal producer by the name of Bhatia Coal and 
I would strongly suspect that this refers to a purchase of 
Bhatia shares in India. 
10 
 
And then finally to close out this blue line part the 
remainder of the 700 000.00 that had been transferred on 
the 7 September the – of that $504 087.00 which equals 
1.85 million Durham is transferred to the right on the 
diagram on the 7/9/2013.  It reached Global Corporations 
Bank of Baroda Dubai based – Dubai based Durham 
account and on the same day we see an entry of that 1.85 
million Durham being transferred to – to the Nadi Exchange 
for Hawala and that closes that out.  So with – with parts 3 
and 4 concluded we can see the total amount of tranche 1 
20 
funds – tranche 0 funds I should say that went to the 
Hawala 
exchange 
was 
2 614 500.00 
Durham 
and 
the 
amount that was given in cash to the Vikus Chaturvedi was 
368 750.00 Durham. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then if you could finish off 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 14 of 130 
 
tranche 0 with the fifth and last stream? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  So tranche 0 is highlighted on 
the diagram in red and there are two unfortunately two 
streams involved here.   
 
The first stream is a payment shortly after Gateway 
Limited receives its funds from Estina.  It is paid from 
Gateway Limited Standard Chartered US Dollar account 
into Accurate Investments Limited Standard Chartered 
Dubai based US Dollar account. 
 
And then immediately thereafter $1.347 million is 
10 
transferred to Linkway Tradings State Bank of India 
Johannesburg account.   
 
I attempted to confirm the exact rand amount that 
that would equal to but the treatment of this deposit in 
Linkway’s State Bank of India account was slightly strange.  
It does not reflect the full amount coming in but only a 
portion of it and it refers to it as transferred from ZA – 
transferred to ZAR accounts which would make me believe 
that either Linkway Trading the State Bank of India 
received the deposit into a US Dollar denominated account 
20 
and discoursed a portion of it into the Linkway Trading for 
that – I did then check the historical exchange rate on that 
day and it was almost exactly R10.00 to the dollar so the 
total amount that was transferred was roughly R13.47 
million to Linkway Trading.  And then as the final stream of 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 15 of 130 
 
the 1.4 million that was paid on the 9 September there was 
50 000.00 that remained in Accurate Investment account. 
This was then transferred over on the 23 September 2013 
into Fidelity Enterprises Standard Chartered Dubai based 
US Dollar account which it moves to the right here.  It is 
joined by a transfer that had to be made five days previous 
from 
Gateway 
Limited 
Standard 
Chartered 
US 
Dollar 
account into Fidelity Enterprises Standard Chartered Dubai 
based US Dollar account of 50 000.00.  And then that same 
day we see a transfer of $3.1 million from Fidelity 
10 
Enterprises Standard Chartered Dubai based US Dollar 
account 
into 
Oakbay 
Investments 
Bank 
of 
Baroda 
Johannesburg account.  Of that $3.1 million we can 
definitively 
trace 
100 000.00 
to 
tranche 
0 
and 
the 
remainder 3 million to tranche 2.  So if we look at the 
bottom here we can see again a corresponding end point 
the final railway station stop the exit point for Linkway 
Trading in this tranche but this tranche they earned $1.347 
million and Oakbay Investments is paid formerly in dollars 
at this time of which $250 000.00 is sourced from tranche 
20 
0.  And that concludes the section. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr 
Holden.  It is quite a staggering exercise this and we are 
about to get to the worst of the lot which is tranche 1.  So 
can I – can I ask you to – to go to page 692.  And there we 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 16 of 130 
 
see an overview of tranche 1 and can you tell the Chair 
how this – how you have broken up this tranche for the 
purposes of your analysis and what arrows mean what in 
terms of different sections of the – of the analysis? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  But before I do so it might be 
worthwhile explaining some of the reasoning behind the 
way in which this tranche operated. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Absolutely. 
MR HOLDEN:  So as we saw with tranche 0 we had money 
coming in from the Free State government and immediately 
10 
being put into a fixed deposit account and being left 
untouched for a period of time for over a year. 
 
But as 2012 wore on Estina started having to 
develop and deliver a dairy farm in which case they started 
incurring certain costs.   
 
In order to finance those costs as the following 
payment from the Free State government the tranche 1 
payment was only going to be made in 2013 – 18 April 
2013.   
 
The – Estina took out a series of well Kamal 
20 
Vashram I should say this took on a series of loans from 
Oakbay Investments and Aerohaven Trading which were 
immediately on paid to Estina and used for various costs 
and they were ultimately settled once the tranche 1 funds 
came in from the Free State government. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 17 of 130 
 
 
And then turning to the diagram it is I am fully 
aware that in this format it is almost illegible but it does 
give you a good sense of the extent of the complexity of 
the section. 
 
As with the previous diagram the start point of 
money entering into the – the money flows is the green box 
of the Free State government which is right at the bottom.  
And then we have a series of red… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry while we at the green box 
can you just clarify that the – that it was not R34.95. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  It was 34.95 million yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja there should be an M there. 
MR HOLDEN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HOLDEN:  And then we have obviously the red boxes 
which again are the final stepping off point on the journey.  
And we have a couple here and over here.  The yellow 
boxes are again or anything that is colour coded in yellow 
is a – a stop along the way to a final destination adding 
slightly more complexity to the – the yellow.  Every loan 
20 
account that is taken out is indicated as a circle.  And 
every fixed deposit account is designated by this particular 
rhombus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I missed the part about the 
circle. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 18 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:  So the – the fixed deposit accounts are 
represented by this – this rhombus here sort of like a 
slightly skew squiggly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
MR HOLDEN:  Ja.  Obviously just to distinguish it from the 
other squares, rectangles on the page.  And then in terms 
of the colour coding. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Sorry Mr Holden can you just go 
and clarify what you said about the loan accounts as well? 
MR HOLDEN:  Yes so the loan accounts are circles – are 
10 
indicated as circles on the diagram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So whenever I see a circle I must know 
that is a loan account? 
MR HOLDEN:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:  And whenever you see the skew square the 
rhombus here you will know that is a fixed deposit account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR HOLDEN:  And then anything else that is a square and 
yellow is a stop off point that is a current account or a 
20 
saving accounts of some kind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR HOLDEN:  Then there are four – I broke this tranche 
down into four different sets of fund flows.  The first part is 
indicated by green arrows, the second part is indicated by 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 19 of 130 
 
purple arrows, the third part is indicated by blue arrows 
and the final part is indicated by an orangey red colour. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC: Because this tranche is so dense 
I think it may be simpler when we – when we run through it 
to do it by the part diagrams rather than the overview 
diagram because there is so much on the overview 
diagram.  So can I ask you to go to part 1 on page 693?  
And take us through what you describing in part 1? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly so what we see here Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am sorry might I ask that every 
10 
now and then where you see a fairly obvious money 
laundering device being employed maybe to flag it. 
MR HOLDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Maybe not every time because 
that may take too long. 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  So this part is actually entirely a 
– a money laundering exercise to an extent.  It is – if you 
look at the overview diagram on the left hand side the first 
large yellow box which is a little bit down here is the loan 
that is granted by Oakbay to Kamal Vashram which is 
20 
eventually settled with the money that is paid in by the 
Free State government.  So what we are seeing here in a 
very complicated form is a circular movement of funds – I 
will go out a little bit further if I can.  Circle movement of 
funds which effectively settles a loan back loop.  This is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 20 of 130 
 
what is known as a loan back.  If I go to… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the loan back is settled with 
public funds? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Not with Gupta Enterprises 
funds. 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct.  So none of the funds that 
are transferred from Oakbay to Kamal Vashram are actually 
ever fully derived from Oakbay Investments it is just an 
advance on the Free State government’s tranche payment 
10 
and it is repaid in full by the Free State government funds. 
 
I have broken just down into steps as well which 
might be a little bit easier to… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If you want to take it step by step 
by all means do. 
MR HOLDEN:  And – so this would be I am not quite sure 
what the – it would be the following page in the… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  694. 
MR HOLDEN:  694.  So the first step here is that Oakbay 
transfers its loan which I put in inverted commas to Kamal 
20 
Vashram’s Bank of Baroda and Standard Bank accounts.  
In this slide we see the loan payments made over a period 
from the – I am trying to find the earliest payment.  I think 
it is the 9 November 2012 and the latest payment is the 18 
April 2013 and in total all of those payments total R6.342 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 21 of 130 
 
million.  And as we can see here these amounts are as we 
scroll over to the following slide. So here is Oakbay’s loan 
and here are all the transactions being paid into Kamal 
Vashram’s accounts.   
 
The first one up here is his Bank of Baroda account 
and the one down here is the Standard Bank accounts and 
if you scroll over to the following step we see that Kamal 
Vashram transfers immediately the day he receives the 
loans from Oakbay he pays them directly into Estina 
Standard Bank account 310864860 which is then used to 
10 
pay a whole range of dairy related costs over the course of 
a period of time.  Here of that R6 million original loan 
R4 135 829.63 goes to entities that I assume are related to 
the provision of the dairy farm.  It goes to various 
contractors and local businesses in Vrede.  And... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  But included in that is salaries to 
– well to him? 
MR HOLDEN:  Indeed.  Thank you for pointing that out.  
One of the largest recipients of funds in that – and actually 
over the life of the Estina Project, when I refer to dairy 
20 
related costs, I also mean employee costs there.  By far the 
largest recipient of funds personally form the Estina Project, 
in that regard was a man by the name of Chandra(?) 
Maprusaad(?).   
 
And Chandra Maprusaad in the Gupta-leak-show was a 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 22 of 130 
 
very close Gupta associate.  His work – these [speaker not 
clear] – for South Africa was arranged by the Gupta 
enterprise.  I think, as far as I recall, on the Sahara Base 
letterhead.  He had no experience whatsoever in agriculture.  
It appears that ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What was his experience? 
MR HOLDEN:   His experience appears to be based – from 
what we can discern in the Gupta leaks is that he was either 
a junior to or a PA to a former Indian Intelligence officer.   
 
And if we – I am not sure if you recall(?) here but I think 
10 
there was a witness by the name of Pasan(?) who appeared 
before the Commission at a certain stage.  And he described 
the experience of interacting with Chandra Maprusaad 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, yes, yes.  I think I remember 
that. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR HOLDEN:   Where Chandra Maprusaad could not 
understand why all the cows were dying and he had to 
20 
explain that they cannot just survive off grass.  That they 
needed feed as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR HOLDEN:   Ja.  And over time – over the length of the 
Estina Project, that we can see, he gets paid just over 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 23 of 130 
 
R 3 million in this period.  So a very substantial salary over 
this period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR HOLDEN:   We also see him interacting with the various 
Gupta Enterprise’s employees, trying to advise them on how 
they can get certain security or diplomatic clearances in 
India.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR HOLDEN:   So I would imagine that part of the reason he 
was employed was to facilitate those sort of contacts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There is also an amount of just 
under 460 000 that goes to AFGRI Equipment in one of your 
red boxes coming out of ...[intervenes]  
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [Indistinct]  
MR HOLDEN:   So of that, the six million loan, R 459 876 is 
paid on the 11t h of January, to the right, to AFGRI 
Equipment.  They receive a further payment from this 
20 
tranche, which is why I indicated a total there of 2.819 and I 
will show where those funds come from.   
 
And then to close our first step.  Some(?) is strange.  I 
do not fully understand the reason behind this but one of the 
Oakbay Transfers to Kamal Vasram was for R 1.2 million on 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 24 of 130 
 
the 6t h of November.   
 
And we can see here, it goes from Kamal Vasram’s 
Standard Bank account all the way up gladly(?) to the right 
up to Estina’s Bank of Baroda account.  Current account 
02255.  That amount is then immediately put into a cash 
margin account and it stays there for...   
 
Apologies.  It says there for about 18-days where it is 
returned back to Estina’s Bank of Baroda account.  And then 
ultimately paid onwards to an entity that is described in the 
budget(?) statement as Vrede, Pretorius and Bosman at that 
10 
FNB address.   
 
And some limited online searches seems to suggest that 
Pretorius and Bosman were a law firm based in Vrede.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you...  On this diagram, all of 
the money appears to be originating in an Oakbay loan and 
all of it goes through Kamal Vasram to Estina.  Can you 
suggest that may – why the money flow may have be 
designed that way? 
MR HOLDEN:   The only possible reason I can think, is to 
create a degree of confusion in tracing the funds to create a 
20 
distance between Oakbay and Estina. 
 
So that when an investigator was to look at the Estina, 
Standard bank account, for example, they will be seeing a 
whole range of transfers from Kamal Vasram who is the sole 
director of Estina.  And he could argue at that point:  See, I 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 25 of 130 
 
am putting in my own funds into this venture.   
 
Whereas, if you had Kamal Vasram’s bank account, you 
realise that actually it is none of his own funds.  It is 
Oakbay’s funds.  And as you will see, those Oakbay’s funds 
are eventually returned. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go to step 2? 
MR HOLDEN:   Step 3. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, sorry step 3.  Step 3. 
MR HOLDEN:   Step 3 works slightly differently.  There is as 
loan amount that is transferred from Oakbay into Kamal 
10 
Vasram’s Bank of Baroda counter account, which is 024/262.  
500 000 is transferred here up to the right.  Of the 500 000 
up to the 26t h of October 2012, of that 150 000 is 
immediately ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Holden, you have lost me 
again.  What page is that one? 
MR HOLDEN:   Oh, that will be the following. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   696, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   696? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, thank you. 
MR HOLDEN:   So on the 26 t h of October 2012, 500 000 is 
transferred to Kamal Vasram’s Bank of Baroda bank account 
from the Oakbay loan facility.  On that same day, 350 000 is 
then transferred into Sunday Trading’s Standard Bank 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 26 of 130 
 
account.   
 
And as we discussed yesterday, Sunday Trading was a 
sole director of Sunday Trading, Kamal Vasram but it was 
implicated in a series of State Capture related scams with 
the 
Free 
State 
Government. 
 
And 
the 
remaining 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And was that involving – I think 
yesterday you testified that it involved selling computers 
derived from Sahara at a very substantial mark-up to the 
provincial government. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair.  Of the remaining 
R 500 000,00, a R 15 000,00 is transferred to Estina’s 
Standard Bank account where it is used to pay – it is 
comingled with the other funds to pay all sorts of assorted 
dairy costs.  And then we have a final, slightly complicated 
step.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Page 697 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   This begins with step 4 which I have 
indicated here at the bottom.  Again, there was another 
amount of the Oakbay loans that behaves very differently 
and it becomes quite a complicated treatment which is quite 
clearly designed as a money laundering exercise.   
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 27 of 130 
 
 
We 
can 
see 
that 
on 
the 
11t h 
of 
October 
2012, 
R 3.5 million is transferred from Oakbay’s loan to Kamal 
Vasram’s Bank of Baroda current account.   
 
That is then immediately transferred onwards to Estina’s 
Standard Bank account.  And then on that same day, 
2.359 million is paid to AFGRI Equipment.  I am sorry, it is 
the following day rather than the same day.   
 
So on the 12t h of October, we see a line to the right here 
from Estina’s Standard Bank to AGRI Equipment and that 
brings the total to just over – just under three million, or at 
10 
least two parts paid in.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Three million to AFGRI? 
MR HOLDEN:   To AFGRI.  That is correct.  That leaves, 
after this payment was made, just over a million rand from 
the original R 3.5 million loan.   
 
That is then transferred back into Kamal Vasram’s Bank 
of Baroda account on the 12t h of October 2012 and that is 
step 5 in my diagram here.  
 
That amount then comingles with another amount in 
Kamal Vasram’s Bank of Baroda current account.  My 
20 
apologies. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is the...  That would be 
the missing 950 000 that we were discussing yesterday. 
MR HOLDEN:   Correct.  So I suspect that that 150 000 
might have derived from the Tranche 0 payment that was 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 28 of 130 
 
paid to Estina’s ABSA account because there is a payment 
out of 150 000.   
 
And it seems quite a coincidence that that amount then 
gets reintegrated back into the laundering system.  So that 
R 1.05 million 
joins 
with 
the 
R 150 000 
and 
is 
then 
transferred into Estina, Bank of Baroda fixed deposit 
account.   
 
So again, what is noticeable there is that it is not a 
Kamal Vasram’s Bank of Baroda fixed deposit account.  He is 
transferring funds from his own account to create an Estina 
10 
fixed deposit account.   
 
The – this current account remains active for a – for just 
over five months if my maths is correct.  No, apologies.  It 
is... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is just under a year. 
MR HOLDEN:   Sorry, just under a year.  Apologies.  
R 2 million is then – it is transferred from that fixed deposit 
account into Estina’s Bank of Baroda account.   
 
At that point, on the 4t h, it joins an amount of 
R 28 million that we saw from Tranche 0 that is paid into – 
20 
that was the fixed deposit in Tranche 0.   
 
It is then paid out to Estina’s Standard Bank account 
that which then facilitates the R 30 million transfer to the 
right here to get ...[indistinct] [speaker is not clear] which is 
the offshore payment that we were discussing in the previous 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 29 of 130 
 
tranche.  And we can ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Just to recap here.  When we 
dealt with that payment of just over 32 million Dollars to 
Gateway yesterday, 28 million had come from Tranche 0 and 
what you are describing here is the remaining 2 million. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct.  So to clarify.  We can 
definitively trace of that 30 million, 28 million definitely came 
from Tranche 0.  1.05 million definitely came from Tranche 1.  
And I suspect the remaining 150 000 came from Tranche 0.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if you can complete the loan 
10 
back story. 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes.  Which is on the following ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is then on page 698.  So thus 
far, it looks like this entire money flow has been funded by 
an Oakbay loan. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair.  What we see now is 
the Free State Government pay in money sufficient to now 
settle those loans.  So that happens as step 7 on my 
diagram here.   
 
On the 18t h of April 2013, R 34.95 million, I have 
20 
included the M.  So it is not R 34.95.  It is paid on the Free 
State Government in Estina’s Standard Bank account.   
 
That is then – 10 million of which is then transferred 
immediately on the 19 t h of April 2013 into Estina’s Bank of 
Baroda counter account 02255.   
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 30 of 130 
 
 
And then again on the same day, that is then placed into 
a fixed deposit account as step 8 with the account number 
03/245.   
 
This is where things get very complicated.  Estina then...  
Oh, so Kamal Vasram then opens up a loan account of 
R 9.5 million up here in the left-hand corner which is 
guaranteed against the Estina’s Bank of Baroda fixed deposit 
account which again Chair is a very useful way of breaking 
the flow of funds. 
 
Because 
unless you 
have the underlining 
banking 
10 
instructions from the Bank of Baroda, you will not know that 
the loan amount is actually based on Estina’s funds.   
 
That 9.5 million is then transferred out over the course 
of three days in one payment of 5 million and one payment of 
4.5 million 
on 
the 
19t h 
of 
April 
2013 
and 
the 
22n d of April 2013.  Respectively, it gets paid to Oakbay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So that is Kamal Vasram repaying 
the original Oakbay advance on the basis of funds that are 
secured by Estina fixed deposit which in turn has been 
funded by the Free State Government. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair.  And then the final step 
in this particular loan back scheme is step 10 up here which 
is that finally on the 14t h of October 2013, the fixed deposit 
account is closed and the proceeds are paid back into 
Estina’s Bank of Baroda counter account 02/255.   
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 31 of 130 
 
 
And the loan account is then closed and it is settled.  As 
you can see there is a dotted line there and I should have 
made perhaps a little bit clearer.   
 
When I indicate a dotted line, either they a fund flow 
based on a guarantee rather than an actual fund flow.  If that 
makes sense.   
 
And then here we have the loan get settled by the fixed 
deposit’s closure.  That happens on the 14t h of October 
2013.   
 
And it is an amount of R 9 577 673, 94 which is the 9.5 
10 
million plus a small amount of added interest that has been 
settled against the 10 million funds which effectively closes 
the loan back and allows us to see that all of these funds are 
ultimately paid back using Free State Government funds.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is the end of part 2 of 
tranche...  Sorry, part 1 of Tranche 1.  Before we get to part 
2.  Maybe if we can go back to the big picture which is page 
692.  So you can show us where part 2 is going to fit in.   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So part 2 on the big diagram is a 
– is indicated by the pink lines.  And again, it will be making 
20 
use of a fixed deposit and loan arrangement.  And it 
eventually pays out funds to Vargafield, Linkway Trading and 
on dairy costs as well.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go to the close up of 
part 2 which starts on page 699.   
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 32 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  What we have here is 
effectively another loan back scheme using Oakbay in which 
ultimately the funds are repaid using Free State Government 
funds.  If I may go to the next page to start the step bits? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay.  That would be page 700 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
MR HOLDEN:   Okay.  So on the 18 t h of April, the first step is 
the 
deposit 
in 
from 
the 
Free 
State 
Government 
of 
R 34.95 million.  It goes into Estina’s Standard Bank here to 
10 
the 
right. 
 That 
is 
then 
transferred 
four 
days 
later, 
R 24.95 million.   
 
It is then transferred up and to Estina’s Bank of Baroda 
account.  And if you recall from the previous part of Tranche 
1.  That was happening roughly at the same time as the 
R 10 million 
stream 
was 
devoted 
into 
a 
fixed 
deposit 
account.   
 
And then on the 22 n d of April 2013, so the same day, it is 
paid into Estina’s Bank of Baroda current account.  It is put 
into a Bank of Baroda fixed deposit account, 03/246.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   H’m. 
MR HOLDEN:   To the following page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   To the following page, which is 
701.  So we are now sitting with a fixed deposit of 25 million. 
MR HOLDEN:   And the step 3 here is that Kamal Vasram 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 33 of 130 
 
again takes out a R 4 million loan with the Bank of Baroda 
with account number 06/297.  And here I have indicated with 
a dotted line.   
 
He takes it out against the Estina Bank of Baroda fixed 
deposit account, which as you saw previously, was a good 
way of breaking electronic flow of funds you would not be 
able to see where that was derived from.   
 
That R 4 million ultimately ends up back in Estina’s 
Standard Bank account operating, according to the Standard 
Oakbay loan back.   
10 
 
But we saw here, which is quite interesting, when we 
were looking into this particular payment once I received the 
statements from the Commission is that the Bank of Baroda 
loan account for Kamal Vasram, the R 4 million loan account, 
if you look at that statement...   
 
Well, it is – in the withdrawal figure, it actually states it 
is going to Oakbay Investments but it goes to no Oakbay 
Investment account at all.   
 
Instead, it turns in Estina’s Standard Bank account with 
the reference Kamal Vasram.   
20 
 
So what I suspect happened was that the Bank of 
Baroda knew quite well that this amount was ultimately going 
to be paid onto Kamal Vasram anyway and skipped a step 
instead of paying it into Oakbay’s account.  Just paid it 
directly into Estina’s Standard Bank account with the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 34 of 130 
 
reference Vasram.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go to step 4? 
MR HOLDEN:   So step 4 with the R 4 million is then paid 
out in assorted costs.  So we have R 157 320,00 that is paid 
out on the 8 t h of May 2013.  That goes to Linkway Trading.   
 
We 
have 
two 
transfers 
that 
are 
made 
on 
the 
24t h of April 2013 and the 6t h of May 2013.  And those 
ultimately get paid out to Vargafield here for a total of 
3.25 million.   
 
And then there is an approximate amount because there 
10 
is a slight difficulty in disaggregating the exact funds at this 
point from the Estina bank account.   
 
But 
according 
to 
my 
calculations, 
approximately 
R 358 739,00 of that R 4 million loan is paid on assorted 
dairy costs.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you can do step 5 on page 
703? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  Chair, step 5 effectively closes 
this loan back system.  On the 124t h of October 2013, 
Estina’s Bank of Baroda fixed deposit account is closed and 
20 
the proceeds are paid into Estina’s Bank of Baroda current 
account 02/255.   
 
And it is used to pay back the loan over here to the left 
going up to Kamal Vasram’s account which then closes 
Kamal Vasram’s R 4 million loan account.   
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 35 of 130 
 
 
The total amount that is paid through settled it is 
R 4 035 131,32.  It is paid on the 14t h of October 2013 which 
is the R 4 million original amount plus R 35 000,00 in 
interest that had been accrued in that period.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is the end of part 2.  If 
we go over the page to 704, we see a diagram of part 3 of 
this first tranche.  And again maybe before we get into any 
detail there, if we can go back to the big picture of the whole 
of Tranche 1 on page 692.  Can you show the Chair on 692 
what we are going to be looking at now? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So part 3 funds are indicated on 
the big diagram in blue lines.  And effectively what we have 
here is another loan back scheme being used.   
 
This time, however, it is not Oakbay that is paying out a 
loan.  It is Error(?) Heaven(?).  And Error Heaven, as we 
discussed yesterday, is another Gupta enterprise company in 
which Ronica Ragavan is the primary director.   
 
It goes through quite an extensive loan back loop.  
Again, funded by and settled with various amounts of loan 
accounts 
and 
ultimately 
disgorges 
in 
payments 
of 
20 
R 2 million.   
 
Just over 2 million.  R 2 052 112,00 on assorted dairy 
costs.  R 5 ...[indistinct] [speaker not clear] million paid over 
to Vargafield over a period of time of – between the 
30t h of August 
2013 
and 
the 
10t h 
of 
September 
2013.  
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 36 of 130 
 
R 2.2 million paid also to Vargafield and a final amount of 
R 8875 000,00 also paid to Vargafield.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Does Gateway not pick up a little 
amount as well? 
MR HOLDEN:   Oh, correct.  Correct Chair.  And then there 
is an amount of approximately R 3.52 million that derives 
from Tranche 1, part 3 which we will turn to now that goes to 
Gateway Limited as part of the broader – a bigger 4.57.  So 
seven million transfer.  That transfer is funded with funds 
from this tranche and also Tranches 2 and 3.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay when you say 4.75 million.  
You are talking Dollars not Rands.   
MR HOLDEN:   No, that is Rands.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, let us get to it.  The total 
amount that will go to Gateway is Dollars.  Well, let us get to 
it. 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go back to page 204 
where you start – where there is a diagram of Tranche 3.  
And maybe to start with step 1 on page 705. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   So as we discussed previously, this step 
starts 
with 
the 
R 34.95 million 
payment 
into 
Estina’s 
Standard Bank account by the Free State Government which 
is then placed into the Estina’s Bank of Baroda account and 
then that creates the R 25 million Estina fixed deposit 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318

account which we described in the previous part.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And over the page on page 706 for 
steps 2 and 3. 
MR HOLDEN:   This is where it gets slightly more 
complicated.  Step 2, Kamal Vasram takes out two loans.  
One worth R 2 million and one worth R 1 million.  And it is 
guaranteed.  The procedure to the left over here.  Let me 
just zoom in to make that clearer.   
 
You can see here that those two loans to Kamal Vasram 
are guaranteed against a Estina fixed deposit account with 
10 
account number 03/249.   
 
That fixed deposit account is funded with Tranche 2 
money.  However, these two loans are ultimately settled 
against Tranche 1 money which I will then go and describe 
as we go further.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And step 3. 
MR HOLDEN:   Step 3 Chair involves the payment of those 
two loans from Kamal Vasram.  It gets paid into the Estina’s 
Standard Bank account.   
 
And I just need to double check the dates of those.  The 
20 
first one million rand is transferred on the 11t h of June 2013.  
And as far as I can see, that is the first date of the second 
one as well.   
 
It gets paid into Estina’s Standard Bank account as step 
3.  And then pay onwards to various recipients.  625 000 is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 38 of 130 
 
transferred to Vargafield on the 17t h of May 2013 and 
250 000 is transferred on the...   
 
My apologies Chair.  On the 7t h of June 2013.  There is 
also two amounts which are transferred.  Two amounts which 
eventually get comingled and transferred over to pay 
assorted dairy costs.  The first amount is a million rand – 
R 1 052 112,00 which is paid out on the – between the 
17 t h of May 2013 and the 10 t h of June 2013.   
 
And then a further amount of R 1.339 million which is 
paid 
out 
on 
the 
12t h 
of 
June 
2013 
– 
between 
10 
12t h of June 2013 and the 4t h of July 2013 of which a million 
rand is derived from the loan. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then over the page on 707, you 
have steps 4 and 5. 
MR HOLDEN:   Here at step 4, Error Heaven grants a loan to 
Kamal Vasram of R 8.9 million and those amounts are, like 
with the Oakbay loan, immediately transferred into Kamal 
Vasram’s Standard Bank account and from there immediately 
transferred into Estina’s Standard Bank account where it is 
used for a range of different expenditures which you can see 
20 
here in step 5, the loan amounts are paid out.   
 
And my calculation suggest that from this R 8.9 million 
loan, Vargafield has paid R 5 950 000,00.  Gateway gets 
approximately R 557 000,00. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that 557 will form part 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 39 of 130 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR HOLDEN:   A much larger payment. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   A much larger payment.  You have 
got 19.87 million on your diagram. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Once again, just the inter-position 
of Vasram between Error Head(sic) and Estina, is serving 
what purpose? 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, I suspect that the primary purpose...  
Well, I suspect two primary purposes.  The one is to make 
10 
the tracing of the funds slightly more difficult.   
 
And the second is that it creates a break between Error 
Heaven and Estina which could be used to justify... 
 
If an investigator was to look at Estina’s Standard Bank 
statements or for example the Free State Government, 
Kamal Vasram will be able to say:  Look, I have put in this 
amount of money into Estina.   
 
When in actual fact it derives from Oakbay.  Sorry, from 
Error Heaven in this case.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed.  And so then can we go 
20 
over the page to 708 and steps 6,7, 8 and 9 starting with 
step 6? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So at the very top of the diagram, 
we see at step 6, Kamal Vasram takes out a R 19.5 million 
loan against the Estina fixed deposit account 03/297 which 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 40 of 130 
 
had been funded by the original R 25 million payment.   
 
That loan is then paid out on the 19t h...  Sorry, on the 
20t h of September 2013. 
 
The 
419.5 
million 
is 
then 
transferred as step 7 into Kamal Vasram’s Bank of Baroda 
bank account.   
 
So if I might highlight here?  We see an amount of 
Estina fixed deposit account guaranteeing an amount for 
Kamal Vasram.   
 
Therefore, creating a difficulty – it will be difficult for an 
investigator to know that the loan amount is based on the 
10 
fixed deposit account without the banking instructions.   
 
And to turn to step 7.  The R19 5 million loan is then 
immediately paid out to resettle – to settle the 2 million rand 
loan and the...   
 
Apologies Chair.  And the one million rand loan that I 
described slightly earlier.  Then on the - settles those two 
loan accounts which are effectively settled with tranche 1 
funds.   
8.9 million of that original R90.5 million loan is then 
transferred on the 20 September 2013 to Aerohaven and 
20 
that effectively closes the Aerohaven loan and again what 
this entire structure has done, an investigator was to try 
and establish whether these - Kamal Vasram was the 
source of those loans of the payments into Estina.  He will 
be able to present bank statements saying, as you can 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 41 of 130 
 
see, I too got a loan from Aerohaven but I also repaid that 
loan from Aerohaven therefore these are my funds, being 
paid into Estina. 
 
And then, as a final step, 5.8 million, that is the 
remainder of the R19.5 million loan, is transferred down 
into the right on the 20 September 2013 into Estina 
Standard Bank account and that is then comingled with a 
much larger set of amounts stemming from other tranches, 
from tranche 2 funds in particular and is ultimately paid 
over to Gateway Limited.  So we can see from this 
10 
particular step of tranche one, 5.8 million is paid over to 
Gateway Limited.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then can we close out part 3 on 
page 709? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So step 10, which is the 
penultimate step, involves - the Estina fixed deposit 
account is closed and the proceeds are paid on the 14 
October 2013 in Baroda account with the account number 
92022213201001 and I indicated it as unknown Baroda 
account because we are still not entirely clear based on 
20 
the Commission’s records the exact nature of the account.  
It does it turn up a suspense account but on the Bank of 
Baroda’s own account statements, or the fixed deposit 
account, it refers to an entry called Zolofo(?) (Pty) Ltd.   
I cannot – I am afraid I cannot entirely explain why 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 42 of 130 
 
this takes place.  I suspect that perhaps there was a 
clerical error and the amount was paid into the wrong 
account and then eventually returned back into Estina fixed 
deposit account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Either way the 25 million goes 
out and comes back a short while later. 
MR HOLDEN:   Pretty much on the same day and then – so 
which is my reasoning behind the clerical error that it 
happens on exactly the same day and then the R25 million 
is then eventually – pays back out of the fixed deposit 
10 
account into Estina’s Bank of Baroda account and then 
mercifully, as the final step, the R19.5 million Kamal 
Vasram loan is then settled with the closure of the fixed 
deposit account and that is settled with a payment of 
R19 593 066.61, that is paid on the 14 October 2013 which 
would be the 19.5 million plus roughly R93 000 in interest 
accrued. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then at page 710 we have 
part four which is mercifully simple.  Maybe once again just 
for orientation purposes if we can go back to 692 just to 
20 
see where we are in the big picture. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, so as I indicated previously part 
four is – the part four arrows are in a sort of orangey red 
colour and it involves the disposition of a remaining R2 
million from Free State government which does not actually 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 43 of 130 
 
take a very long trip around, but is eventually disgorged 
into Vargafield.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that we see on page 710. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is the end of tranche 1.  
Tranches 2 to 7 are a lot simpler, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We will move them quite quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that one took quite some time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can you take us to 
10 
tranche 2 on page 711?   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly I am just bringing it up here.  It 
has appeared to be disagreeing up with my computer, we 
have it up now. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And maybe again take us to the 
starting point and the end points and anything of note in 
between? 
MR HOLDEN:   Absolutely, so again we started this funds 
flow with the green departure point box from the Free State 
government and that is a payment of R30 million on the 26 
20 
April 2013 and that is tranche 2 funds and it ultimately is 
then paid out via – it is smurfed and then put into a fixed 
deposit account for a short period of time and then 
ultimately paid out to Gateway Limited where it is then 
further disbursed and we see the ultimate recipients of 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 44 of 130 
 
these funds we see in the red boxes to the left here, we 
have three recipients.  There is a 109 932.40 dollars that is 
paid to an entry that is unfortunately not described in the 
Dubai ledgers.  But then we have an amount of 135 000 
dirham which is paid out on the 13 October 2013 to an 
entity by the name of Third Eye Enterprises.  Again I am 
not entirely sure what role they played within the Gupta 
enterprise, if any, and an amount of 265 270 dollars and 39 
is paid to an enterprise by the name of Idea for Life 
General Trading.  Again, I have not entirely been able to 
10 
verify the exact role that was placed on the Gupta 
enterprise, I prefer not to put things into evidence that I 
cannot – that would be pure speculation and then the final 
amount is …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Not yet that final amount, there 
is …[intervenes] 
MR HOLDEN:   Oh, apologies.  Further down the page, I 
have scrolled in too quickly.   At the bottom of the page 
there is 73 222 dirham that is paid to an enterprise by the 
name of Relevan Global and Relevan Global at the time 
20 
was providing travel services to the Gupta enterprise, 
booking flight tickets in particular. 
 
And then the final amount is paid from Gateway 
Limited into Fidelity Enterprises’ account and it is an 
amount of 3.1 million dollars that is paid out on the 23 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 45 of 130 
 
September 
2013 
and 
that 
is 
paid 
out 
to 
Oakbay 
Investments and as we discussed at the previous tranche 
that 3.1 million is constituted of 3 million dollars from 
tranche 2 and 100 000 dollars from tranche 1. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And is there anything of note 
that you want to highlight about how the money gets from 
the Free State government to these end points or…? 
MR HOLDEN:   I think it relatively straightforward, this 
tranche, and I think the two sort of money laundering 
techniques to note here, the first is as we discussed 
10 
yesterday, the smurfing exercise where the R30 million is 
then divided into six equal parts of R5 million. 
 
The second laundering exercise is to – it is actually 
related to the previous tranche, I think it might be 
worthwhile just highlighting how tranche 2 and tranche 1 
do actually fit together.  
 
So, as I described previously in tranche 1 there 
were two loans of a million rand and 2 million that were 
taken out and it is against this deposit here, so you can 
see this fixed deposit here that those loans were issued. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Holden.  Then let 
us move forward to tranche 3 which is even simpler.  Sorry, 
yes, tranche 3, page 712. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you take us through the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 46 of 130 
 
start and end points and anything in between that is of 
importance? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So what we have here, is the 
start point again is the yellow box and …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, the green box. 
MR HOLDEN:   Sorry, the green box, apologies.  The green 
box, it is from Free State government and that is a R19.05 
million transfer from the Free State government on the 3 
May 2013 and that forms tranche 3.   
The hallmark of this particular tranche is that it 
10 
takes a very brief sojourn, it gets paid almost immediately 
from Estina Standard Bank account into a Stanlib unit trust 
account, 
an 
investment 
account, 
where 
it 
sits 
for 
approximately three months, just under three months and 
then the full amount plus the proceeds of that investment 
are 
then 
returned 
back 
into 
Estina’s 
Standard 
Bank 
account on the 5 August 2013.  So what we can see here is 
that by having access to the Free State government funds, 
the Gupta enterprise has by investing it in the Stanlib 
Bedford Gardens account earned R222 000 for doing very 
20 
little. 
 
On the 5 August I should also mention that – so on 
the 5 August the full amount is transferred back into Estina 
Standard Bank account, there it comingles with an amount 
of R1 million from an Aerohaven loan that was originally 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 47 of 130 
 
sourced from tranche 1.  Once that is comingled in with 
Standard Bank account a 100 000 goes to …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, just to clarify, that that 
Aerohaven loan is a loan to Kamal Vasram. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Which then goes into Estina. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct.  Thank you, thank you, 
sorry, apologies, Chair.  On the 7 August – sorry, on the 2 
August of that R1 million loan back a R100 000 is 
transferred to Kamal Vasram’s personal account.  By 
10 
joining with the 19.2 million the remainder of the 1 million 
provides sufficient funds to then transfer R19.78 million on 
the 7 August and that gets paid to Gateway Limited.  That 
is the Standard Chartered US-based Dubai bank account.  
It takes a very brief and unnecessary detour.  1.6 million of 
that is transferred on the 11 August 2013 into Global 
Corporation’s Standard Chartered account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Holden, would I be 
correct that the R19.2 million translates into 2 million 
dollars? 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And it lands in the Gateway 
Standard Chartered account. 
MR HOLDEN:   Of that 1.6 million dollars, it is almost 
immediately returned in two payments of 890 000 dollars 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 48 of 130 
 
and 700 000 dollars both on the 12 August so effectively 
have just moved it around in circles in one day. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But it goes to a different Gupta 
vehicle. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct and it goes to an Accurate 
Investments Standard Chartered US dollar account where it 
joins a further 400 000 that had been paid by Gateway 
Limited on the 12 t h.  All those comingled back together, 
which is effectively the amount that had been transferred 
earlier, 1.986 million dollars is then transferred out on the 
10 
12 August 2013 to Linkway Trading and again this amount 
and 
the 
previous 
Linkway 
Trading 
amount 
were 
the 
amounts that were invoice against the wedding costs. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I stop here and maybe 
highlight a different laundry device that – that you have not 
mentioned.  This is – if you talk about cash firebreak, this 
is almost an offshore firebreak because what we see here, 
I would like you to comment on this, what we see here 
ultimately is 19.05 million coming into Estina from the Free 
State government and goes around in circles and then 
20 
comes out in essentially the same amount to Linkway 
Trading.  So a South African company receives public 
funds which are eventually going to be transferred to 
another South African company but in the meantime the 
money has gone offshore, has moved between different 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 49 of 130 
 
vehicles offshore, so there is no way within South Africa 
absent the Gupta Leaks that we would ever be able to link 
the 19 million that was received by Estina to the 19 million 
that was paid to Linkway from Accurate because Estina’s 
19 million went to Gateway, Linkway’s 19 million came from 
Accurate and we do not have sight of offshore records. 
MR HOLDEN:   Absolutely, I think that is an excellent 
point.  Clearly this is all designed to create a – as soon as 
funds move from South Africa offshore and certainly as 
soon as they move into a jurisdiction like UAE or Dubai 
10 
where 
the 
likelihood 
of 
compliance 
with 
mutually 
assistance request may not be as likely as what the United 
States or the UK, it becomes increasingly difficult to 
access those sort of bank statements and it creates 
effectively a blind spot that we have luckily been able to fill 
with the Gupta Leaks. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then – well, Chair, I see we 
have reached the tea break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but if you are about to finish a 
particular part we can finish and then take the break or 
20 
…[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do need five minutes with Mr 
Holden just to flag something in relation to the fifth tranche 
which is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us do that.  Ja, let us do that.  Ja. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 50 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, no, no, no, I need to speak 
to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you to speak to him, okay.  So you 
need the break. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do need a break, Chair, sorry, 
but we will move very quickly through 4, 5, 6 and 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You will use the tea break or you 
would like …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, I will use the tea break, I 
will not… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, we will take the tea break now.  
It is about nineteen minutes past, we will resume at twenty 
five to twelve. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden can we go quickly 
through …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I did not say in the morning 
but let me say now, yesterday’s oath or affirmation 
continues to apply. 
MR HOLDEN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 51 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can you take us 
quickly through tranche 4, again the starting point and the 
end points and anything between of consequence? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair, the starting point here 
again is in the green box, I think you might need the page 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   713, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   713, okay.  Yes. 
MR HOLDEN:   So, Chair, it is initiated with the R29.95 
10 
million transfer, but the tranche 4 transfer from the Free 
State government, which is paid into Estina’s Standard 
Bank account and without going through every single 
transfer, as you can see it is quite complicated, it 
effectively operates the same way as the previous tranches 
which involved the loan back in which you can see the 
amount that is paid in by the Free State government is paid 
into Estina’s Bank of Baroda’s current account and again 
used to open up a fixed deposit account and another loan 
amount. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I think what you are indicating to 
the Chair and to anyone who is watching, I think you 
indicated the loan and the fixed deposit incorrectly.  So 
you indicated the loan as the fixed deposit and the fixed 
deposit as – oh, oh, no, no, you …[intervenes] 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 52 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:   I have but I [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You have used the wrong 
shapes. 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, this is my lack of visual acumen.  This 
is supposed to be this shape, a rounder shape rather than 
a circle and that is supposed to be circle up here but what 
you have effectively is R25 million put into a fixed deposit 
account which then secures a loan for Kamal Vasram and 
the purpose of that loan is that again we have another 
10 
Aerohaven loan back system which starts up here and in 
total it is R13.7 million that is transferred over from 
Aerohaven to Kamal Vasram’s account and then into 
Estina’s Standard Bank account which then immediately 
paid over to Vargafield and I will come to totals very 
briefly.  And that Aerohaven loan is settled by the Kamal 
Vasram loan up here which is secured against the fixed 
deposit account and you can see on the 30 December 2013 
that payment is – that loan is paid into Estina’s Standard 
Bank account and on the same day it is transferred from 
20 
Estina’s Standard Bank account into Kamal Vasram’s 
personal account, that is a Standard Bank account and 
then on the same day it is transferred to Aerohaven. 
 
And once that loan back is completed the fixed 
deposit account is closed and the amount that remains 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 53 of 130 
 
after the settlement of the loan is transferred back into 
Estina’s Standard Bank account and in total we see three 
different recipients of this particular tranche. 
 
The first if Vargafield which received the largest 
amount, it gets paid R18.237 million out of this tranche.  
R5.825 million is paid to a company by the name of UTI 
which the Gupta Leaks show is a logistics and freight 
company and this was the cost of importing the dairy 
equipment from India.   
And then we have on the furthest left hand side 
10 
appropriate R4 million spent between December 2013 and 
March 2014 on a range of different dairy-related expenses 
including payments to SARS, South African Revenue 
Service, Eskom and on salaries as well. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So this would be the only 
tranche that stays onshore.   
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then go to tranche 5 on 
page 714 and starting with the – again – well, let us start 
with the end points and go back to the start points because 
20 
there are some questions I would like to ask you in relation 
to the start points. 
MR HOLDEN:   So we just start with the end points. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if we start with the end point. 
MR HOLDEN:   Okay.  Well, the end points after this 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 54 of 130 
 
particular tranche, Aerohaven earns R3.2 million by being 
participant to a loan back scheme.  Vargafield is paid an 
amount of R19 million of which R14.3 million is from 
tranche 5 and then the remainder of that tranche is then 
paid 
out 
to 
Estina’s 
FNB 
account 
which 
had 
then 
subsequently use of their main banking account and we 
can see two payments into Estina’s FNB account.  The first 
is on the 21 November 2014 of R3 890 752.40 and a 
payment of R15.79 million on the 5 August 2015 bringing 
the total amount that is transferred from Estina’s Standard 
10 
Bank and Bank of Baroda’s accounts into Estina into FNB 
account of R15.79 million. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we then get to the start 
points?  So the first one is Free State government – well, 
can you take us through the start points? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  Chair, so the first start point -= 
well, actually the first I have indicated on the diagram is 
actually not first chronologically is the R30 million that 
gets paid in by the Free State government on the 25 July 
2014.   
20 
 
Slightly preceding is a payment in of R6 720 657.79 
and that is paid in on the 30 July. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And where does that come from? 
MR HOLDEN:   We have now – I understand from the 
Commission when I first had a look at these amounts the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 55 of 130 
 
only information that I had was this particular reference 
and I had no idea what that might refer to.  My evidence 
leader and other staff at the Commission have now alerted 
me to the fact that this is a reference that is used for all 
SARS payments for VAT rebates.  So this is a SARS-
related VAT rebate that is being paid into Estina, as is the 
amount that is below that is below that of 2.382 894.45. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And, Chair, there will be further 
evidence, not from Mr Holden, but we are told, Mr Holden, 
what that evidence is going to inform the Commission.  Do 
10 
you want to share – well, let me put on record what the 
Commission will adduce later.   
A far greater amount than the VAT that was paid 
back in respect of these two payments was VAT that was 
fraudulently - well, was VAT that was fraudulently claimed 
in respect of payments to Vargafield who invoiced with a 
VAT number that does not exist and so, in truth, instead of 
being due, these payments of just over 9 million in 
aggregate from SARS, Estina’s true position was that they 
had claimed VAT – they had claimed VAT in respect of 
20 
Vargafield inputs that was – let me just get the exact 
figure, 64 million of the VAT input costs that Estina claimed 
from SARS were claimed in respect of Vargafield VAT 
invoices that were fraudulent.   
 
So this 9 million can actually be added to the public 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 56 of 130 
 
funds that the Gupta’s derived from the Estina enterprises.   
 
And then if we can move then to tranche 6 on page 
715. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you take us through the 
start points?   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  Again on the far left, as 
indicated with the green boxes there is an amount that 
comes into Estina’s FNB account of R15.79 million that 
ultimately derived from the previous tranche and that is 
10 
paid on the 5 August 2015 and on the same day an amount 
of 
R60 
million 
is 
transferred 
from 
the 
Free 
State 
government on the 8 May 2015 for R60 million into Estina’s 
bank account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   At this stage there is not – the money 
does not travel too long before it reaches the final 
destination. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, Chair, it moves very 
rapidly now and maybe, Mr Holden, can you comment on 
20 
that?  We saw very elaborate moves in the earlier 
tranches, can you offer some reasons as to why the money 
moves more directly and more quickly now? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  By this point Estina’s formal role 
within the Vrede dairy project had been terminated by the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 57 of 130 
 
Free State government and they had already received an 
undertaking from the Free State government that they 
would be paid the remainder of their investment amount.  
However, Estina had been relieved of the obligation to 
prove that they had invested their own funds, so at this 
point there was no need to generate a false set of inflows 
of funds to make it seem like more money was being 
invested by Estina.  Effectively, have the abandonment of 
the round-tripping programme because there was no need 
to fraudulently increase the number of deposits coming into 
10 
their account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it also not a sense of security, 
maybe peace of mind that nothing would ever happen, that 
these things would not be uncovered or would not be 
pursued by law enforcement agencies? 
MR HOLDEN:   I think that is a pretty good assumption.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR HOLDEN:   I think we see at this point that by May 
2015 at least already quite a substantial amount in known 
about the Gupta enterprise’s involvement in the dairy 
20 
project yet there seems to be absolutely no movement 
towards an investigation and when investigations are 
undertaken by ENS forensics and later by the Public 
Protector in a temporary report – a preliminary report, 
sorry, those recommendations are effectively ignored.  So I 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 58 of 130 
 
think at this point the participants in the scheme would be I 
think very justified in feeling safe at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you briefly describe the 
end points here? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, so after a very brief sojourn in an 
FNB investment account and then into an FNB money 
market 
account 
the 
funds 
are 
eventually 
paid 
out.  
Vargafield is paid, here at the bottom right hand corner, it 
is paid R3 416 479.10.  Gateway is paid R45 091 652.50 
10 
and the reason, Chair, that this – we have not extrapolated 
further from this point is that the Gupta Leaks records that 
we do have only extend to the end of 2014.   
So at this point we actually now have the corporate 
firebreak that my evidence leader was referring to because 
we have funds going offshore, but we have no idea how 
they were dissipated at this point. 
 
And then we have three payments to SARS, South 
African Revenue Service, we have R28 387 635.73 that is 
paid against – I am informed by the Commission that this is 
20 
Estina’s VAT number and that we have two amounts that 
are paid in relation to SARS e-Filing, one for R19 711.23 
and one for R183 002.78.  As yet I understand the 
Commission is still undertaking to establish who was 
referred to or what particular individual may have been 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 59 of 130 
 
referred to with those reference numbers. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then finally, over the page, 
the last tranche, page 716.  Very briefly take us through 
this tranche, it is a very simple tranche. 
MR HOLDEN:   Fortunately, this is a very easy tranche to 
describe.  The input is again the green box, the Free State 
government, pays in R46 252 652 on the 5 May 2016 into 
Estina’s FNB current account.  The vast majority of that is 
almost immediately dissipated over the course of – it is 
roughly 13 days.   
10 
 
There are four payments into Gateway Limited and 
Gateway Limited is paid a total of R40 737 452 and then 
after a brief sojourn in a call account, Estina FNB call 
account which is then returned – part of which is returned 
to Estina FNB account.   
We have to payments that are made to South 
African 
Revenue 
Service 
again 
against 
Estina’s 
VAT 
number and the total amount paid here is R5 384 412.26. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, that completes our 
evidence on the Estina money flows.  Mr Holden is now 
20 
going to move to discuss some of the Transnet kickback 
money flows. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And for the most part those are 
addressed in bundle 6, Chair. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 60 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so this bundle can be put away? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Not forever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Because we will come back to 
the ledgers in this bundle when we are describing some of 
the Transnet kickbacks to follow their movement offshore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay, I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And this bundle, Chair, is 
covered by a separate statement so I must ask Mr Holden 
to confirm the correctness of that statement.  Maybe before 
10 
I do so, Chair, I must apologise, there are a series of 
problems with the annexures to the statement in part 
because this evidence was brought forward and we did not 
– the preparation of the annexures was a bit rushed.  We 
will periodically come to annexures which are duplicates of 
other annexures instead of the real document.  Can I – we 
will sort all of this out on the weekend but rather than take 
you now to the full set of problematic annexures when I 
cannot cure it, can we do that if we bump into one of 
those? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, as and when. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And I must apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 61 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can I ask you 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will now use the flow funds 
bundle 6, hey? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Indeed, Chair, and unless I refer 
to bundle 5, assume that the references are bundle 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can I ask you to go 
to page 160 and to identify the statement that runs from 
160 to 162 as your statement? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair, this is my statement. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And subject to the problems with 
the annexures in relation to the report that is attached to 
that statement will you confirm the correctness of the 
statement and the report to which it refers? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that report, Chair, is PEH1 
which commences on page 163.  Sorry, Mr Holden, will you 
confirm that?  It is not for me to confirm. 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, this is the report that I compiled and it 
20 
starts at page 163. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And, Mr Holden, this is a report 
into money flows relating to the Gupta enterprise and what 
you describe as the capture of Transnet.  Can you briefly 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 62 of 130 
 
give the Chair an …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Chaskalson, do you want 
me to formally admit the statement or not really? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, Chair, it is already referred 
to as PEH1 in the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh, sorry, sorry, the statement?  
Yes, please, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Statement, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can the statement be formally 
10 
admitted? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And I must confess I am not sure 
where we are in the BB series.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you junior or somebody can 
check and then let you know?  Later on we can do it as we 
go along. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can you briefly 
20 
describe to the Chair which contracts and which money 
flows you will be considering in this statement?  Sorry, in 
this report. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So, Chair, the focus of this 
report has been trying to use, amongst other things, the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 63 of 130 
 
Gupta Leaks and other available banking documentation 
and certain documentation that was made available to me 
by the Commission to try and identify and trace all the 
funds that were paid to entities that had entered into 
kickback contracts with China South Rail, with China North 
Rail and its subsequent merger company, CRRC.  
 
We also engaged with a kickback contract in 
relation 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
cranes 
by 
a 
Chinese 
Manufacturer ZPMC. 
 
And then finally, we also examine the flow of funds 
10 
in relation to payments made to the Gupta enterprise by 
Liebherr and Liebherr was – Liebherr Africa was contracted 
by Transnet to provide cranes. 
ADV CHASKALSON 
SC:   And although the report 
precedes in a different sequence, I think it may be 
convenient to start with Liebherr because that is a self-
contained 
topic 
whereas 
the 
ZPMC 
Cranes 
and 
the 
locomotives have a lot of common ground and context that 
needs to be described for them both.   
So can I ask you to go to the section of your report 
20 
which deals with Liebherr and that, Chair, is to be found at 
page 203, 203 of bundle 6.  And most of the cast of 
characters who we will encountering here we have met 
before but there is one person who we have not met before 
who Piyoosh Goyal but can you explain to the Chair who 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 64 of 130 
 
Piyoosh Goyal was?   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly you will definitely be hearing 
about him a lot more in further evidence.  Mr Goyal was the 
Chairman of the Worlds Window group of companies that 
was based in India and as I mentioned in previous 
testimony, the Worlds Window Group and the Gupta 
enterprise start doing business together in at least 2010 or 
2011 in which period they engage in a whole series of 
money laundering activities and Piyoosh Goyal is in quite 
frequent 
contact 
with 
the 
Gupta 
enterprise 
and 
is 
10 
effectively the most senior person the Worlds Window 
Group heading up this particular relationship. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Then if we move now to the 
Liebherr contract and the Liebherr kickbacks, can we go to 
page 203 and can you briefly describe to the Chair what 
the Liebherr contract was about and how the Guptas 
become involved? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  On the 4 December 2011 
Transnet publicly advertised three separate requests for 
proposals, RFPs, related to the expansion of the Ngqura 
20 
Container Terminal.   
The first request for proposal required – called for 
the supply of 18 single lift rubber tyre gantry cranes with 
an option to purchase a further ten. 
 
The second RFP called for proposals to supply four 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 65 of 130 
 
twin lift ship to shore cranes with an option for a further 
three single lift cranes. 
 
The third RFP asked for bidders just to make bids 
for both of those proposals combined. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Going forward, when did 
Liebherr announce that it has been successful? 
MR HOLDEN:   On the 17 February 2014 Liebherr Cranes 
announced that it had received the contract to supply the 
22 cranes to Transnet Port Terminals including the 18 
single lift rubber gantry cranes and the four twin lift ship to 
10 
shore cranes.  Based on the supply we now concede that 
they won the bid on the basis of the third request for 
proposal which was to provide all of the necessary cranes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then there will also be an 
option to extend the 18 and the 22 from what you have said 
in paragraph 73. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In paragraph 76 you make the 
point that you cannot identify obvious irregularities in the 
award of the contract but what evidence have you seen 
20 
that suggests the involvement of the Guptas? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  On the – what the Gupta Leaks 
reveal is that on the 21 December 2011 Ashu Chawla sent 
an email to Piyoosh Goyal at his Worlds Window address 
with is Piyoosh@WorldsWindow.cc and attached to that 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 66 of 130 
 
email was a document that emanated from Transnet in 
relation to this particular procurement. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can I then ask you to go to  
page 431?  Is that the email to which you are referring? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you situate that again 
for the Chair in the chronology of the tender? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, that would be roughly nine 
months subsequent to the first advertisement of the 
request for proposal.  Is that correct? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, I am afraid it is not. 
MR HOLDEN:   I am confusing February 2014 and February 
2011. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if you go back to your 
paragraph 73 you will see when the RFP was advertised, 
203. 
MR HOLDEN:   Apologies for that confusion.  It is 
advertised on the 4 December 2011.  So we have the email 
being sent 17 days after the advertisement of the tender. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I then take you to page 432 
20 
and is this the attachment that went with the email? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go down the 
document is there anything in particular that would be 
significant about – that you can point to that would be 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 67 of 130 
 
significant about this document given that it was being 
leaked to the Guptas while the tender was pending?  
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  What we have here is a 
memorandum that is sent from Mr Denzyl Pillay who was 
the executive manager of capital procurement at Transnet 
to a Mr Karl Socikwa.  I am afraid I am not entirely certain 
of the pronunciation of his name who was the Chief 
Executive of Transnet Port Terminals.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Socikwa. 
MR HOLDEN:   Socikwa. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Socikwa.  Yes, you got it right, Socikwa, 
ja. 
MR HOLDEN:   And what this does is provide the 
memorandum …[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, if I might intervene here, 
Chair, the Commission is investigating how this leaked but 
in fairness to Mr Pillay and Mr Socikwa, we have our 
suspicions but our suspicions do not relate to either of 
them and I just wanted to put that on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do not want them to be 
associated with the leak. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR HOLDEN:   And what the memorandum does, Chair, is 
provide 
a 
background 
and 
a 
status 
update 
on 
this 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 68 of 130 
 
particular request for proposal and it provides in the 
background a description of the way in which the tender 
was initiated and for what reason and then the page 
thereafter on 433 we can see there is a summary of 
milestones in that table which provides a very clear 
guideline to what Transnet Port Terminals will be doing at 
different stages of the tender process which I would submit 
would be a very useful – it is a very useful knowledge for a 
potential bidder and there is also very importantly at 
paragraph 8 there is the heading Budget Implications which 
10 
provides the total budget for the tender and the approved 
budget for the tender was R1.090 billion.   
 
If I may add, Chair, that just in further corroboration 
of the Gupta leaks and the timing of the email we can we 
see that in the summary of milestones document the 4 
December entry as advertised in the media says complete.  
So clearly it has been drawn subsequent to that date. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You’ve mentioned earlier that 
Liebherr was successful and what you describe in your 
report is a series of payments that Liebherr made to Gupta 
20 
– a Gupta company in Dubai, Accurate Investments.  I 
understand 
that’s 
not 
contro 
– 
that 
VAT 
is 
not 
controversial, Liebherr had publically admitted that.  Can 
you describe the sources that you have to identify what the 
amount of the payments that were made? 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 69 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly so the first source is a source 
that we referred to in our – in my testimony yesterday 
which was the UAE ledgers which in that instance ran up 
until the early part of 2014 and there are – there’s one 
notable payment that comes in from Liebherr in those 
letters.  I should have mentioned, I am sure we will come 
to the individual files, the numbers that ledger entry is then 
corroborated by another document that was found within 
the Gupta leaks which is a statement, a bank statement or 
at least a transaction record for Accurate Investments and 
10 
it was being distributed amongst Gupta Enterprise staff.  
The second document is a continuation of the Dubai 
ledgers, I am not sure if you recall but yesterday we 
discussed how in February 2014 Ashitola wrote to Sanjay 
Grover and provided him an Excel spreadsheet and said 
please can you update these ledgers in this particular 
format 
hereon, 
and 
on 
a 
relative 
regular 
basis 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair if I might just interject 
there that was the document that appeared at flow of funds 
20 
volume 5, page 718, and then with 718.1 to 718.5, which 
had almost empty template ledgers for each of the Dubai 
based companies and a cash ledger as well.   
MR  HOLDEN:  The task that they then performed was to 
take everyone of the updates that was sent by Sanjay 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 70 of 130 
 
Grover over that period of time, the final one was sent in 
December 2014, and to take all of those entries and put 
them 
into 
a 
single 
spreadsheet 
so 
we 
have 
a 
full 
accounting of all the transactions for Global Corporation, 
for 
Accurate 
Investments, 
for 
Fidelity 
and 
Global 
Corporation over the period of February 2014 until roughly 
the 26 t h of December 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to go to page 439, 
Annexure O, is that the consolidated ledgers that you have 
generated from all of these regular ledgers that are sent 
10 
from Sanjay Grover to Ashu Chawla. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair, I attached it as 
Annexure O to my statement. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So that is not a document that is 
on Gupta Leaks but what it is, is it consolidates all of the 
information in the ledgers that are sent on a regular basis 
on Gupta Leaks into one consolidated set of ledgers for a 
period, how long does this period run? 
MR HOLDEN:   It runs from roughly mid-February, 17 t h of 
February till the end of ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Which year? 
MR HOLDEN:   17 t h of February 2014 until the end of year, 
roughly 26 t h of December I think is the final payment that I 
can see 2014. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Chair just to note this is one 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 71 of 130 
 
of the annexures where we are going to have to reprint 
them because they were printed with margins that are too 
narrow so some of the figures don’t show in the cells, they 
just show sort of XXX because they are too wide for the 
cells. 
 
You 
talked 
about 
the 
ledgers 
we 
discussed 
yesterday, you have now discussed this Annexure O, what 
other 
sources 
have 
you 
used 
in 
relation 
to 
your 
examination of the Liebherr payments? 
MR HOLDEN:   We also I am sure you must remember 
10 
Chair yesterday I described another Excel spreadsheet that 
I created which was to take the running totals in all the 
bank balances for Global, Accurate, Fidelity and so on and 
put them into a single spreadsheet so we can properly 
verify that the amounts that are being paid into the account 
and being dispersed outwards weren’t co-mingled with 
other funds and it properly describes the flow of funds. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can I just give the reference 
that is Annexure A in Bundle 5 at page 113.  And Mr Holden 
you also refer and here we will have an annexure problem, 
20 
to Annexure N to your report on the Transnet funds.  If you 
– if you go to your statement at page – sorry your report at 
page 204 can you explain to the Chair what Annexure N is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly the annexure which I am afraid is 
not produced as an annexure in here, is a set of bank 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 72 of 130 
 
statements that had been removed from the original bank 
statement format and put into an Excel spreadsheet and 
that had been sent by Jessemine Cook to a Sahara employ 
to Ashu Chawla and have provided a very brief window of 
bank statements related to Global, Accurate, Fidelity and 
Gateway. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go to page 435 you 
will see what is part of Annexure N but unfortunately 
doesn’t include Accurate which is the company that we 
need to refer to today, but you will have the – you will have 
10 
in due course we will get the I think it is just literally one 
page that we need to add here in relation to Accurate 
Investments.  If we need to refer to it today Mr Holden has 
the document ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought there was one reference to 
Accurate on page 435.  Where you talk about page 435 
where you are saying there is no reference to Accurate, 
well I see B/O Accurate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Oh yes, this is a transfer out of 
Gateway into Accurate, I think it is out of Gateway into 
20 
Accurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But the Accurate – so the host 
company for this spreadsheet would I think be Gateway, 
what we are missing is the one for Accurate but we will add 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 73 of 130 
 
it and to the extent that we have to refer to it today we can 
put it up on the screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Holden there is one last 
document in the Gupta Leaks that you refer to at page 206 
of your statement, can you tell the Chair about that one? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair if I may get the exact facts 
right before I put it into the record.   There is an email that 
is sent from – well the Gupta Leaks reveal Chair that an 
email sent from Veronica Radewaan from Oakbay email 
10 
address to Ashu Chawla’s Sahara email address on the 
14 t h of February 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are looking at what  page? 
MR HOLDEN:  206. 
CHAIRPERSON:   206? 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes of the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   Yes continue. 
MR HOLDEN:   At paragraph 84 and 85 attached to the 
email 
was 
an 
Excel 
spreadsheet 
that 
was 
titled 
IS12.02.15.xlsx, xlsx being the file format name for an 
20 
Excel spreadsheet I think 12.02.15 is pretty explanatory, 
that means the 12 t h of May 2015. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   February, 12 t h of February. 
MR HOLDEN:   12 t h of February 2015, apologies, and the 
IS I speculate although I cannot entirely confirm may have 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 74 of 130 
 
referred to Income Sheet or Income Statement.  The Excel 
spreadsheet 
itself 
which 
we 
may 
want 
to 
turn 
to 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In due course, you have actually 
extracted the relevant reference there, unfortunately this is 
another document that went missing from the annexures.   
MR HOLDEN:   What the spreadsheet indicated was that it 
was – at the top left corner of the spreadsheet it indicated 
there was an income statement.  Sadly the document is 
pretty difficult to decipher and I have to admit that I wasn’t 
10 
entirely comfortable relying on the figures therein without 
being able to fully understand exactly how they were 
derived but what was noticeable was that there was a 
single entry in the Excel spreadsheet which appears 
against an internal Gupta Enterprise account number of 
LCC001 and it reads: 
“other income lieber” 
And it then includes three different figures next to it of 
11.888,956 and then 4.125 350.78million and then a third 
figure.  It appears from the – to the left of that there’s also 
20 
an A that is indicated there, if you look at the original 
spreadsheet which was at a different stage perhaps that A 
falls under a heading called company, so I think we can 
relatively safely assume that means accurate in relation to 
this particular income statement. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 75 of 130 
 
 
Sadly I am not entirely sure what denomination the 
figures are listed there refer to and also I am afraid I 
cannot tell from this statement the relationship between 
those three figures.  I think one interpretation might be – 
and I must say this is very much a might be, is that the 
first figure of 11.888million may be a reflection of this is a 
total aggregate figure that had been paid in to Accurate 
Investments by Liebherr or was anticipated to be paid in by 
Liebherr either in Durham or in Dollars. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But we can establish I mean 
10 
that’s some speculation but there is very clear evidence of 
what amounts were paid in definitely before this period. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And have you got an aggregate 
figure? 
MR HOLDEN:  I do, I may need to consult a note very 
quickly if that is okay.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   You can do that. 
MR HOLDEN:   Apologies for taking time to locate that, the 
total aggregate figure that I am able to extract Chair is an 
20 
amount of 3 232 430,88 dollars which was paid to Accurate 
Investments, I did a very simple calculation at today’s spot 
exchange rate and that equals R49 381 200. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what we are now going to do 
is we are going to look at each one of those payments that 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 76 of 130 
 
we can establish and we are also going to see what 
happened to that money.  So can I ask you first of all to 
turn to page – let’s start at page 206 at the bottom of 206 
where you talk about the first payment. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly we see in total I am able to track 
five payment tranches from Liebherr over a period of time. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I just emphasize those five 
do not include this sort of cryptic reference in the 
spreadsheet of 7 February 2015? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So whatever these five payments 
are in addition to whatever that may mean? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct.  And the first tranche that 
we can trace was a amount of 905 088 and I do – that was 
paid on the 22 n d of July 2013 into Accurate Investments US 
dollar account at Standard Chartered Bank.  I can refer to 
the – I have prepared the entry in the Excel spreadsheet 
where I can refer to that, I have also prepared visualisation 
what happens to those particular payments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well maybe let’s start with the 
20 
visualisations which are easy, the diagrams and I think this 
diagram is at page 1101.  So Chair I ask that you go to 
1101.  It is 11 – yes it is 1101. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Holden can you 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 77 of 130 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, 1101 is a 
diagram, oh no where I am is not 1101, it is 1011, let me 
try and find 1101.  Yes I found it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And I think for these diagrams 
we should probably try and source the ledger references to 
each of these cash movements if you are able to do so now 
we may have to make some notes over lunch if there are 
any gaps but can you take the Chair through what you see 
at 1101 or what you have produced at 1101. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  This is a – the 
visionalisation follows very much the same format as the 
visionalisations I used in relation to Estina, again the 
green box is the beginning point, the entry of funds, and 
then at the bottom we have red boxes which indicate the 
out points where those funds eventually emerge, and what 
we have here the first payment is made by Liebherr to 
Accurate’s Standard Chartered bank account, US dollars 
are nominated, account on the 22 n d of July 2013 and that is 
for an amount of 905 000 dollars and 88 cents, I should 
20 
note obviously that the timing of this payment is notable in 
relation to the timeline of the chronology of the award of 
the tender as this was still while the tender hadn’t been 
announced.  The tender is only announced the following 
year in February. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 78 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can I ask you, so that is 
905 000 dollars and 88 cents and you have it in the 
Standard Chartered Bank.  Can I ask you to go flow of 
funds bundle 5, and turn to page 354. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is just trying to find the page for me, 
it was 354? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is 354 Chair and Chair if you 
can hang on to that file open roundabout that page 
because we are going to be flipping backwards and 
forwards a few pages as we go through Liebherr, but can 
10 
you identify this payment by Liebherr into the Standard 
Chartered account of Accurate, or first what are we looking 
at, at page 354. 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly, this is the UAE ledger that was 
compiled by amongst others Sanjay Grover and sent to 
Tony Gupta.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you find the Liebherr 
payment on that letter and maybe put it up on the screen? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, so I have already identified it 
here on screen, it is slightly easier to read than the very 
20 
small text in the annexure, what we see here at row 157 is 
the primary party is Accurate Investments, the date is the 
22 n d of July 2013, and the counter party is Liebherr and if I 
was to scroll further to the right we see the input amount 
as a positive entry into the US Dollar Standard Chartered 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 79 of 130 
 
Bank account of 905 000 and eighty eight. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you for that.  Can I ask 
you, I referred, I mentioned when we were discussing 
Annexure N that we hadn’t added the tab for Accurate 
Investments.  Can I ask that, we will add that probably only 
at the end of the day but can I ask you to call up the tab 
for Accurate Investments on the correct, the full version of 
Annexure N. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair I will do so in short order.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And just to – while you are doing 
10 
that, if you can multitask if you can just remind the Chair 
what Annexure N was or is. 
MR HOLDEN:   Apologies Chair, I did extract it this 
morning and sent it to my evidence leader and for some 
reason I can’t seem to locate it now. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Maybe we will come back to this 
one after the lunch break and ...[intervenes]  
MR HOLDEN:   Yes if we could that would be helpful. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Okay let us go back to the 
diagram of where this money went.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we now moving to the other bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chair we are, Bundle 6 
and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you said I must keep this other one 
close. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 80 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Keep that one close because 
each time we are going to want to authenticate the 
payments we are discussing we are going to have to refer 
to those ledgers, and if we go to 1101 – oh you are at 
1101.  The diagram ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is 1101 of ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Of Bundle 6 Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
am 
always 
thinking 
about 
the 
transcript, ja okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you take the Chair 
10 
through this process that we see at 1101? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair as I put up on the screen 
after 
the 
905 000 
has 
been 
deposited 
into Accurate 
Standard Charter Bank account we have three transfers 
out, the first transfer is made on the same day, it is 
received from Liebherr, that is an amount of 700 000 
dollars and that is paid from Accurate Standard Charter 
Bank account into Global Corporations Standard Charter 
Bank account in US Dollar denomination and it is paid on 
the 22 n d of July 2013.  There is an amount of 130 000 
20 
dollars that is transferred on the 23 r d of July 2013, and that 
is paid out to Global Corporation Standard Charter Bank 
US dollar account and then a final payment of 60 000 
dollars also on the 23 r d of July 2013, made form Accurate’s 
Standard 
Chartered 
Bank 
into 
Global 
Standard 
Bank 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 81 of 130 
 
account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask that we then go back 
to 354 of flow of funds bundle 5 just to identify those three 
transactions.  And maybe Chair – ja sorry, ja I think we are 
going to have to just move backwards and forwards 
between the two bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought I had kept that other page, as 
you have said on Bundle 5 but you can just remind me 
which page we are going to on Bundle 5?  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   354 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So Mr Holden can you take the 
Chair to those three transactions you have just described, 
the 700 000, the 130 000 and the 60 000.   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair so as I brought up the 
screen 
here, 
it 
might 
be 
highlighted 
on 
your 
Excel 
spreadsheet in red.  The first transaction takes place at 
Eurogrow 139, the first party is Accurate, the primary party 
the date is the 22 n d of July 2013 and the reference here is 
GCL/SCD which stands for Global Corporation Limited 
20 
Standard Chartered Bank and if we are to scroll further to 
the right here, we see a negli – R700 000 dollars in 
brackets which means it is paid out.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the 130 and the 60? 
MR HOLDEN:   That occurred, the 130 000 you can find at 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 82 of 130 
 
row 
140 
the 
primary 
partner, 
the 
primary 
company, 
apologies, is accurate.  The date is the 23 r d of July 2013, 
and the counterparty is Global Corporation LLC and it is 
the right year, we the US Dollar under the US Dollar 
Standard Chartered Bank row we have 130 000 Dollars 
paid out which is why it is in brackets and as you can see 
below this is the counterparty record in the double entry 
bookkeeping which will show that same transaction but 
from Global’s perspective. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think we are on different 
10 
documents, 354 is the – 354 is the version of the ledgers 
that’s been organised by company.  
MR HOLDEN:   No that is not correct.  So in my 
...[indistinct] page 354 is ledger 1.2, Annexure number 
page 10. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:    Yes.   
MR HOLDEN:   And the prescription, the transactions I 
have just described ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So if you look at the left of that 
column all of the companies are accurate?  So you are not 
20 
going to see the double entry. 
MR HOLDEN:   You are quite right. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Let’s do it on this document 
because where I have got my references we can go to the 
double entry reference after lunch.  So you have dealt with 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 83 of 130 
 
130 000 and the 60 000. 
MR HOLDEN:   So there was a 60 000, we can see here on 
my spreadsheet as row 142, the date is the 23 r d of July 
2013, the counterparty is again Global Corporation LLC 
and if we scroll over to the right we see 60 000 in 
brackets, which is a negative ...[indistinct] so a payment 
out, and then a payment in to the counterparty transaction 
of 60 000 that is they paid to – from Global’s perspective.   
It might also be worthwhile to mention that in – look at 
Annexure O, the original Estina bundle, the spreadsheet 
10 
that I created showing running totals if we were to look at 
that we would see that prior to the deposit by Liebherr into 
Accurate Investments there is an incredibly small balance, 
such that these transfers could only have been funded by 
the payment from Liebherr. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That would be Annexure A on the 
funds bundle 5, if you can do that relatively easily will you 
take us there, I don’t have a reference, so I am going to be 
dependent on you there.   
MR HOLDEN:   So I have produced that up on screen here 
20 
and I realised that I have prepared this morning’s evidence 
on the basis of this particular spreadsheet, which is why I 
highlighted certain things. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well maybe if I can give you the 
reference, because I have now found it, it is 113, 113 Chair 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 84 of 130 
 
of Flow-funds Bundle 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you take us to the point 
that you want to make about what the Liebherr payment 
does to the Accurate balance.  
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, so as we see on here I 
acknowledge that Annexure A is very difficult to read on 
paper, but if we were to look at the screen and scroll over 
to the right here we see prior to the deposit that is made 
by Liebherr there is a balance of 815 dollars and twenty 
10 
one in that account and that increases the payment from 
Liebherr the increases the balance to just over 905 000 
and that then finances, that 700 – so that 900 000 is then 
dissipated by the 700 000 dollar transaction on the cell I 
have highlighted, the 130 000 dollar transaction and the 
60 000 dollar transaction you can see after those amounts 
have been dissipated an amount of only 15 000 dollars is 
left in the Standard Charter Bank account for Accurate 
Investments. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Mr Holden, can you 
20 
take us to the money when it lands in Global? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  So the first stream and now 
referring back to the diagram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what page is that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  1101.  It make – Chair what is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 85 of 130 
 
probably going to be the simplest way of dealing with this is 
for you to take out 1101. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Which will always stay the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then maybe annotate or again 
do not bother to annotate because we will – we will take you 
through these references. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Because these are important 
10 
references to go through. 
CHAIRPERSON.:  101? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Transaction by transaction.  1101 – 
1101. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1101. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  1101.  But again just like we 
promised yesterday we will get Estina diagrams that are fully 
reference we will do the same with these. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Accurate diagrams. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  1101 is on the other bundle? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Bundle 6 – 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then if you keep 5 open while 
you have 1101 as a separate page we will be able to track 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 86 of 130 
 
each step on 1101 through the ledgers in 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  This particular lever arch is quite 
full so if you want to take out a page that is towards the end 
it is quite difficult.  Now in page – in Bundle 5 what was it 
534 that you suggested I should keep open more? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think Mr Holden and I made our 
notes on separate documents.  I think he is going to be here 
around about page 114 for the consolidated annexure A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So that is the page I should… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  114 Chair yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  114 okay.  Yes okay alright.  Okay so that 
particular one we said is 1103 that one on the screen? 
MR HOLDEN:  It is 1101 as far as I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1101 okay.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And Chair in fact it is going to be 
115 not 114 of Bundle 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  115. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  115. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay I have got 115.  Okay but right 
now we are going onto that one or we are moving away from 
20 
that one?  We are going to that one. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Well we are going to see each 
transaction on this diagram as it reflects in the ledger on 
page 115. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay.  But that diagram is on 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 87 of 130 
 
what page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That diagram is the loose page 
that you have 1101. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the loose – oh okay alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  From Bundle 6 not from Bundle 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay I have got it.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So Mr Holden we had seen that the 
130 000 and 70 000 and 60 000 had moved from Accurate to 
Gateway.  Can we then – sorry Accurate to Global.  Can we 
see what happens to them in the ledgers – well first can we 
10 
pick that up in the ledgers so that we can see the other side 
of the transaction where in the books of Global as it were? 
MR HOLDEN:  The – you would like to look at the 
counterpart transactions? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  The counterpart transactions 
because it will also if we looking at Global’s books show us 
where the money moves out there after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you can I ask you to remind me of 
the date. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  23 July 2013. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:  So at – at annexure A we have a number of 
different transactions reflected here.  So the first one is at 
row 256 – the primary party is Global, the date is the 22 July 
2013, the counterparty in Accurate or Accurate Investments 
and if we scroll to the right here we see the R700 000.00 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 88 of 130 
 
entry - $700 000.00 apologies entering into the US Dollar 
account of Standard Chartered Bank for Global. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the 130 and 60 while we are 
there are just two below. 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct.  So we have 130 over here 
and 60 over there as the counterparty transactions reflecting 
they have been paid into the Global account. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then what happens to that 
money once it is in Global?  I mean maybe you first tell us 
what it does to the balance of Global? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  It vastly increases the balance in 
Global prior to the deposit of $700 000.00 the bank account 
had $24 948.00 within it.  So the deposit of $700 000.00 
increased the balance to $724 948.68. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And then the 130 and the – so you 
have identified 130 and the 60 can you go back to your 
diagram of the tranche and show where that money goes 
from Global on the diagram and then we will pick it up in the 
ledger? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  The first stream is paid out 
20 
on the 22 July 2013 and it runs to the left of Global Standard 
Chartered Banks box and that is $499 500.00 and if you 
scroll down to the bottom that is paid to Sahara in South 
Africa. And I very quickly bring up the counterparty the 
reference in the spread sheet as well. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 89 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes if you would? 
MR HOLDEN:  And then as we can see here on spread sheet 
at row 257 Global is the primary partner, the date, Sahara as 
the counterparty and the amount being taken out of Global of 
$499 500.00. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So just to take a step back what 
we are seeing is an amount paid into a Gupta Company in 
Dubai as a self-confessed payment in respect of the 
Transnet trains con – cranes contract which very quickly of 
which half a million dollars very quickly is transferred to 
10 
Sahara Computers. 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  So let us look at the next payment 
out but let us go to the diagram first so that we – we can plot 
it on the diagram. 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  Then we have a payment of 
$100 000.00 that is made on the 23 July 2013 and that is 
paid from Global Standard Chartered Bank US Dollar 
account into Gateway Standard Chartered Bank US Dollar 
account. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can we see that on the ledger 
at page 115? 
MR HOLDEN:  So we see here at row 261 – have I zoomed 
in enough for you Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can see there but not on –  
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 90 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not on … 
MR HOLDEN:  As long as it is legible on the screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. No, no I can see that ja. 
MR HOLDEN:  So I am afraid I have just lost my place there.  
So a t row 261 we can see the primary party is Global, the 
date is the 23 July 2013, the counterparty is Gateway SCB 
which is short for Standard Chartered Bank and then we 
have a payment out here of $100 000.00 from Global 
Standard Chartered Bank account and to pre-empt my 
10 
evidence leader I will then scroll up to the Gateway account 
and identify the same transaction which we can see here at 
row 110 primary party as Gateway the date is the 23 July 
2013 and the counterparty is Global Corporation LLC and 
that reflects a $100 000.00 deposit into Gateway Standard 
Chartered Bank accounts which as we see from the column 
to the right increases the balance in Gateway Standard 
Chartered Bank account from $372.39 to $100 372.39. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair for referencing purposes but 
you will get that later that entry is on page 113 the 
20 
corresponding entry that Mr Holden has just taken us to.  If 
we can go back to the diagram again. 
MR HOLDEN: Certainly.  So the day after that amount is paid 
into the Gateway Standard Chartered Bank account of that 
amount $93 378.61 is paid on the 24 July 2013 and that is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 91 of 130 
 
paid to Star Engineering which again was the agent that 
provided the dairy products – the dairy equipment that was 
used on the Estina farm from India. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And again if I might stop here.  
What we are seeing is proceeds derived from a Transnet 
contract being used to fund some of the very few dairy 
expenses that actually were incurred in relation to the Estina 
Dairy Product – Project. 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we go to the next entry on the 
10 
diagram, the next cash flow on the diagram? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  So returning further up the 
diagram heading out to the right from Global Standard 
Chartered Banks accounts.  We have a transfer on the 23 
July 2013 of 620 000.00 Durham which is equivalent to 
$168 845.32 and that is now paid into Global Standard 
Chartered 
Banks 
– 
Global’s 
Standard 
Chartered 
Bank 
Durham denominated accounts over here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can you find that on the 
ledgers?  Chair the reference will be page – oh no – I am – 
20 
yes the reference should be page 115 Chair. 
MR HOLDEN:  I am afraid I have [00:12:13] myself. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  You need to go two down. 
MR HOLDEN:  What is the date? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If you look – if you look it is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 92 of 130 
 
Standard Chartered AED. 
MR HOLDEN:  Oh that is correct.  Thank you 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  That is where you want to find 
that. 
MR HOLDEN:  Thank you.  So at row 263 we can see the 
primary partner – primary companies Global, the date is the 
23 July 2013.  The particulars are SCBAED which is short for 
Standard Chartered Bank UAE Durham and if you scroll 
further to the right here we see 620 000 Durham entering 
into the Standard Chartered Bank Durham denominated 
10 
account for Global. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And if we go back to the diagram 
to see the next money flow. 
MR HOLDEN:  From there that amount is withdrawn entirely 
in cash.  So we have another cash fire break at this point.  
So 620 000 Durham is transferred on the 23 July 2013 – 
sorry it is withdrawn in cash on that date. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And maybe go back to your ledger 
and go down a couple of lines and you will see that 620 000 
cash withdrawal. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  So at row 264 of my annexure you 
will see again the primary partner – the primary company is 
Global, the date is the 23 July 2013 and it indicates cash 
withdrawal slightly misspelt and you can it there a minus 
amount – a negative integer of [620 000] Durham from the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 93 of 130 
 
Standard Chartered Bank account which is then reflected as 
a 620 000 Durham credit in cash going to Global. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can we go back to the diagram 
and see the – before we see where the cash goes I think we 
have to track one further payment from I think – I may not 
have kept – go up a line.  I think you have been travelling 
down one line but not the other. 
MR HOLDEN:  I have been travelling down this line here. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Yes.  But can we then travel down 
the line on the far right. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:  Absolutely.  It might actually make sense at 
this point because the cash… 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Cash is going to co-mingle. 
MR HOLDEN:  The cash then goes out there. This amount 
the 620 000 goes out there. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay can you take us to that? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly.  So then what we see is on the 23 
July 2013 we see that cash is then given to Vikus and it says 
Vikus via JJT which is quite an interesting entry.  Vikus I 
assume again was Vikus Chaturvedi who was the Gupta 
20 
Enterprise employee in India and JJT was the – is wholly 
owned subsidiary of the Worlds Window Group.  So what we 
seeing here is a – effectively a cash deposit that is being 
paid to Vikus Chaturvedi via one of the Gupta Enterprises 
partners and money laundering JJT. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 94 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And can I just stop there and 
maybe link this to the Hawala ledger that we discussed 
yesterday.  How will this sort of transaction be covered in the 
Hawala ledger? 
MR HOLDEN:  Certainly Chair.  The Hawals ledger would 
reflect – it would have a – on its left most column it would 
have the individual to whom the money is being paid or the 
account that it is being paid from and it would be reflected 
either as a negative or a positive integer.  In this case it 
most likely be represented in – when it was coming into JJT 
10 
as a negative integer because this is a Hawala ledger that 
has been drafted from the point of view of the Worlds 
Window Group and then when it is paid out it is paid out as a 
positive integer. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thanks.  Unfortunately I do not 
have my reference to the Hawala ledger to hand but we will 
probably find that payment in the Hawala ledger.  Can you 
then find that – let us see if we can – well let me find the 
Hawala ledger and we will come back to = to that after lunch 
which is in – oh there you have it.  So this would be in your 
20 
annexure O which is the combined daily or daily ledgers or 
no, no.  Is that – is that  - that was one of the tabs on the 
spread sheet that was sent to Tony Gupta? 
MR HOLDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Okay. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 95 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:  So this is – this is a – the cash sheet that 
appears in that – in the ledger that is sent to Tony Gupta and 
you can see here on the 23 July we see a matching amount 
and it says here JJT and then the amount here is 616 560.00 
Durham and then the description of it or the explanation for 
it is Vikus.  So clearly it is been funds being transferred via 
JJT to Vikus. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Can I – Chair can ask you – I have 
now found the reference to that.  That is Flow of Funds 
Bundle 5 page 374 and there we will see the relevant 
10 
payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  374.  I have got 374. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Right there.  No I have got the 
wrong document Chair.  I am losing track of all of these 
ledgers I will – we will find that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And it will – we will reference it 
and come back – I think Mr Holden and I probably need a 
lunch break too. 
[Speaking over one another]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Holden has been feeding us all these 
figures. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I was more or less in control up 
until about ten minutes ago Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are two minutes – three minutes to one 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 96 of 130 
 
o’clock. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I think in fact it would be two or 
three minutes usefully spent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If Mr Holden and I can coordinate 
our references so that we move quicker after lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we take the lunch adjournment 
then Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  We will adjourn for 
10 
lunch and resume at two and maybe Mr Chaskalson you 
could 
see 
me 
in 
chambers 
immediately 
after 
the 
adjournment.. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Holden, I 
20 
undertook to avert to the Chair with references in relation to 
the diagram at page 1101.  I see you have it up there.  I was 
going to ask you to put it up there.  Chair, we have now done 
that referencing exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 97 of 130 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And we were coming back to you 
with references on the right hand side of that diagram.  So 
starting with the 168 845,32 Dollars.  It becomes 620 000 
Dirham that goes into Global Standard Chartered.  It is the 
on – it is the first tranche coming down on the left.  Sorry.  
Not on the left, on the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the right, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   On the right.  So it is the left-hand 
arrow down on the right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, into Global ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Global Standard Chartered.  That 
is on page 349.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Page three...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And all of these references will 
Flow Funds Bundle 5.  The – immediately to the right, there 
is 104 015 740 Dollars also coming down into Global 
Standard Chartered in Dirham.  That is 345.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is the page. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Same page, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is in relation to... 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So Chair, I think Mr Holden will 
just highlight it on the screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So that is the 115 730 Dollars 
...[intervenes]  
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 98 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...converted into 425 000 Dirham. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And that is page? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   345. 
CHAIRPERSON:   345. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   All of these are in Bundle 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Not Bundle 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Coming down from that rectangle, 
10 
there are two lines both of which we see at page 349. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then the 620 425 that is 
turned into cash, leads into a 425 000 cash deposit into 
Global in the National Bank of Abu-Dhabi.  That is at 349.  
And...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Let me see on the 
screen.  That is the one.  Okay.  And that is page 349. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   394. 
CHAIRPERSON:   349.  Okay. 
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the other movement of the 
cash was out to the right and down to Vikus Fire JJT.  And 
that is at 345. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And also 342.  It is picked up 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 99 of 130 
 
twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the last transaction on this 
page that we have not yet got to, was the payment coming 
down from the Global National Bank of Abu-Dhabi, a 
payment of 475 620 Dirham into an entity called Whizz Craft. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is at 349. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Holden, can you explain 
10 
who Whizz Craft are or were? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  Chair, Whizz Craft are an 
entertainment services company that provided the Gupta 
enterprises with dances and other entertainment for the Sun 
City wedding.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So then...  Well, this payment in 
particular.  We have...  Well, it is one of several payments.  
Maybe I can...  If I can ask you to go to Bundle 6, page 467.  
Bundle 6.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 467? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct.  And can you tell 
the Chair what we see at Bundle 6?  Oh, sorry 467.   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  What we have here is an 
email that was extracted from the Gupta leak records.  It was 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 100 of 130 
 
attached to as Annexure Q to my report.  It is an email that 
is sent from Johan Schalkwyk at johan@vdmass.co.za(?).  
Sent on Wednesday, August the 14 t h, 2013 to Ashu Chawla 
and 
also 
CC’d 
to 
another 
VD 
Mass 
email 
address, 
denise@vdmass.co.za with the subject Whizz Craft.  And the 
subject – the content of the email reads: 
“Dear Mr Ashu.  Attached hereto the amended draft 
as requested.  Yours faithfully, Johan Schalkwyk.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And if you go over the page, is 
this the attachment that was linked to the email? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Page 468. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And I do not want you to read this 
whole document but can you explain to the Chair what it is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  It is a letter that has been drafted 
by Johan Schalkwyk in relation to a dispute around payment 
between the Gupta enterprise and Whizz Craft.  There are 
disputes about the terms under which payments had been 
made for the entertainment services provided.   
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can I ask you to go to page 
469? 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there the writer lists four 
payments that were made to Whizz Craft in settlement of 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 101 of 130 
 
their invoice.  How does that link to the diagram that we are 
looking at? 
MR HOLDEN:   So the fourth payment that is listed there of 
129 600 US Dollars is made on the 24t h of July 2013.  That is 
the same date as reflected in the ledgers as being paid from 
Global’s National Bank of Abu-Dhabi account into Whizz 
Craft’s account of 475 000 Dirham.  And I did a calculation 
on the exchange rate at the time and that amount of Dirham 
almost exactly 129 600 US Dollars.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  That concludes the 
10 
first payment.  If we turn the page – if we go to the next 
diagram.  And Chair, that is at Bundle 6, page 1102.  It is in 
fact on the back of the page that you may have taken out.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The page number? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   1102 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay ja.  That is the one I took out, ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you take the Chair 
through this diagram Mr Holden? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  Chair, we have – this diagram 
begins – it is a relatively straightforward one.  Again, with 
20 
the green box.  It starts with a payment of 212 006,01 
Dollars that is transferred in on the 17t h of February 2014.  
And it is a payment that is made into Accurate Mashreq Bank 
account.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What was significant about 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 102 of 130 
 
17 February 2014? 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, on the 17t h of February 2014, that was 
the same day that Liebherr(?) announced that they had won 
the contract from Transnet.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And what happens to this 
212 006,01 Dollars once it lands in the Accurate Mashreq 
account? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  What happens in this 
instance is that it is comingled with funds from other 
sources.  Other sources that I have not entirely been able to 
10 
determine the origin thereof.  But effectively, it moves 
through 
Gupta 
enterprise 
companies, 
like 
Unlimited 
Electronic Computer.   
 
Eventually, 
on 
the 
25t h of February 2014, 
450 000 
Dollars is paid into Accurate Mashreq’s account where it 
joined the 212 006,01 Dollars from Liebherr.   
 
And then on the same day with the account balance 
increased sufficiently, there is a payment of 599 327 Dollars 
on the 25t h of February 2014 to Linkway Trading. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So once again, what we have is a 
20 
payment made by Liebherr in respect of a Transnet contract 
that ends up in the Gupta company in South Africa, namely 
Linkwe(?). 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I am – we are not going 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 103 of 130 
 
with references on these diagrams.  We will provide you with 
a fully referenced set of diagrams. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The third diagram, page 1103.  
And Chair, for that, you will have to go back to Bundle 6.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, ca you take us through 
that diagram? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly, Chair.  Again, it begins with the 
green go-box at the top, indicating Liebherr.  On the 
10 
15t h of April 2014, 
Liebherr 
transfers 
an 
amount 
of 
371 105,83 Dollars.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  
Mr Chaskalson, did you say I must go to page...  Oh, you 
said 1103? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   1103 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I think maybe it has been a long day.  
I keep on sometimes going to attend something when you 
say 11.  So.  [laughs]  Okay let me...  Yes, I have got it. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And Mr Holden, can you take us 
20 
through this one? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So as I was saying.  The first 
amount Chair beings with a payment from Liebherr into 
Accurate Investments’ Mashreq Bank, US Dollar account and 
the total of that payment is 371 105,83 Dollars and that is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 104 of 130 
 
transferred on the 15t h of April 2014.   
 
Just shy of two weeks later, 13-days later on the 
28t h of April 2014, there is an amount of 375 000 Dollars that 
is transferred from Accurate Mashreq bank account into 
Fidelity Enterprises, Mashreq bank account.   
 
Obviously, the additional – I think it is 3900 Dollars 
making that payment, were funds already resting in the 
Accurate account at that point.  And finally to complete this.   
 
On the 29t h of April 2014, an amount of 400 000 Dollars 
is transferred from Fidelity Mashreq Bank account into 
10 
Oakbay’s accounts of which 371 000 Dollars emanated from 
Liebherr.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So once again, a payment in 
respect of a Transnet trains contract is made offshore and 
lands in a South African Gupta Enterprise company. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we go to 1104 and the fourth 
payment? 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you start with the money that 
20 
comes in from Liebherr? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So the way I have organised this 
particular payment.  Rather than a payment, it is a payment 
tranche.  And the reason I have organised it in this way is 
because all of these funds are used to the same purpose, 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 105 of 130 
 
eventually.   
 
So it begins with Chair at the top right hand corner.  
Liebherr makes three different transfers into Accurate’s 
Mashreq US Dollar account on the 7t h of May 2014.  That is 
for 405 598,52.   
 
On the 19t h of May 2014, 402 879,34 Dollars is paid into 
Accurate Mashreq.  And then finally on the 26t h of May 2014, 
296 890.30 Dollars is paid in Accurate’s Mashreq account.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you give the Chair the 
sum of those three payments?  You have used it low down in 
10 
your diagram . 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes.  [laughs]  I was hoping you will not ask 
me to do it in my head.  The total amounts of those 
payments is 1 105 368,16 Dollars.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that – those payments into 
Accurate’s 
Mashreq 
account 
are 
comingled 
with 
other 
payments.  Can you identify or can you describe the 
movement of the other payments that come into Accurate? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  We have two streams.  On 
the top left here, we have a payment of roughly 4.5 million 
20 
Dollars that is paid into an account of Reliable.   
 
And Reliable is another Gupta enterprise company.  
Mashreq Bank, US Dollar account.  JJT Fourth Exum.   
 
It is a little bit difficult to discern exactly what company 
they refer to but we can very safely assume it is JJ Trading 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 106 of 130 
 
or one of its subsidiaries. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And for where did most of JJ 
Trading’s payments into the Gupta companies derive from? 
MR HOLDEN:   They derived from payments relate to the 
Transnet contracts. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, which Transnet contracts? 
MR HOLDEN:   It is the, 1064 contract.  And... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It is the locomotives contract and I 
think there is another contract that it may be as well. 
MR HOLDEN:   I would rather not say right now because 
10 
there is a difference between JJT and Central General 
Trading.  And I would just want to double check exactly 
which... 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sure.  At any rate.  We do know 
that most of the money that JJT receives and transfers into 
the Guptas comes from the locomotives contract. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is contract. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   From Reliable, Mashreq.  Where 
does that money go? 
MR HOLDEN:   On the 12 t h of May 2014, 2.5 million Dollars 
20 
is transferred into Global’s Mashreq US Dollar account.  And 
then thereafter, on the 26t h of May, 2.2 million Dollars is 
transferred from the Global Mashreq US Dollar account into 
Accurate Mashreq US Dollar account.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then if we can deal with the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 107 of 130 
 
parallel’s stream of funds that is going to end up Accurate 
Mashreq account.  
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  I have indicated here mix sources 
including JJT Key Centric on the far left here.  When I was 
compiling and I was trying to chase these funds, there were 
quite a large number of payments that are made into Global 
Mashreq’s Dirham account from various different sources of 
which JJT Centric is – was certainly the largest one.   
 
I have always interpreted JJT Centric to potentially refer 
to Centric General Trading which was the sister company of 
10 
JJ Trading and which always received funds from the 
Transnet locomotive contracts.   
 
So those are the sources over the course of four days 
between the 11t h of May 2014 and the 15t h of May 2014 pay 
8.2 million Dirham into Global Mashreq’s Bank Dirham based 
account.   
 
Those 
comingled 
are 
then 
transferred 
on 
the 
19t h of May 2014 at an amount of 5 000 336  Dirham into 
Accurate’s Mashreq Dirham based account.  And then 
transferred in two payments over to Accurate Mashreq’s US 
20 
Dollar account.   
 
The first payment was on the 27t h of May 2014 
equivalent to 1.7 million Dirham which is 462 710,94 Dollars.  
And on the following day on the 28t h of May, we have 
4 545 800 Dirham which is equivalent to 1 237 289,06 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 108 of 130 
 
Dollars.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then what happens to these 
accumulated funds in Accurate Mashreq’s account? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  As soon as these funds are 
comingled into the Accurate account which effectively acts 
as a piggybank to facilitate one further transfer.  On the 
28t h of May 2014, 5 million Dollars is paid from Liebherr...   
 
Oh, sorry.  From Accurate Mashreq’s account into the 
account of Brookfield Consultants which is a company based 
in the US, which as I have noted before, of which 
10 
1 105 386,16 Dollars emanates from Liebherr. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you now to turn to page 
213 of Bundle 6 where you describe who Brookfield are.  
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   213? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   213 at paragraph 114. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  The tax record filed in the 
US state of Texas...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second. 
MR HOLDEN:   Pardon me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hold on, Mr Holden.  Let me get there.   
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have found it.  Yes? 
MR HOLDEN:   Thank you Chair.  The tax records that are 
filed was in the US state of Texas.  Show that the directors 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 109 of 130 
 
of – or the individuals who signed tax return mentioned on 
behalf of Brookfield in the US are Ashish and Amal Gupta 
who are relatives of the Gupta brothers.   
 
I do indicate here that there is an Annexure S of that 
tax.  That is all of the annexures that appears not to be 
included in the bundle which we will need to resolve over the 
weekend.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  But can I ask you to 
go to Annexure T which is an email in relation to this 
payment?  It is at page 477. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you describe to the Chair 
what this annexure is? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  What we have here is an 
email from Tony or Rajesh Gupta from his Sahara account 
that is sent on Wednesday the 7t h of May 2014.   
 
And it is sent to Ronica Ragavan’s Oakbay email 
address and to AJ Gupta’s – I think it is a Sahara address.  
And the subject is:  Forward info.   
 
And the body of the text indicates that Tony Gupta was 
20 
forwarding on a message that have originally been sent from 
Ramesh Gupta at the address rgupta6666@yahoo.com which 
he had originally sent two days before on the 5t h of May to 
Tony Gupta and to Ashu Chawla.   
 
And what it is provides is a – a bunch of information for 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 110 of 130 
 
procure consultants so that the amounts can be transferred 
across to the consultants in the US. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can I ask you to go to the 
bottom of the page where you will see the email that Ramesh 
Gupta...  That Tony emailed from Ramesh Gupta which is 
how he describes the money that is going to be paid. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So preceding that email chain.  
Ramesh Gupta writes to an individual by the name of Ken 
Haas.  I am afraid I have not been able to identify who 
exactly that it is.  But the email reads: 
10 
“Ken, 
please 
send 
information 
for 
the 
money 
transfer from South Africa to Brookfield, same entity 
as it went from which should include bank details 
and transfer instructions.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So the Gupta relative in America 
understood that this money that he was going to receive 
came from South Africa.  And of course, he was right 
because it came ultimately from Transnet.   
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So even though this...  Well, this 
20 
is a payment made in respect of a Transnet contract but 
ends up not in South Africa but at a Gupta relative in the 
United States. 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we go to page 1105 where we 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 111 of 130 
 
look at the fifth tranche?  And can you describe to the Chair 
what you see there? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  Sadly, this was the final 
tranche in relation to Liebherr that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You said we should go to what 
page Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, it is 1105. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Bundle 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  Yes, thank you.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am ready. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Holden, can you describe what 
you see there?   
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  This is unfortunately a 
tranche that I am not able to complete the tracing on as at 
this date, the Gupta leak records, the ledgers go dark for us.  
We have no longer...   
 
We have no idea where the funds go to from there, 
although it is a begin – a small amount of the tracing.  So it 
20 
begins on the 9t h of October 2014.   
 
Flowing from Liebherr into Accurate Standard Chartered 
bank account in US Dollars for 368 110.  And that amount is 
dissipated pretty quickly.  On the...  Apologies, I am getting 
ahead of myself here.   
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 112 of 130 
 
 
The second transfer in from Liebherr is made on the 
1s t of December 2014 and that was for 278 840 Dollars and it 
is 
again 
paid 
into Accurate 
Standard 
Chartered 
bank 
account.   
 
And then, this essentially splits into two streams that we 
can trace.  First, coming off the left of Accurate Standard 
Chartered bank account.  We have two transfers.   
 
One made on the 9t h of December 2014 for 20 000 
Dollars and that goes into Fidelity Enterprises’ Mashreq 
Bank US Dollar account.   
10 
 
And on the 10t h of December, so the following day, a 
further 20 000 Dollars is transferred from Accurate Standard 
Chartered bank account into Fidelity Enterprises’ Mashreq 
Bank US Dollar account.  And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So the one...  There are two which were 
effected on the same date.  Is that right? 
MR HOLDEN:   There is two...  There is on that is made on 
the 9t h Chair and one that is made on the 10t h both for 
20 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought you had talked about two 
20 
which were made on the 10 t h and I thought you had said 
20 000 in regard to – what seems to be 200 000. 
MR HOLDEN:   Okay.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  You were not there yet. 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, I am not there yet. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 113 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   I am still – there I am still busy addressing 
the left-hand side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   And then returning to the right-hand side.  As 
the 
Chair 
has 
correctly 
identified 
on 
the 
10t h of December 2014, 200 000 is transferred from Accurate 
Standard Chartered bank account into Global’s Bank of 
Baroda US Dollar account where it comingles with other 
funds   
10 
 
And 
on 
the 
11 t h 
of 
December 
2014, 
243 000 
is 
transferred from Global’s Bank of Baroda US Dollar account 
into Fidelity Bank of Baroda US Dollar account.   
 
And unfortunately, at that point, our records go dark and 
we cannot trance it any further.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Now, we have seen five tranches 
of payment from Liebherr.  They all end up or either end up 
in Gupta companies in South Africa or in the United States 
and the last one has not left the Gupta company in Dubai at 
the point of which we lose sight of it.  Can you tell the Chair 
20 
what other activity, if any, was taking place in the Accurate 
account over these periods? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  The Accurate account is 
relatively inactive.  What we do see is a large number of 
transfers into and out of the account from other Gupta 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 114 of 130 
 
enterprise companies.   
 
For 2013, the only payment into Accurate Investments 
account that we see from outside of the Gupta enterprise, is 
from Liebherr.   
 
In 2014, we see Liebherr again as a payee into those 
accounts.  And one other payee by the name of VK Trading, 
Hong Kong   
 
Unfortunately, I have not been able to determine exactly 
who that is.  But what is very notable is that there are no 
expenses coming out of that account.   
10 
 
There is no payment of salaries.  There is no payment of 
office costs.  There is no payment of any sort of physical 
infrastructure at all.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And maybe in that regard, can I 
ask you and the Chair to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Much earlier, 
other than the movement of what you identified as money 
from Transnet, was there much activity in relation to 
Accurate, showing that they were a company that was really 
operational, 
other 
than 
just 
being 
used 
for 
money 
20 
laundering? 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, we do have certain records.  Obviously, 
our records for Accurate only begin at the beginning of 
20143 from the Gupta leaks.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 115 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:   But prior to the Liebherr deposits, again, we 
see no activity that would indicate ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
HOLDEN: 
  ...a functioning 
company that would 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HOLDEN:   ...that has staff for or a physical premise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If this tranche, the fifth tranche...  
Okay there was a further point that I wanted to make in 
10 
relation to it.  The point at which the trial goes cold for you, 
is a at a point at which all of those funds have ended up in 
Fidelity accounts.  Is that correct? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to go to – and it is 
in December 2014 that the trial goes cold. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to go to Flow of 
Funds, Bundle 5, page 636? 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number again? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   636 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   636.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   This is the Reserve Bank’s 
spreadsheet record of cross-border transactions of Fidelity 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 116 of 130 
 
and can I ask you to look at that cross-border transaction on 
the 5t h of January 2015? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   What do you see there? 
MR HOLDEN:   H’m ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Chair.  Are you at that 
page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR HOLDEN:   Chair, what I see here is a payment in, on 
the 5t h of January 2015 into the Oakbay Investment’s 
10 
account.  And on the following page, on 672 under the 
heading:  Non-resident surname...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  At 636, you say the 
5t h of January 2015? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the fourth or fifth item from the top 
right? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct Chair. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   In fact, make a note that it is the 
20 
fourth item from the top because that how we will follow it 
across the next pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Because this is one long one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ja, just...  Mr Holden, just mention 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 117 of 130 
 
the point you make about that item.  Just repeat the point 
you were making. 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So on the 5t h of January, we see a 
flow in that is paid into Oakbay Investment’s account and the 
relevant column, which is the second last column on the 
spreadsheet, there would be the CIPC registration number 
for Oakbay Investments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   And on the following page, again you have to 
trace the fourth entry because these are supposed to be 
10 
read next to each other, rather than one after each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR HOLDEN:   We see that the registered address is given 
us Oakbay Investments registered address.  And the payee 
under the non-resident’s surname entry is giving us Fidelity 
Enterprises.  And then finally, the Rand amount is given as 
R 23 430 328,54.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now on page 367, I have not 
identified.  Just tell me where I see the relevant items? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  It is the fourth entry down. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Fourth entry from the bottom of the page? 
MR HOLDEN:   No, from the top of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the top of the page. 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Oakbay, yes.   
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 118 of 130 
 
MR HOLDEN:   And if you follow it to the right, we will see 
the non-resident surname as Fidelity Enterprises.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is the 23 million. 
MR HOLDEN:   23 430 328, 54. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR HOLDEN:   And so we have to go again over to the next 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HOLDEN:   And if you look at the fourth entry down 
again, this is a flow of funds number 5, page 638.  We have 
10 
four entries down, an amount of the US Dollar amount is 
1.999970 million Dollars. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   No, I am must actually stop at that 
point.  I cannot take the further point that I was hoping I 
would be able to make.  The – can I ask you to go to Volume 
50.  I am taking you out of your – the topic which you were 
addressing which is movement on the Accurate accounts 
because Accurate was the party paid by Liebherr.  Can I ask 
you to go to page 113 of Bundle 5? 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you tell the Chair what 
we are looking at here? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  This was – because it is 
Annexure A to my Estina report.  This is the spreadsheet that 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 119 of 130 
 
I put together by scraping or collating all the entries, the 
funds flow entries.  I then creating a running balance to the 
right of that.  And then organising that by company which I 
have now also put on screen because the printed version is 
incredible difficult to read.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And do you see any receipts by 
Accurate, when revenue is coming into Accurate or in this 
period of 1 March 2013 to 26 February 2014.  They do not 
come either from the Gupta company or from Liebherr.   
MR HOLDEN:   On this spreadsheet.  No, Chair. 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I suppose in fairness to Liebherr, 
we should point out that on the 12 t h of January 2014, there 
was a cash deposit of 10 000...  Oh, but that goes out.  
Sorry.  Can I ask whether you see any payments out to any 
entity other than the Gupta entity? 
MR HOLDEN:   I do not. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that is for a period...  That is 
for a calendar year? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thanks.  Has Liebherr ever tried 
20 
to explain these payments? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  They issued one statement in 
October 2017 which I am sure we will turn to shortly. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes, let us turn then now.  It is 
page one...  Well, can you confirm that what we see at 1099 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 120 of 130 
 
in Bundle 6 is a Liebherr statement? 
MR HOLDEN:   Correct Chair, that is Liebherr’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I 
thought 
you 
said 
109 
at 
– 
of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   1099 of Bundle 6 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 1099? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me get there.  Okay, okay.  Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to read Liebherr’s 
explanation for these payments in the statement? 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  So as context, Liebherr issued the 
statement in response to a media article that was published 
by AmaBhungane, which is an investigative – a group of 
investigative 
journalists 
who 
do 
excellent 
work, 
who 
indicated that based on the Gupta leaks that Liebherr had 
been paying money to the Gupta enterprise companies.  I 
will resume from paragraph 3 of that statement if that makes 
sense? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Well, maybe we should start from 
paragraph 1.  So. 
20 
MR HOLDEN:   Okay.  It says: 
“In an article published on July 2017, a group of 
investigative 
South 
African 
journalists, 
AmaBhungane, 
mentioned 
Liebherr 
Containers 
Crane Limited based in Killarney, Ireland in the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 121 of 130 
 
context of an alleged kickback scheme, who supply 
contracts for Transnet and involving the sales agent, 
Accurate Investments Limited. 
Liebherr 
considered 
these 
allegations 
as 
very 
serious.  The business practice as described in the 
article are unacceptable to us. 
The commitment to integrity of conduct and a fair 
competition in the market across the world, is part 
of our core values. 
In accordance with group policies, the ultimate 
10 
holding company of the Liebherr Group, Liebherr 
International AG, therefore, conducted an internal 
investigation into the matter. 
The result of this investigation showed that the 
transactions under investigation will legally sound 
and not in violation of any applicable law or 
regulations on the part of Liebherr entities and 
employees involved. 
The selection of a sales agent such as Accurate 
Investments Limited to provide interface services to 
20 
the end-user during the tender, procurement and 
supply process is a practice which is common in a 
sales process for capital expenditure projects. 
It is also common that such a sales agent receives a 
nominal commission for the services provided in the 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 122 of 130 
 
event of the tender, procurement and supply process 
is successfully completed.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Stop...  Can I just stop you there?  
I think you have already mentioned the amount of the 
nominal commission that Accurate received in this case.  
Can you just refresh our memory if you translate it or give a 
Dollar amount and then translate it into Rands? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  The total amount that we 
can 
track 
from 
Liebherr 
into Accurate 
Investments 
is 
3 232 430,88 Dollars which is equal to R 49 381 200,07 at 
10 
today’s exchange rate. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And that nominal commission, of 
course, is only what you can see, not what you note to be 
the total of what Liebherr paid Accurate. 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can you continue with the 
Liebherr’s statement? 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes. 
“In the case in question, Accurate Investments 
Limited was the sales representative selected by 
20 
Liebherr Container Cranes Limited. 
As required by the groups due diligent process, 
Liebherr 
Container 
Cranes 
Limited 
performed 
background checks prior to entering into the agency 
agreement with Accurate Investment Limited. 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 123 of 130 
 
These background checks did not indicate any 
malpractice on the part of Accurate Investments 
Limited. 
The internal investigation did observe, however, that 
the group’s defined due diligence process might 
have been implemented in a more stringent manner 
in 
this 
case, 
by 
pushing 
the 
performance 
background checks to an even higher level than the 
ones actually performed. 
Being aware of the increased risks associated when 
10 
agents are included in any type of transaction, the 
group company’s management and employees must 
strive to ensure that the group’s standard of scrutiny 
and diligence are complied with in day-to-day 
business.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I see.  Have you ever tried to 
engage 
with 
Liebherr 
over 
this 
quite 
extraordinary 
explanation in relation to the kickbacks that they paid to 
Accurate Investments? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  Prior to my submission that 
20 
I made regarding Transnet and this flow of funds, I thought it 
appropriate for – to approach Liebherr again a number of 
years later to ask them detailed questions about this 
contract and to get their response. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to turn to page 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 124 of 130 
 
1107? 
MR HOLDEN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you tell us what you see 
there? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly Chair.  We see an email that was 
sent from my email address to three individuals at Liebherr. 
The first is philipherth@liebherr.com.   
 
The second is sandradiella@liebherr.com.  The third is 
barennicknortman@liebherr.com.  And the email was sent on 
Wednesday, August the 12t h, 2020.   
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you...  Well, I think, can 
you read your email to Liebherr and the questions you asked 
them? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly.  I say: 
“Hello.  My name is Paul Holden.  I am currently the 
Director 
of 
Investigations 
at 
Shadow 
World 
Investigations...” 
 
And I provide our EUL(?) address SWI.   
“SWI intends to publish a lengthy report on the 
capture of a South African railway facility, Transnet 
20 
by the Gupta family and their extended network. 
This report includes a discussion of the contract 
entered into between Liebherr Container Cranes 
Limited and Accurate Investments. 
The 
latter 
now 
is 
well-established 
as 
a 
fund 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 125 of 130 
 
ultimately controlled by the Gupta family. 
Using internal accounting records, our report will 
trace how the funds paid to Accurate Investments by 
Liebherr were used by Accurate Investments. 
This process has revealed that the funds paid by 
Liebherr 
to 
Accurate 
were 
almost 
always 
immediately 
dissipated 
into 
other 
accounts 
controlled by the Guptas and ultimately used to pay 
for services delivered to the Gupta family. 
This includes, for example, using Liebherr funds to 
10 
hire actors and musicians to perform at the now 
notorious Sun City wedding of Vega Gupta. 
Prior to publishing our report, I was hoping that 
Liebherr would be willing to answer the following 
questions which I provide hereunder. 
We will include your responses in our final report 
and any additional media coverage that flows from 
our findings. 
I would appreciate a response by the end of the 
business day, Friday, the 14t h of August.” 
20 
 
And here, I delve into the questions.  I say:   
“Question 1: 
On the 16t h of October 2017, Liebherr issued a 
press statement regarding allegations of kickbacks 
paid to assist Liebherr Africa to secure contracts for 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 126 of 130 
 
the supply of cranes to Transnet. 
The statement indicated that Liebherr had found no 
evidence 
of 
wrongdoing 
after 
an 
internal 
investigation. 
Do you wish to add any further information to this 
statement or any further clarification?” 
 
At Question 2, I say: 
“In the same statement, you clarified that Liebherr 
Container Cranes Limited entered into a sales 
agreement with Accurate Investments. 
10 
In this regard: 
2(a) 
What 
services 
did 
Accurate 
Investments 
provide? 
2(b) 
On 
what 
date 
was 
the 
agreement 
with 
Accurate Investments entered into? 
2(c) 
What was the total value of payments made 
under the terms of this sales agreement and the last 
payment was made and when was the agreement 
said to terminate? 
2(d) 
Who signed the sales agreement on behalf of 
20 
Accurate Investments?  Who else from Accurate 
Investments was Liebherr in contact with regarding 
this contract and its fulfilment? 
2(e) 
Who signed the sales agreement on behalf of 
Liebherr Cranes?” 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 127 of 130 
 
 
Question 3: 
“Accurate Investments is a Dubai invest entity with a 
sole Indian director, Sanjay Grover, who had no 
notable connections to South Africa. 
The 
company 
has 
no 
online 
presence 
or 
infrastructure. 
Well, the on the ground investigations suggests that 
they have no physical office.   
What possible interface services could this company 
have provided to Liebherr Cranes? 
10 
Considerable evidence has emerged, showing that 
Accurate Investments was controlled by the Gupta 
family and formed one of a number offshore entities 
based in Dubai, used by the family to receive and 
launder and dissipate funds.” 
 
And I then linked to an article which describes that 
process.  And I ask: 
“Would you care to comment?” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Questions 5 and 6 relate to other 
matters that we may address at another time in the 
20 
Commission but are not relevant to evidence today. 
MR HOLDEN:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Did Liebherr respond? 
MR HOLDEN:   Certainly they responded the following week 
on Wednesday, the 19t h of August 2020.  They wrote back to 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318

me. 
 
The 
individual 
who 
wrote 
back 
was 
philipherth@liebherr.com.  And they responded: 
“Dear Mr Holden.  Thank you very much for your 
message ...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry.  Are you reading now from 
page 1108? 
MR HOLDEN:   That is correct. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   1108.   
MR HOLDEN:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR HOLDEN:   Yes. 
“Dear Mr Holden.  Thank you very much for your 
message.  In 2017, we conducted an internal 
investigation into the role of Liebherr Container 
Cranes Limited based in Killarney, Ireland in the 
context of the processes you mentioned. 
In doing so, we took into account all the information 
available to us. 
In the public statement on October 13t h of the same 
year, 
we 
made 
available 
the 
results 
of 
this 
20 
investigation. 
Please find the original statement attached to our 
email.” 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I stop you there?  Was that 
the statement that we read a short while ago? 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318

MR HOLDEN:   That is correct Chair. 
“With the completion of the investigation report and 
the publication of the results, we considered the 
case to be concluded for us. 
We ask for your understanding in this regard.” 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
[laughs] 
 
Did 
you 
give 
them 
the 
understanding?   
MR HOLDEN:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And did you understand? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
MR HOLDEN:   I understood but I did not agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, that concludes Mr Holden’s 
evidence on Liebherr.  I am hoping that it does not conclude 
the Commission’s evidence on Liebherr.  We are now about 
to move to the Transnet’s side of the report and that is quite 
a detailed introductory leading to set the scene.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So with your permission Chair, I 
20 
would ask that we adjourn at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And pick that up on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  So we will continue 
on...  We will have an evening session on Monday.  That is 
04 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 318 
 
Page 130 of 130 
 
when Mr Holden will continue, right? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Chair.  At what time should 
Mr Holden make himself available on Monday? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think maybe he should be here at five.  I 
think that is safe, five o’clock. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay thank you very much.  Thank 
you very much Mr Holden.  But you will be back on Monday.  
Thank you very much.  We will adjourn for the day.   
 
And then, next week during the day, I will hear evidence 
10 
relating to Eskom and then in the evenings I will hear 
evidence relating to money flows.  Okay alright.  It will be 
money flows throughout Mr Chaskalson or there would be 
others that are not money flows? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   There will be witnesses from 
Mackenzie coming on Wednesday and Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is Wednesday and Thursday.  Okay, 
okay, alright.  We will adjourn for the day.  Thank you.  We 
adjourn.
