PROCEEDINGS ON 18 APRIL 2019  
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning, good morning everybody.  Thank you 
let us proceed. Your mic.  Put on yours as well Maj or General Booysen.  
Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Good 
morning.  Yesterday Mr Booysen we ended your evidence on you telling 
the commission about Mr Toshan Panday and Colonel Madhoe having 
been arrested on criminal charges rela ting to bribery / corruption, is 
that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  We remain then to be with use 
of the timeline on Exhibit ZD page 3.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And which block are we on today?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Page – sorry block- 
we moving onto block 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  27 okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In that regard can I ask you to 
turn to page 15 in bundle ZA of your main affidavit while keeping this 
particular diagram page open.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say … 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  So it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 15?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Page 15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  To start I know direct your 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 3 of 108 
 
attention to paragraph 49 of your statement.  General Booysen 
following the arrest of Colonel Madhoe and Mr Toshan Panday are you 
aware of what transpired following the arrest?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  To an extent I am 
Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please inform the commission 
about what you know? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair soon after both 
had been arrested and had appeared the commercial crimes court in 
Durban the investigator officer alerted me that the prosecutor in the 
10 
matter Advocate Bheki Manyathi had received a communicae from I do 
not know in what form – well I did not know at that stage in what form, 
had received a communicae from Advocate Mgwebe from the NPA head 
office.  He was I think the head of the commercial crime section  at the 
National Prosecuting Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And he showed me a 
letter which Advocate Mgwebe had written to Advocate Manyathi.  The 
extent of the letter was basically interrogating why Madhoe had been – 
Colonel Madhoe had been charged or prosecuted.  There was one 
20 
reference – in the - this communicae stating besides a scrap piece of 
paper what other evidence is there against Madhoe.  I think the scrap 
piece of paper they probably referred to is the note on which I wrote 
the date at the funeral. 
CHAIRPERSON: H’m. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 4 of 108 
 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  After that Advocate 
Manyathi penned a detailed legal opinion comprising a number of pages 
setting out the extent of the evidence against Madhoe and he 
concluded his legal opinion by stating that he intends indicting Madhoe 
in the high court for corruption. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then ask you to turn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry he – did he… 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you know did you – did he then send that 
10 
opinion to Advocate Mgwebe?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I know that he did do 
that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In that regard can I ask you to 
turn to Annexure JWB5 which starts on page 91 of that same bundle 
ZA.  This particular document is titled Internal Memorandum and it is 
sent from Advocate L S Mgwebe Special Director SCCU to Advocate W 
Miller Acting Regional Head SCCU Durban and cc is Advocate Mlotshwa 
Acting Director of Public Prosecution KwaZulu Natal.  It is dated on the 
20 
front page as 9 January 2012 and the subject title is referenced as 
Colonel 
Navin 
Madhoe 
with 
particularity 
to 
additional 
details.  
Notwithstanding the date on this particular page if I  can ask you to just 
turn to page 94 – 94 of that same bundle.  There is in fact a date 
mentioned there though the 4 December 2011 and it is signed off by 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 5 of 108 
 
Advocate L S Mgwebe or rather not signed off by Advocate L S  
Mgwebe.  Is this the particular documen t that you were referring to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the document 
but I have it as Advocate Lawrence Mgwebe that is how he is known.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Is it correct that 
this particular document concerned repre sentations that were made to 
his office as you have previously indicated?  
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
That 
is 
my 
interpretation of the document Chair.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  One can say that in the first paragraph  in that letter 
that document it is a letter from Advocate L S Mgwebe dated 9 January 
2012 addressed to Advocate W Miller at regional head CCU Durban and 
a copy sent to Advocate Mlotshwa acting Director of Public Prosecution 
Kwazulu Natal.  And in the firs t paragraph he says that his office that is 
Advocate Mgwebe received on 6 December 201 - it says 201 it must 
have been 2011 – must have intended 2011 his office received 
representations from the lawyer representing Colonel Madhoe in the 
abovementioned matters.  He then says a copy of the said 
representations is attached here for your information.  So it would 
20 
appear that arising from some representations made by the lawyer for 
Colonel Madhoe he then decided to make certain enquiries.  Okay 
thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Can you just 
very simply explain what exactly does representations mean?  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 6 of 108 
 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
Chair 
my 
understanding of representations are that if you as an accused feel that 
there are no – that there is no evidence against you or that there might 
be a prosecution for ulterior purposes that one could then bring that to 
the attention of the NDPP or in this particular instance I would have 
thought it should have been sent to the DPP and if they had not  had 
any closure that it would then be advanced to the NDPP.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Excuse me.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In that regard can I then ask 
you whether or not Advocate Lawrence Mgwebe ought to have received 
10 
these representations directly from the a ttorneys of Colonel Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure why you think he – he should deal 
with that. Somebody a lawyer is instructed by an accused person and – 
and the lawyer decides to make representations.  If he are indeed the – 
is the lawyer who decides where he will or she will send those 
representations.  Even Advocate Mgwebe does he have a – does he 
have a choice of whether he receives them or not.  If they are sent to 
him they land on his desk, they land on his desk.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMB ER:  As it pleases Chair.  I would 
like the witness though to clarify to us whether or not it was in fact well 
20 
within the right of Mr – of Advocate Mgwebe to consider the 
representations as he did?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am not sure you might know something that I 
do not know yet but an accused lawyer decides that on behalf of his 
client or her client he or she wants to make representations to the NPA.  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 7 of 108 
 
He or she decides to make representation to the prosecutor  or she – he 
or she decides to make representatio ns to somebody much higher up I 
am not sure that it is something that we really want to spend time on at 
this stage. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ja.  Chair, Chair this particular 
witness will be talking to the proper channels that ought to have been 
followed in this particular process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By whom – followed by whom?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  By an accused person and in 
this particular instance.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but if the accused person decides not to follow or 
does not know how does that assist us?  Or does not know what the 
correct procedure.  It is different if the point being made is something 
about Mr Mgwebe. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a point that is sought to be made about Mr 
Mgwebe? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  That is in fact the point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the point?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The point is that through the 
20 
evidence of General Booysen the representations ought not to have 
been considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ought not to have been? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ought not to have been 
considered. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 8 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well are we at the stage where they are being 
considered?  All I know is there has been – Mgwebe had received some 
representations and he is asking for comment from t he prosecutor. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair.  Can I – 
can I maybe just rephrase my question to the General instead?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe otherwise maybe at some stage later maybe 
there might have – there might be a proper foundation for – for what 
you or Major General Booysen might have in mind but as things stand it 
does not appear to me that it is really something that one can make 
much point about representations being sent to a wrong person by an 
10 
accused lawyer. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is assuming it is a wrong place to send them.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen in your 
experience 
what 
was 
the 
proper 
channels 
to 
process 
the 
representation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I specifically 
mentioned this in my statement because Advocate Mgwebe his name 
20 
will crop up on a few other occasions later in my statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In my experience and 
were a number of years and I have canvassed this with a number of 
prosecutors. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 9 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Normally if you want 
to make representations  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
 MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In this particular 
instance it should have gone to the DPP or at – or to Advocate Miller  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Who was the head of 
the office in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL B OOYSEN:  And I understand the 
Chair’s concern about the attorney writing directly to the NDPP office 
they could have been – been unaware of the procedure but my problem 
is that I feel that Advocate Mgwebe should not have entertained the 
representation.  He should have referred it in its entirety back to the 
DPP’s office to deal with it.  If the accused was still not satisfied he 
could then escalate it to the NDPP’s office.  That – that is how I have 
experienced it over the years.  So I just found it a bit o dd that Advocate 
Mgwebe would entertain this – looks more – rather a complaint than a 
representation of the attorney of Mr Madhoe.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No it may well be I do not know.  It may well be 
that it was a wrong procedure.  It may well be that it w as a wrong place 
to send them to on the part of the accused’s lawyer.  I am just saying at 
this stage it does not appear to me that there is proper foundation for 
anything for us to canvass more.  Maybe when other aspects of Major 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 10 of 108 
 
General Booysen’s evidence have been dealt with we might come back 
to it if there seems to be something.  One – I do not know what the 
procedure is.  Do we know?  Do you know Major General whether there 
is a procedure set down in policies or regulations or the statute the 
relevant – the statute? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair not in terms of 
statutes.  Not in the National Prosecuting Authority Act neither in the 
Constitution but the protocol that we have been following over the 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I have extensively 
canvassed this with a number of prosecutors.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The protocol is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Go to the DPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In this instance he 
should have gone to the head of the office Advocate Miller  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Then the DPP.  If they 
were still not satisfied then go to the NDPP.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And I do not have a 
problem with the fact that they had sent it directly to the NDPP’s office 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 11 of 108 
 
to Advocate Mgwebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  My concern is why did 
Advocate Mgwebe deal with the matter instead of referring it back to 
the DPP’s office/My concern is why did Advocate Mgwebe deal with the 
matter instead of referring it back to the DPP’s office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay what we will do I think canvass other 
matters later on see wheth er there is proper basis to come back to the 
question.  Okay let us see whether the other evidence will provide 
anything.  One has got to bear in mind if there are no rules or statutory 
10 
provisions or policies that specify where representations should be 
directed and maybe there is just a practice.  One must also check 
whether there is a discretion to refer or not to refer or whatever and 
what we want to make of it – what is sought to be made of it. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair.  I have just 
got two quick questions in relation to this then.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can ask you to turn to page 
92.  Can you read paragraph 2 into the record please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The complete 
20 
paragraph? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just – not the sub-paragraphs. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just the top paragraph – first 
headliner. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 12 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Okay. 
“In order for this office to meaningfully respond to 
the said representations the prosecutor dealing with 
the matter must please ensure that the following is 
submitted to this office.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry where is that?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  On page 92. 
CHAIRPERSON:  92.  Yes thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it correct then that following 
on from the paragraph 2 there is a list of various points for analysis by 
10 
the prosecutor? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is indeed so 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think going back to w hat we were talking about and 
this is for later on if we look at the issue it may be that Major General 
you want to say nothing more than simply this that it was strange that 
this is how this – these representations were dealt with or that this is 
the person who dealt with them because the practice following and you 
– maybe you say no more than that.  But you will decide if you want to 
say no more than that or whether you want to infer something more.  So 
20 
you – you can just – it depends what you have in mind.  So if you want 
to say something more than that it looks strange or something like that 
then you will say so and then we can – we can look at that and then. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I am happy to 
stay – to proceed. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 13 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To put it that – yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The reason – and as 
Chair will see later on  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There is a whole 
chapter that deals with certain prosecutors at the National Prosecuting 
Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That were always 
invariably involved in these  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
In 
certain 
investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And Advocate Mgwebe 
was one of them  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So this was merely to 
set the tone 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Where I started to 
experience  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BO OYSEN:  For the very first time  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 14 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Some sort of I do not 
want to call it interference in this instance  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But later – later on  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It is clear to me that 
there was definitely interference.  So this is merely setting the tone  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  For what is going to 
happen later on when I discuss the prosecutors.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes okay, okay.  No that is fine.  Thank you.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In that regard could I then also 
just highlight that paragraph 3 on page 92 asks very particular factual 
detailed questions which runs for at least one and a half pa ges, is that 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Then can I ask you to turn to 
page 96 of the same bundle.  It appears to be a document which is 
marked Memorandum.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BO OYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please ident – and it is 
dated sorry 22 January 12 presumably 2012.  It is an eight page 
document.  Can you please identify what this document is?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair this is the 
response I referred to earlier on that was penned by Advocate Bheki 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 15 of 108 
 
Manyathi the prosecutor in the matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And is it your understanding 
that this was in fact the memorandum of response to the letter from 
Advocate Lawrene Mgwebe?  
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
That 
is 
my 
understanding Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then ask you to quickly 
turn to page 103 and read the conclusion into the record?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BO OYSEN:  Chair the conclusion it 
10 
is in paragraph 26. 
“In 
my 
view 
the 
case 
against 
Madhoe 
is 
overwhelming and I recommend that he must be 
indicted in the high court.”  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Do you know what 
is the current employment status  of Advocate Manyathi? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair what I can say 
is I bumped into Advocate Manyathi at the high court in Durban during 
one of our appearances and he actually called me aside.  He sent 
someone to fetch me and we went around t he corner.  And he said to 
20 
me General you know I am not happy with what is happening here he 
said to me.  Because at that time we were being prosecuted.  And he 
indicated to me that his stance in this matter had caused him to be 
overlooked for promotion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 16 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And that he intended 
resigning from the NPA 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which – and I saw him 
a couple of months later on the beachfront and he stopped by and 
showed me his car that he had bought and he had told me that he had 
actually gone into private practiced.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So as far as I know he 
is currently in private practice. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you know whether or not 
whilst Advocate Manyathi was still part of the prosecutorial service 
whether or not he was promoted in any way?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I am being – I 
am testifying now what I have been told by Advocate Manyathi.  He was 
short listed for a promotional post but after he had penned this legal 
opinion he was overlooked for promotion and either removed from the 
post or overlooked for promotion.  The indications were that he was 
going to be promoted.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And what I understood 
from him is that because of his stance in this matter he did not get 
promoted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  There is – there is a limit to where – how far one 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 17 of 108 
 
can go with matters which are based on what someone else has said 
and we just need to tread with care.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  During June 2012 there was a 
change to the encumbrance to the acting DPP p osition.  We are now on 
page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before – I am sorry before we – we got there.  
Advocate Mgwebe requested information from the prosecutor in the 
Madhoe matter and the prosecutor furnished a comprehensive response 
10 
at the end of which he said  there was an overwhelming case against 
Madhoe, Colonel Madhoe.  We should – we should – I want to know 
what happened – what decision if any was taken after that as far as you 
know and what happened out of those representations and so on, do 
you know? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Tell me. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair soon after this 
event a new acting DPP was appointed in KZN Advocate Moipone Noko 
and a month or two I cannot recall exactly how long aft er her 
20 
appointment she withdrew the charges against Panday and Madhoe.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  But you do not – you do not know the 
circumstances you just know that the charges – there was a new 
provincial Director of Public Prosecutions and soon after – after that 
appointment the charges were withdrawn?  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 18 of 108 
 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
That 
is 
- 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you know. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Following the withdrawal of the 
charges can I ask you to turn to page 105 please?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – I am sorry – did you ever enquire in one 
way or another from the NPA what the basis was for the withdrawal of 
the charges? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSE L BOOYSEN:  Chair two significant 
10 
things occurred at the time.  The investigating officer enquired from her 
as to why the charges were withdrawn and she would not respond to 
the investigating officer.  She did not give reasons at that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The second thing is 
the investigating officer reported to me that she did – Advocate Noko 
did not want to return the docket.  So she kept the docket with her.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  For quite a period of 
time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Much later she issued 
a media statement and I do quote that in my affidavit Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That she had 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 19 of 108 
 
withdrawn the charges in the interest of justice or words to that effect 
but that I do have the exact words.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms September will direct you to that part of 
your statement if – when he wants to do that because it would be good 
to know.  And did they stay withdrawn – they have never been 
reinstated, those charges?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I do speak to 
that a bit later on in my statement.  What happened is about two years 
ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I – and in conjunction 
with a journalist had written a book about my what happened to me and 
the book had appeared online I think the Monday and I think that was 
the Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  We were on our way 
to Cape Town to attend the launch of the book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then she told me 
that was now Jessica Pitchford we were both going to Cape Town for 
20 
the release of the book.  And she had just watched the – on the cell 
phone the news.  It was then announced by Advocate Shaun Abrahams 
that Panday and Madhoe would be prosecuted.  I had not heard 
anything about it again until much later when I bumped into another 
journalist in Durban Tania Broughton and she said to me she had seen 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 20 of 108 
 
the lawyer of Panday and Madhoe at the high court and enquired from 
them what they were doing there and he then told her that they were – 
that they had filed a review application for the decision to prosecute 
them and that case referred specifically to the at tempt to bribe me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I do deal with 
that extensively later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Late.  No that is fine.  That is fine.  Thank you.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then by the direction of the 
Chair take you to page 105.  Is that the media statement that you 
10 
referred to earlier? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is the media’s – 
that is right Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This media statement is dated 
3 April 2013 and it is titled “Graft c harges against Panday withdrawn”.  
It appears to have been published on the iol.co.za website.  Can I ask 
you to read the last two paragraphs into the record please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  “Earlier this 
year 
the 
provincial 
prosecution 
boss 
Advocate Moipone Noko instructed that the charges 
20 
against 
him 
and 
supply 
chain 
unit 
police 
Navin Madhoe involving an alleged attempt to bride 
KZN Hawks Head Johan Booysen with R2 million be 
provisionally withdrawn.  She said that while there 
was 
a 
prosecutable 
case 
she 
had 
concerns 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 21 of 108 
 
regarding “justice” based on representations which 
Panday had made and which needed further 
investigation.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then ask you to turn the page 
and read the third short paragraph – sentence rather into the record. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  “But State 
Advocate Dorian Paver said the state could not 
proceed “because of problems regarding their 
preparation of evidence”.”  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So is it to be understood that despite 
10 
all of 
the 
evidence 
that had 
been investigated 
and 
collated 
Advocate Noko shortly after her appointment as the Acting DPP 
withdrew the charges against Colonel  Madhoe and Mr Toshan Panday? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I am not a 
prosecutor and I do not want to pretend that I am a prosecutor.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I have worked 
with prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For more than 30 
20 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  After I joined the 
detectives more than 30 years ago.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 22 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think I am in a 
position to more or less say when there is at least a prima facie case 
and a prosecutable case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
In 
this 
particular 
instance Chair every conceivable type of evidence is in that docket.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Physical evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I.e. fingerprints. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Act 70 interceptions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  A 252A authorisation 
by the DPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Eyewitness 
statements how the money was put in the boot of my car.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There is even a bank 
20 
note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In the notes that 
linked with an account of Toshan  Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 23 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The evidence was 
overwhelming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But in spite of the 
overwhelming evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The charges were 
withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and the police officers who were involved in 
arresting Colonel Madhoe who observed what happened in the 
10 
basement on the day in question have at all material times being 
available to give evidence.  I would imagine.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair every single 
witness from the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously you have been available?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes.  Every single 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Had been available all 
along. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
One 
witness 
unfortunately passed away I think now in December.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Len Sheriff. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 24 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But over and above 
that all the witnesses every single one of them are available to testify.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just, you mentioned earlier on - and maybe 
Ms September was still going to deal with that but I just want to know 
now – you mentioned that you learnt at some stage that ap parently 
Mr Panday was bringing a review application in relation to the decision 
to reinstate charges.  Did you ever receive any court application papers 
as an interested party to see that indeed there was a review application 
and you had to deal with it?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I also deal with 
that a bit later on but I can answer you now.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please do. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  What happened is I 
found it strange at the time that there is a review appli cation and I am 
not even aware of it.  I would have at least expected myself to have 
been a co respondent.  Subsequent to that I received a phone call from 
Advocate Mxolisi Nxasana who had informed me that he had seen the 
founding affidavit deposed to by C olonel Navin Madhoe in the review 
application and I cannot remember who favoured me with a copy.  I 
20 
might have gotten it through a journalist and I read the founding 
affidavit and the founding affidavit number one Madhoe lies under oath 
there because he says that he is a witness in the Cato Manor case 
which he is not.  He has never been on the witness list.  He has never 
been a witness but that is not the real problem.  The real problem with 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 25 of 108 
 
the founding affidavit is that it is an attack on Advocate  Nxasana, an 
attack on myself, an attack on Mr  McBride from IPID.  According to the 
founding 
affidavit 
it 
was 
a 
conspiracy 
between 
myself 
and 
Advocate Nxasana to have them re-prosecuted and they also made 
certain allegations against Mr  McBride.  Now the fact that we were not 
co respondents I was expecting Advocate Abrahams to at least deny the 
allegations and ask us for confirmatory affidavits or at least inform us 
to make affidavits to support him in opposing the review application.  
The review application was opposed but the fact that we were kept out 
of the loop tells me that I suspect it was a paper exercise but they 
10 
never intended prosecuting them but what had happened Chair I 
established about probably about two months or three months ago that 
the matter had been struck off the roll. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that matter has been – that review application has 
been pending as far as you know for - for how many years now or from 
when? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair.  It was 
struck of the role now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well I mean you mean the criminal matter or the 
review application? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No – so they took the 
decision to prosecute by Abrahams.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On review.  That was 
– so they must have been informed two years ago when they decided to 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 26 of 108 
 
prosecute them.  They were going to take the matter on review.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So it had been in and 
out of court for a while and about two or three mon ths ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, the criminal matter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No the review matter 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The review matter? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The review matter has been in court a few times .  Is 
10 
that what you are saying?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say it has been struck off the roll?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was struck off the 
roll. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And my understanding 
is that Advocate Wendy O’Brien from the Commercial Crime Court in 
Durban they are preparing to now re -prosecute Madhoe and Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For the attempt to 
bribe me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But Chair at this 
juncture maybe I must just also make it easier to understand.  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 27 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There are different 
cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That we probably – 
that I mention in my. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  My statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The main corruption 
10 
charge of R60 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
case 
was 
declined to prosecute a good couple of years ago.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And when I eventually 
went back to work after my suspension was lifted.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I wrote to the then 
new NDPP Advocate Nxasana. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Giving my views on 
those charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he had appointed 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 28 of 108 
 
Advocate Gerrie Nel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At the NPA Office to 
review all those – all those cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  My understanding is 
and once again I am not officially being informed of this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  My understanding is 
that and this I also learnt through the media.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When it – when it was 
reported that the review matter for the criminal case of attempted 
bribery had been struck off the role the journalists then approached the 
National Prosecuting Authority to ask them why are they now not 
proceeding with that matter and the answer they got was well they are 
waiting for the – for the other matter as well. That is the  60 million one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So that matter had 
also been taken review. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So in my view the 
attempt to bribe me can proceed without t he other matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 29 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is still under 
review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  That then leaves 
us with the last block on the time sheet – timeline sorry.  If I could ask 
you to just turn quickly to EXHIBIT ZC and in particular page 2.  At 
paragraph 6 you document additional evidence relating to the 
Toshan Panday corruption investigation and in particular regarding the 
release of the R15 million.  Can you pl ease inform the Chair about such 
evidence? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
what 
had 
happened is on and off there were attempts to have the 15 million 
released.  Fortunately for myself and unfortunately for Mr  Panday I had 
someone from our Financial Department who would tell me there are 
moves afoot to have the money released.  They devised a number of 
strategies.  For instance they tried to have the money paid out of 
National Office.  They were communicating directly to National Head 
Office.  I do not know whom at National Head Office and at one stage I 
had asked this person and I do not even want to disclose the – the 
gender of this person because that person would be ostracised.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At one stage I had 
been informed – I had asked this person is it possible to have money 
paid out at National Head Office if it is a Provincial matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 30 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I was informed it 
was indeed the case.  So between myself and the Head of Finances at 
the time Brigadier Kemp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  We agreed that that 
person would go in at night and check on the system.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because it would be 
logged at night. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then it would be 
paid out the following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So for a protracted 
period of time I had this person going at night to see if it  was loaded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On the system and if 
it had been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I would have been 
20 
contacted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
that 
I 
could 
prevent the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 31 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To be paid out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I also approached 
General Ntanjana at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The one that passed 
away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
I 
told 
him 
because I know that there - and I managed to get hold of the 
10 
communication between his office and our Legal Department and it was 
clear from that that they were contem plating paying out the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I told him – I said 
to him if you guys are going to pay out this money while it is a subject 
of a corruption investigation you are going to make yourselves guilty of 
corruption as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But Chair that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  What then happened 
is I get a frantic call from a person – well in our engagements with 
Mr Panday’s lawyers they threatened me with all types of things and I 
told them well let us go to court then.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 32 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  If you can prove that 
the state owe you the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I will be happy to 
release the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then it was on 
1 January.  I cannot recall the year.  I got a frantic call from a person 
by the name of Captain Stevens. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I – can I just interject and ask 
10 
you did – did you receive this call before or after Toshan  Panday and 
Colonel Madhoe were arrested? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies.  Not arrested – before or 
after the charges were in fact withdrawn.  Can you recall?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I suspect it was 
after.  I will just have to check the timeline.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There were so many. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Events happening at 
the same time and some of them I only learnt about afterwards.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – buy you think it was after?  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 33 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think it was after 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  After they were arrested or after the 
charge [intervenes]? 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the withdrawal of the charges.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think after they were 
withdrawn. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Please proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair so I got this 
10 
frantic call and I recall vividly I was at the dam on the day.  It was 
1 January with my family and when I left the dam – when I had 
reception on my phone again I saw I had a number of missed calls.  So 
I phoned the person back and it was a Captain  Stevens and he told me 
that he had been approached by Mr  Toshan Panday and Toshan Panday 
wanted him to assist him to have the money released – the R15 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Toshan Panday 
devised a strategy or a plan to have the money released.  So he said to 
Captain Stevens you from police side you must create documents and I 
20 
will create invoices.  So he was going to create invoices for R15 
million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But you cannot just 
send invoices if there was not a service required from the police.  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 34 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So he said to Stevens 
you must fabricate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Call up instructions 
for policeman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  During the soccer – 
World Cup Soccer period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then I will do 
invoices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
To 
match 
those 
figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then we can present 
it and then the idea was then that Booysen would b e happy to release 
the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
immediately 
on 
1 January phoned Captain Pelser once again.  I said to him get us 252A 
authority which he did and I told  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I just interrupt yo u again?  Just 
clarify again what Section 252A is.  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 35 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
my 
understanding of 252A authority it is the Criminal Procedure Act.  It 
authorises an ostensible illegal act.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And we normally use 
those in sting operations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you very much. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair we had this 
252 authority and having had experience of how they operated I called 
in the investigators and I said to them you need to do – not that they 
10 
had not done it previously but I wanted to ensure that everything was 
done according to the book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
enlisted 
the 
assistance of Crime Intelligence and there were  subsequent meetings 
between Mr Toshan Panday and Captain Stevens.  There were probably 
about 19.  Of the 19 about six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Meetings?  19 meetings? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is – that is 
correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the two? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Between the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So we had Stevens 
wired every time he met Panday. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 36 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  With a camera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And a recorder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So the recordings 
were audio and visual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So there – over these 
number of meetings 16 of them were  recorded audibly and visually. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At one stage Stevens 
had a problem switching on the camera and.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
particular 
meeting was not recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But every time that 
they met he would report there before the time to the investigators.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It would be reported 
to the DPP dealing the 252A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And during some of 
these meetings Panday was getting anxious becue Stevens was working 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 37 of 108 
 
too slowly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And Stevens was 
making excuses by saying well there are people  who need to cooperate 
from supply chain management.  So Panday at one stage gave Stevens 
R2 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  As a bribe to be paid 
to one of the people at supply chain management.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But Stevens came 
back with the money.  We took the money.  Put it in an exhibit bag and 
it was kept as an exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
At 
a 
subsequent 
meeting Panday once again complained that Steve ns was taking too 
long.  So Stevens said to him well look some of these documents have 
to be signed by a Brigadier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Now the person in 
20 
charge of deployment at the time was a Brigadier  Vernon Hunter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Madhoe says to 
him but you have to – well then you have to forge his signature.  Now 
Chair there was a previous matter completely unrelated to this that 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 38 of 108 
 
Panday had been involved in but completely unrel ated to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was a civil matter in 
which he had put in false claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the – when we did 
the Act 70s we picked up on the Act 70s that a coupl e of million Rand 
was going to be paid out to him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that there was a 
10 
problem with the claim.  So we enforced – informed the insurers and in 
that particular instance what he had done was he had cut a nd paste the 
signature of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Of 
a 
deceased 
person.  So he tells Stevens when you forge these signatures do not 
cut and paste.  You must make different ones.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So it looks authentic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  We then went to – as 
part of the 252A operation went to Brigadier  Vernon Hunter and we told 
him look this is what is going on.  Your signature is going to be forged.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which he agreed to. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 39 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On the particular day 
that that was done we had the LCRC.  That is the local fingerprint 
office come to – to the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in their presence 
each document that had been created by Stevens was photographed 
before the signature was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Placed thereon and 
10 
then afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
Hunter 
was 
present as well where his signature was forged as part of the 252A 
operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
what 
also 
happened is in this process Panday was getting quite frantic because 
Stevens was taking too long.  So Stevens said to him well you know I 
have to print this stuff and Panday then – they were close to Gateway 
20 
then.  I cannot remember whether he had gone there himself.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Or sent someone to 
buy a – a computer and a printer from Dions and he gave him the whole 
bag with the computer and printer and everything with the receipt still 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 40 of 108 
 
inside there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Stevens came 
back and he handed that over to us as well.  That was also handed in 
as exhibits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair this continued 
for a period of time and eventually there was enough evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To arrest Panday once 
10 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
He 
was 
arrested 
eventually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He appeared in court 
but unfortunately that case ha d also been withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By – and do you know who made the decision to 
withdraw this time? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair this time I think 
20 
there might be – and I do not want to cover me up for the prosecutor.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I think there might 
be a little bit of a valid explanation from the prosecutor’s side.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 41 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To give them the 
benefit of the doubt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  A number of these 
recordings had to be transcribed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I think it was a 
White person who had done the transcriptions and.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There if you do not 
10 
live in Durban and if you do not know the language how the Indians talk 
you might. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  You might get it 
wrong.  So because I could see from the transcriptions it was an 
Afrikaans person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who had transcribed 
it.  So the prosecutor was not happy with that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  What subsequently 
happened to that case it was sent – at a later stage I will talk about 
that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can just interrupt you and ask you 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 42 of 108 
 
to turn to page 3 and please identify who was the actual – apologies – 
page 3 of ZC.  On the top of page 3 you were informed that the charges 
were provisionally withdrawn.  Please identify who the prosecutor was.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
They 
were 
provisionally withdrawn by Advocate  Dorian Paver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair much later when 
I – and I will speak to this later on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
When 
Mr McBride 
10 
started investigating all these issues.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I handed the docket 
over to IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  My understanding was 
that they had – and I speak under correction – that they had the 
recordings transcribed again - once again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But to date no one 
20 
has appeared in that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In court.  Hm, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To your knowledge has the R15 
million been paid to Mr  Toshan Panday? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair before I respond 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 43 of 108 
 
to that I just want to add when the invoices that Panday eventually 
created the understanding is that we owed – well according to him we 
owed him R50 million but if my memory services me correctly the 
invoices that they eventually created amounted to R70 million.  Chair 
as far as I am aware to date that R50 million has not been paid out.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then take you to page 18 - 1-8 
– of your affidavit?  It is at this juncture that you deal with additional 
investigations that you were involved in.  Perhaps not in as much detail 
as the Toshan Panday investigation and in that regard the next 
10 
investigation that you deal with in your affidavit is one which you have 
titled the “Amigos” case.  In very simple terms please explain what this 
“Amigos” case concerned. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair what happened 
is when – when the Hawks were established they combined Commercial 
Crime, Organised Crime and the Scorpions.  That was an interim 
arrangement and they then formed the Hawks.  So I inheri ted - for lack 
of a better description – the investigation from the Commercial Crime 
Section.  There was this one investigation that was known as the 
“Amigos” case which related to the fraudulent acquisition of water 
20 
purification plants for hospitals.  I k now in KZN and a few other 
provinces as well.  There were a number of accused.  One of them – a 
prominent accused in this matter was a Mr  Gaston Savoi.  I think he 
was a Bulgarian businessman and he was charged inter alia with two 
politicians – Mike Mabuyakhulu and Peggy Nkonyeni.  They were both 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 44 of 108 
 
part – members of the legislature in KwaZulu-Natal at some time or 
other. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can just interrupt for the record 
can you please spell Peggy  Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Nkonyeni is N-K-O-Y-
E-N-I (spelt) and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There will be an N before the Y. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is an N for Nellie before Y.  I think you omitted 
the N.  N-K-O-N-Y-E-N-I. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mabuyakhulu is M-A-B-U-Y-A-K-H-U-L-U. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is here.  You can even just give the 
spelling yourself Ms  September. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair they were 
among the accused – Mr Savoi and Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.  What 
happens on a monthly basis - I will call the investigators and then they 
20 
have to give feedback es pecially on the high profile cases and the 
investigating 
officer 
in 
this 
particular 
matter 
was 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Piet du Plooy.  So the investigation had already been in an 
advanced stage when Du Plooy came over to me.  So I was not privy to 
the extent of the evidence in the docket but nevertheless Chair 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 45 of 108 
 
Du Plooy then reported to me that the then Acting DPP in KZN 
Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa there was pressure on him to withdraw 
the charges against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.  So I said to him Piet 
what does the evidence look like and he said to me no sir there is – 
there is a solid case.  I never – I never physically checked the dockets 
but he assured me that there was a solid case and I said to him what is 
the position of Mr Mlotshwa in the matter – Advocate Mlotshwa and he 
said no Mlotshwa is proceeding with the matter.  He is – he is going 
ahead full steam.  So I was happy with that.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Are you aware as to 
10 
whether or not a forensic investigation was conducted in this parti cular 
matter? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am aware Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Who 
conducted 
that 
forensic 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  If my memory serves 
me correctly it was also Pricewaterhouse Cooper.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Are you aware of any particular 
events relating to the involvement of Pricewaterhouse Cooper’s and the 
prosecutors involved – and prosecutors involved in this matter?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
Colonel 
du Plooy had reported to me at some stage that he and one of the 
forensic auditors had been summoned to Pretoria by Advocates  Mrwebi 
and Mosing and the meeting was about this particular investigation and 
I can recall when they had come back that Du  Plooy was unhappy.  I did 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 46 of 108 
 
not go into the detail of the – of what had occurred at the meeting but 
they conveyed to me that when they arrived there that it was clear to 
them that there was a notion that there is no evidence against Nkonyeni 
and Mabuyakhulu and I think it was Du  Plooy who still said well to 
either of the two advocates – either Mosing or Mrwebi.  It looks as if 
you have made up your mind already to - to not proceed and he 
basically excused himself from the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So he must have felt quite very – quite strongly? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Du Plooy did feel 
strong about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You said that you inherited this 
matter.  In what year did  you inherit the matter?  If I could take you to 
paragraph 58 [intervenes]. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ja Chair that – that 
was when I became the Head of the Hawks in 2010.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and in paragraph 61 which is at 
20 
page 19 of your affidavit you document what the current status is or 
rather what the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms September.  Let us – the two 
investigators went to see Advocate  Mrwebi? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair.  It was the 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 47 of 108 
 
investigator Lieutenant Colonel  Piet du Plooy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
the 
forensic 
investigator from the audit company.  I cannot recall.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Yes [intervenes]. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who that person was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  They did – ja, the investigator plus the 
person from the forensic investigation team?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They went to see Advocate Mrwebi. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And Advocate Mosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Advocate Mosing. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Anthony Mosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the report you got was that the two 
advocates were saying that there was no evidence against Mr 
Mabuyokhulu and Ms Nkonyeni.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It was a verbal report 
that I received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, a verbal report that you’ve got ja.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes, and the way I’ve 
20 
articulated that in my statement is that they went a long with the notion 
that the evidence was not sufficient to proceed against those two 
whereas du Plooy felt that there was enough evidence and that’s why 
he said to the Advocate it looks like you’ve made your mind up already.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, now what I want to find out is what 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 48 of 108 
 
happened subsequent to that meeting, what happened to, is there any 
decision that was taken by Advocate Mrwebi and Advocate Mosing or 
pursuant to those views that they expressed according to what you 
were told? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair not by the two 
of them but there was a ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a change of leadership?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There was a 
significant change on leadership in KZN when Advocate Simphiwe 
Mlotshwa was unceremoniously pushed aside in my view and replaced 
10 
by Advocate Moipone Noko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Advocate Mlotshwa had been acting Provincial 
Director of Public Prosecutions. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s correct Chair 
the appointed DPP at the time was the current NDPP, Advocate Shamila 
Batohi who had then gone to The Hague and and to the International 
Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Advocate Simphiwe 
Mlotshwa was appointed as the acting and at this juncture he was 
20 
relieved of his duties and replaced by Advocate Moipone Noko  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and the replacement was it on an acting basis?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Also on an acting 
basis Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright, thank you. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 49 of 108 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  You have just 
mentioned about the change in leadership, I’m not quite certain if you 
dealt with this part, but have – what in fact happened shortly after the 
change in leadership? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair exactly two 
weeks, exactly two weeks after Advocate Moipone Noko took up her 
post she would do the charges against only two people of a number of 
accused, Mabuyakhulu and Peggy  Nkonyeni, and I still asked I think it 
was Mr P du Plooy Colonel du Plooy how muc h evidence is there and I 
think someone still made the statement if she had really gone through 
10 
the evidence that there was it would have been equivalent of reading a 
bible per day for 14 days.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm.  So he seems to have shared the view that  you 
mentioned earlier on that somebody said there was overwhelming 
evidence or was that in regard to the other case of Madhoe, I thought 
you said somebody, I don’t whether Mhlotwa or somebody said there 
was overwhelming evidence but I may be confusing the  Amigo case with 
the Madhoe case. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No, no in the Madhoe 
case it was my view, in this matter it was the view of Lt Col du Plooy 
20 
who reported to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He was confident that 
they had a strong case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay.  And from what he told you Advocate 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 50 of 108 
 
Mhlotwa was confident as well?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is Advocate Noko who withdrew the 
charges against those two particular individuals in this case the same 
Advocate Noko who withdrew the charges against Colonel Madhoe and 
Mr Thoshan Panday? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The withdrawal of the charges against Mr Panday and 
Colonel Madhoe it did also happen after Advocate Noko had replaced 
10 
Advocate Mhlotwa? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair, within two 
weeks after Advocate Noko taking up a post as acting DPP she 
withdrew the charges against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then I think about 
two or three months later she withdrew the charges against Panday and 
Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Madhoe, okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Are you aware General Booysen 
20 
whether or not there was a change to the prosecutor who was assigned 
to this particular case?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair obviously the 
investigator is giving me feedback I knew who the advocates  were that 
were dealing with the matter so the advocate that dealt with the matter 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 51 of 108 
 
at that stage was Advocate Ndunjwa.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL 
BOOYSEN :  He was the 
prosecutor, this investigation had a number of legs there was one in t he 
Eastern Cape that I recall and we had the KZN leg, and Advocate 
Ndunjwa from the DPP’s office in KZN he was dealing with the matter, 
and I know for a fact that Advocate Ndunjwa also felt strongly about the 
case and after the charges were withdrawn the d ocket was taken away 
from him and handed over to Advocate Wimbane from the Commercial 
Crimes Court in Durban. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  What is the current status of the 
criminal matter against the two individuals whom you have mentione d, 
such being Peggy Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair as far as I know 
there was at one stage a review application in the High Court in 
Pietermaritzburg and I cannot recall who brought it, it could have been 
the DA, I don’t know what that was about, and I've also been informed 
by the investigating officer that Mr Gaston Savoy, I suspect that he 
wants to bring an application for a permanent stay of prosecution and I 
20 
don’t want to speculate, I’m merely talking from what  I’ve heard from 
the investigators because his argument is why are they withdrawing 
charges against those two and not against the rest of the accused, but 
I do not know the detail of that matter, but as it stands ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The prosecution has never been pursued even against 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 52 of 108 
 
those other accused who – against whom now withdrawal happened?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No I think it’s 
proceeding Chair against those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it’s proceeding against those.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  As far as I’m aware 
it’s still on the roll. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just to make sure I too understand 
it’s proceeding against all other accused other than Peggy Nkonyeni 
and Mike Mabuyakhula against whom th e charges were withdrawn?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  That then takes us to the 
next investigation that you deal with in your affidavit, from page 19 
paragraph 62 to 74, this particular invest igation you have marked as 
looting of the secret services account.  Is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you start with that just to go back on the 
Amigos case that’s been pending for a long time and did you say it was 
roundabout 2010 or thereabout when it started, as far as you know?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I was appointed 
20 
as the head of the Hawks in KZN in 2010, and I think that case when I 
inherited it with Du Plooy being the investigating officer it could have 
been a year prior to that, or even more, but I cannot recall.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So certainly when you were appointed in 2010 it was 
already pending? 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 53 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the sense of it being under investigation with no 
appearance in court already, or do you think there had been 
appearance in court already by the time you were appointed?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair when I was 
appointed by then I can recall  they had the – all the accused sitting 
there in the box, there’s a newspaper photograph and that’s where the 
name Amigos came from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So when I inherited 
10 
Du Plooy with his investigation that al ready appeared a number of 
times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to say the list it’s been going on you would say no 
less than nine years? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I would even say ten 
years Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or even ten years.  And as far as you know are  you 
able to say or maybe you are not able because you might not have 
looked at the evidence, are you able to say roundabout when as far as 
you know there was enough evidence for the trial to proceed?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair when I – when 
Du Plooy came over to me from Commercial Crime what I did not 
mention is prior to them coming over to me I was a Brigadier in charge 
of Organised Crime and my counterpart for Commercial Crime was 
Lategan, Brigadier Lategan.  Now once every quarter or eve ry now and 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 54 of 108 
 
again we had to – the two of us had now to go and give feedback 
pertaining to our investigations to the person who was then my 
immediate supervisor, Commissioner Pat Brown, General Pat Brown 
and I could recall, although I did not take much notic e of Lategan’s 
feedback but I could recall that there was discussions between him and 
Brown that they were getting questions from I think it was the Portfolio 
Committee, I’m not too sure because I did not really pay attention to 
his cases, because it didn’t concern me at that time, where questions 
were asked about the detail of the investigation, and I recall that Brown 
always used to say to Lategan just give them the necessary, the case 
10 
has been remanded, or still under investigation, but when I – when Du 
Plooy came over to me by then the investigation was complete and I 
say this Chair for the following reason, they were charged for 
racketeering ,now in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act I 
think it’s Section 21, you can only prosecute a person f or racketeering 
if there’s an authorisation by the NDPP, so the NDPP would not have 
authorised that investigation if it had not been completed, so in my 
view when Du Plooy came over to me with his investigation and having 
already having been – having appeared in court, as far as I’m 
concerned the investigation was complete.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that’s fine.  I do seem to remember that 
there may have been a case involving Mr Savoy, which went up to the 
Constitutional 
Court, 
it 
may 
have 
had 
something 
to do 
w ith 
...(intervention)  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair I know about 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 55 of 108 
 
that, Mr Savoy they applied to the Constitutional Court to say that 
certain aspects of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act were 
unconstitutional, I actually attended that p articular case at the 
Constitutional Court but I cannot remember the phrase but they say it 
was an academic argument, they should wait for such a case to come 
and then argue it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I think I remember that case because I would 
have sat in the matter, but that might be part of the reason for the 
delay in the finalisation of the matter if there was a challenge to the 
statutes that might be part of the reason for the delay.  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That could be Chair 
but I think that matter had been disposed of ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  A long time ago. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  About seven years 
ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, thank you.  I think let’s take the short 
adjournment, and we will resume at half past ele ven.  We adjourn. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Major General Booysen yesterday I intimated that we 
might use two hours today to hear your further evidence.  Two hours 
would take us to twelve o’cl ock.  Is it fine with you if we go up to half 
past twelve? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I am in your 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 56 of 108 
 
hands. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you very much.  
Thank you.  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Just before 
the adjournment we were about to start on the next investigation that 
you were involved in and that takes us to page 19 of your affidavit 
which is in bundle ZA and in particular paragraph 62.  You have titled 
or rather named the investigation Looting of the Secret Services 
Accounts.  In very simple terms can you please explain what this 
investigation concerned?  
10 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
Chair 
this 
investigation related to the abuse of the Secret Services Accounts.  The 
Secret Services Account is monies that must be utilised by crime 
intelligence for covert operations specifically for organised crime.  The 
Secret Services Account is not – is not being audited in the similar 
fashion as the open account is being audited.  Although there are 
committees at parliament that have – that has oversight over their 
budget.  But be that as it may some time ago and I cannot recall the 
exact period this – the whistle blower in this whole matter was a person 
by the name of General Mark Hankel from Crime Intelli gence who wrote 
20 
a report about how this fund was being abused by individuals within 
Crime Intelligence.  And at the time I think General Dramat was the 
head of the HAWKS the national head and he appointed Colonel Kobus 
Roelofse from the Western Cape who I would describe as the Chief 
Investigator in the looting of the Secret Services Account.  That 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 57 of 108 
 
investigation pointed fingers towards the then head of the divisional 
commissioner of crime intelligence Luietenant General Richard Mdluli.  
So that investigation had been going on for quite a while and I also 
know at the particular juncture within that investigation that General 
Shadrack Sibiya from Gauteng had also reopened the – an investigation 
into the murder of a person.  I think it was in Vosloosrus I cannot  recall 
exactly where – in which it was alleged that Richard Ndluli also had a 
hand in.  That investigation I am not privy to that investigation although 
a lot of reporting about that had been done in the media.  But where my 
involvement comes in is at a m uch later stage when this investigation 
10 
had been initiated the then acting National Commissioner at the time 
from the police General Mkwanazi.  I do not know whether he had been 
informed by sources within Crime Intelligence but he instituted a 
separate leg of investigations relating to the abuse of the Secret 
Services Account in KwaZulu Natal.  I had a Brigadier at some point 
who worked with me in KwaZulu Natal Brigadier Simon Madonsella.  He 
is not related.  I was – being asked the question but he is not r elated to 
Thuli Madonsella the Advocate.  So his wife had taken ill and he asked 
for a transfer to Pretoria which I arranged for him.  When he arrived in 
Pretoria one of the first investigations they allocated to him I think it 
20 
was allocated to him by General Mothiba was to investigate the case at 
[indistinct] of the looting of the Secret Services Account by Crime 
Intelligence.  I recall Madonsella coming to me expressing his 
frustration because Crime Intelligence failed or refused to make certain 
documents available to him to – to assist in the investigation.  So I – 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 58 of 108 
 
he would often come to me in Durban because we had – we were quite 
close and we are still close. And I would say to him, Simon the best 
way to get these documents is to – to 205 it and just for  – to explain 
205 again.  It is Section 205 subpoena in terms of The Criminal 
Procedure Act whereby we obtain documents from institutions or 
individuals that can assist us in our investigation.  And he would 
continuously say to me no they promised they wou ld give it to him and 
then he would come back and say no they frustrating him.  And I recall 
at one juncture they came to  my house and they showed me the 
dockets and I asked Brigadier Madonsella if I could make copies of the 
10 
dockets and he said to me no I cannot make copies of the dockets. And 
I asked him if he would mind if I take notes from the dockets.  He said 
no that is fine. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I just interrupt you there 
for a second?  Is it then our understanding – is then your evidenc e 
sorry that you assisted Brigadier Madonsella?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In his investigation in relation 
to the KZN arm of the looting of the Secret Services Accounts?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right Chair. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  So were you formally involved 
in the process? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No I was not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you – you said they came to you one of them 
was Mr Madonsella and who else was – was with him when you asked if 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 59 of 108 
 
you could make copies of those documents?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair there were three 
people well two of them I knew very well.  It was Brigadier Simon 
Madonsella and then there was another person as well as Lieute nant 
Zungu and they also had working with them a Captain Heerlal.  Heerlal 
was from Pretoria and Zungu and Madonsella originated from KZN.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The documents that they came to show you were they 
documents that they had obtained by following your a dvice? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  At that juncture Chair 
they were all affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And some documents, 
police documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And Chair I made – I 
wrote down.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made notes – you made notes 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I made notes.  I wrote 
20 
down the name of each witness in that – of each statement that – that 
was filed in the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I would write down 
and if it was a police person I would write his or her persel number 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 60 of 108 
 
down so it would be easy to locate them afterwards.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And if it was a private 
person I would write his contact details down and then I would just 
write a little [indistinct] of the witness or person said in his statement.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I just at this juncture take 
you to page 131 of your affidavit please?  Not of your affidavit of 
bundle ZA.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it 131 of Exhibit ZA?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair those are my 
contemporaries hand written notes a copy thereof.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please proceed then to 
just explain as you were explaining the order of what you had 
documented and the nature of its contents?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair that is 
basically what I did.  I made a short praisee of what each witness said 
and I kept those notes. It was common cause in KZN especially 
20 
amongst the Crime Intelligence Fraternity that Brigadier Simon 
Madonsella and myself were just more than colleagues we were 
actually personal friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I know his children, 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 61 of 108 
 
he know my children, he visits me, I visit him etcetera.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And he would frequent 
my office and they knew that I was assisting him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And advising – not 
assist him but advising him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In this particular 
matter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  This thing carried on 
about having these documents provided to him from Crime Intelligence.  
So eventually he took up my advice and he applied for a Section 205 
subpoenas which were granted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And I recall him 
coming to my office and saying to me he is going to court now.  That 
particular morning the magistrate had made a ruling that they must 
submit the dockets and he was very excited that he was eve ntually 
20 
going to get those dockets to formalise his investigations.  And then the 
next moment he left for court and the next moment about an hour later 
he phones me.  And I said to him – we call each other Mfoytu.  I said to 
him Mfoytu where are you now?  He says, no I am on my way back to 
Pretoria.  I said, I thought you at court.  He says no when they arrived 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 62 of 108 
 
at court a senior officer from Crime Intelligence had come to court and 
told the magistrate that there was an agreement of some sorts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But it is not necessary 
any longer for the documents to be released.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL 
BOOYSEN :  So Brigadier 
Madonsella got into his car and he drove back to Pretoria.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So he phones me 
10 
back from Pretoria and he says to me – he is very upset now because – 
I said to him what happened?  He says no when he arrived at Pretoria 
he went to General Mothiba’s office and he was told to hand over  all 
the dockets, all fifteen dockets to General Mothiba.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He then said to me 
Mothiba said to him well this is an instruction from the National 
Commissioner at the time Ria Phiyega, General Ria Phiyeg a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And I think he still 
20 
said to me that Mothiba had told him he can clarify this with General 
Godfrey Lebeya who is the current head of the HAWKS.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Simon got into his 
car according to him and he went to General Lebeya and General 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 63 of 108 
 
Lebeya confirmed that General Phiyega had given an instruction that 
those dockets must be taken away from him.  I recalled sometime 
afterwards I was in his…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry the instruction as you understood it from 
General Phiyega was that the docket that Brigadier Madonsella had in 
regard to this investigation should be taken away from him.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is what 
Madonsella told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that amount to saying he must not continue 
with the investigation if that docket was taken away or there may have 
been different dockets he could still continue with the i nvestigation. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No.  No General – 
Chair it was taken away from him and that was not the first time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because on a 
previous occasion those dockets had been taken away f rom him and I 
cannot recall the exact details and it was sent to the Inspector General.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And I remember there 
was a fallout in the media about the dockets being sent to the Inspector 
General and now my view is the Inspector General cannot adjudicate 
upon dockets.  That has got to go to the prosecuting authority.  But be 
that as it may I think Simon told me it was either six weeks or three 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 64 of 108 
 
months that those dockets were – were with the Inspector General a nd 
they were eventually returned to him with not a single entry made in 
those dockets.  So he proceeded up until the time he applied for the 
205’s and then he was called back and for the second time the dockets 
were taken away from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And according to him 
what he was informed by General Mothiba and General Lebeya that 
those were on the instructions of General Ria Phiyega.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But now they were taken away from by whom 
10 
and where were they taken to?  Do you know? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair they were taken 
away – physically taken away from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And they were handed 
over according to Madonsella and a person that for a whil e still 
remained on the investigation they were handed to Captain Heerlal.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And I do speak about 
Heerlal a bit later on Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Because there was 
some developments later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which also became 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 65 of 108 
 
very suspicious to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But the point I am 
making Chair is that this is a high level inves tigation.  It is allocated to 
a Brigadier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Who is doing what he 
has to do.  It gets taken away from him and then handed over to a less 
experienced investigating officer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was much more experienced than the person 
10 
that was given the dockets?  So he was much more experienced than 
the person that was given the dockets?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I would say if 
you can – if I can draw a parallel Madonsella would have been like a 
SC and Heerlal was like a junior lawyer who finished university.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay.  Okay alright thank you.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I recall a while 
after that there was some investigation about those dockets.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And Brigadier 
20 
Madonsella was visiting me at my son’s house in Pretoria.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And they received a 
phone call and I can understand a little bit of Zulu.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 66 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So – but I could hear 
he was very annoyed.  So he put the phone down and I said to him, 
what was that about Simon?  He said to me, no he was phoned legal 
services they now need a statement from him about what had o ccurred 
there.  And he said to me General I am gatvol and he told this person 
he is not going to make a statement.  I said but Simon make a 
statement.  He said but who is back me up?  I say I can guarantee you 
General Lebeya will back you up.  He says but I do not have Lebeya’s 
number.  I have him General Lebeya’s number I said speak to General 
Leberya.  So he phoned General Lebeya, the current head of the 
10 
HAWKS and Lebeya confirmed with him on the phone that he will – he 
will support him.  He will make a statement that it was indeed General 
Phiyega who instructed that those dockets be taken away from him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair then much later 
when Mr McBride came on board he got to know about those dockets.  
So he approached me and asked me would it be possible for me to get 
hold of those dockets.  I said well look I can try.  So through my 
contacts I made enquiries and Zungu was also part of the investigation.  
I do not know whether they approached Heerlal or be  that as it may he 
20 
said no they will see what they can do.  And then a week or so later 
Zungu came to me with – with what was supposed to be copies of the 
dockets.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But when I saw him 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 67 of 108 
 
approaching me I realised there was something wrong because I knew 
the volume of the docket before and what he – he was bringing to me 
on face value was less than I had seen previously.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I went through the 
statements and compared it with – with my list and every single witness 
who implicated Richard Mdluli and a number of other officers all those 
statements were removed from the docket or from – they were not part 
of the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So whether it was 
taken out by Heerlal or whether it was taken out by someone else I do 
now know but every single statement that incriminates Richard Mdluli 
and other senior officers were sanitized from the docket.  
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I then made an 
affidavit describing as I described to Chair now the circumstances.  And 
I listed each witness and what they more or less said and I handed that 
with a copy of my [indistinct] notes to Mr McBride.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I suspect that they 
still busy with that investigation Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  How long ago was that when you handed that 
over to Mr McBride? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I would say 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 68 of 108 
 
about eighteen months ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But in between I have 
been engaging with Mr McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But between him and 
myself then we suspended, then he is suspended, then I a m back and 
then he is suspended again.  And then when he gets back I will enquire 
from him.  Then he tells me no things have gone missing out I will 
testify later on about an Exhibit.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That I handed to him 
in a very, very serious matter that after when he returned from work he 
phoned me and he said to me, he calls me chief and I call him boss.  
He said Chief that exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he told us I think last week when it was – he was 
called for the first time Boss. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but he did not say it was you it was somebody 
else. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No we come from the 
same area in Durban.  He is from Wentworth and I am from 
Amanzimtoti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So we grew up on the 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 69 of 108 
 
wrong side of Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So he said to me hey 
Chief have you got – have you still got a copy of this – this recording?  
And I said no I do and I said what happened to the one I gave you?  He 
said no while he was suspended when he got back it had gone missing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I – I do not know 
what happened to those fifteen dockets the investigations regarding 
that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I have not spoken to 
him recently about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it correct then that you do 
not conclusively know the reason for why the statements incriminating 
Richard Mdluli and other police officials were not included in the bundle 
of documents you received?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do not Chair.  I can 
only speculate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  All you are saying is you found it strange that 
documents of witnesses that you – I mean statements of witnesses that 
you had seen which incriminated a particular individual were all now 
not there in the file when you saw it?  That is what you are saying.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is true Chair and 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 70 of 108 
 
something I omitted to tell you.  There were also correspondence which 
I saw in the dockets and it was correspondence from a General Godfrey 
Lebeya who at that time was a Deputy National Commissioner in which 
he gave certain instructions, those were copies of those instructions 
that there should be an investigation against Richard Mdluli and there 
were a whole list and I think I might have listed some of the names.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL B OOYSEN:  Of People that had 
been promoted in terms of the Secret Services Account.  So what they 
do Chair if there is a covert investigation they take a profile of a 
10 
particular individual if it is for instance in a drug related matter – I will 
identify a policeman say in the Western Cape that fits a profile of a 
drug dealer.  I will recruit that policeman and he resigns from the 
police.  They take him off the system.  He then becomes an agent.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So everyone thinks he 
has left the police but in the meantime he is an agent.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So what they did with 
the – in the Secret Services Account they would appoint people like 
20 
that as agents.  Some of them I think so me of them had never even 
seen the inside of a police station but all of a sudden they now agents 
and some of them were promoted as far as I know up to the rank of 
Colonel and I know individuals that still hold the rank of Colonel who 
had been promoted in terms of the Secret Services Account.  So that is 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 71 of 108 
 
how they abused it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm,  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then take you to page 
20 of your affidavit and in particular paragraph 64.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Sorry? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  So it is page 20 of your 
affidavit paragraph 64.  Can you please inform the – or rather your 
evidence in your affidavit focusses on one particular example in 
relation to the looting of the Secret Services Accounts?  Can you  
please inform this commission of this particular example you refer to 
10 
and why it – why this particular example was so important to highlight?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair one of the 
transactions that at some juncture had been investigated wa s a fence 
that was built around the residence of the then Minister of Police 
Minister Nathi Mthethwa to the amount of R195  581,45.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Where was this fence built?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It was built around his 
private residence I think around about Empangeni Chair.  Now Chair at 
the time when the looting of the Secret Services Account surfaced it 
was reported that the fence had been paid for through the Secret 
20 
Services Account, their funds.  And it common cause at t he time 
because it had been reported in the media that the matter had been 
investigated by the Auditor General at the time who exonerated the 
then Minister of Police.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who had investigated?  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 72 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The Auditor General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But Chair in my view 
and I have – I am including documentation in my statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The understanding 
was that the Minister at the time w as unaware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Now subsequent to 
that there was an engagement with …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – I am sorry the – as you understand it the – the 
idea was that the Minister was unaware of what?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of where – that the 
money had come from the Secret Services Account.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair if I can 
digress a little bit.  Recently there was a radio interview between 
myself and Karima Brown  from 702. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Where I mentioned 
20 
this and no sooner had I arrived home the Minister – the then Minister 
Nathi Mthethwe had made contact with Karima Brown from 702 and said 
to her that I am clasping at stra ws and I am basically – he basically 
said that I am not talking the truth.  So she invited me back to the 
studio the following evening because she said she would invite the 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 73 of 108 
 
Minister.  So I said – she asked me if I would come so I said well tell 
the Minister I will meet him the studio tonight.  I went back to the 
studio he did not pitch.  So they did a radio interview with him.  Now 
during that radio interview he once again said that I am clasping at 
straws and he explained that as Minister he was entitled t o security 
upgrades at his house in terms of the Ministerial Handbook.  And that 
the Ministerial Handbook says that he can get security upgrades to 
R100 000,00 and he was unaware that they overspent.  The point I am 
making Chair is I went and I had a look at this – at the Ministerial 
Handbook.  According to the Ministerial Handbook he is entitled.  The 
10 
Minister is entitled but it must be at his request number 1.  Secondly 
there must be a risks assessment and then thirdly the Department of 
Works will then deal with the matter.  And the Ministerial Handbook is 
clear it says security upgrades up to the amount of R100,000,00.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Any amount in excess 
of that will be for the account of the office bearer.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I interrupt you there then 
and take you to excerpts of that Ministerial Handbook you refer to 
which is at page – starts at page 113.  Thank you.  Is it correct that 
20 
these are extracts of the Ministerial Handbook that you were refe rring 
to? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  They are Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I ask you to please turn to 
page 115 and read only the first sentence into the record?  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 74 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“This handbook is a guideline for benefits and 
privileges to which Ministers and their families are 
entitled in execution of their duties.”  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In correction to your reading it 
is not Ministers but members. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Sorry, sorry Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is that correct?  Can I then ask 
you to turn to page 117 please?  Is it correct that member at the top is 
defined to include a minister?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It does Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it also correct that National 
members means minister, a minister amongst others?  
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
That 
is 
my 
understanding Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And in the definition of private 
residence which is the sixth definition it is d efined to me in a privately 
owned house, is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then take you to page 
20 
118.  This document is titled Annexure E and named Policy on Security 
Measures at the Private Residences of public office bearers.  Can you 
please read the first – the first line beginning with the word cabinet and 
then paragraphs 1 and 2 into the record please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 75 of 108 
 
“Cabinet approved on the 11 June 20 03 the following 
provisions of the above policy.  The Minister of 
Public Works may approve a state contribution of a 
non-recoverable maximum amount of R100  000,00 or 
the total cost of security measures not exceeding 
R100 000,00.  Should the cost of the sec urity 
measures be more than R100  000,00 the difference 
shall be borne by the Public Office Bearer.”  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then at page 120.  Can I 
ask you to read paragraph 11 into the record please?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Security measures may be implemented at Public 
Office Bearers private residences occupied on a 
regular basis in the areas other than Cape Town or 
Pretoria.” 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you know where the private 
residence of Minister Nathi Mthethwe is situ ated which benefited from 
the building of a fence?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It is in the area of 
Empangeni Chair. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And it is correct 
that your testimony was that the cost of the fence exceeded 
R100,000,00? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That was my evidence

ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Ought the – or rather – where 
was the funds for the payment of the building of a fence ought to have 
secured from? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
it 
is 
my 
understanding that it should have at least have come from an open 
account and not from the Secret Services account.  That is the first 
call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Secondly it should 
have come in my view from the Parliamentary Budget. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Or then secondly the 
police’s budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Via the Department of 
Works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then the Act says 
I think it is R193 000 should have been borne by the officer bearer 
which was the Minister at the time.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you say the source of the funding was the 
wrong source.  The amount expended was the wrong amount insofar as 
wrong amount that was paid by the state because it exceeded R100  000 
and the procedure followed – you say – was a wrong procedure 
because this issue is supposed to be handled by the Department of 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 77 of 108 
 
Public Works and not through the Secret account?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Those are the points I 
am making but there is one extra point I would like to make Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
During 
the 
conversation with Karima  Brown on 702. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
Minister 
attempted to justify the building of the fence around his house which I 
do not have a problem with. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But he at least now 
knows that the money came from the wrong funds.  I  do not know 
whether any attempts were made to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Reallocate 
those 
funds and get the funds from the proper budget.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 And 
whether 
any 
attempts were made to – to repay the R90 000-odd. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which was in excess 
of the R100 000 that he was entitled to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Do you see he did not know that it came from 
the Secret fund account?  
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 78 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
is 
my 
understanding of what – what came out of the Auditor-General’s report 
at the time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then just for the record if I can 
take you to page 20 paragraph 65 of your affidav it.  You refer there to 
an interview on Radio 702 on 17  October 2018.  Is that in fact the date 
of the interview to which your evidence concerning the interview 
relates? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is the date Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  If I may just at this 
particular stage place something on record Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 68 of the witness’ affidavit 
refers to an Annexure JWB10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which is in the enclosed part of the 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is a document marked “secret”. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
It 
has 
a stamp 
on 
it 
which 
declassifies the document.  However we are in the process of just 
clarifying the actual status of this document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 79 of 108 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so that evidence is not going to 
be referred to at this stage until such proper confirmation is sought.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can now take you then to page 23 
of your affidavit which starts the next investigation that your evidence 
concerns and that investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just in case I miss something.  Going 
back to the investigation that Brigadier  Madonsela was doing.  The 
10 
docket was taken from him and given to somebody else much junior to 
him and then at some stage you understand that the docket was sent to 
the IGI.  Is it the IGI?   The Inspector General and then when it came 
back there were no notes to indicate that any work had been done on it 
and is that how far you know about what happened with that 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair can I just get 
the sequence right? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Madonsela 
was 
20 
investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then when he 
started probing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 80 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The dockets were 
taken away from him and sent to the Inspector General.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
think 
it 
was 
Faith Radebe at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There were quite a lot 
of complaints in the me dia about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then it was either six 
10 
weeks or three months later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The dockets were 
returned to Madonsela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Simon Madonsela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
With 
no 
entries 
whatsoever been made.  So they were basically like there for that 
period of time without any progress whatsoever.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He then continued 
with the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Sought my advice 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 81 of 108 
 
which I gave him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Came to my house 
that is when I made the notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Eventually applied for 
the 205s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They were authorised 
but when he went to court to now get the documents he was recalled to 
10 
Pretoria by Jona Moteba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Dockets were taken 
away from him and then handed to a junior member.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So I got some of these steps in the wrong 
sequence? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I thought that when the files – docket was 
taken away from him that was after the – well when they were taken to - 
the docket was taken to the Inspector General that was before the 205s 
20 
– he applied for the 205s?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he applied for the 205s after the docket had come 
back from the IGI and then at a certain stage the docket was taken 
away from him and given to somebody much junior to him to 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 82 of 108 
 
investigate? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And has – and that is where the whole thing ended as 
far as you know? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Until I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or stopped? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is where it 
stopped Chair until my affidavit to with my notes over to Mr  McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  McBride yes, but Mr McBride would have been 
investigating the conduct of police officers in relation to that 
10 
investigation and not doing the actual investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair not really.  What 
happened is when McBride came on board.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When he phoned me 
and asked me what was going on and I gave him a – described to him 
what was going on and he asked me for a report which I did the same 
evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he immediately 
20 
sent an investigators down and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He set the wheels in 
motion to have all these investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 83 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which had become 
dormant to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To rekindle them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And while we were 
having these discussions he still joked and he said to me watch I will 
be the next one to be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I said no they will 
10 
never suspend you because you – you have – you have got the right 
credentials and lo and behold he was eventually suspended.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja, okay.  Thank you.  So for all intents and 
purposes as far as you know that investigation does not appear to have 
been taken further after the docket was taken from Brigadier  Madonsela 
and given to somebody else? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair according to me 
those dockets have gone nowhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Even whilst being at 
20 
IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am alive to what has 
happened at IPID with Mr  McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 84 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  His suspensions and 
trying to keep him out of his job.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So there were other 
investigations also that we communicated with – to each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That I know- and he 
expresses his frustrations at some points and I will perhaps talk about 
that later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That when he gets 
back from suspension things had gone missing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  People from his office 
had been suspended or fired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So what happened to 
those dockets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I really cannot tell you 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair before we move onto the next 
investigation and guided by your direction of course.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 85 of 108 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am not sure if this particular 
chapter would finalise by the time that you have directed and so I am 
happy to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Start it even if we do not finalise it.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am happy to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just use the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  No problem.  So at page 23 of 
your affidavit paragraph 75.  Are you there General  Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  (No audible reply). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You talk about another investigation 
10 
although your involvement in this particular investigation was quite 
different.  This investigation you have called the Cato Manor 
investigation.  In very simple terms please explain what this 
investigation entailed and in particular what  your involvement in this 
investigation was and is. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair after I had 
arrested Colonel Madhoe or had him – caused him to be arrested for 
the attempt to bribe me Chair would recall that he had shown me some 
photographs. 
 
It 
was 
in 
early 
December 2011.  
Major General Deena Moodley the Head of Crime Intelligence at 
20 
KwaZulu-Natal came to my office and he said to me that there were two 
reporters 
from 
the 
Sunday 
Times 
- 
Stephan Hofstatter 
and 
Mzilikazi wa Afrika. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The way he described 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 86 of 108 
 
it to me it sounded like he had actually been part of this meeting.  That 
is now General Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that they were 
going to run a story that Sunday that I am basically the head of a death 
squad. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That this one unit that 
ultimately reported to me – Cato Manor – had committed extra judicial 
killings and that I was the leader of the so cal led death squad. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And they were going 
to phone me - I think he said the Saturday evening for my comments to 
basically catch me off guard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then proceed with 
publishing the story the – the Sunday.  I immediately asked – 
immediately asked my attorney Mr  Carl van der Merwe to contact the 
then editor of the Sunday Times Mr  Ray Hartley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To ask him that we 
want in terms of the audi alteram partem rule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  We would like a 
proper opportunity to. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 87 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To explain what. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  What the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To respond to the allegations?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which they agreed to 
and then I think it was on the Wednesday – following Wednesday – 
Mr Stephan Hofstatter arrived at my office and wa Afrika was not there 
10 
and he dialled in and so wa  Afrika was on the line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And they started with 
all the allegations and we had a long discussion and it made it clear to 
– to Mr Hofstatter that the photographs that they had which I had seen 
some of them were not even scenes where Cato Manor had been 
involved in.  One particular one which was eventually published and I 
think it is one of the most gruesome ones was spread over almost half 
a page of a number of people who had been shot dead on a light 
delivery vehicle and I indicated to him that look the photographs that 
20 
you guys have not all those people were shot by Cato Manor.  They 
then came with a story that – and this eventually becomes the nub of 
one of the complaints against me Chair.  They said to me that their 
information is that in a shootout in Howick on the – on the freeway.  I 
cannot now actually recall if it is N1 or N2 – that I was in a police 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 88 of 108 
 
helicopter and that I basically blocked the vehicle and my guys came 
and shot the people in the car almost like in the movies.  So I said to 
them look you have got a version.  I have a different version.  My 
version is I was sitting in my  office at that time.  I only heard about it 
afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I then went to the 
police’s air wing and where I took the police chopper and I only arrived 
there quite sometime later.  I said what you nee d to do is to establish 
the objective facts.  Just go to the police’s air wing.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And find out what time 
they picked me up because it is all logged in the helicopter’s logbook.  
They also then indicated to me that they had interviewed Mr  Madhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who by now is an 
accused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who accused me of 
all sorts of things and that he was – according to Madhoe he was 
20 
actually investigating me for atrocities.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which I thought was a 
joke because he is from supply chain management.  I do not even think 
he can investigate shoplifting. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 89 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I said to – and 
Madhoe accused me of not handing in the exhibits to the police’s 
exhibit register and I said to him – I looked out of my window – I said 
there is the police station – Durban Central – go and ascertain the 
facts.  Chair it was clear to me that the nature of the conversation they 
had already written their story and they are not going to change it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which they did.  They 
following week on 11 December 2011 the article appeared – big heading 
10 
“Shoot to Kill” and I still phoned General  Dramat my immediate head.  I 
said to him look this thing is in the paper.  He advised me a day or two 
later that he would be appointing General  Jan Mabula from North West 
and also two other Generals – General [indistinct].  I cannot recall her 
first name from the Eastern Cape and General  Lindsay [indistinct].  I 
think she was from one of the other provinces – just to come and 
investigate the articles in the newspaper.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But Chair a couple of 
days later only Jan Mabula arrived at my office – General Jan Mabula 
20 
with a Colonel Manu.  Colonel Manu I later – he has since passed away 
– I established that he was actually of torture in a diffe rent matter in 
the High Court here in Gauteng.  So I said to Mabula – Jan – I said Jan 
because I was expecting him to investigate.  So I said look I will make 
my office at your disposal if you want to use my secretary of typewriter 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 90 of 108 
 
– have anything typed or make photocopies and I also instructed 
whomever at my office to cooperate with Mabula.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He departed and then 
– that was just before Christmas.  He said no they will be back after 
Christmas.  So after C hristmas they come back again but they are very 
evasive Chair.  I mean we are colleagues.  We are generals together 
and I have done him favours in the past.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But all of a sudden he 
10 
is – I could just sense that there was something and I could not put my 
finger on it.  Then later on I get a call from one of my – the same 
Warrant Officer Mostert who had engaged Panday and he said to me 
General one of my informers phoned me and they had been – the 
informer had now been approached by some of Mabula’s team and they 
are putting pressure on them to make certain statements.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
That 
was 
also 
reported by Mostert to Colonel  Hoosain and Hoosain still wrote a letter 
expressing his concern that the informer had now being exposed.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But then something 
else happened Chair.  The San  Zungu who was involved in the – in the 
looting of the Secret Service’s account investigat ion he was now with 
Crime Intelligence.  So I receive a call through a colleague of mine 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 91 of 108 
 
saying that Zungu wants to see you.  At that time I was very suspicious 
about what was happening.  So I did not know what to make of - 
because I had not seen for quite  some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I said to this 
colleague of mine tell Zungu to meet me outside Kentucky in 
Amanzimtoti.  So I drove out to Amanzimtoti and I – because I did not 
know what the purpose of the visit was I decided to record the 
conversation but Zungu was a bit – he was faster than I was.  So he 
was waiting under a tree while I was sitting in the car busy preparing to 
10 
get the recorder right.  The next moment he knocked on my window.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I said Zungu jump 
in the car.  So he said to me General I have got a serious concern.  I 
said what is wrong Zungu.  Now since that day Zungu’s name is 
Kentucky.  I call him Kentucky.  So I said to Zungu what is the problem.  
He says to me no General Mabula’s detectives who are now 
investigating the so called extra judicial killings had called him to their 
hotel where they were staying in Durban.  In one of the cases where it 
is alleged that Cato Manor had done – committed an extra judicial 
20 
killing was the shooting of a person by the name of Bongani  Mkhize.  
Zungu was the investigating officer in a different matter where 
Nkosi Zondo was murdered and which suspect had been sought and 
Mkhize was one of the suspects been sought fo r the killing of 
Nkosi Zondo. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 92 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So – and he had made 
an affidavit in one of the dockets that – that Mkhize was been sought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So they tried to get 
him to change his statement – Mabula’s team tried to get him to change 
his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he refused and he 
says when – he says eventually he just said look his – I am 
10 
uncomfortable what is going on here now.  He is going to excuse 
himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he said almost 
like in a – it was like a veil threat.  We will be back.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And that is when he 
left and he decided to come and inform me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I then started to 
20 
wonder what is going on here.  They are supposed to be objective in 
their investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Now they are trying to 
get people to change statements. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 93 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They are going to 
informers.  I think that recording might still be available where one of 
the informers had a second meeting with them which we re corded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So they were putting 
pressure on people to implicate detectives of Cato Manor in 
wrongdoing.  Then I received a strange phone call from a journalist.  I 
cannot recall her name.  She was from a television station and I recall 
at one stage she also spoke on CNN but not about our case.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But she always used 
to come and talk to us in Durban and then she said to me General I 
believe they are going to charge you for racketeering.  So I said to her 
you must be joking.  They do not know what racketeering is because I 
have been trained in racketeering by Michael Johnson from the US.  I 
have been trained by prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Here in South Africa.  
They surely do not know what racketeering is.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair so this whole 
thing carried on and on and on and then on one particular day I was 
informed that Mabula and his team were done here to arrest some of 
the Cato Manor guys.  So I told – I phoned Colonel Olivier who was 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 94 of 108 
 
their immediate Commander and I said to Willie get the guys together.  
They are going to arrest them.  Let them hand themselves over.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So they all went to the 
office and Carl van der Merwe the attorney then phoned Mabula and 
said we understand you want to arrest the guys and Mabula and them 
denied it initially.  Some reporters would phone the m because the 
reporters now had got wind of this story and they could see the activity 
at the one hotel that they were staying at but they all denied that they 
were about to arrest the Cato Manor guys but they remained at the 
10 
office throughout the night an d then early that morning some of the 
detectives of Cato Manor’s wives started calling in to say look there are 
armed police outside the house here and – so they all decided to go 
home and as they went home at or about – most of the instances the 
media was already waiting there.  They were arrested in full view of the 
media.  They were then taken to a central point at the airport – at the 
police’s air wing where they were paraded in front of the cameras.  
Chair subsequent to that they had to reappear in cou rt in August.  I 
think they appeared in June – June or July.  They had to reappear in 
August. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Of which year if I may interject?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I get this call 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 95 of 108 
 
from a – he as then Colonel Barraza Ncube. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he says to me 
General can I see you but by then I had gotten uncomfortable and I had 
written to Mabula and his team.  We had written to the Prosecuting 
Authority.  If they want to arrest me by all means.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I will present myself 
wherever you want me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And we did that on 
more than one occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And on this particular 
day I was driving in my car and I received – I got a phone call from 
Colonel Barraza Ncube.  He said to me General I would like to see you.  
So I said to him well do you want to arrest me.  He says oh maybe.  So 
I said to him well it is not a joke.  If you want to arrest me tell me.  He 
says no he has got a warrant for my arrest.  I said fine.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Where would you like 
me to meet you.  So I suggested we will meet at my office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Drove back to my 
office and I sat there in my boardroom.  Then I went to all my staff 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 96 of 108 
 
because I did not want them to come barging in there and.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I called all my staff 
and I said look this is what is going to happen.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So do not be upset 
and go back to your offices and carry on with your work.  About 20 
minutes later I phoned him I said I am still waiting for you.  He said no 
they are coming now.  So in the meantime I got a phone call from a 
member of the Special Task Force. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Now the Special Task 
Force are people who deal with terrorists and hostage situations and I 
happened to work with these guys over years.  They all knew me.  So 
he said to me General we are on our way to come and arrest you.   I 
said no I know.  I am waiting for you guys.  He said but we have got 
instructions to handcuff you.  I said well then you have to comply with 
your instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 And 
then 
a 
few 
20 
minutes later they arr ived at my office in the boardroom.  By then I had 
summoned my attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So specific instructions had been given that you be 
handcuffed? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 97 of 108 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So they arrived there 
with the Special Task Force in their camouflage and I sat in my office 
and Brigadier Ncube sat across me and he showed me the warrant of 
arrest.  I said well I am entitled to a  copy.  He gave me a copy.  I then 
asked him for a copy of the founding affidavit and he did not even know 
what a founding affidavit was.  I had to explain to him what a founding 
affidavit was.  Chair it was actually a farce the way I was arrested 
10 
because it looked like I was arresting him because I was taking all the 
notes and he was just sitting there.  It was clear that he was under 
instructions and after the formalities had been concluded he said look 
they have – we have to go but they have to handcuff me.  So I said to 
him Colonel you have got the Special Task Force.  These youngsters 
are fit and strong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am much older than 
them.  I mean – surely I do not pose a danger.  No, no, no they have 
got to follow rules.  I said well then do what you have to do.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They then took cable 
ties and tied my hands in front of me and then they escorted me out of 
the lift.  The cleaner was still there and the clean er often comes to my 
office.  I give him some of my sandwiches and he looked at me – what 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 98 of 108 
 
is going on now.  We got into the car and we drove to my house and I 
looked around and there was an entourage of media people following 
us.  So they obviously altered  the media as well.  We arrived at my 
house.  My domestic she is used to that I bring people home and she 
always offered them water and she still offered them water, but when 
she realised no there is something else going on she got nasty with 
them.  I said no Dorothy [foreign word] and stay calm.  Chair we went 
to my – they ransacked my house.  I do not know what they were 
looking for and then at some point Ncube says to me where is your 
official firearm.  I said you see Ncube you are only interested in 
10 
embarrassing me by handcuffing me in front of the people and dragging 
me out of the office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
But 
the 
most 
important thing you should have done is to look where my firearm is.  
So I lifted my – my pants and I said there is my firearm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he still said you 
could have shot us.  I said exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then I handed my 
firearm to them but I first said to them I want them to take a 
photograph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Which 
they 
did 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 99 of 108 
 
because they had the police photographer there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I said I want to 
see the photograph and I had a look at it and I could not see my 
bathroom in the background because I wanted to use that photograph.  
I had to ask them to take another one which they did.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then Chair we 
went to the air wing.  Chair I have – I am one of the police officers that 
have probably flown – who is not part of the air wing – that has 
10 
probably flown the most in the police helicopter over the years.  The 
police air wing is a secure place.  It has got a probably a four metre 
high fence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When you enter there 
you have got to buzz and they look at you and they identify you.  They 
open this huge gate and then you proceed.  On this particular day and 
after they had arrested me that gate was standing open.  We drove in 
and it looked like the Oscars.  It was just paparazzi and cameras.  So 
we drove around the back.  They took me in the back and a few of the 
20 
other guys who they had also now arrested.  So we went in and they 
started with the – but it was clear to me that Ncube – and I still said to 
him you are playing with time here because I need to – I want to go and 
apply for bail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 100 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then he would 
look halfway through the forms and then he made a mistake.  Then he 
would start all over again clearly playing for time.  Then a Task Force 
member came into my office.  He said to me they have just been 
admonished by – by General Mabula.  I said why.  He said no because 
we did not take you in the front where the media was.  So I got up and I 
Barraza excuse me one second.  I went to Mabula I said to him – I said 
to him Jan I do not mind if you arrest me or investigate me but do not 
make a circus of this thing.  Then he said no i t is not him.  It is 
Len Angus from IPID.  I went to Len Angus I said to Len Angus listen 
10 
you want to make a circus well let us put a tent around this place then.  
So he said no, no, no.  He has got no problem if we leave that we 
should go around the back again and then when they finally processed 
us by now it is too late to go to court.  So I knew now tonight I am 
sleeping inside the – the cells. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Myself and a couple 
of my colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So – and Angus 
20 
comes back to me and he says to me Mabula is adamant we must go 
through the front.  I said now well then we go through the front where 
the media is and I was walking in the front with the rest of my guys 
behind me and then Angus came to me.  He said to me General if it is 
going to make you feel more comfortable I can take your coat and put it 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 101 of 108 
 
over your head.  I said to him Len I have never had any reason to hide  
my face, I am not going to hide my face, I w ant to walk out and I will 
face the cameras, I turned around and I said to my guys those of you 
who want to cover your faces, you’re welcome to do so, I am not going 
to do that, and we all walked out and the flashes going and Chair it was 
actually embarras sing, not the media, the media knew me, but going 
through that passage with junior police officers, constables, sergeants, 
all standing there with their cell phones, here comes the General in 
handcuffs, that to me was probably the most embarrassing.  
 
They put us in a vehicle and we were taken to Durban North 
10 
Police Station ,where we were detained for the night and the following 
we appeared in court and we were granted, well they did not oppose 
bail and we were granted R5 000 bail each, and then Chair later on we 
were charged for racketeering ,those were the charges against us and 
the main allegation was that a number of shooting incidents over a 
period of three and a half years they alleged that those shootings were 
extrajudicial killings.  At least Chair five of those people that they were 
accused of having killed unlawfully at least five of those matters 
inquest proceedings had been finalised and magistrates had made 
findings ruling in favour of the Cato Manor members.  
20 
 
In other cases I’m aware of, had alre ady been to the DPP for 
decision, they were nolle prosequi declined to prosecute, some were 
still under investigation.  So Chair as Chair is aware once you are 
prosecuted you are entitled to copies of the docket, so they provided us 
with copies of the dock ets and at that point Chair I thought when all 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 102 of 108 
 
this is going on you start to doubt yourself, and then you start to 
wonder where did I do something wrong, and you toss and turn in bed 
and I thought okay the thing it can be they must have fabricated a case 
against me and they must have taken false statements.  
 
So I took the dockets home and now I’m reading through the 
dockets, there were 23 dockets Chair, but I don’t figure anywhere, I’m 
not finding the statements that I thought were fabricated statements.  
There were three statements where my name appear, the one is from a 
Captain I think it’s Pillay who says he went to the Howick shooting 
scene, when he arrived there he saw the police helicopter standing on 
10 
the freeway, and he also saw General Booysen there,  that’s the sum 
total of his evidence.   
 
The other one was the crew of the helicopter who says they 
picked up General Booysen at the Airwing, we flew there, we landed, 
Booysen had a look at the scene, we flew back.  That was the full 
extent of his statement.  There was a third statement, that person’s 
name was Cochrane, there was a third statement by Shamila Williams 
from IPID in which she attended to a shooting in Durban North at some 
stage.  I happened to arrive at that scene five hours afterwards and sh e 
merely mentions in her statement that after she had attended the scene 
20 
I also saw her and I think at that stage, I can’t remember if it was a 
Brigadier or a General but she says I saw General Brigadier Booysen, 
but that is much later.  That was the sum t otal of my names in the 
docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the docket ja. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 103 of 108 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
Chair 
I 
immediately approached my attorney and I said to him look I’m not 
happy with this, I mean how can you charge a person or racketeering, I 
have been trained Chair in racketeering, I’ve ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You know what it is. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I know Chair and as  
Provincial Head of the Hawks we have seen a couple cases through of 
racketeering, I know what it takes to  convince the NDPP to sign that 
Section 21 certificate, so I took the matter on review Chair, the 
decision to prosecute me on the basis of legality and irrationality.  I 
10 
filed my founding affidavit and then in the answering affidavit of the 
then acting in DPP Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba she files three extra 
statements that did not form part of the docket, the one is of a 
deceased person who does not implicate me in the offence that I was 
being charged for, he merely mentions somewhere that he had heard – 
now this person is now dead Chair, this person had heard two other 
people saying that they shoot the people in the taxi violence issues and 
then they collect money and then they pay Cato Manor and big boss 
boys.   
 
Now Chair as far as I’m concerned that’s hearsa y twice 
20 
removed, but I won’t go into that, but the two people that they mention 
are – well up until recently were both still alive, they were never 
approached to confirm those discussions, to the contrary when those 
statements were discovered to us through  Crime Intelligence I gave it 
to Colonel van der Vyfer I said do you know these people, they then 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 104 of 108 
 
eventually traced them and showed them the statements, and they then 
went to their attorney, which was Malloy & Partners and ironically who 
then spoke to Advocate Stix Mdladla who then took statements from 
those people that apparently had said that they collected money for 
Cato Manor and when which they disavowed every single aspect of the 
statement, in fact the person that, the deceased person that apparently 
had made that statement was out on bail himself for murder.  So that 
statement is one of the statements which Jiba attaches, there’s another 
one, an unsigned statement from a Greek citizen, who happen to be a 
friend of mine, he is no longer a friend of min e Chair, in which he 
10 
makes wild allegations but nothing pertaining to racketeering.  It’s more 
mischievousness than the commission of offences, but that particular 
document is not signed, and then there are two statements of a 
Colonel, a very controversial  colonel in KZN, Colonel Rajen Aiyer, but 
Chair if you read those statements it looks like a – it’s incoherent to 
say the least, but nowhere does it talk about any offence, it’s pure, 
pure office politics.   
 
But Jiba then says she considered evidence unde r oath, 
evidence in the dockets and evidence under oath.  I – and then the one 
statement taken from Aiyer was dated two weeks after she had 
20 
authorised the prosecution.  The one of Dannicas is not under oath, it’s 
not signed, it’s for all intents and purpos es no one knows where it 
comes from at that time, so I filed a replying affidavit in which I accuse 
of being mendacious and I explain to her how could you have 
considered evidence which objectively seen could not have existed at 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 105 of 108 
 
the time that you took the decision.  She did not take up my invitation, 
long story short Chair Judge Gorvan ruled in my favour, he said none of 
the evidence in the dockets link me to the commission of any offence, 
none of the statements that Jiba belatedly added links me to the – well 
they don’t link anyone to the commission of an offence.   
 
Subsequent to that Chair normally the police are supposed to 
be ...(intervention)    
CHAIRPERSON:  So the review application succeeds?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It succeeded Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the decision to charge you is set aside, was 
10 
set aside as a result of the review?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No the – Chair so in 
order to prosecute a person for racketeering there must be two 
predicate offences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So what they did is 
the one incident that I had gone to Howick for.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 And 
sometimes 
I 
wonder where, how senior advocates understand the law, for 
20 
racketeering you must have committed two predicate offences, now 
what they did in that particular instance they alleged that at the Howick 
matter where I flew to, the allegations that I flew there and I planted an 
AK47 on the scene, but Chair in the book that I wrote th at’s what – I 
put that on the cover because it was taken by a newspaper 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 106 of 108 
 
photographer to – I still can’t find the AK47 that I was supposed to 
have planted there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what I am interested in is what was the actual 
order, the effect of the order in the review application?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But Chair what was 
set aside, the Judge set aside the predicate offences that was murder, 
because they alleged that I – there’s a common purpose for the Howick 
matter and possession of unlicensed firearm, the AK47, possession of 
unlicensed ammunition for the AK47 and defeating the ends of justice 
for planting the firearm. 
10 
 
Chair there is not even remotely a suggestion or nothing 
whatsoever in the dockets that remotely suggests something like th at, 
it’s something that they made up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair to just assist with the review.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Noting the time though, at paragraph 
154 a copy of the actual judgment appears.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what’s the order, is the order a short order, is it a 
long order? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I may with your leave just 
read quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 180 which is paragraph 36, 
at the end of that par agraph the Judge finds that – and I read : 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 107 of 108 
 
“I can conceive of no test for rationality, however relaxed, 
which could be satisfied by her explanation.  The impugned 
decisions were arbitrary, offend the principle of legality, and 
therefore the Rule of law, an d were unconstitutional.”  
In paragraph 38 the first sentence reads:  
“I hasten to emphasize that this outcome is based purely on 
the facts of the present case.”  
And paragraph 39 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s the order that I am really interested in.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The order is that save for the 
10 
interdict which Mr Booysen sought the remaining prayers were granted 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, and the prayers ...(intervention)  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that, if I could it states that there 
– at page 183: 
“There’s no basis for the interdict sought by Mr Booysen in 
paragraph 3, either in the form sought or in any other form.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now that’s fine. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then: 
“In the result the order is granted that in terms of paragraphs 
A, B, C, D and F referred to in paragraph 3 of the judgment.”  
Effectively all the decisions are set aside.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
18 APRIL 2019 – DAY 86 
 
Page 108 of 108 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Save for the interdict. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that’s fine, I will have a look.  So the review 
application was successful, and after that the criminal proceedings 
against you arising from that were gone?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They were withdrawn 
in court chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were withdrawn in court.  That might be the 
convenient time for us to adjourn for today, and then when we resume 
then we can continue, but at least we’ve reached a point where you 
brought a review application, an d it was successful and the criminal 
10 
charges were withdrawn and then we can take it further next time.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine with you? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, we are going to adjourn, we are not 
going to sit next week, we will continue on the 2 n d of May, so you can 
then continue with your evidence.  Is there anything Mr Pretorius wants 
to say? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  No Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  I presume we start at the normal 
time, ten o’clock? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will start at ten o’clock on the 2 n d of May, we 
will then adjourn.  We adjourn
