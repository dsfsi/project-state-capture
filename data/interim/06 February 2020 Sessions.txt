PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 6 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed.  Chair Mr Mbikiwa will be 
presenting the evidence of today’s witness Mr Human but there are a 
few procedural aspects I would just like to deal with at the outset of 
today with your leave? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair since yesterday we received three 
10 
responses from implicated persons to the evidence of Mr Human and I 
indicated earlier in the week we would update you as and when that 
occurred.  Chair they are responses from Ms Kwinana, Ms Memela and 
Swissport South Africa and I will deal with each of them in a little bit 
more detail in a moment.  But there was an issue that was raised in the 
course of the hearings yesterday about the process for Rule 3.3 
Notices and the types of responses that are received from implicated 
persons.  And the question that was raised with us was, is it adequate 
that the response from the implicated person come on – as a statement 
as opposed to an affidavit deposed to under oath?  Chair we looked at 
20 
the various provisions of the Rules and we have also considered the 
practice that has been followed by the commission to date.  I would like 
to address just both of them.  The Rules themselves in Rule 3.3 which 
is the Rule that requires notice to be given to implicated persons is a 
Rule that requires the legal team to give notice to implicated persons 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 3 of 142 
 
when they intend to present to the commission a witness whose 
evidence implicates or may implicate that person.  And then what Rule 
3.4 says – oh I should just add before I go on.   
“That notice identifies for implicated person that they 
have certain rights and then they can also seek leave 
to do certain things.  The rights are to attend at the 
hearing and to have a legal – have legal assistance.”   
The – the opportunity offered subject to your leave is to present 
evidence themselves, to bring the evidence of another person or to 
cross-examine the witness.  Now what 3.4 then says: 
10 
“Rule 3.4 is that an application in terms of Rule 3.3 
that is an application to one of those three things 
must be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the 
Commission within 14 calendar days from the date of 
the notice referred to in Rule 3.3.”   
And it goes on to read:  
“The 
application 
must 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
statement from the implicated person responding to 
the witness’s statement insofar as it implicates him 
or her and the statement must make it clear what 
20 
parts of the witness’s statement are disputed or 
denied and the grounds upon which those parts are 
disputed or denied.”   
Chair the Rule 3.3 Notices that are sent out by the legal team of the 
commission replicate this language from Rule 3.4 and so in other words 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 4 of 142 
 
what that notice does is it alerts the implicated person that in order to 
respond and to make such application they must do so in writing 
accompanied – an application in writing accompanied by a statement.  
Chair it is our submission today that insofar as implicated persons have 
previously received notices in respect of which they have been told that 
they must provide a statement as opposed to an affidavit deposed to 
under oath it would be appropriate that those statements be received 
and where it is useful because they have received in advance of 
witness’s evidence to then use the opportunity in the hearing to put that 
version albeit on statement to the witness for comment.  Chair it may 
10 
well be – you raised in the course of the debate yesterday with my 
learned friend that there is that catch or general provision in the rules 
that is Rule 11 that talks about whenever the Rules – this is 11.3.   
“Whenever the Rules make provision for a person to 
apply to the commission or the Chairperson the 
application must be a substantive application on 
affidavit with a Notice of Motion.” 
Chair it may be that going forward it would be appropriate it is our 
submission for some revision to be made to the Rule 3.3 Notices that 
go out to make it clear that there – any application in terms of 3.4 
20 
should nonetheless be on affidavit because then I think as you were 
highlighting yes at least you have a deposed to version and a witness’s 
version under oath.  But it would be our submission for today’s 
purposes and given the practice that has been followed previously that 
the commission acknowledges that it has received statements from 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 5 of 142 
 
implicated persons and where relevant that those statements be put in 
the course of Mr Human’s evidence today.  But before I go there I 
would just like to make one further point in relation to the specific 
applications that have been received in relation to Mr Human.  Because 
even if there was a remaining concern on your part about a version not 
under oath and a version under oath it actually does not arise in 
today’s case and I would like to explain why.  The first application – or 
at least the first statement received is not an application to cross-
examine Mr Human.  It is a statement received by Ms Kwinana in 
response to Mr Human’s affidavit.  Now Ms Kwinana deals briefly with 
10 
some of the aspects.  It is our proposal that we put those points where 
relevant to the matters that we will be focussing today to Mr Human.  
But I also think it is necessary to indicate that it is the intention of the 
legal team of the commission certainly in due course to present the 
evidence of Ms Kwinana in these hearings and I can indicate to you 
Chair that we are engaged with her at the moment about meeting with 
her and facilitating that.  So in that respect there should be no risk of a 
situation where you have a version from her not under oath and a 
version from Mr Human under oath.  Chair the same applies in relation 
to Ms Memela.  Ms Memela does bring an application to cross-examine 
20 
Mr Human but Ms Memela has been summoned to appear tomorrow.  
And depending on what happens in relation to any application she may 
bring it is certainly the intention that her version also be provided to 
this commission under oath.  And so we advance in our submission the 
interchange between her and the disputed versions by putting them first 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 6 of 142 
 
to Mr Human and then addressing them tomorrow with her in her 
evidence.  Chair the final response was a response from Swissport 
South Africa.  Now Swissport South Africa has indicated that it is still in 
the process of considering Mr Human’s affidavit but they have drawn 
the commissions attention to the fact that the former CEO of Swissport 
South Africa Mr Cole who is not currently present in South Africa.  I 
think he is now working for them in the United States has supplied an 
affidavit to the commission in the course of its investigations.  I think 
we received it last week.  And so all that they have done is that they 
have highlighted the parts of their affidavit previously supplied which 
10 
they say are response to Mr Human’s evidence and so it is on that 
basis that we propose to put their responses.  I should also just note 
that their correspondence with the commission yesterday indicated that 
they will continue to consider his affidavit – they have not completed 
doing so yes and if necessary they will apply to supplement Mr Cole’s 
first affidavit if they deem it necessary.  Chair with that background in 
place we propose along the lines that I have described to conduct the 
proceedings today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  The one aspect that I want to raise 
with regard to the issue of statements that are not under oath or that 
20 
are not affirmed is whether some of the statements you have received 
such as maybe from Ms Memela and Ms Kwinana and maybe from any 
implicated person that may have responded to 3.3 Notices before 
whether it is simply a statement without – it is simply a statement that 
is not an application for leave to accused’s evidence or for leave to 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 7 of 142 
 
cross-examine because there may be an argument that 11.3 maybe 
does not apply to a situation where somebody does not apply for leave 
to adduce evidence or to cross-examine or to call witnesses but simply 
says, here is my side of the story what you do with it is up to you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that – that might be the position it 
may be necessary that the Rules be amended because I think that when 
somebody – when a witness has taken the trouble to go under oath in 
regard to what they tell the commission anybody who wants to 
challenge their evidence should take the same trouble and also go 
10 
under oath. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not – we should not have a situation where the 
witness has gone to the trouble of going under oath and somebody just 
sends us a letter or just a statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where there would be no – no consequences if what 
is contained there is not true. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we might need to amend the Rules to cover that 
situation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But all those implicated persons who responded to – 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 8 of 142 
 
who have responded in the past and may continue to respond in the 
future to 3.3 Notices that do not call upon them to put their statements 
on affidavit.  Those will be accepted and be dealt with. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the understanding that it is the 3.3 Notices that 
did not require them to put that under oath.  But once the 3.3 Notices 
have been amended then everybody would need to make sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That their statements are under oath. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at least I think it is important that we have cleared 
it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it arose yesterday. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just on the factual question as to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The ones that we have received in relation to 
this evidence the only cross-examination applications are the ones from 
20 
Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In respect of Ms Sambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yesterday and in respect of Mr Human. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 9 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The rest are just statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or in the case of Mr Cole an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Previously provided in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But given that Ms Memela has been summoned 
10 
to testify tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It seems to me we can address those aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Given that she will be going under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will hand over to Mr Mbikiwa 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Mr Mbikiwa. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair could I just have moment to get my 
files? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Hm. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 10 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair I am – we are ready proceed with the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR HUMAN:  It is Schalk Hendrik Human. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR HUMAN:  No objection. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
10 
conscience? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR HUMAN:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair may I ask that the 
files labelled – well the files containing Mr Human’s affidavit and 
annexures be admitted as Exhibits DD22a to DD22g? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  B up to G are they there? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  They should be Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay are they all annexures to his statement? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  They are all annexures to his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To his statement. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 11 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  With – with a small section in G for 
additional documents such as the statements that we have received in 
response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In G? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In G. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But up to F it is annexures to his statement? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And including most of G is annexures – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including most of G? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The file containing Mr Schalk Hendrik Human’s 
10 
affidavit will be marked Exhibit DD22a together with the annexures 
contained in that file.  The other files marked DD – Exhibit DD22b to g 
contain annexures to his affidavit and they will be marked accordingly 
but it is recorded that G – that is DD2g contains not only his annexures 
but also other documents.  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human can I ask you to open the file that 
should be in front of you labelled DD22a?  Can I ask you to turn to the 
first page and you will see the red numbers in the top right hand 
20 
corner.  Those are the page numbers that I will be referring you to 
during the course of your evidence.  We will for the most part be within 
this file but during the course of your evidence I will take you to other 
documents in the files that should be alongside you.  Can I ask you to 
turn to page 54?  Is this the affidavit that you provided to the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 12 of 142 
 
commission? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And is that your signature? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes it is. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you swear that the contents of the 
affidavit are true and correct? 
MR HUMAN:  I do. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Human your – your affidavit 
deals in some detail with a variety of issues and the full chronology of 
events and it is not necessary for us to traverse most of those matters.  
10 
Subject to the Chair’s direction both because much of it is 
uncontentious background material and also because much of it was 
dealt with by yesterday’s witness, Ms Sambo.  Instead I intend to take 
you to particular aspects where your expertise and experience will help 
to shed some light on the process.  Can you begin by telling us about 
your qualifications? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Sir I hold a Bachelor’s Degree and a Diploma in 
Financial and Administration.  Public Financial Management and 
Administration. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what is your employment history? 
20 
MR HUMAN:  I was employed at the Auditor General for 10 years.  
Thereafter joined the National Treasury in the office of the Accountant 
General for 5 years.  Thereafter in the office of the Chief Procurement 
Officer and served as the acting Chief Procurement Officer for 18 
months odd under Minister Gordhan and Nene respectively. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 13 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And – and tell us something about what that 
role involved? 
MR HUMAN:  The Chief Procurement Officer is responsible for the legal 
and regulatory framework in public sector procurement.  It is 
responsible for the governance of those processes and it is responsible 
to ensure that transversal contracts applicable to the whole government 
are tendered, evaluated and adjudicated.  The office manages 
approximately R80 Billion of transversal tenders.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what position do you currently hold? 
MR HUMAN:  I am currently the acting Head of Department in the 
10 
Technical Materials Department at SAA Technical responsible for 
procurement, 
logistics, 
warehouse 
and 
storage 
and 
inventory 
management. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can you tell us what South African 
Airways Technical is and what it does? 
MR HUMAN:  South African Technical is a state owned company 
charged with the responsibility of maintaining aircraft.  Its main 
customer is SAA and it is also 100% owned by the – by SAA.  It 
specialises in maintenance, repair and overall activities, scheduled 
maintenance as well as unscheduled maintenance and it serves a 
20 
number of customers.  The main customer is South African Airways but 
we also have a healthy portfolio third party customers like Mango, 
ComAir and a few other airlines like Air Namibia to name a few. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Now Mr Human you have – you have spoken 
in your affidavit about the approach you have taken to your evidence 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 14 of 142 
 
and in particular those issues that you do and do not have personal 
knowledge of.  Can you give us an overview of – of how – what 
approach you have taken to putting together a chronology of events? 
MR HUMAN:  Absolutely.  Chair I was not employed at SAAT and the 
time of the award of these tenders.  I started my employment on the 25 
July 2018 and my approach was in compiling this affidavit to base the 
statements on written documentation available to me.  The content of 
forensic reports and the Minutes of the Procurement and Board 
Committees.  My approach was to capture the document – the sequence 
and chronology of events based on these documents and reports. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Can we then move to 
components tenders?  And we can pick that up at your affidavit on page 
5.  Can you explain broadly speaking what a contract for the provision 
of component support services is? 
MR HUMAN:  Certainly.  Chairperson in the maintenance of aircraft is 
quite expensive.  So to hold excessive stock especially of what we call 
rotable components it is quite expensive.  Very few airlines in the world 
has the capital means or the monetary means to buy excessive stock.  
So a pool contract or a component contract is where inventory would be 
centralised by a service provider and those who would like to use the 
20 
service pay a premium on a monthly basis usually a flight hour rate.  
That is every hour that the aircraft flies.  A specific agreed upon rate 
would be paid for the use of components.  The benefit for maintenance 
and repair organisation is that if there is a failure on a component you 
have the benefit to access a replacement part quite quickly within days.  
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 15 of 142 
 
While if you send it for a repair it might take up to three months or 
even longer depending on the complexity.  So participating in a pool 
contract provides the opportunity to have spares available so that 
aircraft are serviceable and available to be deployed into service.  
There is usually three components Chair I have interrupted you I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no continue I will ask you after you are done. 
MR HUMAN:  Okay.  There is usually three components.  A base kit.  
That is a list of core components that the service provider would put on 
site – on the premises of the organisation so that you can access it 
within hours.  The second would be advance exchange service.  One 
10 
would request a specific part.  It will be shipped to your premises and 
you have to return a core unit, the unserviceable one, the one that is 
out of service.  The third aspect is repair services.  When you have a 
component that has become unserviceable it is sent to a repair shop of 
the supplier and once it is repaired it will be returned to the 
organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say this is a pool arrangement? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean that there would a supplier and this 
supplier would have arrangements or contracts with different airlines 
20 
for example of companies and they all look to this supplier for parts 
whenever need arises?  And the obligation of the supplier is to always 
have the parts that may be needed by the companies that are – that 
have contracts with them, is that right? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 16 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you say an airline would not like to keep its 
own stock because that is very expensive? 
MR HUMAN:  Hundreds of millions of Rand worth in stock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And just explain for us how the – how the 
pricing works?  We heard from Ms Sambo yesterday reference to PBH 
or I think she said it was Power by the Hour.  Just explain what that is? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct it – Power by the Hour is a generally 
recognised term in the industry and that is a rate agreed between the 
supplier and the recipient in this case SAAT on how much you would 
10 
pay in Dollars for every hour the aircraft flies.  The incentive is there is 
no revenue when the aircraft is on the ground.  So the incentive is on 
the supplier to make sure that quality components are delivered quite 
fast.  It is despatched within very short space of time so that it enable 
revenue generating flight hours.  The rate is usually determined with a 
couple of elements.  It will be the pool access amount.  There is a 
provision made for beyond economic repair.  Chair it happens that 
spares just come to the end of life and even if it is possible to repair 
the cost thereof will well exceed the economic value thereof.  So 
instead of replacing the full fair market value it is almost like insurance 
20 
that you pay and in case it fails only a percentage would be applicable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess that it happens but very rarely that a part that 
has not come to the end of its life just falls from the sky as the 
aeroplane flies.  I heard something like that recently.   
MR HUMAN:  No comment Chair. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 17 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  Chair in rarest of occasions this might have happened 
before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human can you – can you tell us 
something about the procurement process within SAA Technical and the 
stages that need to be followed in order for a components contract to 
be entered into? 
MR HUMAN:  Absolutely.  As a state owned entity – company we fall 
within the ambit of the provisions of the Public Finance Management 
10 
Act as a Schedule 2 entity.  The Act provides for differentiation 
between departments, municipalities, Schedule 3A and C entities and 
then big entities like SAA, Transnet, Eskom. It is based on the 
principles of the Constitution in Section 217 that all procurement 
should be open, fair, transparent, equitable and cost effective.  Those 
are the principles that is also being adopted in the Supply Chain Policy 
of the Group and of the – of the companies that it owns.  The policy 
therefore provides that tenders or acquisitions sourcing should happen 
by advertising bids on its website, on the Treasury’s E Tender Porthole 
or in the states Tender – Tender Bulletin.  It allows for a minimum 
20 
number of days obviously to allow a fair chance for suppliers to prepare 
a quality, responsive bid and such publication is based on so called 
request for proposal or a request for bid and this document specifies 
the critical criteria.  It is really articulating the needs of the 
organisation and discloses how scoring in this manner will be done.  
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 18 of 142 
 
The policy further states that there should be segregation of duty and 
by that I mean that those who are charged in compiling the 
specifications for such a bid should not be the persons that is also 
responsible for the evaluation thereof.   
The rationale is basically that one does not design a tender 
for your own interest and for a specific - buyers for a product.  The 
third compulsory committee is a Bid Adjudication Committee and also in 
this case the members are not the same with the intent that there is 
segregation of duty.  As an extra governance measure the policy 
provides for a delegation of authority. 
10 
It is threshold driven.  It is based on values of tender where 
high value tenders are referred to the Board - the relevant Board.  In 
this case it will be South African Airways Technical Board for final 
approval.  The process will then upon award result in the finalisation of 
a contract.  This - stipulating the conditions that was advertised. 
Typically a service level agreement depicting performance 
aspects would be included and then the process will progress to 
contract management and supplier performance. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And within that process where - where does 
the Cross Functional Sourcing Team fit? 
20 
MR HUMAN:  During 2016 the SAA and SAAT policies also provided for 
a so called Cross Functional Sourcing Team and in the case of SAAT 
this group of people were responsible for both compiling the 
specification as well as conducting the evaluation.  In 2016 the 
National Treasury issued an instruction 3 of 2016 specifying the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 19 of 142 
 
segregation of duty in no uncertain terms and from there on this is a 
practice that the three committees is the legitimate committees in 
procurement to address the process required. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So the - the CFST is a - is a 2016 and 
before phenomenon? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Human, you - you list in your 
affidavit five tenders that you then deal with.  For - for the reasons I 
have given I do not intend to spend much time on - on most of those, 
but just tell us before the first tender was issue in February 2013 who 
10 
was the provider of component support services? 
MR HUMAN:  Air France. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can we go to the first tender?  You deal 
with that from paragraph 29 on page 8 of your affidavit.  What was the 
recommendation of the CFST in this tender? 
MR HUMAN:  After … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Can I first hear what the tender was 
about?  If - if … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have covered that I must have missed it.  If I 
20 
can hear what the tender about was about first. 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, the - a component tender for SAAT was 
advertised five times consecutively.  The first occurrence of this bid 
was the … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh.  Hang on.  Is that the one I heard about 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 20 of 142 
 
yesterday? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the same tender about yesterday from … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  This - this - the first one is the first one that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Ms Sambo? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  From Ms Sambo indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - and when - when he talks about advertised five 
times.  He is talking about exactly that one? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That we said … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We said it is the same, but … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and each - on each occasion it had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It had a separate bid number.  So it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It was readvertised … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Under - under a new - a new bid number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So we have been referring to it as the first, 
second … 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 21 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Mr Human you do not have to go 
through that.  I now understand. 
MR HUMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is something that was dealt with yesterday, but it 
was a components tender? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Mbikiwa, you had asked 
question about cross section or something. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes.  I was just asking what the - what the 
recommendation was in that - by the CFST in - in that tender. 
10 
MR HUMAN:  The - the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well I am sorry.  Mr Human, you might not 
understand this, but maybe for purposes of consistency.  We - we may 
have to refer to them as first, second, third, fourth tender as we did 
yesterday … 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because your evidence has to link to yesterday’s 
evidence. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that it is clear we are talking about the same 
20 
thing. 
MR HUMAN:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So this is the first tender. 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, the first tender was advertised and the 
recommendation by the Cross Functional Sourcing Team recommended 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 22 of 142 
 
that the components support for the Boeing Fleet be awarded to Israel 
Aerospace or IAI as the abbreviation commonly used and for the Airbus 
Fleet to Air France. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and what was the outcome of that 
tender? 
MR HUMAN:  The outcome was that eventually the Board approved that 
this tender be retracted in totality.  That SAAT test the market by 
requesting quotations from other parties to test the relevance of pricing 
and then to allow SAAT to deviate from a competitive open tender 
process and rather confine the award to only one bid.  Chair, I have 
10 
tried to depict these facts in paragraph 41 of the affidavit. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Before we get there and - and this - this 
maybe because of the - the way we are naming the tenders, but - but at 
paragraph 41 of the affidavit.  You are talking about tender SP437/14 
which is a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The second. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What we might refer to as the second … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Second tender. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Second tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So his question Mr Human related to the first - 
20 
what we call the first tender. 
MR HUMAN:  Oh.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  Chair, I apologise.  The - the first tender was numbered 
in terms of the - the tender register at SAAT as SP401/2012.  The first 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 23 of 142 
 
tender.  The - if I may confirm the CFST recommended the award for 
the Boeing Fleet to Israel Aerospace and for the Airbus Fleet to Air 
France. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  And then the recommendation from the - from the Board 
… 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  You deal with the BAC recommendation at 
paragraph 33. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  The recommendation was in paragraph 33 and I 
have attached as an annex a copy of the BAC resolution.  That it 
10 
should be cancelled and retracted to - to allow an integrated approach. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what does that mean?  An integrated 
approach. 
MR HUMAN:  Integrated approach would mean that the services for 
components and for logistics be combined in one tender and one award. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you; and - and - so now we can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Integrated approach is ….? 
MR HUMAN:  Sir, the two big ticket items in terms of cost drivers at 
SAAT is the cost of the - the component itself, but also the 
transportation.  Most of these are flown from either America for Boeing 
20 
parts or Europe for Airbus … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  And represent significant amounts of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMAN:  So integration was the supply of the components plus the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 24 of 142 
 
transportation or logistics thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So that the - the bid must not disregard transport 
costs and only add them later when they have got the - the tender? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct Chairperson.  Is it a concentration of spend of 
two … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  Cost drivers into one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  Very big tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Human we can now move 
onto the - the second tender.  SP437/14. 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  So what you said earlier on namely the 
Board decided that the tender be confined to one supplier.  That related 
to the second tender not the first? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  And I do apologise for … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human do - do - sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  I am - I am wondering whether your 
approach is to let him say something on each one of them before you 
take each one in terms of how far it went ultimately or whether you 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 25 of 142 
 
would be saying okay.  Let us finish with the first tender or I may be 
confused because there was a withdrawal. 
So the second tender arose because there was a withdrawal 
of the first tender.  Okay.  So there would have been nothing done after 
- ja.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  That is … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and you have told us what - what 
10 
happened with the - the second tender.  What - what was your 
understanding of the reason for the retraction? 
MR HUMAN:  So I just want to confirm we are now on tender two? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Now - we are now on tender two. 
MR HUMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I think that question Mr Mbikiwa is going to 
explain if I - I misunderstand him.  I think that question goes back to 
the first tender to say what your understanding was of why that tender 
was withdrawn or retracted. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No Chair.  Let me - let me try and … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless I understood you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr - Mr Human, thought I was talking about 
the second tender when in fact I was talking about the first … 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 26 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And explained what he had said at 
paragraph 41 about the retraction of that tender … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what I am ask … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you were talking about the first. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  On that occasion I was talking about the 
first one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you were talking about the second. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  As I understand Mr Human’s evidence the 
10 
first tender was advertised and was retracted in order for an integrated 
approach to be followed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and we are now moving on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are done with the first one? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are now done with the first tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And we are moving on to the second tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Which - which he has already told us … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  There was a confinement to one bidder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  There was a retraction and I am - and I am 
asking … 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 27 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Whether he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I think maybe what you do, because he said - he 
said that in - at a wrong time.  Let us start afresh with the second 
tender. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell us about the second tender. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Tell us about the second tender. 
MR HUMAN:  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Disregard what you said earlier. 
10 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  Chairperson is it not every day that you have an 
opportunity to start afresh and I would certainly welcome it.  Thank you 
for your indulgence.  So the second tender was then advertised on 
29 October 2014.  It was evaluated and then the Board asked that this 
tender be put on hold and the reason for that was that there was a 
Memorandum of Understanding proposed with AAR under a supplier 
development framework proposal. 
The Board then resolved that this tender be put on hold - the 
evaluation process.  So it was advertised.  Bids were received.  The 
committee were busy evaluating the results and midway this evaluation 
20 
the Board requested the SAAT Cross Functional Sourcing Team to put it 
on hold for three months while the possibilities of engaging on a 
Memorandum of Understanding with AAR are investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why was the Board getting involved in the second 
tender and in - in the first tender in the second tender?  Was that 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 28 of 142 
 
because the value of the tender required the Board to be involved or 
what was the reason? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson at the time SAA and SAAT developed a 
strategic partnership program as a vehicle to advance economic goals - 
empowerment goals and it was seen as an opportunity to explore 
localisation.  Now if you allow me just to explain a little bit later.  The 
Government has a number of instruments that it would like to use to 
attract foreign direct investment. 
The National Industrialisation Participation Program is one of 
those tools.  Supplier Establishment in South Africa is one of those 
10 
tools and it is my understanding that the Board was considering using 
the strategic partnership framework to engage suppliers that would 
make these kind of investments in - in South Africa. 
Their involvement was not to approve the tender.  Their 
involvement was to say they consider the - the framework - supplier 
development framework to - to - as a vehicle for empowerment and for 
investment in South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right to think that normally a Board of an SOE 
would not be involved in tenders, but that there may be tenders that are 
above a certain value that have to go to the Board, but other than that 
20 
reason normally a Board would not be involved in - in tenders.  Am I 
right? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson that is correct.  The PFMA Act makes 
specific provision for what is the roles and responsibilities of an 
accounting authority.  In this case the accounting authority is the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 29 of 142 
 
Board.  Their involvement is oversight and governance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm, but the - the reason that you have forward 
why they were getting involved and you have said they were not getting 
involved to approach or not approach.  As you understand it that would 
be in line with PFMA requirement or is that something you are not sure 
about? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, the involvement of the Board would be to 
approve mechanisms within the legal framework and the legal 
framework in this case would be two very specific pieces of legislation.  
It would be the Black Based Economic Empowerment Act plus the codes 
10 
and secondly the Preferential Procurement Act plus its regulations. 
Those two would form the legal framework.  The partnership 
agreement in my understanding was a specific dispensation for Eskom 
and Transnet and it was based on a provision of the Act where those 
entities had to specifically apply for approval to deviate from the 
normal instruments.  I am not - unaware and unsure what motivated the 
Board to use that specific instrument without applying for the approval 
to deviate from the two main frameworks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Human, would it be fair 
20 
to say that if the tenders had got to that stage Board approval would 
have been required? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But that the Board intervened before it got 
to that stage? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 30 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:  That would be correct, sir. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In respect of what we are calling the second 
tender.  Can you just confirm for us when it was issued and what the 
closing date for the bids was? 
MR HUMAN:  Certainly.  The - the tender was published - I am going to 
make very sure Chairperson that I have number two as number two.  If 
you allow me a minute … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  The tender was advertised on 29 October and the closing 
date was 2 December 2014. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you know when the suspension 
decision was made by the Board?  The Board - the decision you 
referred to where the Board suspended the tender. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chairperson.  The decision to suspend the Board - 
the - the tender for three months was made on 29 April 2015. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And the date on which the Board finally 
resolved to retract the tender? 
MR HUMAN:  The tender - the Board at their meeting of 18 June 2015 
made the decision to retract the tender. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The - the reason I ask you those dates is 
20 
because I would now like to turn to the - the portion of your evidence 
where you deal with the relationship between AAR and SAAT during the 
period between the issuing of the tender and the decision to retract it. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And before you - you deal with that.  These decisions 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 31 of 142 
 
by the Board to suspend the tender for whatever period - three months.  
Would - would they normally fall within the function of - of a Board that 
kind of decision or should it be a decision of management and if the 
Board wants to suggest they suggest, but the decision should be taken 
by management? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, it is usually the decision of management 
and the regulations - the PPPFA Regulations make it clear when you 
can cancel a tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  It is only when circumstances have changed or when 
10 
there is no budget available or a tender is - is viewed that there was 
fraudulent or corrupt activities involved.  That would be the three 
reasons that is currently provided for in The Public Sector Procurement 
Regulatory Framework for cancellation of a tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR HUMAN:  It is not common that a Board would take such a decision.  
It would be taken at management level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human, I would like to take you to a few 
aspects of the development of this relationship.  If we can pick it up at 
20 
- on - on page 13 of your affidavit at paragraph 49.  You - you refer to 
Ms Jackson - Ms Cheryl Jackson approaching Mr Nico Bezuidenhout.  
Can you tell us about that approach? 
MR HUMAN:  Chair, I have attached an email to my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  Mr - Mr Mbikiwa, I may have 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 32 of 142 
 
missed this again.  The resolution of the Board on 18 June as I - as I 
look at paragraph 41 of your affidavit - which was done by way of round 
robin - was: 
“To approve the retraction of the tender to allow the 
finalisation of the strategic partnership.” 
That strategic partnership did you say it was with - what 
organisation? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, the intent was to enter into a strategic 
partnership with AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the - the intention? 
10 
MR HUMAN:  Correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it says: 
“The Board also approved that SAAT test the market 
by requesting quotations from other parties for a six 
month period.” 
MR HUMAN:  Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the two make sense?  One, retract the tender to 
allow for the finalisation of the strategic partnership.  Two, SAAT test 
the market by requesting quotations from other parties for a six month 
or maybe it does, because maybe the quotations that would be 
20 
requested would include AAR or not - or not? 
MR HUMAN:  The rationale for inviting quotations Chairperson, is to 
make sure that the economic value is on par. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  So - so inviting a few quotations would get a field for 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 33 of 142 
 
value for money … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  Usually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  And then in item three - 41-3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMAN:  The intent was to deviate from a competitive process and 
only award it to one bidder through a confinement process.  Not 
through a competitive tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well Mr Mbikiwa, when you deal with the 
10 
relationship is that when you will deal with some of these aspects, 
because … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or if you will deal with them.  It is fine. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We will.  We will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In - in a sense Chair what we have done 
chronologically is we have dealt with the beginning of the second 
tender and its retraction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And the reason for the retraction is the 
relationship with AAR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you are going to deal with now. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And we are now going to move to the 
chronology … 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 34 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Of the development of that relationship up 
to the retraction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The intervening period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human, I had asked you about the 
approach that Ms Jackson made to Mr Bezuidenhout in February 2015. 
MR HUMAN:  Correct.  An email was sent by Ms Cheryl Jackson to 
Mr Nico Bezuidenhout.  Mr Bezuidenhout was the Acting CEO of SAA at 
10 
the time.  She thanked him in this email for a meeting that he had with 
her and she attached a proposal - a partnership proposal.  Chairperson 
that would be in line with the strategic partnership proposal that the 
Board intended to put on hold the running tender for three months … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  To allow for the development of a strategic partnership … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  Framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Except Mr Human in time the Board had not 
20 
yet suspended the tender.  Had it? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So there was an open tender in which bids 
had been submitted and there was an evaluation ongoing? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 35 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In your view is that - is that common 
practice to - to submit a partnership proposal as a tenderer while a 
tender is open and pending? 
MR HUMAN:  Not at all.  It is commonly viewed in public sector 
procurement that when a tender process is running that interaction with 
suppliers are prohibited and it is explicitly stated like that in the Supply 
Chain Policy of SAA and SAAT. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And then if we can move to - to paragraph 
51?  You - you speak about a proposed collaboration agreement that 
emerged thereafter.  Can you tell us about that? 
10 
MR HUMAN:  Based on the proposal that Ms Jackson has emailed to 
Mr Bezuidenhout.  Mr Bezuidenhout then forwarded this proposal to the 
SAAT CEO - Mr Zwane - and this proposal from AAR proposed 
collaboration between the two organisations in the provisioning of - of 
components.  The provisioning of components. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it is necessary Mr Mbikiwa to let Mr Human 
just deal with the main features of the proposal.  So that one can - can 
follow the - the proposal that Ms Jackson sent to Mr Bezuidenhout. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR HUMAN:  Chair, the - the proposal is attached as Annexure 9A.  If 
you would allow me one sec … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, it is at page 1-1-2-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-1-2-8.  Thank you.  Would that be in another 
bundle? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 36 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry.  My apologies Chair.  That is in 
DD22C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DD22C.  Okay.  Thank you.  11-28. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  11-28 Chair.  That is the - that is the email 
correspondence and then the collaboration agreement is on the next 
page as the attachment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is in draft form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just emphasising the main features might assist 
in understanding maybe why later on the Board decided to say the 
10 
tender should be suspended for three months pending the finalisation 
of this. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human can I ask you to turn page 
1-1-3-4 and in particular to Clause 5.2.  Sorry 5.1 under the heading of 
“Collaboration”. 
MR HUMAN:  Certainly. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can you read that into the record? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, Chairperson the agreement states the following: 
20 
“Collaboration 
The parties agree to collaborate with each other for the 
purpose of negotiating this memorandum of understanding in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement.  
For these purposes the parties record that the intent to 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 37 of 142 
 
execute the MOU by 15 June 2015; the purpose of the MOU is 
to provide the following: 
(a) 
AAR is to be SAAT’s major MRO equity partner 
through a joint venture. 
(b) 
AAR is to be the primary supplier of MRO and supply 
chain services including a power by the hour 
program to SAAT. 
(c) 
The parties will seek to strengthen the provisioning of 
SAAT of MRO and Aviation Services to South 
African Airways and currently third party customers; 
10 
(d) 
The parties will seek to increase and develop through 
the JV the business in respect of the provision of 
MRO services to third party airlines.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Mr Human.  Can you give us a 
sense of how that collaboration, that proposed collaboration compares 
to the tender that was at the time under way? 
MR HUMAN:   It is virtually the same services Chairperson, the 
provisioning of power by the hour was the main component, the 
provisioning of supply chain and components, repairs, exchanges, 
modifications, exactly the same, the strengthening of MRO and Aviation 
20 
Services in our contract, engineering services, reliability services, 
modifications on servers bulletins and airworthiness directives are 
included in the current tender. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you.   If we return to your affidavit 
that’s DD22A, unless Chair there is any aspect of the collaboration 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 38 of 142 
 
agreement you would like us to go to? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to say that a reading of that draft does 
or doesn’t give an indication that the later resolution by the Board to 
which we have – about which you have testified, indicate that the Board 
already at this stage of that resolution was looking at AAR being given 
the job.   Is that something that you are able to say based on just 
reading this and having regard to the resolution or not really? 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson it is the absence of any other proposals of 
equally or better service providers that gives me an indication that it 
was more or less the only option on the table. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Chair perhaps we can go to the minutes of 
the Board Meeting which happened the very next day after the 
collaboration agreement was circulated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   That Chair you will find also in DD22C and 
that’s at page 1055, and if you turn to 105 – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it under any particular ...[intervenes]  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Yes sorry, it is Annexure 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, yes. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And if you turn to 1056 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us just say these are minutes of the board, is it 
the SAA Board or is it SAAT Board? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Chair it is the SAAT Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, of a meeting of 29 April 2015 at nine in the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 39 of 142 
 
morning, okay, yes, you may continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.   If we turn to 1056 can 
you read the first portion of 4.2? 
MR HUMAN:   Chair it is recorded in the minutes, “ 
“evaluation of AAR proposal, the Board considered the AAR 
proposal in which AAR sought the partnership, including the 
option to invest in SAAT, to aggressively expand its regional 
footprint as well as diversify and increase the revenue.   Also 
the proposed partnership would help SAAT revitalise its 
capabilities 
for 
jets 
shop, 
landing 
gears, APU’s 
and 
10 
component repairs.” 
Must I continue? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Ja, please continue. 
MR HUMAN:    
“The Board propose that the following matters be included in 
the list of SAAT’s expectations from the AAR potential 
partnership, 
that 
the 
efficiency 
improvement 
or 
cost 
reductions led to lower maintenance costs for SAA Group 
Airlines [that would be SAA and Mango] that AAR expand into 
Africa with SAAT as its business partner.  That the potential 
20 
partnership be for a minimum of five years and reviewable 
every year and thereafter be reviewed by both parties every 
year and that AAR would make a cash contribution to the 
proposed partnership.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And then can you read for us the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 40 of 142 
 
resolution? 
MR HUMAN:    
“In conclusion the Board resolved that; 
1) 
the process followed by SAAT in evaluating AAR as a 
potential strategic partner in the context of the 
approved strategic partnership framework be and 
hereby is noted. 
2) 
The selection of AAR as one of SAAT’s strategic 
partnerships be and is hereby approved and 
recommended to SAA. 
10 
3) 
The next steps to be taken by SAAT ahead of signing 
a memorandum of understanding or any other 
contract with AAR be and are hereby approved.  
This includes a May visit to AAR led by Board 
Chairperson.  During this visit a collaboration 
agreement, which would be the basis in the 
memorandum of understanding would be signed.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can I pause you for one moment Mr 
Human? 
MR HUMAN:   Certainly. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   You referred above to AAR – sorry at the 
top of the page, at D, that AAR would make a cash contribution to the 
proposed partnership, is that normal practice? 
MR HUMAN:   Not in a procurement process, unless it was specified no 
it is not normal practice, not in a tender process sir. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 41 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the heading to what you have just read Mr 
Human is evaluation of AAR proposal. 
MR HUMAN:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is being done by the Board, who is also – is that 
also normal or would the evaluation be normally done by management 
who will then if necessary bring the recommendation to the Board or 
was this based on the recommendation of the Board anyway, it is just 
that it might not have been put like that. 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, Chairperson evaluation is ordinarily done by 
management, if it falls within the delegation of authority the value of 
10 
the contract it will be submitted to the Board for evaluation.   This 
strategic partnership process was not put to tender, it was not an open 
process, this is a proposal that was submitted, evaluated and adopted. 
 
In the procurement speak one would probably refer to this as 
an unsolicited bid, there wasn’t an RFQ, there was no formal process of 
inviting bids or testing the market, it is a submission and evaluated and 
awarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The records that you looked at in preparation for 
your statement did it reveal whether this unsolicited proposal went – or 
it didn’t go directly to the Board, it went to Mr Bezuidenhout is that 
20 
right, we dealt with that earlier. 
MR HUMAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay he was the CEO at the time of SAAT. 
MR HUMAN:   He was the Group CEO of SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   SAA. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 42 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:   SAA Airlines. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MR HUMAN:   And he referred this bid to the SAAT CEO at the time, Mr 
Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who would then have referred it to the Board? 
MR HUMAN:   To the SAAT Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the SAAT Board. 
MR HUMAN:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  I see we are close to the 
10 
tea adjournment, there is just one further aspect of these minutes I 
would like to deal with.  The collaboration agreement is dealt with as a 
separate item in the minutes, if you turn to 1058, can you just read for 
us the Board Resolution into the record, at the bottom of the page?  
MR HUMAN:   Chair in paragraph 4.3 in conclusion the Board resolved 
that Musa Zwane, the CEO of SAAT be authorised to sign on behalf of 
SAAT 
all 
necessary 
documentation 
to 
effect 
the 
collaboration 
agreement between SAAT and AAR, the SAAT components tender 
currently underway be placed on hold for three months to allow for the 
finalisation of the AAR partnership and three the current components 
20 
contract with Air France be extended for three months from the expiry 
date to allow for the finalisation of the SAAT AAR partnership 
agreement. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Mr Human.  Putting to one side 
for the moment the relationship between SAAT and AAR the extension 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 43 of 142 
 
of the contract with Air France what’s the lawfulness of that and does 
that require a procurement process?  
MR HUMAN:   The current public procurement framework allows for the 
variation or extension of contracts but to avoid the so-called evergreen 
extension upon extension of extension Treasury Instruction 3 has 
curbed these extensions to a maximum of 15%, and the reason for that 
decision was to ensure that procurement agencies are allowed to go on 
an open tender process without disrupting services but to prohibit an 
extension for ever and ever after, so it is allowable but within that 
limits specified in instruction 3 of 2016. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mbikiwa I was looking for the page which has got 
that resolution that Mr Human read earlier on before we came to 11.45, 
I thought it was 11.48 but 11.48 doesn’t seem to be ...[intervenes]  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair when we were at 11.48 we were within 
– or 11.43 rather we were within the collaboration agreement itself, but 
are you talking about the resolution of – to do with the evaluation of the 
proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think so, I am not sure.   No evaluation of the 
proposal is at 11 – 10.56.  The one we dealt with just before we came 
20 
back.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Just before – is it not 1056, or 1057.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just have a look.  No 1057 is ...[intervenes]  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Not that one? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no I don’t think ...[intervenes]   
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 44 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Chair it may have been Mr Human’s 
reproduction of the resolution in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In his affidavit, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Yes but we can take you to the actual 
resolution, it is at 1079. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1079.  Yes I think I may have been looking at his 
affidavit reproducing this.  The date for that resolution is 12 June 2015, 
but I see that in terms of the minutes at 1055 already in April it looks 
like the Board had effectively made similar decisions of more or less 
the same decisions, am I right, Mr Human?  
10 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I see there’s a resolution at 1037, the process 
followed by SAAT in evaluating AAR as a potential strategic partner in 
the context of the approved ...[indistinct] framework be and is hereby 
noted.   Two, the selection of AAR as one of SAAT’s strategic partners 
be and is hereby approved and recommended to SAA, so that’s already 
– that’s April. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And on 12 June 2015 that resolution at 1079 seems 
to either repeat the same in essence or say something very similar that 
20 
those resolutions, am I right, you have had more time to look at these 
documents than I have had. 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, correct Chairperson, the minutes in 1055 on page 
1955 dated 29 April is the resolution where the Board instructed SAAT 
to put the open tender, that was the second tender we mentioned 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 45 of 142 
 
earlier, on hold for three months to allow for the development of the 
tender and then on page 1079 the resolution pointed out here is after 
this framework has been developed and proposing to the Board now to 
enter into the agreement thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I guess that already in April one can see the 
thinking of the Board, is that right? 
MR HUMAN:   Correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair, that would be a 
convenient time to break for lunch.   For tea, sorry, that’s optimistic. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea adjournment, it is twenty past 
now, we will resume at twenty five to twelve.   
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay let us continue. 
MR HUMAN    Thank you Chair, before the tea adjournment we had 
concluded with the board meeting in April which had resolved to 
suspend the tender to allow for partnership with AAR to be explored.  
20 
You deal at paragraph 55 Mr Human with a various SAAT personnel 
visiting the USA.  Can you tell us what the documents revealed the 
purpose of that trip was? 
CHAIRPERSON    That is paragraph 55 of his affidavit. 
MR HUMAN    Of his affidavit, sorry Chair that is DD22A on Page 14. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 46 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes. 
MR HUMAN    Yes Sir.  The travel records in the position of SAAT 
indicates that Doctor Tami, Miss Kwinana, Mr Zwane and Advocate 
Memela visited the US from the 2 n d to the 8 t h of May and we have 
attached as an annexed copy of the allowances for accommodation, 
transfers, daily allowances and hotel reservations to substantiate the 
statements [Intervenes]. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Sorry, in your experience is it consistent 
with procurement and supply chair requirements to travel to and be 
hosted by a bidder while a tender is open? 
10 
MR HUMAN    The supply chain policy allows for engagement of 
suppliers in two manners. One: when samples are required, then there 
is engagement and it is well defined in the SCM Policy or as part of the 
evaluation process, in this case this process was not at the evaluation 
stage and the members that attended this engagement were not part of 
the evaluation committee.  They are of a other structure.  Board 
members and the head of procurement, so no, it is not practice.  There 
is a provision but under conditions well defined in the procurement 
policy to protect both supplies and the members involved in the 
evaluation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON    And the engagement that supply chain policy 
contemplates would not include the board, would they?  Or members of 
the board?  Or would they include them under certain circumstances, 
namely at, you said the one stage is when they look at samples and 
then another one as evaluation stage.  Would a member of the board be 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 47 of 142 
 
involved in those stages? 
MR HUMAN    Not at all Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON    Not at all. 
MR HUMAN    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Mr Human this is one aspect that Miss 
Kwinana has responded to in her statement in response to receipt of a 
Rule 33 notice.  She responds to the implication that it was improper 
for her to have participated in the trip.  It is not necessary to go to the 
statement.  I can give you the nub of what she says.  She says that 
10 
supplier visits are not unusual and that SAAT would not sign a MOU 
without knowing exactly who they dealing with.  What is your comment 
in response to that? 
MR HUMAN    If it was a evaluation of a service, the right person to 
maybe engage in such a visit would be the members of the cross 
functional sourcing team.  Two: The policy makes it clear that during 
the evaluation process contact should be prohibited except if it was 
part of the evaluation.  And thirdly Chairperson, the roles and 
responsibilities of board members or executive authorities are very 
clearly defined in the PFMA Act under public entities.  And that 
20 
certainly is not one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON    Just to take you back to the time when Miss Jackson 
sent their proposal to Mr Bezuidenhout.  At that stage had AAR put in 
their bid already?  Because that would have been before the board 
decided that the tender should be suspended for three months to allow 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 48 of 142 
 
for the finalisation for the MOU.  Is that something that you are able to 
clarify?  Namely whether when Miss Jackson sent the proposal for this 
partnership, she was or AAR was one of the bidders who were 
expecting their bids to be considered? 
MR HUMAN    Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Indeed Chair, Mr Human’s earlier evidence 
was that the closing date of the bid was the 2 n d of December 2014 and 
Miss Jackson sent the proposal on the 26 t h of February 2015 so 
[Intervenes].  
10 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    It was after the closure and during what 
would have been the evaluation stage. 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, okay. 
ADV 
MICHAEL 
MBIKIWA    
Mr 
Human 
there 
is 
then 
some 
correspondence that is attached to your affidavit that I would like to 
take you to.  If you can turn to 1266 in Annexure DD22C.  1266.  Are 
you there? 
MR HUMAN    Yes sir. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    This is an e-mail from Ken Hein to Miss 
20 
Noncasa Memela.  Do you know who Mr Hein is? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Mr Hein is a senior manager or senior 
executive at AAR at the time. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And in this email Mr Hein indicates that he 
and Mr Fiddes will be arriving on Wednesday morning and staying at 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 49 of 142 
 
the Inter-Continental Hotel and he asks if Miss Memela can fetch him.  
He then attaches some topics for discussion.  If you go over to 1267, if 
you look under discussion topics. 
MR HUMAN    Yes Sir. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    At the first bullet point, can you read that 
one? 
MR HUMAN    A full understanding of SAAT support requirements and 
needs versus the RFB. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Now this is at a stage when the tender will 
has not yet been retracted.  Would that be an appropriate discussion 
10 
for a bidder to be having with SAAT? 
MR HUMAN    Totally unappropriated. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Can I ask you then to turn to 1263, it is just 
a few [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON    Well I am sorry, I am sorry Mr Mbikiwa. The second 
bullet point seems quite interesting.  Current SAAT support; likes and 
dislikes of current support provided, do you know what that that is 
about? The ‘likes and dislikes.’ 
MR HUMAN    Sir, I have no written evidence of what that might mean. I 
will have to interpret but, 
20 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, okay, alright.  Well you have dealt with a lot of 
correspondence and minutes of meetings, are you able - based on your 
understanding of various minutes and correspondence that relate to 
this – are you able to say what you think that meant? 
MR HUMAN    Yes. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 50 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON    What did you, what do you think it meant? 
MR HUMAN    Chairperson, I am of the opinion that there is also 
evidence in the other documentation that a case was built that the 
service of Air France are unacceptable, and it is used as a motivation 
why this agreement should be further pursued.  It is my notion that this 
formulation probably points to a performance services and operating 
models that will be better suited to SAAT then what the then provider 
Air France were able to do. 
CHAIRPERSON    So the current supplier at the time was Air France. 
MR HUMAN    That is correct.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON    And the reference in that second bullet point to 
current SAAT support would be on your thinking would be a reference 
to Air France. 
MR HUMAN    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON    And therefore when he says likes and dislikes of 
current support provided it effectively, you say, it refers to what it is 
that SAAT did not like about the current support and what it is they 
liked. 
MR HUMAN    Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON    Which I think only logic says it would mean they want 
20 
to emphasize on the likes for their purposes and magnify the likes it, 
you could criticize, maybe the current support. 
MR HUMAN    Absolutely Chairperson. It is probably a method to solicit 
information that would strengthen the proposal that the supplier then 
would have put forward. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 51 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes. It is the kind of information that they would have 
wanted to use to strengthen their own either bid or if not bid the drive 
for this collaboration. 
MR HUMAN    Correct Sir. A common practice that is provided in the 
procurement legislation is so-called briefing sessions and then in an 
unbiased and manner that doesn’t favour only a specific supplier this 
kind of information will be presented to all potential suppliers. 
Government entities are given the opportunity to make it a compulsory 
briefing session and that would have been probably the correct vehicle 
to use to share information that bidders could use to strengthen their 
10 
bid and prepare quality proposal during the evaluation phase.  But it is 
certainly not practice and acceptable to share information with only one 
supplier and with constitute the unfair advantage.  
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you. Can I ask you then to turn to 
Page 1263? 
MR HUMAN    I am on the 163 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    1263 
MR HUMAN    Correct.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    You will see at the bottom there is an email 
20 
from Miss Lopez, Miss Sonya Lopez to Miss Mimela asking for 
transportation for various people from the Inter-Continental Hotel above 
that Miss Mimela forwards that to Mr Mike Kenny if I can ask you to 
then turn back to 1262. 
Miss Mimela then say thanks Mr Kenny, could you please let me know 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 52 of 142 
 
what when your guys go to fetch them so I can leave Premier Hotel to 
there further take note that we will be using operational purchasing 
board room and if I can ask you turn one page back  to 1261.  Mr Kenny 
informs Miss Memela that he will not make the meeting.  Miss Memela 
above that ask him Why? If I can go one page back.  Can I ask you to 
read Mr Kenny’s email at the bottom of 1260? 
MR HUMAN    Certainly.  Mr Kennys response to Advocate Memela I 
have a meeting with a customer regarding work in Uganda taking place 
in Kimberley and I am concerned about discussing component support 
issues with somebody who is a bidder in the process and the process is 
10 
still ongoing.  Operate governance issues.  However, I would not be 
available for this meeting anyway due to prior arrangements which have 
been confirmed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you.  And do you know who Mr Kenny 
is? 
MR HUMAN    Mr Kenny was the General Manger marketing or acting 
general manager marketing is his senior executive on the SAAT 
Exscope. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    The concern that Mr Kenny is expressing 
there is that one that you would share? 
20 
MR HUMAN    Absolutely 
CHAIRPERSON    And the e-mail is addressed to Miss Mimela. 
MR HUMAN    Yes Chairperson 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    You will see Miss Memela’s email above 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 53 of 142 
 
that says the process has been put on hold to which Mr Kenny then 
replies and says I understand that it is on hold but that means it is still 
open and ongoing. Is that also a view you would share? 
MR HUMAN    I would subscribe to that, yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON    So in other words that is on hold is no valid reson to 
have these kind of interactions with one of the bidders. 
MR HUMAN    Correct sir. There was a postponement or hold for three 
months but the bid was active. 
CHAIRPERSON    It had not been cancelled. 
MR HUMAN    Correct 
10 
MR HUMAN    It means that it could be continued and finalised.  So it 
would be inappropriate to engage with suppliers while there was an 
open bid under review.  
CHAIRPERSON    Would it be an answer to say, for what it is worth, 
could it be an answer to say the bids would.  The closing date had 
come and gone the bids were in and whoever needs to evaluate them 
and consider them is bound to consider them on the basis of the 
information already put in and not on the basis of any information that 
they might get from other meetings.  Would that be an answer at all? 
MR HUMAN    That would be correct Chairperson. The information to be 
20 
evaluated during the bid process would be what is submitted on the 
official closing date. 
CHAIRPERSON    So, to the concern that Mr Kenny raises could Miss 
Mimela say there is nothing we are going to discuss that is going to 
find it is way back into the bid or find it is way to into the bid 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 54 of 142 
 
documents?  So therefore, there is no problem with me meeting with 
them. 
MR HUMAN    The argument that Mr Kenny tries to convey that it is 
contrary to the provisions of the supply chain policy.  To engage 
suppliers while there is an open bid at hand.  Even if Advocate Mimela 
would argue that any additional information would not be concerned 
during the bid it is still very exposed process for undue influence. 
CHAIRPERSON    If she was not going to be involved in any 
adjudication of it, be it would that make a difference?  In other words, 
her meeting with her bidder in circumstances where the bids had, the 
10 
closing date had come and gone and she was not in any way going to 
be part of the people who adjudicate the bids.  Would that be answer to 
say well it cannot possibly affect the bids because I don’t sit in the 
committees that decide and whatever they might discuss they cannot 
supplement their bid.  Whatever they have put in that is how their bid 
would be judged? 
MR HUMAN    That would be a correct interpretation Chairperson. But 
Advocate Mimela was the Chairperson of the group BAC and can I just 
confirm the date. 
CHAIRPERSON    No, no it is enough if you say that she was a 
20 
Chairperson of the BAC, do on your understanding she would be 
involved in the adjudication of the bids. 
(Intervenes) 
MR HUMAN    As Chairperson 
CHAIRPERSON    So that argument would not be available to her 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 55 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN    Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay. Thank you 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you Chair.  The last piece of 
correspondence Mr Human I would like you to turn to is in the same file 
at Page 1278.   
CHAIRPERSON    So maybe just to complete what we are talking about 
a minute ago Mr Human, then the prohibition of any interaction with a 
bidder while a bid is a tender is pending and has not been decided the 
rational for a prohibiting that kind of interaction would apply to her fully 
because although this particular bidder could not add any document to 
10 
its bid.  Whatever was discussed here could well influence her thinking 
in making the decision even though it might be something that has not 
on the papers, on the bid. 
MR HUMAN    That would be correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you Chair.  Mr Human at the bottom 
of 1278 is an email from Ms Jackson, Where she says, “Hi all, last 
week Chris Phedis ,Ken Hein and I  SAA team and Leadership below 
the scope of work and listed initiatives that SAAT would like to work 
with AAR on or explore further as part of our partnership.  
20 
If I can ask you, in that scope of work just to turn to one two eight zero.  
And under timeline” 
CHAIRPERSON    That one two eight zero 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Yes.  Under timeline can you tell me what it 
says near June five? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 56 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN    It reads SAAT powered by the LRFQ, RFP request for 
proposal cancellation becomes official. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Does it strike you as odd that AAR would be 
aware Ms Jacksons email is dated the fourth of June, would be aware 
that a cancellation of a tender of which it was a bidder was becoming 
official? 
MR HUMAN    That strikes me as odd, yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON    Do you read that item to mean that SAAR had been 
given information that on that date namely five June.  The request for 
proposal would be cancelled officially.  That is how you read it. 
10 
MR HUMAN    Yes Chairperson.  It appears irregular that a bidder is 
aware that there would be a cancellation prior to the date of that 
cancellation. It would suggest to me that information made available 
were made available to the supplier outside of the normal procurement 
process. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    If you stay in the timeline and you go to 
June fifteen to seventeen it says PBH contract meetings during Pairs 
air show sign MOU BEE structured discussion June twenty two to 
twenty six SAAT MRO. 
Then at June thirty what does it say there? 
20 
MR HUMAN    Sign power by our contract with SAAT. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Does that strike you as unusual at all? 
MR HUMAN    Yes, because this would be a contract out of a normal 
procurement process in it would be quite strange to cancel a tender but 
then to sign a contract. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 57 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    For what looks like, the same services that 
were the subject of the tender. 
MR HUMAN    Yes Chairperson 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    If we can then turn to your affidavit Mr 
Human.  That is DD 22(a).  And we pick it up from paragraph 68.  Can 
you tell us whether an MOU was ultimately concluded? 
MR HUMAN    Chairperson a MOU was concluded and submitted for 
signature during the Paris air show. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And are you able to say what in broad terms 
it provided for? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON    I am sorry, did you say paragraph six eight? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Sixty-eight Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay, yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    It is from sixty-eight onwards Mr Human 
deals with the MOU. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Mr Human are you able to say in broad 
terms what the MOU provided for? 
MR HUMAN    The MOU provided for the collaboration between the AAR 
and SAAT concerning the provision of components the so called joined 
venture that was contemplated and I have the next to my affidavit 
20 
Chairperson as SH twenty seven.    
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Chair I do not think it is necessary to go 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, let me ask this question.  They called this 
collaboration agreement.  Is that right? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 58 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN    Yes sir 
CHAIRPERSON    At that stage, did the collaboration agreement not 
already give AAR the right to provide the services or components that 
were the subject for the tender or it was just quick guesser to that kind 
of agreement. 
MR HUMAN    Chairperson, on this date the collaboration agreement 
was not yet formally signed it was only the MOU indicting the intent to 
end up in a formal signed contract.  Later on in this affidavit we do 
elaborate a little bit more on how that process unfolds. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    On the, the further negotiation for a more 
definitive contract well I think let us go there Mr Human.  You deal with 
that at paragraph 82. 
MR HUMAN    That is correct 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Tell us what the agreement referred to there 
are. 
MR HUMAN    Chair, the intent was, the process of confirming the 
collaboration agreement was initiated by Mr Vedus by email by where 
he submitted draft letter of agreement and where requests clarification.  
Now the main intent was to enter into negotiations for the acceptable 
20 
definite written agreement in the provisions.  That is the standard terms 
and conditions.  Services, the scope thereof and obviously I anticipate 
pricing would be part of that.  It specifically pertains to routable 
component services.  Which was the intent of the original RFP in the 
first instance.  Letter contains a reference to exclusivity that makes it 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 59 of 142 
 
incumbent on SAAT not to engage with any other potential service 
providers. 
So this agreement, the collaboration agreement is nothing else than the 
request for proposal in a different format called a Collaboration 
Agreement.  In its intent and spirit it is exactly the services that was 
required from the RFP process. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    And Mr Human this is on the third of July 
so it is after the board is resolved to retract.  Would it be fair to say 
then that SAAT and AAR are in negotiations to conclude a contract for 
the very services that had been the subject matter of the tender that 
10 
was retracted? 
MR HUMAN:    Chairperson that would be an accurate articulation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:    I would like to jump ahead in the 
chronology a bit, two concerns that were raised about what we have 
been speaking about by one of the board members Mr Parsons.  Are 
you able to articulate for us what concerns he raised? 
MR HUMAN:  Chair, Mr Parsons was a Non-Executive Director serving 
on the board and he had certain concerns.  They relate to governance.  
They relate to the fact that the MoU were not made available to the 
board in time and that his commence on what he saw as fault lines or 
20 
weaknesses in the MoU were not adequately addressed.  He was also 
concerned that in terms of Section 54 of the PFMA an Executive 
Authority like SAAT needs to engage the National Treasury when it 
intends to enter into unincorporated joint ventures amongst other.  He 
addressed his concern in writing to the company secretary at the time. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 60 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was done in response to his 
concerns? 
MR HUMAN:  A legal opinion was invited through the group legal 
services which solicited an opinion from a private firm called Cliffe 
Dekker Hofmeyr and the expert that was assigned was a Mr Arrie. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what further steps did Mr Parsons take? 
MR HUMAN:  Mr Parsons thereafter raised his concerns to the chair of 
the board Ms Kwinana where he expressed his concern that he is the 
MoU with the points that he indicated as served before the SAA board 
with any improvements or alterations that would address his concerns 
10 
and mitigate what he has pointed out as governance- a break in 
governance. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was Mr Parsons final step? 
MR HUMAN:  Mr Parsons then submitted his resignation with immediate 
effect.  And that chairperson happened on- sorry, if you can just help 
me to get the exact date ... (intervenes) 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am going to ask you to go to Mr Parsons 
resignation letter. 
MR HUMAN:  Sure. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can go to DD22D. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  1676. 
MR HUMAN:  17? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  1676.  Can I ask you to read the first two 
paragraphs of that? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 61 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:  Certainly.  Chairperson the heading is, 
  
Resignation from SAA Technical Board.   
Please accept my resignation with immediate effect from the board of 
directors of SAA Technical SOC Limited.  I feel I have made a strong 
contribution to the board finding governance in the business week after 
what had appeared years of neglect.  Unfortunately, the value I can add 
seems no longer wanted and it is quite clearly due to the AAR 
Corporation strategic partnership.  There is clearly a hidden agenda 
somewhere in this relationship and it requires urgent independent 
investigation. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  So, would it be fair to say that 
Mr Parsons soul reason for resigning is the proposed partnership with 
AAR? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be necessary to highlight some of the 
features or other features of the letter.  I am not sure. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair the thrust of the letter is Mr Parsons 
is raising issues. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The fact that the issues he had raised in the 
past have not been adequately addressed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think let Mr Human just read the whole of that 
letter. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 62 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  Please go ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems to be an important letter. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Certainly Chair. 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, now the third paragraph reads as follows;   
A memorandum of understanding was signed by SAA Technical 
Management with AAR on 16 June 2015 which based on the version 
finally distributed at both my insistence and persistence to the SAA 
Technical and SAA boards on the 1 s t of July is fundamentally flawed.  I 
sought guidance on this matter from the SAA Technical Board 
chairperson on the 2 n d of July however I have received only a poor and 
10 
evasive explanation from management.  And I was shocked to the see 
the same version of the MoU submitted to the SAA Board the 
shareholder for the board meeting on the 10 t h of July over three weeks 
after the execution.   
On 13 July the SAA Technical Board chairperson offered to meet to 
understand my concerns and this was scheduled for 17 July and then 
postponed to the 24 t h of July.  My concerns are quite concise and 
summarised in the attached email read Annexure A.  However there 
appears to be no hurry to ensure either SAA Technical or the SAA 
boards are either briefed or received the correct version of this MoU 
20 
and are able to understand the full implications of the strategic 
partnership or any implementation steps already completed five weeks 
after the execution.   
Apart from the lack of visibility of the precise nature of this relationship 
and the overall governance I have specific concerns whether the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 63 of 142 
 
requirement I raised at the last SAA Technical board meeting in May for 
the partnership to deliver lower maintenance cost to SAA and Mango is 
fully considered.  Having cancelled the components tender to 
accommodate the exclusivity in the AAR relationship we are already 
adversely impacting both SAA and Mango’s maintenance cost for the 
financial year 2016 from a position where the cost base of SAA 
Technical is already uncompetitive.  This consequently impacts the cost 
compression targets committed to National Treasury in the 2015 SAA 
Corporate Plan.   
My other specific concern is the identification and selection for BEE 
10 
partners for the purpose of a joint venture.  A process that needs to be 
highly transparent in a business that has already has uncompetitive 
cost base.  The copy of the MoU received includes an implementation 
time table that suggest the process may already be significantly 
advanced and there is no visibility of this to either the SAA Technical 
board or to National Treasury.   
I hope the company shares my concerns and appreciate I can have no 
confidence in the integrity of the SAA Technical board.  And my 
membership of that board has become a reputational matter and it is a 
simple decision to submit my resignation. 
20 
 
Yours sincerely Larry Parsons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I did not ask you a certain question that I 
thought I would ask you much earlier.  When we were looking at one of 
the resolutions of the SAAT board that we looked at earlier there was a 
resolution that was approving the conclusion of I think memorandum of 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 64 of 142 
 
understanding with AAR.  And then towards the end the sentence said 
“and recommended to SAA”.  Do you remember seeing something like 
that? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that in regard to the MoU or was it in regard to 
something else? 
MR HUMAN:  It was specifically to the MoU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  MoU.  I wanted to find out what your understanding is 
of that last portion.  That the SAAT board was recommending something 
to the SAA board and if it was the MoU, what is your understanding of 
10 
what- how that came about?  How do they- how does the board of one 
entity recommend something for the board of another entity even if they 
are in the same group? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  Chairperson, SAAT is 100% owned by the SAA main 
group and therefore the main shareholders so in their framework there 
is a requirement to report on material transactions.  This would 
constitute a material transaction.  And my understanding is that the 
board’s rational to submit it to SAA was first for noting purposes but 
also because it represented a huge financial aspect of its annual 
turnover.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have misunderstood that portion of that 
resolution.  I thought it meant something along the lines that the SAAT 
board was recommending that SAA should have a similar MoU with 
AAR.  But probably that is not what it meant.  It meant they were 
recommending that SAA should approve that they have this MoU with 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 65 of 142 
 
AAR.  Is that right? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct.  The intention was not for SAA to have a 
similar MoU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  It was a submission for the noting and indorsement by the 
SAA board. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Human if we can return to 
your affidavit, I would like to now move on to tender SP451/15 and 
453/15.  That is in DD22A, the file with your affidavit on page 28 from 
paragraph 98. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do- you move on.  The Mr Parsons letter 
of resignation says at the end of paragraph 2 that there should be an 
urgent independent investigation.  Do you know whether the company 
secretary or the board either of SAA or SAAT took that suggestion and 
followed it up? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson yes, a legal opinion was requested from 
Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr and I think we are going to deal with that shortly 
on ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say Advocate Hofmeyr? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not this one?  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  It was a slip of the tongue Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  No pun intended. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, it is not clear to me that that was in 
Commented [BD1]:  
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 66 of 142 
 
response to Mr Parsons resignation letter because the opinion that we 
have from CDH is a draft preliminary one which predates Mr Parsons 
resignation.  I am not sure that we are aware of any other independent 
investigation that was undertaken post Mr Parsons resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Human, do you go along with that or do you know 
that there was some independent investigation that followed his 
resignation?  Based on the correspondence and minutes that you have 
seen. 
MR HUMAN:  Chair I was of the opinion that the email dated 27 July on 
paragraph 97 of my affidavit is a response to Mr Parsons concerns and 
10 
that Mr Arrie in his response to the legal department and Advocate 
Memela raised- says that Mr Parsons has mostly raised non legal 
issues.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR HUMAN:  But the only thing that he is- that needs to be corrected is 
the signing of the MoU and then to submit it to the board.  I am 
referring to paragraph 97 of the affidavit and Annex 54A as a 
supporting document. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  Is that correct.  I think can we clarify just the timing?  Mr 
20 
Parsons resigned on 24 July. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
MR HUMAN:  And then this email that was provided to me and that I 
have access confirms that on the 27 July this response has been 
forthcoming. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 67 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair we can go to the response from Cliffe 
Dekker Hofmeyr.  I do not think it is an independent investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is a response from ... (intervenes) 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Arrie to the internal legal person at SAAT 
simply saying that he cannot really deal with it because it raises some 
non-legal issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  I agree with that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree with that? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV 
MICHAEL 
MBIKIWA: 
 
Chair 
of 
course 
the 
independent 
investigations that we do have in the record are those conducted by 
Open Water. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But that of course occurs much later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In 2017.  Mr Human, can we then deal with 
20 
tender SP451/15 and 453/15, what were these tenders and how did they 
differ from the previous ones? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We going back to his affidavit now? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are at his affidavit Chair at page 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 68 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  On paragraph 98. 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson these two tenders are now number 3 and 4 of 
the 5 tenders that were published to solicit the component services.  It 
was agreed that this should be a closed bid and that SAAT would only 
invite a number of suppliers.  So, in tender number 3 (451/15) was a 
short-term tender to obtain services for five months and it was issued 
to only five suppliers, Air France, Israel Aerospace, Pegasus and 
Lufthansa.  Later- I apologise. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Continue.  Please continue. 
MR HUMAN:  It later appeared from the advice also from CDH that 
10 
SAAT would be at risk not to invite a bid from AAR.  The reason why 
AAR was excluded from the closed bid is unbeknown to me.  But it was 
remedied when this very same tender, the very same request for 
proposal was then issued under SP453/15 to AAR to make this process 
complete.  So, 453 is really just a reissuing of the same tender also to 
AAR. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what is your understanding of why they 
were only a four or five month contract? 
MR HUMAN:  The reasons why it was only a four or five month contract 
is to allow enough time to finalise the agreement with AAR with 
20 
collaboration partnership. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So, in other words it is in pursuance of the 
board resolution retracting the previous tender. 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you recall whether AAR did submit a 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 69 of 142 
 
bid? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes, AAR did submit a bid after asking for extension in 
the response time. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you remember who its BEE partner 
was? 
MR HUMAN:  The bid submission that was submitted indicates that AAR 
identified Nziza Aviation as its strategic partner. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And who was this tender ultimately awarded 
to? 
MR HUMAN:  This tender was also not awarded.  A decision was taken 
10 
to extend it to Air France for a continuity of service, the rational being 
to conclude the agreement with AAR in the meantime. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Your evidence at paragraph 114 is that the 
board in fact resolved to award it to Air France. 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But that that was an award of the tender. 
MR HUMAN:  It award of the five month tender. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So just to clarify from your previous 
evidence.  Was it simply an extension of Air France as the incumbent or 
was it an award of a new tender to Air France? 
20 
MR HUMAN:  It was an award to Air France not an extension. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Alright.  Much of what you have dealt with in 
respect of these two tenders we heard from Ms Sambo yesterday.  So, I 
intend to proceed to what you have described as the 5 t h tender and to 
deal with some of the process issues in respect of that in some detail. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 70 of 142 
 
   
So, if we can turn to page 37 of your affidavit.  Can you tell us 
what this tender was and how it differed from previously? 
MR HUMAN:  This tender is a request for services for 5 years for 
component tender and is in essence the very same as the previous 
tenders. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I would like to take you to the bid invitation 
document just to focus on a few clauses in it.  If I can ask you to go to 
Exhibit DD22E and page 2043.  It is DD22E, 2043.  Can you read for us 
what the date issued is? 
MR HUMAN:  The sender was ... (intervenes) 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry, let me ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Let me pause.  Chair, I see you have not yet 
got your file.  It is 2043 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2043. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Exhibit 84. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is this?  Is this an RFB? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  This is the RFB for what we are describing 
as the 5 t h tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  On the affidavit where does the 5 t h tender 
20 
start? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The 5 t h tender starts on page 37. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the heading is on 36. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes, the heading is at the bottom of the 
page. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 71 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But there is no paragraph below it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So, we start at page- paragraph 133.  Mr 
Huma, can you tell us what the issued date and the closing date was of 
this tender? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes, so the issued date was 8 December 2015 and the 
closing date 19 January 2016. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  And if I can take you just to a 
few clauses in this document.  Can you turn first to 2062?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us first get the witness to confirm 
where the document ends.  It starts at 2043 and ends at what page?  Is 
it 2086? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Are you at 2062? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what is that table? 
MR HUMAN:  The table found on page 2062 is the critical criteria that 
suppliers are required to comply to, to qualify for this bid. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What is the consequence of not complying? 
MR HUMAN:  If the critical criteria is not met this- the bid will not 
proceed to the next phase of evaluation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can- in the table if you go ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let him read all of them. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 72 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  If you would read each of those 
critical criteria Mr Human. 
MR HUMAN:  The first one is, sufficient experienced and equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sufficiently experienced and equipped. 
MR HUMAN:  Equipped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMAN:  Thanks Chair.   
Is of sufficient sound financial standing to carry out satisfactory any 
contract that may be awarded pursuant to the tender.   
Must be certified for FAA EASA as a repair station.  FAA is the Federal 
10 
Aviation Authority, the American equivalent of our Civil Aviation 
Authority and EASA is the European Aviation Authority.   
Must offer and access pool or exchange bases.  No fault found rate 
20% BER rate ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know what that requirement relates to?  No 
fault found rate?  That is a rate for what? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson sometimes ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you know. 
MR HUMAN:  I know.  A component might be removed, sent to a repair 
facility and when they test it, it is working perfectly.  And to encourage 
20 
MROs to do decent fault finding before spending excessive money, they 
charge a rate of 20% to deter this practice of just willy-nilly sending a 
component for testing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR HUMAN:  BER rate is Beyond Economic Repair rate of 70%. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 73 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I just pause you there?  What does it 
mean for the BER rate to be 70%? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just remind me also what BER stands for. 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson when a component is faulty and sent to a 
repair facility and the repair cost would eventually be more than the 
cost of a new one.  Then it is not really worthwhile to ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like a write-off if it was a car. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR HUMAN:  It is not worthwhile to ... (intervenes) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Repair it. 
MR HUMAN:  Correct.  Ja and instead of then paying the full value of 
the repair this tender asks for that 70% will be covered and that SAAT 
will only pay 30% of the value.  So this ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  So yes, at a practical level let us say a component 
was found to be a write-off as it were, what would that mean for SAAT?  
In the- what or for any service provider or any entity in its position, 
what did this mean?  Did it mean that they would not- they would be 
charged 70% of what otherwise it would have cost them to have the 
component repaired?  In other words, there is special dispensation that 
20 
although normally you would not repair such a component because it is 
a write-off. 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will repair it but you would charge us only 70%.  
Is that what it means? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 74 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson more or less.  It means that if a component 
is found that the cost of repairing it would not really be worthwhile it 
should be written off that this supplier needs to carry 70% of the cost.  
So if the value was R100,00 – R70.00 would be for the account of the 
supplier and SAAT would need to pay R30.00 towards this component.  
It is almost like an insurance policy.  Every month you pay insurance 
for your car and if it is written off there is an access amount that you – 
that you need to pay to repair it.  It is the same con – principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – but why would SAAT for example want – 
want a part that is supposed to be written off back and pay for it.  Is it 
10 
because the – a new one might be more expensive? 
MR HUMAN:  It will be actually cheaper to have a new one than to 
repair it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why would they want one that is old and has been 
used when they can get a new one cheaper? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or am I missing something? 
MR HUMAN:  No it is very pertinent and relevant questions if I could – 
like to clarify.  When a component becomes beyond economic repair it 
needs to be scrapped.  It would be defaced, cut up into pieces and 
20 
discarded.  But to replace the unit in the inventory of the pool you need 
to contribute to buying a new one and we share the cost.  So SAAT 
would pay 30% towards the purchase of a new one and the supplier 
70%.  It is a mechanism – these components are quite expensive.  It is 
not uncommon to pay R3 or 4 or 5 million for a component and then the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 75 of 142 
 
cost is just not possible to bear for the airline.  So this mechanism is 
possible to share the cost.  The equivalent of insurance premiums 
would be the flight hour rate.  So if I may give a practical example?  At 
the moment SAAT pays more or less 100 000.00 Dollars every month 
towards possible BER occurrences. It is like the insurance policy.  If a 
component fails – say it was a Adiro – Adiro is a component that is 
used to measure air speed, temperatures and the instruments on a – on 
a – it is linked to the instrumentation in the cockpit but it is quite 
expensive.  It costs above R5 – R6 million then SAAT would only pay 
30% and the supplier must pay the remaining. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yes you were still going to 
finish just read into the record those – all those requirements? 
MR HUMAN:  The next one is AD – AD’s mandatory.  An AD is a 
airworthiness directive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMAN:  Many times manufacturers would issue improvements.  It 
is like maybe you get a new version of Microsoft on your computer.  In 
this case it is a directive, it is compulsory to – to replace.  AD’s non-
mandatory.  Warranties. The sessions of warranties to reduce rates.  
Chairperson if you buy a new aircraft it comes under a warranty and 
20 
any components that would be faulty will then fall under a warranty 
claim.  This criteria is for the supplier to deal with those warranties.  It 
can be sometimes quite complicated.  Supplier Development must equal 
to 10% of the contract value and a proposal needs to be included.  
Reciprocal Work must equal to 10% of the contract value and must 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 76 of 142 
 
include a proposal.  It must be willing to enter into a partnership joint 
venture with SAAT which is equal to 10% of the contract value and must 
be a 24 hour, 360 days per year service.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  If you can then turn to page 
2064.  And you will see the table at the bottom of that page.  You refer 
to one of the requirements being supplier development.  Just describe – 
it is not necessary to read the block but just describe for us what 
supplier development is? 
MR HUMAN:  Supplier Development would be initiatives that will 
10 
empower local suppliers to become competitive in this industry.  It also 
deals with a localisation SMME development, job creations and is 
aligned to the government’s developmental objectives of empowerment 
described in the BEE Act and the BBBFA Act. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you to just read the last sentence 
of that block into the record? 
MR HUMAN:   
“A bidder to indicate what value they would place on 
each area of development based on the above and 
which they would be impacting – imparting to the 
20 
local vendor.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  And then lastly if we can go to 
2085?  This refers to something you spoke about earlier.  The NIP 
obligation.  Just tell us what – what a NIP obligation is? 
MR HUMAN:  A NIP obligation will be applicable to any contract that is 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 77 of 142 
 
worth more than 10 million US Dollars over its term.  It requires 
agreement with the DTI and the scope thereof and that at least 30% of 
that contract value be applied to NIP – to obligations back into the 
country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please remind me about what NIP stands for again? 
MR 
HUMAN: 
 
Chairperson 
it 
is 
the 
National 
Industrialisation 
Participation Programme. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  We will return to those aspects 
when we discuss the contract and its implementation.  Before we get to 
10 
the evaluation and adjudication of the bid you have dealt in your 
affidavit and we return… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We going back to the affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are going back to the affidavit, sorry 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just remember to announce. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I will Chair sorry about that.  We are back in 
DD22a.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what page must I go to? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To page 37 please Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry that is a mistake it is 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 78 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And you deal from paragraph 137 onwards 
Mr Human with documents that reveal a property purchase and salary 
increases granted to Ms Memela.  Can you tell us about that? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson I have been provided with documentation 
that demonstrates that Advocate Memela purchased a property in 
Bedfordview to the value of R3.8 million and that it was registered on 
the 11 July.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry which paragraph at 38 are you re? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At – from paragraph 137 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
10 
MR HUMAN:  In addition we have documentation confirming a salary 
increase for Advocate Memela approved by the SAAT Acting CEO and 
Chair – SAAT Chairperson.  We are not sure whether this was a 
performance related increase or what would have triggered the increase 
at this stage.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Does the increase in her salary coincide with the 
customary time when increases are effected on staff remuneration at 
SAAT or is that something you would not know? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson it is out of cycle salary adjustment which we 
– which I gathered from the documentation submitted referred to in 
20 
paragraph 140. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMAN:  So it is definitely – it is not the normal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Annual. 
MR HUMAN:  Annual increments. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 79 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  Or increase percentages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You might wish to raise your voice a 
bit.  I think it might be going down so that everybody can hear you. 
MR HUMAN:  Certainly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human those facts were included in the 
Open Water investigation.  Are you aware if the Open Water 
investigation discovered that JM Aviation R.5 million towards a house 
that Ms Memela bought in 2016? 
10 
MR HUMAN:  Based on the report yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we then turn to the evaluation and 
adjudication process in the tender?  And that you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That last bit is that in a page somewhere else in 
another document not in Mr Human’s affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No Chair it is not.  In fact that was not in 
the Open Water investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  But Ms Memela has been notified about 
it? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The fact – the fact that she bought the 
20 
house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Is in the Open Water investigation.  That is 
subject of the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 80 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What I am asking Mr Human is whether he is 
aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Whether Open Water discovered that JM 
Aviation paid R2.5 million towards the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no what I am asking is whether that report – she 
is aware that report will be part of what we will discuss here? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Oh indeed Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We have engaged with Ms Memela about 
10 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we then turn to the evaluation and 
adjudication process Mr Human.  We pick that up at paragraph 141 on 
page 39.  Can you talk us through what – what happened in the 
evaluation process of the fifth tender? 
MR HUMAN:  We have already Chairperson indicated that this tender 
was published in December 2015 and closed on – in 2016 – early 2016 
20 
after it was received across functional sourcing team convened and 
they embarked on the evaluation of the tender.  They used the criteria 
that we have referred to earlier as the basis for evaluating compliant 
bidders and then the process to consider the financial offers.  During 
this process Chair – I would just like to clarify the question is 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 81 of 142 
 
specifically about evaluation or also including the adjudication? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  If we can just deal with the evaluation in the 
first instance. 
MR HUMAN:  Okay.  Okay.  The Chairperson of this committee was a 
Mr Roberts at the time he was responsible for chairing this committee 
and part of the procurement department.  The evaluations took place 
and bidders were asked for best and final offers.  Reduced bids were 
then returned during April where the – the bidders indicated reduced 
prices.  Final submissions were then considered and the cross 
functional team signed off unfortunately it is undated document which I 
10 
refer to in paragraph 146 of the affidavit.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was the recommendation of the 
CFST?  You deal with that at paragraph 47 – 147. 
MR HUMAN:  So Chairperson after this process the recommendation 
was that Lufthansa be – that Lufthansa is appointed for both the boeing 
and the airbus fleets.  The CFST recommended the winning bidder or 
the recommended bidder to be Lufthansa.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And tell us what happened next in the 
process? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Lufthansa had offered the lowest price, is that 
20 
right? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking at 145. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the next lowest was JM/AAR Corporation 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 82 of 142 
 
and then F – Air France, is that right? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson no. The next step was that after this 
recommendation the cross functional team was requested that they 
should ask the bidders to confirm whether they actual understood the 
scope well and they had to provide written confirmation to this effect 
and supply a list of their current customers before submitting yet 
another best and final offer. I am in 41 – 8.1 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you? 
MR HUMAN:  148.1 Chairperson at the top of page 0041. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I was asking you something that is at 145. 
10 
MR HUMAN:  I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Mbikiwa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this covered and I just missed it or… 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No Chair it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you planning to come to that? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I am grateful for you to – for going there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human the – the question is, after the 
final submission you have spoken… 
20 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Spoken about the best and final offer 
process. 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  After those best and final offers my 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 83 of 142 
 
understanding of Chair’s question is, what was the ranking of the prices 
of the bidders? 
MR HUMAN:  Lufthansa offered the lowest price Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And then? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It was followed by JM Aviation or JM/AAR 
Aviation and then Air France. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay you can continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I see that in response to the last of the best 
and final offer requests AAR reduced its price by R49 million.  Is it – is 
it common practice to have best and final offers in a tender process like 
10 
this? 
MR HUMAN:  It is a common practice to negotiate on price.  Ja it is 
practice to ask for better price quotations. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you – when you – when that is asked it is 
basically to get the bidders to give their final, final position or prices? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it – it need not be prices only there could be 
other aspects of the bid in – that they put up which might be – which 
might enhance their prospects? 
20 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson usually evaluation committees finish their 
evaluations in totality and then would enter into negotiations with the 
winning bidder.  And in that process price beneficial terms, quality 
standards and training or other benefits would be negotiated.  In big 
tenders that is usually how the process is run.  If it is following this in 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 84 of 142 
 
this pattern.  But to negotiate with all bidders is possible when there is 
the so called two envelope system when – when the bidders go through 
a functionality everybody that passes functionality the critical criteria 
then goes to the second phase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But my – my question was, is it correct that when a 
request is made for a bidder’s best offer that is not necessarily limited 
or confined to price? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It could include other terms and conditions or other 
aspects that the bidder thinks if they made some amendments on that 
10 
could enhance their – the conclusion of an agreement. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chairperson that – that does happen that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But mostly it is the price. 
MR HUMAN:  It is mostly price and then after award all the other 
conditions are negotiated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human you were then after telling us the 
– 
the 
different 
prices 
after 
the 
final 
submission 
and 
the 
recommendation of the CFST for Lufthansa you were busy telling us 
about the meeting, the CFST meeting of 25 April which you deal with at 
20 
148.  Do you want to finish telling us about that meeting? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  So Chairperson after the evaluation and the 
submission of the cross-functional team recommending Lufthansa on 
the 25 April the cross-functional sourcing team once again met and 
based on the Minutes of this meeting it is disclosed that the – that all 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 85 of 142 
 
suppliers were requested to confirm that they understood the scope 
correctly and provide a list of their current customers with a second 
best and final offer.  The rationale for this decision Chairperson was 
that the prices were regarded as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Too low? 
MR HUMAN:  Or quite low yes.  In the industry it is called low balling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  Where a bidder may be under quotes but then later the – 
the service is comprised due to financial constraints. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMAN:  Or possibly a compromise in quality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair this might be an appropriate time at 
which to take the lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether it might be convenient to finish what 
he has to say about that meeting. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless you think it is going to take quite some time? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  No I think we – I think that makes sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us finish that meeting ja. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Let us – let us finish the meeting.  What 
else happened at that meeting? 
MR HUMAN:  At the meeting Advocate Memela also joined and she 
emphasised the urgency to finalise this project.  The meeting took note 
the cross-functional sourcing team meeting took note of the feedback 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 86 of 142 
 
on pricing of the three bidders that being Lufthansa, Air France and 
AAR and the risks that was identified were considered at this meeting.  
The meeting also noted that although Lufthansa is the lowest bidder 
there was still outstanding NIP obligations and that should be a 
concern to the team.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And what was the conclusion of the 
meeting? 
MR 
HUMAN: 
 
The 
cross-functional 
team 
then 
changed 
its 
recommendation to award the contract to Air France. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And just one last question.  Is it – is it 
10 
normal practice – you said earlier that Advocate Memela was the Chair 
of the Bid Adjudication Committee is it standard practice for the Chair 
of the Bid Adjudication Committee to chair – to attend a meeting of the 
CFST? 
MR HUMAN:  No it is normal practice Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  It is – what is not normal practice? 
MR HUMAN:  The principle of adjudication committee and of evaluation 
committee is segregation of duties so it is not common that the 
Chairperson of the BAC would attend the proceedings of a cross-
functional team. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the – the one is higher than the other? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they have different functions? 
MR HUMAN:  They have different functions and the intent is that there 
should be checks and balances that is a way to keep each other 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 87 of 142 
 
accountable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well the – you say here Advocate Memela that 
is 148.2 Advocate Memela joined the meeting at this stage.  Do the 
Minutes reflect that – do the minutes reflect the basis upon which she 
joined – she joined the meeting?  Was she invited by anybody in that 
meeting?  Did she come on her own? 
MR HUMAN:  No Chair it is not clear to me whether she was invited.  
The minutes we will have to refer back to the minutes if you allow it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair perhaps I can refer you to the minutes 
10 
just before we adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is in DD22f. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  At page 225 – page 2245. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  225 you said. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  2245. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2245 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  In –  
CHAIRPERSON:  You want him to repeat the bundle number? 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  DD22f. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not have that page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  2245. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2245.  Bring here.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I think it is E.  Sorry Chair.  Sorry Chair it is 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 88 of 142 
 
– it must be DD22e.  My apologies for that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Yes.  2245 and if you look in the minutes 
three lines down in the table it says NM joined the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the third column, horizontal column, is that 
right? 
MR HUMAN:    Yes Chair. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Third row ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So and that NM would refer to Ms Nontsasa 
Memela.  So she was not at the meeting when it started but joined it 
10 
when it was in progress.  Would that be your understanding Mr Human 
as well? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson in the – the present column it just indicates 
present.  It is unclear to me when – at what stage of the meeting the 
Advocate joined the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well – well it seems to me that if she was there 
from the beginning there would have been no need for them to say she 
joined if she was there from the beginning.  So it must be that she 
joined when the meeting was in progress.  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  That would be a fair comment Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair perhaps I can just read into the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  es. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  What the minutes reflect. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 89 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   
“NM joined the meeting to emphasise the urgency on 
completing this project and to give guidance where 
necessary.  She also stated that the Board will be 
sitting this week and a submission needs to be ready 
by Tuesday [26.04.2016] to be tabled at the Board 
Meeting.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will take the lunch adjournment at this 
stage and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us continue. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Human, we had just 
before the lunch adjournment dealt with the CFST Meeting which 
resolved that SAAT should award the contract to Air France and we 
spoke - we were speaking about the fact that Ms Memela had joined 
20 
that meeting and we - we referred to the minutes. 
Can I ask you to take us through what happened at the BAC 
and Board level after that CFST recommendation? 
MR HUMAN:  So sir … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe - maybe before you do that it seems odd to me 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 90 of 142 
 
that if they had a problem with Lufthansa for one reason or another 
which provided the lowest price.  They should skip the next lowest price 
and go to Air France.  Is there something you picked up in the minutes 
or correspondence that explains that? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chairperson.  The question of lowballing or 
unrealistically low price has been cited as one of the reasons why it 
was passed over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So - so even with Air - Air France it was 
lowballing that was the concern or there was more than that? 
MR HUMAN:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even with Lufthansa.  I am sorry.  Even with 
Lufthansa.  The reason why they did not give it to Lufthansa was 
because of lowball - balling only or because of lowballing and other 
concerns? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, the - the recommendation why Lufthansa 
was passed over was because of their outstanding NIP obligation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  As a first reason and then the recommendation to award 
to Air France as the more expensive one was put forward by the Cross 
Functional Support Team. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So J - J - was it JV or J - JM.  JM and … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  J … 
CHAIRPERSON:  AAR. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were seen to have done lowballing? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 91 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the implications of that as you said is that if they 
were to take JM/AAR there could be problems about the quality of the 
products or service later on arising from the fact that the price they - 
they offered was just too low. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be the fear. 
MR HUMAN:  That - that seems to be from the documentation the 
reasoning of the Cross Functional Team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR HUMAN:  At that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human, can you then take us through the 
- the BAC and Board process that followed? 
MR HUMAN:  Certainly.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and we will get that from where in the affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry Chair.  We are on page 41 of the 
affidavit … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And we dealt with the meeting in the 
subparagraphs in one - in paragraph 148. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR HUMAN:  Hm. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 92 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Human. 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, so the Chair of the Cross Functional Team 
Mr Robbertse prepared a draft recommendation and he requested on 
26 April Advocate Memela to review the submission.  Thereafter it was 
further processed with a recommendation as Air France as the - as the 
- to be awarded. 
A submission was submitted 
for adjudication 
and 
on 
6 May 2016 as per paragraph 1-5-2 of the affidavit Chairperson the 
BAC resolved on a round robin process the - the intention to award this 
to Air France.  Due to the value of this tender and the delegation of 
10 
authority the recommendation from the BAC was to the SAAT Board for 
a final recommendation. 
So there was a Special Board Meeting Chair arranged for 
9 May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that just to go back again.  Mr Robbertse was 
Chairperson of the CFST.  Is that right? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So after they had made the decision that they made 
at the meeting dealt with under 1-4 - at paragraph 1-4-8 to award the 
contract to Air France.  Did he then send Air France’s submission to 
20 
Advocate Memela for review of the submission? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh; and - and would that be normal or would that 
have been because subsequent to the meeting he picked up something 
or became uncertain of their decision?  Is that something you could tell 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 93 of 142 
 
from the documentation? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  Chair from the documentation it appears if this was 
a quality review.  It was a - a staff member asking a superior to do a 
quality review on the submission and take inputs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that would be normal? 
MR HUMAN:  That I think is fairly normal to - to give guidance and 
advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
MR HUMAN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we - we - with regard to guidance I remember 
10 
that in the minutes of the meeting of the CFST that we dealt with before 
lunch where the minutes say Ms Memela joined the meeting.  It does 
say for guidance or something like that.  If I remember … 
MR HUMAN:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I saw something like that. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So could it be that she would have been permitted 
then to even come into a meeting to give guidance if she is allowed to 
give guidance outside of the meeting? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   
20 
MR HUMAN:  Chair, I think the distinguishing difference would be in an 
evaluation process one allows the committee to follow the terms of 
reference and conclude their work.  The recommendation was still firm 
Air France and there was a recommendation the difference is it is - it is 
for a technical review on the - on the completeness and accuracy of the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 94 of 142 
 
submission not to alter the award or outcome. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Human, there is just two 
documents that you have actually referred to that I would like to go to.  
Can we start with the minutes of the BAC Meeting on - of 6 May?  You 
will find that in DD22E at page 2-3-0-2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-0 …? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  2-3-0-2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-3-0-2. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is behind Tab 95.  Sorry Chair.  I have - I 
10 
have made an error again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We are in F. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  DD22F. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the tab number correct or is …? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The tab number is correct.  It is 95 -Tab 95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So if you start on page 2-2-9-9.  You will 
see that this document is the minutes of the SAA Bid Adjudication 
20 
Council Meeting held on 6 May and if you then go to 2-3-0-2.  
Mr Human, can I ask you to read 11 - paragraph 11.2 into the record? 
MR HUMAN:  Chair, the heading is: 
“Aircraft Component Support 80A Chapter Coverage 
SP462/15.  The BAC considered the request and 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 95 of 142 
 
notes SAAT intention to award the tender for 
aircraft components support to - on 80A Chapter 
Coverage for both Boeing and Airbus Fleet to Air 
France Industries for a period of five years as per 
Chapter 25 of the SEN Policy.  The value of the 
contract for the five year period for Air France 
Industries is estimated at R1.346 billion.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  You can read the BAC 
Resolution. 
MR HUMAN:  “The BAC resolved to round robin the 
10 
submission as there - as there was no sufficient 
quorum to make a decision on it.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Now Mr Human, the - the first sentence you 
read said: 
“The BAC considered the request to note SAAT’s 
intention to award the tender …” 
Does that accord with your understanding of what a BAC’s role is? 
MR HUMAN:  The - the capturing of the sentence is because there was 
no quorum and according to the terms of reference of the BAC if there 
is not a minimum number of - of members they do not have the mandate 
20 
to take - make an award decision.  So all that they could do in terms of 
their mandate was to note and defer it to a round robin process. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can we then go to the minutes of the 
Board which considered it on referral from the BAC and that is at 
2-3-0-5?  Well it starts at 2-3-0-4. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 96 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Based on what - is it 2-3-0-2 - the resolution.  I would 
expect us to go to the round robin resolution before going to the 
minutes of the Board.  So that we know what the outcome of that round 
robin was before we go to the Board. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, Ms Hofmeyr has just helping me to 
see if we have got - if we have got that resolution.  I am not - I am not 
sure that we do have the round robin resolution of the BAC? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  If we do not it.  At least we must just know what - 
10 
what the outcome was.  So that the - the story can connect properly, 
because the - 2-3-0-2 ends with a resolution to do a round robin. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Or … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair, we - we do not have it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not have it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And so we are going to have to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Do some further investigations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you by any chance know Mr Human what 
happened or you do not know? 
MR HUMAN:  Chair, unfortunately I do not have a document close by 
hand. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 97 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Huh-uh. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can we then go to page 2-3-0-4 - 
Mr Human?  This is the minutes of the Special Meeting of the SAAT 
Board and if we go over the page to 2-3-0-5 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-3-0-4 is the one that has got 95 written by hand on 
it or something? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  95A chair.  That is the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  95A. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA: 
 
That 
is 
the 
annexure 
number. 
 
It 
corresponds with the blue Tab 95. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wish somebody could write somewhere.  Not on 
top of the page number … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it makes it difficult to see if it is - what - 
what the number is - page number is.  Okay.  Alright.  You say we go to 
2-3-0-5? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  2-3-0-5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Oh.  These - these are minutes of … 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A meeting of the Board of … 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Of South African Airways Technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SAAT held on - it is 9 May 2016?  That is what - ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 98 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 29 t h - not the 29 t h.  9 May 2016. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  9 May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At half past eight in the morning.  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I ask you Mr Human to read 4.1 of 
those minutes? 
MR HUMAN:  “The submission was tabled and considered 
according 
to 
the 
submission. 
 
Management 
recommended that the tender be awarded to Air 
France.  A decision on the matter ensued and the 
Board made the following comments.” 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can I pause you there Mr Human?  Why 
would it say that management recommended? 
MR HUMAN:  It was customary that the Exco of SAAT would also review 
and endorse recommendations.  The referral to the word “management” 
therefore would represent Exco. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  Continue. 
MR HUMAN: 
 
“A, 
management’s 
rationale 
for 
recommendations that Air France be awarded the 
tender was not substantive considering the bidders 
resistance to align itself to SAAT’s development 
20 
agenda.  In other words supply development.  
Furthermore 
the 
benefits 
as 
outlined 
by 
the 
submission as a result of selecting Air France were 
not compelling enough to position the latter as the 
preferred bidder.  The concerns regarding JM/AAR 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 99 of 142 
 
especially management’s view that this bidder was 
lowballing could be mitigated by reducing each 
party’s obligation as well as the terms and 
conditions to writing.  Resolved:  that the request 
for approval of the award of the tender for the 
aircraft components support …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Human.  I am sorry.  Please do not 
forget where were you - you were.  Do you understand that last part 
under result?  I just want to make sure I understand it.  No.  Not under 
resolved.  The one which says: 
10 
“The concerns regarding JM (coughing - excuse me) 
AAR especially management’s view that this bidder 
was lowballing could be mitigated by reducing each 
party’s obligations as well as terms and conditions 
to writing.” 
How would putting - putting those obligations in writing make 
any different to the concerns of lowballing? 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson, in such an assistance mitigating results 
would be for instance to increase the number of units in the main base 
kit.  If one is worried that it is to - the price is - is below market rates 
20 
and that you would not get your - your components on time.  A 
mitigation would be put 10 units instead of five.  Then you at least 
know you have access. 
The concern here was if the price is so low does that not 
suggest that the company would not have the ability to deliver the parts 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 100 of 142 
 
as and when needed.  Secondly, it is standard practice that once a 
contract is - a tender is awarded.  There is a formal contract 
management process where the Service Level Agreement, standard 
terms and conditions, pricing, performance indicators are recorded in a 
contract. 
It is reviewed by the Legal Department and once that process 
is concluded both parties sign.  So the intention was to document 
specific mitigating measures as part of the contract to address the 
concern that because of the low cost the quality and turnaround of the 
service would not be compromised. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure that you understood my question or 
maybe we understand this part differently.  You have told me what 
lowballing is and what the concern is with regard to lowballing and what 
the concerns would have been about lowballing.  I am concerned that 
what the Board is saying here in this part is those concerns which are - 
you are saying it is going to cost you R100,00 in your bid, but in all 
probability it is going to cost you R500,00. 
So you are going to have a problem giving us what we 
expect.  So you might end up lowering the standards.  Giving us low - 
poor quality of a product or something.  That is the concern about 
20 
lowballing. 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now my difficulty is when the Board says here those 
concerns can be addressed or can be mitigated by reducing the 
obligations to writing, because how does that mitigate my concern that 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 101 of 142 
 
this service provider is going to end up not providing quality service, 
because they did not do justice to themselves by quoting too low a 
price.  Did you understand what my concern is? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  Yes Chair person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or - or do you - do you read this part as meaning 
something other than what I understand it to mean?  As I understand it.  
It seems to say put the obligations of the parties in writing.  Where my 
concern is not that they are not - the obligations are not in writing, 
because the obligations are going to be in writing anyway. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  That - that is correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are going to be in writing.  My concern is those 
obligations insofar as the price is so low.  Are going to put us into a 
problem, because when this supplier … 
MR HUMAN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Faces a problem of not being able to acquire A, B, C, 
D at this type of price.  They are going to compromise on other things 
and then I will suffer.  Is - is that how you understand this or do you 
understand it differently? 
MR HUMAN:  I understand it in the same manner Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the same way? 
20 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMAN:  And the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and is it your understanding to that putting the 
obligations in writing will not really mitigate anything?  What would 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 102 of 142 
 
mitigate is if you go to the supplier and say let us increase your price.  
This thing - this price you have put on the table is not going to work or 
something like that. 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson that is certainly a - a correct interpretation.  
In this case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMAN:  The intent was a little different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMAN:  It was to guarantee reliability of components. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMAN:  It was to ensure that any modifications that is issued by 
the manufacturers will be implemented.  It is to ensure that there will 
be delivery as per the required timeframe, because the argument if it is 
so cheap.  Obviously one has to source wide and it might compromise 
the turnaround time.  While a more expensive unit might be more 
readily available. 
A new one for instance.  So - so those mitigating - the 
Board’s request to document firmly how are you - how - how SAAT 
would ensure that the turnaround time is not compromised and 
document roles and responsibilities was the Board’s view of how to 
20 
address the low cost. 
According to the evidence there was no further price 
adjustment as part of risk mitigation in any - any shape or form that I 
am aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we will move away from the point just now, but it 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 103 of 142 
 
just seems to me that it is not a substantive addressing of the 
concerns.  If I - if you offer to get me a suit for R100,00 and I am 
concerned that you are not going to get a quality suit for R100,00.  How 
does it help for me to say let us write it down that you say you will get 
me a suit for R100,00, because you might just come back and say I am 
not getting it. 
Then I am back to square one.  Maybe it is after quite some 
time.  Then I must say.  Okay.  Let us look for one that is R500,00, but 
we have lost time in the meantime or I say let me look for somebody 
else who can - who knows what they are doing, because I think you do 
10 
not know what you are doing. 
If you think you can get me a suit for R100,00 and the fact 
that you have - you did not get it.  Proves it.  You - you understand that 
- that concept?  The fact that we - we write it down does not seem to - 
for me - seem to address the substantive concern. 
MR HUMAN:  I read you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand? 
MR HUMAN:  Low and clear Chair person.  You will get a T-shirt at 
most for 100 bucks these days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Mbikiwa, you may continue. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you chair.  I think Mr Human you were 
in the middle of reading the resolution.  Do you want to just complete 
that? 
MR HUMAN:  Chair the resolution reads: 
“The resolve at the request for approval of the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 104 of 142 
 
award of the tender for the aircraft component 
support services on 80A Chapter for both Boeing 
and Airbus Fleet for a period of five years to AAR; 
b, and is hereby approved subject to the mitigation 
of risks highlighted in the submission.” 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Thank you.  Mr Human do you think that this 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The - the mitigation of - of the risks 
highlighted in the submission.  Is that what we have just been talking 
about or is it something else? 
10 
MR HUMAN:  It is the very same thing Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Mr Human, is this in your view the role that 
a Board should be playing in a tender? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  A Board’s role is not just to rubberstamp a 
submission.  The Board’s role is to apply their mind in three ways.  Has 
due process being followed?  Does the outcome represent value for the 
company and thirdly, if this is the best offer, but not ideal what should 
be done to address those risks.  That is definitely one of the roles of 
the Board … 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And … 
MR HUMAN:  When it comes to procurement matters.  At least. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And - and what would a Board ordinarily do 
when it concludes that the CFST or the BAC has erred? 
MR HUMAN:  The process defined in the Treasury Regulations and - 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 105 of 142 
 
and legislative framework is that they have to refer it back to the BAC 
with their concerns listed and the BAC will then take a decision whether 
they would refer back to the Evaluation Committee or reassess the - the 
tender and once that is done.  They would return to the Board 
Chairperson the revised recommendation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So it is - it is unusual in other words for the 
Board itself to reverse a decision and - and award a tender to a party 
never recommended by either the - the CFST or the BAC? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct.  The - the Board would recommend back to the 
BAC to perform an adjudication.  They would not do it themselves. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is usual is that if the Board cannot see its 
way clear on certain issues.  It would refer the matter back to the BAC 
and say consider these concerns that we have raised and leave it to the 
BAC how to fix that.  Is that right? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - it is unusual for them to go a step further and say 
this is the one who must be awarded the tender? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  This is an aspect which Ms Kwinana has 
20 
addressed in her Rule 3.3 Notice.  She has responded to say that the 
Board’s function is not to rubberstamp, but to apply its mind and she 
also says that Air France was more expensive than AAR and that 
components support was not Air France’s core business and she goes 
on to say that this was one of the best decisions that the Board made 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 106 of 142 
 
at the time.  Do - do you have a response to that? 
MR HUMAN:  I fully agree with Ms Kwinana that the Board is not just 
there to rubberstamp decisions, but according to the evaluation just 
from a process perspective the Board should have referred it back to 
the BAC to consider its concerns and to come back with a proposal how 
to adequately address it before it was submitted to the Board again. 
Whether it was the best possible decision I would not be able 
to comment on that.  Given the time.  It is easy in retrospect to - to 
make pronouncements, but no.  I think the Board might - might have 
had to refer it back to address the - the concerns raised. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it possible that considerations of urgency - if there 
was some urgency - may have justified the decision of the Board not to 
refer the matter - the tender back to the BAC and may - decided to 
make the decision itself?  Would that - would those kinds of 
considerations justify this kind of conduct on the part of the Board? 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson I am convinced there was a certain amount 
of pressure to conclude this matter, however, this has been going on 
for three years already, advertising, cancelling, advertising, cancelling 
another week would certainly have not been material in any way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Ms Memela has also responded to this 
aspect of your evidence insofar as there was an implication that she, 
improperly influenced the decision through her attendance at the CFST, 
she says that she’s simply not that big a fish and that she has no power 
to oppose the appointment of any particular person to the Board, do 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 107 of 142 
 
you have any comment to that? 
MR HUMAN:   Influence is a difficult thing to define in this instance, I 
would agree with Advocate Memela that the role of the BAC is to do 
their work independently and make a recommendation, the nuances of 
influence is very difficult for me to pronounce, I would not be able to 
comment on that. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Mr Human I’d now like to move 
on to the contract itself that was concluded pursuant to this Board 
resolution and do I understand correctly that while, for most of your 
affidavit you’ve relied on documents in order to put together the 
10 
chronology at least in so far as the management of the contract today, 
is concerned, are you able to speak with some degree of personal 
knowledge? 
MR HUMAN:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can you begin by telling us about the issue 
of a payment of an upfront…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where do we go to now? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Sorry Chair, page 44. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   In the affidavit it’s Bundle DD22A. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you say what page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   44. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And we’re at paragraph 161, can you tell us 
about the issue of the payment of an upfront deposit Mr Human? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 108 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:   Yes the contract provides…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, lets connect the two properly.  
The Board makes a resolution that AAR must be awarded, was it 
awarded? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes Chairperson it was awarded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when was that? 
MR HUMAN:   It was at the Board’s meeting dated …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a separate one or the one where we have just 
looked at the minutes? 
MR HUMAN:   It’s the one that we just looked at the minutes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But wouldn’t that be simply a resolution but 
subsequent to the resolution, somebody needs to do the actual 
awarding of the contract, is it – would the resolution amount to the 
awarding – decision to award or was the position that the Board makes 
a resolution to say, this is the entity which must be awarded and 
somebody else within the company must then give effect to that 
resolution by doing the actual awarding? 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson that’s spot on, the Board approved the 
award and then it’s standard practice that a letter of award would be 
issued by the head of Supply Chain, it’s basically a one-pager 
20 
informing the successful bidder that they were successful and it will 
then ensue in a formal contract process where the contract is 
formulated, reviewed by the legal department and both parties sign with 
an effective date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes after the letter awarding the contract, there 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 109 of 142 
 
would be negotiations to then conclude the contract and then the 
contract gets concluded and signed and thereafter you get to the stage 
of implementation and management of the contract, is that right?  Is my 
understanding of the process correct? 
MR HUMAN:   The contract will be based on the conditions that were 
advertised that becomes core to the content of the contract and to the 
performance [indistinct] thereafter.  In Government we are bound by the 
so-called General Conditions of Contract, it’s published and regulated 
by the National Treasury, it’s been reviewed from time to time and it 
deals with all aspects from Supplier Management to disputes, payments 
10 
and the core concepts in contract law.  In this case it’s a very 
specialised environment Chairperson.  Aviation and components 
requires …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Specialisation. 
MR HUMAN:   Specialisation and the contract articulated those 
specialisms. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but am I right to say, after the letter of the 
award, there is no written contract? 
MR HUMAN:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Their discussion is aimed at settling the contract or 
20 
putting together a contract that accords with the general terms and 
conditions that you are talking about. 
MR HUMAN:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whatever else may be added by the parties. 
MR HUMAN:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 110 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay so let’s hear when the letter of the award 
was, what date and then we move from there. 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson, the letter of award was issued on the 13 t h 
of May and it’s documented in paragraph 155 of the affidavit supported 
by Annexure 96. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no, that’s fine, that’s fine. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And Chair it may be a convenient time 
because you’ve raised the issue of contract negotiations and so before 
we get to the contract itself, we do have an affidavit from Mr Mike 
Kenny, Chair it’s been provisionally included in the Bundle at this stage 
10 
subject to your direction in due course if it became contentious.  It is in 
Annexure 22G. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s Exhibit 22G, what page. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And the page – it starts at 3150. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess it wouldn’t – oh that’s the last Bundle. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   That’s the last bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which you said…[intervenes]. 
ADV 
MICHAEL 
MBIKIWA: 
 
 
There’s 
some 
additional 
documents…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed Chair and if you turn to 3154 at 
paragraph 20 – and sorry Chair just to clarify, Mr Kenny was the Head 
of Department Technical Sales at South African Airways Technical and 
at paragraph 20 he says, 
 
“After the Board’s decision to award the tender to AARJM 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 111 of 142 
 
 
Aviation joint venture, I was part of the team that negotiated 
 
the contract with the joint venture.  I recall there being a 
 
number 
of 
meetings 
being 
held 
during 
the 
contract 
 
negotiations, probably between five and ten meetings.  I 
 
recall that I attended all or at least most of them and that Ms 
 
Memela was also in attendance at the meetings, she and Ms 
 
Mbeki were responsible for the legal aspects during these 
 
negotiations with Ms Mbeki taking the lead on drafting.  Ms 
 
Mbeki took an active role in the negotiations and would not 
 
just accept what AAR said.  She was always trying to ensure 
10 
 
that SAAT was protected under the agreement.  I recall that  at 
one point AAR became unhappy about all the issues she  
was 
raising.  At paragraph 23, at one of the Exco meetings  
after 
the 
agreement with AARJM Aviation had been signed I  asked 
to 
be 
provided with a copy.  Ms Memela told me that I  
could not be given 
a copy of the full contract and would only  be given a part of it.  I took 
issue with this and asked why I  
could 
not 
be 
given 
the 
whole 
contract and Ms Memela said  
that it was to protect me.  I did not 
understand what that  
meant at the time and I still don’t understand 
what she was  
conveying, I have never seen the full contract.  It was 
20 
highly  unusual for my request to see a contract that I was 
 
responsible for implementing to be refused”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I see the – I see Ms Mbeki – a reference to Ms 
Mbeki here and there’s been a reference to Ms Mbeki in another 
context by other witnesses and I was looking for her name to see but it 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 112 of 142 
 
looks like this affidavit doesn’t have her name.  Under Law Enforcement 
there was a Ms Mbeki, who was acting director of IPID at a certain 
stage, so I was wondering whether it was the same person. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   I don’t believe so Chair, I’ve been 
conferring with my colleagues and I don’t think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Mr Human do you have any comment on 
that? 
MR HUMAN:   No sir. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can we then turn to the contract itself, you 
10 
deal with it’s conclusion at paragraph 160, can you tell us about the 
conclusion of the contract? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s paragraph 160 of his affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Of his affidavit on page 44 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes the contract will be in the Bundle that we have 
just used? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed Chair, not G no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But for now you want me to look at the affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
20 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson an agreement was eventually reached on 
the content after it was negotiated and it was signed by the then Acting 
CEO, Mr Pirrie and the President of AAR, a Mr Holmes on the same 
date, that was 7 July 2016.  Upon signature…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What paragraph is that, I’m looking for where 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 113 of 142 
 
you…[intervenes]. 
MR HUMAN:   Paragraphs 160 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR HUMAN:   Upon signature of the contract implementation phase 
started. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Alright, can I ask – Chair now I’d like you 
please to go to the contract, it’s in Exhibit DD22F. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   At page 2325. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just give me the page number again? 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Chair the contract begins at 2318 behind 
tab 98. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay found it. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And I’d like you to go to 2325, will you 
please read that clause for us Mr Human…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s just confirm first, this is the contract number 
30310, it says Component Support Agreement between JM Aviation SA 
Pty Ltd, in conjunction with AAR Supply Chain Incorporated and SAA 
Technical Ltd, what is it dated? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   On page 2333, it’s dated 7 t h of July Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the year, 2015? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2016, Ja just before he reads we just need to identify 
it so that the reader of the transcript understands what document it is, 
yes. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 114 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What clause did you want him to read? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   4.26 Chair on page 2325. 
MR HUMAN:   Chair the clause 4.26 reads as follows, 
 
“Prior to the commencement date JMAAR will invoice SAAT 
 
for the deposit.  SAAT will pay the deposit by way of an 
 
irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank acceptable to 
 
JMAAR and inform agreed by JMAAR.  The parties agree that 
 
JMAAR will have the right to set off any SAAT invoices not 
 
paid by it’s due date against deposit and SAAT shall, when 
10 
 
necessary, throughout the term of this agreement replenish 
 
the deposit and maintain the amount invoiced by JMAAR prior 
 
to the commencement date and at the time of expiration of 
 
the termination of this agreement JMAAR will arrange for the 
 
release of the deposit to extend that SAAT has paid all 
 
outstanding invoices”. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you, what’s your understanding of 
that clause? 
MR HUMAN:   Credit arrangement usually by letter of credit by an 
acceptable bank must be furnished to guarantee that in the instances of 
20 
non-payment JMAAR could present such credit letter to the bank to 
make good on outstanding invoices. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that be a normal practice for these kinds of 
agreements? 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 115 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And tell us how that clause was 
implemented? 
MR HUMAN:   In this instance an actual cash payment was paid, not 
just the letter of credit.  JMAAR invoiced SAAT for the value of three 
month’s power by the hour costs and that Chairperson amounted to 
4.382million US Dollars at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in rands that would have been …[intervenes]. 
MR HUMAN:   Just over R60million more or less if we accept the 
10 
exchange rate at fourteen and a half. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, so you say this was given to them in cash? 
MR HUMAN:   Correct, cash meaning transfer – a wire transfer to the 
bank account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes as opposed to giving them a letter, which is the 
normal practice. 
MR HUMAN:   Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR HUMAN:   I was just worried that you were interpreting this as 
maybe small bills, small denomination Dollar bills. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laughter], yes and what was said to be the 
justification for departing from the norm in this regard if you have been 
able to gather any justification from the documentation? 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson I was unable to determine from the 
documentation any logical argument.  To the contrary, my interpretation 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 116 of 142 
 
is to part with valuable cash would certainly put a strain on the cash 
flow, secondly my understanding…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When there was no need. 
MR HUMAN:   Correct Chairperson.  The contract certainly provides for 
acceptable means making a cash payment does not really make a lot of 
sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would it also not put SAAT at risk in case JMAAR 
fail to perform and they already have cash, I mean they’ve been paid 
it’s not just a letter.  If they fail dismally to perform then SAAT will be 
prejudiced. 
10 
MR HUMAN:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you. Mr Human have there ever been 
any draw downs from that deposit in order to off set outstanding 
invoices? 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson to my knowledge there has never been an 
off set against the deposit for unpaid invoices, during the duration of 
this contract. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   You refer, in your affidavit to a review that 
was done of the contract in 2018. 
20 
MR HUMAN:   Correct. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   That’s at page 45 of your affidavit at 
paragraph 166, can you tell us what the purpose of that review was and 
what it found? 
MR HUMAN:   Certainly, Chair the intention of the joint contract review 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 117 of 142 
 
was to assess performance and these spoke specifically to matter that 
SAAT found not to be beneficial. The first instance, if I may expand a 
little bit on it, forgive me Chair, I just want to make sure if it’s not 
listed, was the long turnaround times for repair of components.  We 
keep statistics and so does the service provider and we noted that 
some repairs were outstanding for longer than 600 days.  Now for a 
maintenance organisation it’s virtually unheard of that you will be 
without a spare for almost two years, 600 days is just short of two 
years.  So we addressed performance related matters like this.  At the 
time there was just over 930, I believe items outstanding for excessive 
10 
time that would be for six months or longer.  Secondly incorrect 
invoicing, the contract provides for 35% of, beyond economic repair 
cost but we’ve noted that on several invoices the amount were charge 
at 100% plus a mark-up plus a handling fee and the intention of this 
review as to correct that, cancel the invoices, give us a credit note and 
bill 35% as per the contract terms.  The next issue that we raised was 
the excessive penalties, SAAT has been sloppy in their administration 
of this contract in the sense that it has a determined return date and if 
a core unit is not returned within that date, a penalty is raised.  Up to 
now SAAT has paid R69million in penalties – R69.6million in penalties 
20 
for late return of cores.  Our intention was to point out to JM Aviation 
that the same kind of penalty does not apply when components take 
600 days to come back SAAT and we would like to have some kind of a 
equalisation of the terms and conditions.  Also we noted that there has 
not been any NIP obligation benefits, we wanted to address the matter 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 118 of 142 
 
that the NIP contribution needs to be addressed, be accelerated since 
the contract was already halfway through it’s term and then another 
items was the…[intervenes]. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can I just pause you there Mr Human and 
just confirm that the NIP obligation was a requirement in the RFP.  
MR HUMAN:   Correct the NIP obligation was per standard bidding 
document number 5 it’s a standard part of the RFP pack. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you, continue. 
MR HUMAN:   And then Chairperson, the reciprocal work that was a 
part of the critical criteria in the award was that AAR would provide 
10 
work to SAAT to be performed at it’s workshops and up to now no such 
reciprocal work has come to the fore.  These, in short, Chairperson was 
the main discussion points that we thought was stipulated in the 
contract and we wanted the performance in these areas to be 
addressed. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Can you also just explain the issue of BER 
costs? 
MR HUMAN:   The discrepancy between the RFP was that the ask was 
for a 30/70 percent – it was advertised in the bid as the BER ratio 
would be 30% and 70%, yet in this contract it is 65/35 percent and the 
20 
issue that we addressed is that the charges thereof were made at 
100%, this issue was then addressed at this meeting. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And was that also one of the critical 
criteria, the 70/30 ratio? 
MR HUMAN:   It was a critical criteria that the bid published on the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 119 of 142 
 
beginning of December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whose responsibility would it have been on SAAT’s 
side to make sure that SAAT’s rights in terms of this contract were 
properly enforced against JM/AAR? 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson the contract implementation is the 
responsibility of the contracts unit in SAAT and then on the practical 
side, to return a core unit would be the business unit, it would be 
workshops. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HUMAN:   But enforcing the terms and conditions is the 
10 
responsibility of the procurement – the Supply Chain unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that’s the unit that Ms Memela was heading? 
MR HUMAN:   Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  Now you said that with regard to penalties 
the contract made provision for penalties to be applied against SAAT 
when there were delay on it’s part but the contract did not have similar 
penalties to be applied when there were delays on the part of JM/AAR, 
do you know whether, having that kind of situation was something quite 
unusual to be allowed by SAAT in other contracts that it does, do you 
know whether, usually there would be reciprocal provisions relating to 
20 
penalties? 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson I know that from my experience at Treasury, 
that the general conditions of contract, specifically specifies penalties 
for poor deliver and it is therefore strange that this is a very one-sided 
contract applying penalties on SAAT but not on the other side.  I’m 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 120 of 142 
 
used to contracts that protect the interests of the procuring agency and 
not in this fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it seems that it would be something quite easy 
to pick up for anybody that would be looking after the interest of SAAT.  
If they see that there are penalties that would be applicable to SAAT in 
certain circumstances, logically they would think what about JM/AAR 
when they have delays and therefore it’s difficult to understand how 
they could see these in regard to SAAT but not think about ensuring 
that there were similar penalties against AAR. 
MR HUMAN:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Human, what, in your 
understanding are the services that are provided by JM Aviation? 
MR HUMAN:   JM Aviation the partner? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Indeed. 
MR HUMAN:   Yes, Chair my understanding is that JM Aviation is 
responsible for the supply, development, component or – that was part 
of the tender that JM Aviation would have a full-time representative on 
premise to support the day-to-day operations and to ensure that the 
NIP obligations are met that were stipulated in the contract. 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And to what extent has that happened? 
MR HUMAN:   Up to now we have received no, like in zero, supply 
development beneficiation.  Also no agreement were on NIP has been 
signed with the DTI and we have had zero reciprocal work on the 
contract.  All three of those are – have not been delivered on, in any 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 121 of 142 
 
shape or form. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   And what’s the total amount that SAA 
Technical has spent so far under this agreement? 
MR HUMAN:   Chair I did attach an Annex with the exact amount and 
from memory I believe we are just about at the billion rand – just past 
the billion rand, at this rate, over the duration the contract will probably 
end at R1.8billion if I project the current rate of expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yesterday Ms Sambo, I think, told me what the value 
of the contract was, does that accord with the value of the contract as 
you understand it? 
10 
MR HUMAN:   Chairperson the contract value is stipulated at 
R1.3billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HUMAN:   But at the current rate we will end at R1.8billion, we will 
overshoot with at least half a billion. 
CHAIRPERSON    What would you say is largely responsible for that, 
that you will go so far above what let me say is it. 
MR HUMAN   Chairperson, let me say three reasons.  When this 
contract was signed it excluded the Airbus 330’s.  Six aircraft was 
added about a year into the contract as a contract amendment that 
20 
increased the value. 
Secondly, the fact that SAAT has lost a lot of its capability at 
workshops and their number of repairs is increased.  A third aspect is 
the incorrect pricing, and fourthly, the harsh penalties that was imposed 
on SAAT will contribute to the half a billion Rand increase.   
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 122 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON    Bearing in mind or remembering the concerns which 
management had expressed about giving the contract to J.M. & A.A.R. 
and looking at the fact that it’s been what, two, three, four years, two, 
three years of implementation, are you able to say whether those 
concerns have materialised, or actually no things as far as those 
concerns were concerned have worked fine? I am now talking about 
concerns relating to low balling and so on.   
MR HUMAN    Yes.  Compared to, Chairperson, no, I cannot really 
comment in a scientific way, but I can give you a gut feel if that will 
satisfy in any way. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes. Okay. For what it is worth.  
MR HUMAN    For what it is worth. If this contract was implemented as 
intended, it would have been an excellent contract so two consideration 
is SAAT’s ability to be disciplined. To avoid the penalties would have 
been beneficial.  The concerns about low balling I think is valid if I look 
at the incorrect charges, and I hope it is really administrative error and 
not intentionally incorrectly invoiced. 
CHAIRPERSON    Would you be able, given time, to go back and do the 
homework of seeing whether those concerns have materialised or not 
because it might be helpful.  Would that be something that you could 
20 
do, or is it difficult to do? 
MR HUMAN    No, Chair.  We have gone far with that analysis and I do 
have a calculation of the B.R. difference in cost that I could certainly 
finalise and submit to you in the next two or three days to comply to 
your request. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 123 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  I think that would be helpful. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you, Chair.  Just on the issue of 
cost, you said that SAAT has spent just over a billion Rand.  How much 
would have been paid to JM Aviation? 
MR HUMAN    According to the contract provisions, 5 percent of all 
revenue would be accruing to JM Aviation.  5 percent would therefore 
be around R53 Million. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you.  Chair, we have also received 
an affidavit from a representative of the DTI and I would like to take 
you there, Mr Human.  [Intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON    That is Department of Trade and Industry? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    It is in file DD22(g) and it starts at Page 
2972.  There are three aspects I would like to draw your attention to.  
[Intervenes] 
MR HUMAN    Sorry, just the page number again, Sir? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    It starts at 2972.   
MR HUMAN    Thank you.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    It is an affidavit from Mr Lionel October who 
20 
is in employ of the Department of Trade and Industry in the capacity as 
director general. If I can ask you to turn to 2976, at Paragraph 16, Mr 
October says that SAAT had a duty to not only inform the DTI of the 
agreement between it and JM Aviation but had a duty to do so within 5 
working days after award of a contract.   
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 124 of 142 
 
 
The SAAT in the present instance failed to act in accordance 
with this requirement since we understand that the agreement between 
SAAT and JM Aviation was entered into in 2016.  Does that accord with 
your understanding? 
MR HUMAN    That is correct, Sir.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And if we go to Paragraph 19, the first 
paragraph spoke about SAAT’s obligation.  19 says, “In the present 
instance, despite the fact that there was a duty on JM Aviation to 
immediately inform the DTI that the particular contract was awarded to 
it, it failed to inform the DTI.” So, does that too accord with your 
10 
understanding? 
MR HUMAN    Correct.  Yes.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    The last aspect I would like to take you to 
is on page 2977.  The following page.  Paragraph 27.  That paragraph 
reads, ‘I should also place on record that Mr Kirkland – that is the 
investigator of the commission – requested information in relation to 
Lufthansa’s performance of the duty, of its duties, flowing from the 
obligation agreement which was entered into between the DTI and 
Lufthansa.   
This agreement was signed on 17 February 2013 and is attached hereto 
20 
marked as Annexure I.  According to the DTI’s nip records, there is no 
indication that Lufthansa is non-compliant in relation to its current nip 
obligation.  In this regard, I have attached hereto a printout of 
Lufthansa’s performance status as at 30 September 2019 and have 
attached same hereto as Annexure J.  The DTI has never received 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 125 of 142 
 
correspondence from SAAT in relation to Lufthansa’s non-compliance 
with its current nip obligation.  Does that come as a surprise to you? 
MR HUMAN    I take it as fact from the director general of DTI. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you.  The last matter on the contract, 
Chair, is that we have managed to locate the Round Robin solution that 
you referred to.  If I could beg leave to hand up a copy and to hand one 
to the witness.  [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    It is to be inserted in file, in exhibit DD22F 
at 2302.1.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  Thank you.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    This reads that it is an excerpt from the 
Round Robin approval process of the SAA bid adjudication council held 
on 6 May 2016 and it reads that the BAC resolved to note SAAT’s 
intention to award the tender for aircraft component support services on 
88 chapter coverage for both Boeing and airbus fleet to Air France 
Industries for a period of five years as per chapter five of the SCM 
policy.  The value of the contract [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON    Chapter 25.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Sorry, as per chapter 25 of the SCM policy.  
20 
The value of the contract for a five-year period with Air France 
Industries is estimated at just over one point three billion rand.  True 
excerpt of the Round Robin.   
 
Mr Human, I asked you earlier about the fact that the BAC had 
decided simply to note the intention to award the contract.  Your 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 126 of 142 
 
response then was that all they could do was note it because they did 
not have quorum.  This is the Round Robin resolution and it still says 
that they note the intention to award.  What is your view of that?   
MR HUMAN    My view is that their duty was to recommend this to the 
board and not just note it as their function is to adjudicate and if it is 
within their delegation of authority, at the moment that is fifty million 
rand, anything less than fifty million they can award.  More than fifty 
million needs to go to the next structures.   
 Let me first ask, why is that resolution on SAA letterheads as opposed 
to SAAT? 
10 
MR HUMAN    Chair, SAA and its subsidiaries share a central BAC so 
all tenders for Air Chefs, SAAT, and Mango, and SAA are adjudicated at 
one service. It is called the global or group BAC and it is another form 
of oversight to make sure that there is at least line of sight of what is 
tendered, evaluated and then, for adjudication.   
CHAIRPERSON    You may or may not be able to comment on this. I 
would have expected them never the less to use SAAT letterheads when 
it’s a tender related to SAAT and use an SAA letterhead when it is a 
tender related to SAA and so on and so on.   
MR HUMAN    Chairperson, I believe the reason why it is on a SAA 
20 
letterhead is because the secretariat of the BAC is based in SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, so it may be that for them it is not a big issue, 
but probably what they should be doing is using letterheads for the 
particular entity if the tender relates to a particular entity even if the 
composition of the committee is the same for all the different entities, 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 127 of 142 
 
but for them, maybe it is not a big issue.  But we must take it as the 
relevant BAC’s resolution. 
MR HUMAN    Yes, Chairperson.  The identification would be in the 
heading SP462/15 would then be able to assign it to which entity it is 
but your advice is solid and I would certainly raise it with the BAC after 
the proceedings.   
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  Thank you.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you, Chair.  I intend to move on from 
the topic of the components tenders now, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, that is fine. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Thank you.  Mr Human, I do understand that 
there was some litigation that arose out of this tender.  I do not intend 
to spend time on it, but can you briefly tell us what that litigation 
involved? 
MR HUMAN    Certainly.  Upon issuing the letter of the ward and letter 
of regret to the non-successful bidders, Air France, formerly raised a 
litigation proceeding.  It was heard in the high court of Johannesburg. 
The long and the short of it is that the court upheld the decision of the 
SAAT board to award it to AAR. [Intervenes] 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And my understanding is that that was 
20 
brought on an urgent basis and it was for an interim interdict.   
MR HUMAN    It was for an interim interdict.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Do you know whether there was ever any 
final review proceedings?  
MR HUMAN    No, there was no further action taken by Air France in 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 128 of 142 
 
fact Air France informed SAAT later on that they have no intent to 
pursue the matter further.   
CHAIRPERSON    So Air France was aggrieved by the award of the 
tender to JM AAR and took the decision to award the tender to JM AAR 
on review in court and the outcome was what you have just told me.   
MR HUMAN    Yes, Chair.  Air France did raise the matter to seek an 
interdict not to continue the service while this process are unfolding.   
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  No, I think I may be missing something that 
might have been said while I was looking for something here.  So, what 
Air France wanted to achieve was an interdict of the implementation or 
10 
against the implementation of the tender in favour of JM AAR.  Is that 
what it was? 
MR HUMAN    Correct, Sir.   
CHAIRPERSON    Okay, and that was dismissed? 
MR HUMAN    Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON    And as you understood the position, they wanted an 
interdict pending a review application.  
MR HUMAN    Interim interdict review relief.   
CHAIRPERSON    Yes.  Okay.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    As far as we are aware there is not 
20 
judgement on a final review? [Intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes.  That’s fine.  Of course, it would be important to 
know to get the affidavits that were used by Air France so one can see 
how much information did they know about what went on. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Indeed Chair they are included in the 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 129 of 142 
 
bundle.  We have included both the affidavits and the judgement. 
CHAIRPERSON    Did they know quite very little? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Not what the commission knows. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay, alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Mr Human can we then turn to the portion of 
your affidavit where you deal with the Swissport Ground-handling 
contract and GPU sale, that is at page 52 of DD22A starting at 
Paragraph 177.  And before you take us through it, I think it would just 
be helpful for you to help us with some concepts.  What are ground-
handling services? 
10 
MR HUMAN    Ground-handling services is those services on the apron 
at the airport; positioning power units, making sure that the towing 
services are available, tugs, that kind of thing; the loading and 
unloading of aircraft, baggage transportation and other equipment like 
steps, ramps, that kind of equipment falls under ground-handling.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And what are GPU’s? 
MR HUMAN    A GPU is a ground power unit.  Aircraft needs to maintain 
their power supply, that can either be done through running the engine 
of the aircraft, which of course is quite expensive. Jet fuel is, 
Chairperson, slightly more expensive than the normal 95 unleaded 
20 
version that we use.  And therefore, it makes sense to make use of a 
GPU power unit. 
CHAIRPERSON    How does that work?  The power unit.  Do they 
connect to some electricity or? 
MR HUMAN    Yes Sir. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 130 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON    If you do not use the aircraft engine, how does the 
aircraft get power? 
MR HUMAN    So it is almost like a mobile generator.  It is usually on a 
carriage or on a trailer.  It works with fuel or diesel, and then it has got 
electrical connections that is plugged into the aircraft to power it.  
There is two versions: mobile and then fixed power units obviously they 
are limited to the maintenance base, but the units we are referring to 
here is mobile.  They can be towed behind a tractor or a vehicle 
positioned at the aircraft where they are needed. 
CHAIRPERSON    So this GPU would be, or that kind of generator 
10 
would be used when the aircraft has touched down and is parking. 
MR HUMAN    Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON    Or would it be for the time when the aircraft is 
parked?  Or maybe only when there is a need; maybe the engine must 
run or whatever must run? 
MR HUMAN    Chair, it is usually when the aircraft is parked.  
Sometimes a foreign carrier would arrive in the morning and only fly out 
ten ‘o’clock at night.  So, for a period of twelve hours it would probably 
require the power unit.  In other instances, shorter maintenance events 
can take two or three days and then the power unit will be connected so 
20 
that the engines do not need to run, especially if work on the engine 
itself needs to be done then we would like to use a other power source 
than running the aircrafts own auxiliary unit or APU. 
CHAIRPERSON    Basically it provides the power that enables all the 
electricity in the plane to work without using the engine. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 131 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And can you talk us through the process by 
which the ground-handling contract currently in place was awarded? 
MR HUMAN    Yes, Chair this contract was run by SAA itself, not by 
SAAT. It was published in May 2011 and then on a board resolution on 
the 31 July 2012 it was decided that the GPU owned by SAAT would be 
included in this process.  It was for a 5-year period from 2012 onwards 
and Swissport was awarded the tender for the ground-handling 
services. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And when was that awarded?  
MR HUMAN    It was awarded on the 31 July 2012. I am on Paragraph 
177 Chairperson, of the affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON    I see something here that says Swissport was 
partially awarded the tender at 178.  What does that mean? What did it 
get and what did it not get?  Or is it something you might not be 
familiar with?  
MR HUMAN    I have attached, Chairperson, a Annexure and for the 
moment it eludes me what was included and what not, if you indulge 
me? 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Chair perhaps I can assist.  It is in the 
resolution which is in file DD22G.  Effectively Swissport was awarded 
ramp-handling, PAU and wheelchair and document verification and Bid-
Air was awarded bussing. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  Thank you.  Would that mean that the tender 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 132 of 142 
 
was split among two bidders? 
MR HUMAN    Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And was a contract concluded with 
Swissport? 
MR HUMAN    No the contract was not signed.  I am unsure why.  I am 
not aware why the contract was not signed. 
CHAIRPERSON    But the performance of the contract continued in the 
meantime  
MR HUMAN    Yes, correct Sir.  Despite the fact that there was no 
10 
signed contract, services were rendered.  
CHAIRPERSON    Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And how much was paid to Swissport 
without a contract in place? 
MR HUMAN    R1, 139 Billion 
CHAIRPERSON    What was the value of the contract, well, of the 
tender before it was awarded?  Do you know that? 
MR HUMAN    Chairperson not off the cuff.  We can [Intervenes] 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Chair it is contained in the same resolution 
I just referred to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes, what does it say? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    The total was R1.4 Billion, but that includes 
amounts to Bid-Air which was R81 Million.  So the amount to Swissport 
was a total of about R1.38 Billion  
CHAIRPERSON    Okay.  Thank you.  Yes.

ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Mr Human you spoke about SAAT acquiring 
GPU’s.  Did it acquire GPU’s? 
MR HUMAN    That is correct. Eight PU’s were purchased and it was 
used for operations in SAAT during its maintenance operations. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    And do you know how much SAAT paid for 
the GPU’s? 
MR HUMAN    Yes. We have an attachment that indicates the purchase 
value, the depreciation and the book value. Chair, I would appreciate if 
the colleagues can just refer me to the correct [Intervenes]. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Can I ask you to go to Exhibit DD22B? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON    Have you got the page number? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Yes, it is 684, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Can you see what the price per unit and the 
total price was? 
MR HUMAN    Yes Chairperson, the purchase order contained on this 
page indicates that the value it was purchased at VAT inclusive 
R 9 193981.20 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes. 
MR HUMAN    Just short of about R 10 Million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON    Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Now you have told us about the period 
between 2012 and 2016, tell us what took place in 2016? 
MR HUMAN    A decision was then taken to sell the GPU’s as part of 
the ground-handling services to Swissport and this resulted in SAAT 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 134 of 142 
 
selling the newly acquired GPU shortly thereafter.  
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    You speak in your affidavit about a contract 
being concluded [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON    Are we going back to the affidavit? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    Sorry Chair, there is just so many files to 
move between.  We are back in the affidavit at DD22(a).  
CHAIRPERSON    Yes.  What page? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    We are on Page 52 at Paragraph 180 and 
we are talking about the conclusion of a contract with Swissport. Are 
you there? 
10 
MR HUMAN    Yes Sir. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA    So tell us about that contract? 
MR HUMAN    The SAA board agreed to award it to Swissport for 5-years. 
The process that was followed I do not have first-hand knowledge.  The 
part that I do have knowledge and documentary evidence is concerning 
the sale of the GPUs that was a condition of this award.   
It provided that Chairperson, the Swissport will arrange for the purchase 
of these GPUs and I have tried to formulate it in paragraph 184 of the 
affidavit.  The sale took place at book value.  The amount that I have 
mentioned earlier Chairperson was the purchase price of 9 139 000 odd 
20 
per unit.  After the appreciation the amounts- the units were then sold at 
the so-called book value. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Sorry.  Before we get there.  On the issue of 
Swissport having concluded a- sorry, having performed services between 
2012 and 2016 without a contract and then having concluded a contract in 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 135 of 142 
 
2016.  Do you know if there was a tender process that preceded the 
conclusion of the 2016 contract? 
MR HUMAN:  I do not have first-hand knowledge of a tender process 
unfortunately. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Okay.  Chair in Ms Hofmeyr’s introduction this 
morning she referred to the fact that Swissport had referred to an 
affidavit they had previously given.  I would just like to put their 
explanation of this process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  To Mr Human. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The summary of Swissport’s position is that it 
was awarded a 5 year ground handling tender in 2012 but no contract was 
concluded.  Swissport struggled with South African Airways to get a 
contract signed during the period from 2012 and in the interim provided 
services on a month to month basis.  They did so without a signed 
contract.     
By December 2015 the 2012 tender had therefore still not been 
implemented.  A contract was then eventually concluded ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, do they say the contract has still not been 
20 
signed because otherwise they were implementing it without a contract.  
Is it not so? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So, the contract had not been signed by the end 
of 2015. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 136 of 142 
 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  By the end of 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  They then say that a contract was eventually 
concluded in March of 2016 for 5 years from 2016 to 2021 which 
Swissport says was routed in the 2012 tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is very strange is it not?  The bids were invited in 
2012 or 2011 or whatever time and the tender was awarded to Swissport.  
No contract was signed but they rendered services and were paid as if 
there was a contract.  And then in 2016 a contract was signed without a 
new tender and it was signed on the basis that it was the contract which 
10 
should have been signed in 2012.   
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was providing for a further 5 years. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  For a further 5 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding correct Mr Human? 
MR HUMAN:  I wish I could say otherwise but yes, it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And what was the value of this 2016 contract now 
compared to the 2012 tender?  Mr Human, do you- is that information you 
have at hand?  Even if it is an estimate or not really. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair this is coming in the evidence to follow. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it is coming there.  Oh okay. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  But it is in the region of 1.2 billion rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, they would end up getting 1, something billion times 
2? 
MR HUMAN:  Correct sir. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 137 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Yes Mr Mbikiwa. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Can you- and I am now back at your affidavit 
on page 53 where at paragraph 182 you describe the clauses in the 2016 
contract related to GPUs.  Just explain or read those clauses for us. 
MR HUMAN:  Certainly.  Chair it was recorded that the board resolution 
had the following resolved resolution.   
Swissport SA to acquire all GPU equipment that has been purchased by 
SAAT and,  
Swissport SA to enter into a contract with a BEE company that has 
representation of black women, youth, military veterans and disabled 
10 
persons from which Swissport will purchase all the equipment required for 
SAA contract. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And who were the GPUs sold to? 
MR HUMAN:  This GPUs was sold to JM Aviation. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And for what price were they sold to JM 
Aviation? 
MR HUMAN:  I would like to quote the correct amount but Chairperson ... 
(intervenes) 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  I can take you to the Exhibit.  It is Exhibit 
DD22B at page 844. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Are you there Mr Human? 
MR HUMAN:  No.  So, page number? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  844 in DD22B. 
MR HUMAN:  Apologies Chair.  Chairperson the invoice for the GPUs 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 138 of 142 
 
amounted to 248 000 per unit and the total was 3,392 640 rand. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And do you know what the book value was at 
the time? 
MR HUMAN:  I do. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And I can refer you in the same file to page 
694. 
MR HUMAN:  Chair the book value at the time of sale was 7,968 117. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  So that is more than double the price for which 
it was sold? 
MR HUMAN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And can you tell me what ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just hang on one second.  So Swissport- the buyer here 
was JM Aviation. 
MR HUMAN:  That is right sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the seller was Swissport?  Who was the seller now 
of the GPUs? 
MR HUMAN:  SAAT sold these GPUs to JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Swissport sold them. 
MR HUMAN:  No, SAAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SAAT. 
20 
MR HUMAN:  To JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s been ... (intervenes)  
MR HUMAN:  And then Swissport bought them from JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Swissport bought them for more than double, 
almost more than double the price that ... (intervenes) 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 139 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That JM Aviation had bought them from SAAT. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes.  Chairperson if I may, SAAT bought these units for 9,1 
million.  Shortly thereafter it sells these very units for 3,392 000 to JM 
Aviation.  It is actually worth according to our financial records 7,968 
000.  This transaction is demonstrating that we have sold for next to 
nothing a unit that was more or less worth double. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  Thereafter JM Aviation sells these units to Swissport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Swissport for more than- almost more than double of 
10 
what they paid to SAAT.  Is that right?  Yes.  You agree Mr Human?  I just 
want to make sure that you- 
MR HUMAN:  Chairperson ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you are the witness.  Is that correct?  Is my 
understanding correct?  SAAT ... (intervenes) 
MR HUMAN:  I do not have a document what Swissport has paid to JM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  JM yes. 
MR HUMAN:  But in the forensic report that is attached as Annex there is 
reference made to the sale. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, from that report it looks like Swissport paid more, 
20 
much more for them than- paid to JM much more for the same thing that 
JM paid to SAAT. 
MR HUMAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR HUMAN:  So, my evidence is based on the contend of the forensic 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 140 of 142 
 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  And the learned colleague could maybe just point us to what 
the amount then paid by Swissport. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It looks like he has got it ready. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair the amount is 9,4 million that was paid 
by Swissport.  But this is evidence that Ms Hofmeyr is going to ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be led ja. 
10 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Lead over the next couple of days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine but it is good just to connect the 
story properly. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, the question would be what was going on with 
SAAT, one, selling the units in the first place?  And secondly, selling them 
at almost what, half the price.  Am I right?  Or even lower than that to JM. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Less than half to JM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Less than half to JM and selling the units when they 
were still quite new as well.  And I think that is what Mr Human said.  And 
20 
then later on they lease them from Swissport. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And in terms of the documentation that you have 
come across you could not find anything that justifies this merry-go-round 
that was going on. 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 141 of 142 
 
MR HUMAN:  To the contrary Chairperson after the sale SAAT has to date 
paid 8,42 million rand in leasing fees for these very same units that we 
owned and now lease back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now and are you able to say what the- what SAAT loss 
has been when you look at that plus the fact that they sold the same units 
to JM for less than half.  Are you able to say what the loss is when you 
take all of those into account? 
MR HUMAN:  Yes, Chairperson the capital loss from the original purchase 
price to selling price was just over 6 million and the subsequent loss due 
to unnecessary expenditure was a further 8,4 million in leasing cost. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMAN:  That would have been prevented if we just retained the 
assets.  So total loss would be 14,5 million or thereabout. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shoe.  I take it there will be evidence as to who were 
the people responsible for all these decisions ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  On the issue of the leasing back Mr Human, 
the fact that they have been leased back at this cost, what does that say 
about the decision to sell them? 
MR HUMAN:  It is an irrational decision to sell them Chairperson. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  And it suggests that SAAT still needs those 
20 
GPUs? 
MR HUMAN:  Absolutely. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chairperson that ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  But well maybe Ms Hofmeyr will remember.  Did I not or 
maybe you were not involved.  Did I not hear evidence along the same 
06 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 208 
 
Page 142 of 142 
 
type of thing when Mr Nene was giving evidence with regard to SAA 
about, I think airbuses and that there was an idea that they must be sold 
and then leased back?  But anyway. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair it is before my time but Ms Hofmeyr is 
nodding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  Chair that concludes my questions for Mr 
Human. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Mr Human, thank you very much for coming 
to give evidence.  We will call you back if a need arises but thank you 
10 
very much and you are excused. 
MR HUMAN:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We are going to then adjourn.  Tomorrow 
the plan is that Ms Memela is supposed to be here.  Is it just her or there 
is another witness? 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  It is just her Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just her yes. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  The day has been set aside for her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  At this stage you are not aware of any 
developments that might exist with regard to her intentions? 
20 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:  We have received nothing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Alright, we will adjourn for the day and 
tomorrow we will start at 10 o’clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
