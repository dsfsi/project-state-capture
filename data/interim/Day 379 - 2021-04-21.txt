PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 21 APRIL 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We are ready to proceed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  The witness 
today Chairperson is Professor Cecil Petrus Louwrens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He is called by the Eskom work stream 
in regard to the pre-suspension letters and the metadata in 
relation thereto especially to determine the author and 
modifier 
of 
those 
three 
suspension 
letters 
of 
the 
executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well Prof Louwrens will be ready to 
take the oath or affirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is Professor Louwrens is that right? 
PROF LOUWRENS: That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Professor Louwrens. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand that you are part of the 
investigation team of the commission. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 4 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for coming to assist 
us on this matter that requires I think unusual expertise so 
he will help us to make sense of some of the things that we 
do not understand.  Okay.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Cecil Petrus Louwrens. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  No I do not. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank – thank you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes thanks.  May I proceed? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Have – have you announced for the 
benefit of the public the area on which he will be giving 
evidence? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 5 of 371 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes sorry DCJ I was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody was interfering with you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja they were giving me notice that Prof 
Louwrens' oath was not captured by the recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will redo that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was saying – I was asking whether you 
have already informed the public for their benefit on what 
10 
aspect Professor Louwrens will be testifying so that they 
can follow. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His evidence.  If you have not done so 
please do so before he – he starts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe let us redo the oath 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was wrong because I do not think 
he was speaking too softly.  They just did not put on their 
20 
mittens.  Okay alright let us – Registrar let – and both 
Professor Louwrens let us just redo the oath.  Hang on I 
think the technicians are making some gestures.  Okay 
alright.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 6 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Cecil Petrus Louwrens. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
10 
help me God. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Prof Louwrens 
has been called as an expert witness for the matter that 
has arisen before the commission.  That matter arose in 
the context of the affidavit provided to the commission by 
Mr Zethemba Khoza in terms of – in which an allegation is 
made that he had received four letters of suspension. 
 
He – he thinks that the letters were received from 
20 
Mr Tsotsi but he does not know how.  He has provided 
those letters with the metadata relating to each of those 
letters in terms of which the author of the letter and of the 
letters and the last modifier of the letters are mentioned in 
the metadata. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 7 of 371 
 
 
The 
commission 
seeks 
to 
have 
established 
independently of what has been provided to it by Mr Khoza 
by way of an expert opting in or expert evidence whether 
the author of the letter is indeed the person whose name is 
reflected on the metadata and whether the last modifier of 
the letter is also the person reflected in the field or that 
name in the metadata. 
 
And Professor Louwrens is here for that reason 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  And as I understand 
10 
the issue his evidence also relates to whether there is any 
basis on which the 00:07:09 said that somebody outside of 
Eskom 
had 
something 
to 
do 
with 
those 
letters 
of 
suspension. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to the 11 of March 2015 so the 
evidence resolved around the suspension of the executives 
and if so what is the basis for saying that or there might 
not be a scientific or technical basis so that then that is 
part of what Professor Louwrens will assist us on. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Using the – the suspension letters that 
you have referred to.  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 8 of 371 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Prof Louwrens once again 
thank you for your availability in assisting the commission.  
Could you please by way of a background just state your 
qualifications 
and 
your 
expertise 
relevant 
to 
the 
assessment that you have been asked to perform. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Certainly.  So I am – I own a 
consulting firm called Quintessence Digital Forensics so I 
have had that for the past five years and it is basically why 
I am also involved in the – the commission because of my 
involvement there. 
10 
 
But my background… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you have had the consulting 
firm of how long? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Five years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five years. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  But prior to that I was involved in the 
industry.  I was in the military for a number of years where 
I have – was in the military intelligence and also did a 
20 
computer for – not computer forensics but computer 
security and I then worked for a major bank as a Chief 
Information Security Officer for a number of years.   In that 
role I also managed the digital forensics function of that 
bank and I hold the following qualifications.  First of all a 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 9 of 371 
 
BSC or a BA Military Science, a BSCF Honours Computer 
Science. MSC Computer Science and then a PhD in 
computer science. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you mentioned BA is it BA Military 
Science or is it BSC Military Science?  I see in the 
affidavit. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It is BA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is BA so that should be corrected. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  This is – that should be corrected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I will sort that.  Okay.  And your 
10 
consulting firm is in what sector?  What does it do? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It is in digital forensics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  So I do forensic investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  And analysis of well criminal cases, 
civil cases etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Mr Bergs you have – oh 
Professor Bergs you have – oh Louwrens you have 
20 
provided the commission with an affidavit.  Your affidavit 
Chairperson is found in Eskom Bundle 19 page 355.  Are 
you there Prof Louwrens? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I have got it. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  The affidavit runs up to page 370 – 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 10 of 371 
 
370.  I saw you follow the black pagination on the left hand 
corner – top left hand corner.   
PROF LOUWRENS:  Okay I have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You speaking too softly Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have – you found the page – page 
370? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The affidavit – well on that page a 
signature appears above the name Cecil Petrus Louwrens 
you see that? 
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you confirm that to be your 
signature? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The affidavit is dated 19 April 2021 you 
confirm this to be your affidavit? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you confirm the correctness of the 
contents thereof? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I do. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson I beg leave to 
have the affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that you want to let him confirm 
that it has got annexures and just to identify to say from 
what page to what page the annexures run. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 11 of 371 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just so that I am sure which ones are his 
annexures which documents are not his annexures. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  Prof Louwrens the 
affidavit also has annexures to it starting from page 371 
you see that? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And there is a number of annexures to 
your affidavit up to page 421. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
You 
see 
that 
virtually 
is 
the 
confirmatory affidavit of one Nondumiso Zibi, you see that? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is also a confirmatory affidavit on 
page 423 apparently it is the unsigned one.  We have the 
signed one here of Mr Tshepo Moleko. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes see that.  Chairperson while we are 
there we have the signed copy of Mr Moleko’s affidavit – 
confirmatory affidavit which I shall beg leave to hand up. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To replace the unsigned one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  And so the last annexure 
Prof Louwrens is then the affidavit of Mr – confirmatory 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 12 of 371 
 
affidavit of Mr Moleko on page 423. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that correct.  Thank you Chair then 
Chairperson I beg leave to have this affidavit of Professor 
Louwrens admitted as Exhibit U42.1.  Chair well the reason 
I am pausing is because it is already marked Exhibit 42 – 
U42. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but it should be 42.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .1 yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Well that correction must 
10 
be made so that there is no confusion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the affidavit of Professor Cecil 
Petrus Becks Louwrens which starts at page 355 is 
admitted as an Exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit 
U42.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Prof Louwrens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has told us already about his 
20 
academic qualifications. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had told us about his consulting firm 
and what sector his consulting firm is involved in.   I think 
you can take it from there in terms of completing the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 13 of 371 
 
qualifications as an exception. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Prof Louwrens 
we – we see from your affidavit that you have also been 
involved in academics. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I have – I have been involved at the 
University of Johannesburg specifically lecturing digital 
forensics at Honours level and also computer security, risk 
management and a computer project management. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. So your – your background and I 
am talking educational – from an educational point of view 
your career is in IT. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you explain to the Chairperson 
when you talking about digital forensics what exactly does 
that refer to? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It is a similar field than normal 
forensics.  The same principles apply but the techniques 
are different and obviously we have to rely a lot on 
20 
technology and specific tools.  So that then means that you 
would investigate say for instance a hard drive and that is 
a computer disc from the suspect or whatever the case 
might be and the hard drive would then be analysed in 
detail as in terms of the consistency, the metadata and that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 14 of 371 
 
is the data about data so say for instance we have got a 
file or a word document – that word document is associated 
with other information or other data which is called 
metadata which in fact describes that document. 
 
So if we want to know more about that document 
and the contents how it was created and who created it the 
metadata can actually provide us with some information to 
that extent. 
 
And then if we have access to a computer the whole 
disc you could also then get corroborative information in 
10 
terms of the file system and you could then see if it is 
consistent and if that is consistent that would lead us to 
make certain deductions from that. 
 
But it is basically a 00:19:15 of facts from digital 
media. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue I will come back to this later 
but I think continue the qualification. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And so how long were you – were you 
employed at the University? 
20 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
I 
was 
employed 
as 
a 
visiting 
professor. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As a visiting professor.   
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For how long? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 15 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Fifteen years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is from when to when the fifteen 
years? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That was from 1990 – ag 2004 to 
2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  2004 to 2009? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 2019. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  19 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay alright.  And 
10 
throughout that period were you lecturing on computer 
science, IT, forensics digital forensics, forensics?  You 
were covering those? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And some of the students that you 
were teaching were doing Honours – were at Honours 
level? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And any – any students were doing 
Masters and Doctorates that you might have supervised 
20 
and promoted? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I did.  I supervised a few Master 
students and a few PhD students. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Alright continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Have you – have you yourself read any 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 16 of 371 
 
articles on the – on the – in the field Digital Forensics and 
IT? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes I did specifically the articles that 
were presented at International conferences and I also 
contributed to a chapter in one of the IFIP that is 
International Federation for Information Processing book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe you – you can just give us 
the title of the book and if you able to and then maybe the 
title of the chapter that you wrote? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can remember. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I have – I will get you the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise you can just supply. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  The precise – ja it is about the latest 
developments in – into the forensics and the chapter was 
about 
the 
framework 
for 
evaluating 
these 
00:22:12 
forensics written at [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay other than the chapter that chapter 
in a book in that book and papers that you delivered at 
international conferences would there be other – would 
20 
there be articles that you have published in articles or in 
journals or – that fall within the – the sector of forensics, 
digital forensics, computer science and ja let us deal. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Specifically in computer science I 
published an article on how to protect a computer by using 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 17 of 371 
 
the – let us call it the biological model for computer 
security.  So that enables the computer to protect itself.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe just before Mr Seleka proceeds 
just for the sake of completeness what is the name of your 
consulting firm? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It is Quintessence Digital Forensics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Prof Louwrens then talking 
10 
of digital forensics and which involves looking at the 
metadata and making an investigation how often would you 
have done that sort of an investigation? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Evidence of metadata … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry,  I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you should just cover what he has 
got to say under paragraph 4 up to 8 because it covers the 
other matters relating to his qualification as an expert.  I 
think some you may have covered but you can just check 
20 
make sure we cover all of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise he can just give that evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Prof Louwrens you see – we go back to 
page 355 from paragraph 4 you mention there that you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 18 of 371 
 
have more than 41 years’ experience in security and 
related fields in financial services industry and military 
comprising and then you give a list.  Let us – let us deal 
with security which I think is what you deal with in 4.1.  
When you say security what are you referring to – 
experience in security? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  There are basically three types of 
security.  The first would be physical security which we all 
know that physical guarding, alarm systems, CCTV systems 
and access control.  Then there is the next one would be 
10 
personnel security which is screening of personnel, making 
sure that background checks are done and that the people 
are say – or are what they purport to be.  And the third one 
would be computer security or information security in use 
interchangeably where it goes about the protection of 
computers, access control to computers their systems, the 
file to be able to monitor what happens on computer 
systems and to protect against viruses and malware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of the 28 years compared to in 
paragraph 4.1 how many of those years relate to the last 
20 
part that you said computers and 00:26:51. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Computer security. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I was if information security officer 
since 2010. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 19 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  2010? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  10 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  But prior to that I was always involved 
to a certain extent in information security. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you mention in paragraph 4.2 that 
you 
have 
nine 
years 
in 
intelligence 
and 
information 
security in military environment.  I know that you did touch 
on the military environment could you elaborate a little 
10 
more what the intelligence and information security in that 
environment would entail? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It was early years in the military in 
terms of computer security.  This is a new field.  I just 
completed my degree at Stellenbosch University Saldanha 
and I was then requested to write the first information 
security policy for the Defence security.  So I started off in 
the information security in 1986. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  19? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  86. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you would have then been employed 
by the South African Defence Force? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Well what is it that you did when 
we – we talking intelligence and information security? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 20 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  In terms of information security the 
first job that I had to do is to write a policy for information 
security.  How to do it, what needs to be done, what the 
responsibilities are?  Because the policy that govern 
information security or computer security as it was called 
at that time.  In military intelligence basically we monitored 
of the external events in the vets to the country etcetera 
and also the computer security relates to that because as 
we were using computer systems it could have been 
threatened and it could have been abused and accessed 
10 
and hacked although at that time hacking was not – not a 
known term it just became more known later on.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you have five years you say in 
digital consulting.  So you would have consulted in Digital 
Forensics which you have already explained. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now can you tell the Chairperson 
which years are those, if you can recall? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Which year? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, you said five years.   
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From which year to which? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And in paragraph 5 you say you 
have the following Digital Forensic Certificates, Access 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 21 of 371 
 
Data, Certified Examiner and EnCase Certified Examiner.   
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So this – what does this 
certificate means, you are an Examiner? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, I am qualified to be an Examiner 
using those specific products and those are two of the 
more known products in the digital forensics environment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what products are you referring 
to? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   The first product is Access Data and 
10 
the second one is In-Case, EnCase Forensics.  So the 
Access Data Certified examines the ACE qualification and 
then 
the 
EnCase 
Certified 
examines 
the 
ENCE 
qualifications.  So both of those require examination and 
you can only be certified if you pass that examination.  It 
involves a practical component as well.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you able to give the Chairperson 
inside into what is being referred to as Access Data? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Access Data is one of the leading 
products in the digital forensic tools market.  It provides 
20 
you with a platform or the ability to analyse data, hard-
drives, data that you capture from other electronic media 
and then to categorise it and to display it in a way that is 
understandable and also to report on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So by way of an example, what sort of 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 22 of 371 
 
data? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So say for instance there is a 
question about if somebody did something on a computer, 
we could then access the logs on that computer and look at 
that event and see if that event correlates to the action 
that the person is accused or is purported to have done.  
We can also then display the actions, the time, the specific 
time that it happened.   
 
We can also see from that that computer was 
connected to any other computer on the network, any other 
10 
device that are connected to it, for instance a USB stick.  
If you connect that, it is recorded.  So I can show that that 
is what happened.  I can also identify ...[indistinct] via the 
serial number that is supported. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the two, is it a software 
application? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It is a software tool.  It is actually a 
suite of products. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That can – ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the EnCase.  If you could 
also explain what it entails. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   EnCase is similar.  It has got the 
same 
purpose 
and 
it 
has 
got 
much 
of 
the 
same 
functionality.  It is just two different tools.  It is like having 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 23 of 371 
 
two sets of spanners.  The one you use for this and the 
other for the other.  So the reason why we in the forensic 
world like to use more than one tool is to verify our results 
and make sure that it is actually correct and if there any 
anomalies we will be able to explain that.   
 
So EnCase the same functionality.  It has some 
strengths in certain areas and it is less well-versed(?) in 
others, for instance.  But if you use both of those tools you 
will get to the correct answer.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then regard to the assessment that the 
10 
Commission had required you to do, did you have to use 
any of these tools? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, I did.  I specifically used EnCase 
because it displayed the information to the metadata that 
we needed to look at. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then ready to go into.  [laughs] 
PROF LOUWRENS:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is fine.  Before – I guess this 
would be the right time for me to...  I see that in your 
affidavit footnote 1 you tell us what metadata is.  You say 
20 
metadata is that provides information about other data.  In 
this case it is data about before MS Word documents in 
question. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 24 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, if you are given a document and 
you have to establish in which computer or which computer 
was used to type, your expertise enables you to do that? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No, that is not that easy to do.  It 
depends on the document itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So in some cases you can? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   In some cases you can? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In some cases you cannot? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   In some cases you cannot. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And – ja, we can talk about this case 
if you want to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So we will come to that.  Ja, I 
think that is fine.  Maybe – well, let us talk about this case 
and then we will take it from there. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes, Prof Louwrens 
you were given an email ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I wanted to say earlier on and I did 
not say it, Mr Seleka and Prof Louwrens. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That I hope Prof Louwrens will not be 
embarrassed in any way by this.  I wanted to say:  Well, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 25 of 371 
 
some of the people have said the Commission has got 
some of the best investigators and I just wanted to say:  
Well, look at this qualifications, you see why they say that.  
[laughs] 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Thank you.  It is a compliment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prof Louwrens.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  [laughs]  Yes, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Prof Louwrens, you were given 
then an email with four letters attached to it.   
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The four letters titled:  Pre-suspension 
Letters.  
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you were, together with those 
letters, provided with the metadata that we have also 
received with the letters from one of the witnesses. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You referred to those letters in 
paragraph 11 of your affidavit.  And what I would like you 
to do for the purposes of evidence is to take us through 
20 
each letter ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe before that Mr Seleka.  I 
think it is important that he deals with ...[indistinct] which 
is, I think, where he articulates what he understood his 
mandate to be ...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 26 of 371 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of what he was asked to do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Do 
you 
want 
to 
deal 
with 
that 
Prof Louwrens, what you understood your task to be? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I will, Chair.  So I have been tasked 
to conduct a forensic assessment of the Metadata of four 
Microsoft 
Word 
documents 
that 
were 
submitted 
into 
evidence into the Commission.  The four Word documents 
were attached to an email and I have got the images of 
10 
that attached to Annexure CL-1 here.   
 
So as the first part of the annexure CL-1 
contains an email that has been attached and forwarded.  
The second part of the annexure contains the email itself.  
In other words, the original email contained another email 
that was forwarded as an attachment.  So it was an email 
within an email.   
 
And it was in the second emails where four 
documents attached and those are the documents that I 
have been asked to look at. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Take it from there, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let us go to CL-1 quickly while 
we are here which is on page 371.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page?  371? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   371, Chair. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 27 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Prof Louwrens, you say the four MS 
Word documents are attached to an email, images of which 
are contained in Annexure CL-1.  So on that page 371 is an 
annexure marked CL-1.  Do you see that? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is this what you are referring to as 
images of which – images of an email? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct.  So the top portion of 
that is the image of the email.  That is the first email that 
10 
contains an attachment.  You can see little yellow block. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And that yellow block refers to the 
next page which is 372 which is the email containing the 
four documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that yellow block the one titled 
Special? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct.  Special Docs.msg. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Msg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  Just carry on.  You were saying 
the next page is? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   The next page is actually that yellow 
block. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 28 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That email is contained in that yellow 
block.  So if you open that yellow block you will find the 
next one on page 372. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Going back to 
page 371, that is still with the yellow block.  You have got 
something written there.  What is that Prof Louwrens? 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
 
We 
have 
got 
the 
sender 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is reflected as? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   As khozazw@eskom.co.za. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and the subject? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   The subject:  Special Docs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the message there? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And there is a message ID which is a 
long stream of letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
  
Which 
uniquely 
identifies 
that 
message to the mail system. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And then it is the to field. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It is Veneto, venete@kleininc.co.za. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  What do you make of 
that information there?  What does that information mean?  
Namely, what appears next to the yellow block as the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 29 of 371 
 
information underneath that? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It means that an email was sent from 
an email box called khozazw@eskom.co.za 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
 
To 
an 
email 
box 
called 
venete@kleininc.co.za. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So then you say when you click 
on the yellow box ...[intervenes]  
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...it opens up to what? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, it opens up – you were saying the 
page – I mean, the documents from page 372. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what do we find there in the yellow 
folder or box? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   We have then an email that was 
attached and the email was from an email address called 
20 
sethembe@khoza which is then the same address, the 
previous one, khozazw@eskom.co.za.  And then we have 
got four Word documents attached, the little W in the blue 
boxes.  It is very small but that you can make it.   
 
And then it is a Word document.  And the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 30 of 371 
 
document, the first one is called pre-suspensiondm.docx.  
The second one is called pre-suspensionfd.docx.  The third 
one 
is 
called 
pre-suspensionkm.docx. 
 
(pre-
suspensionmk.docx)   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it MK? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Sorry, correct.  And the third – the 
fourth one is pre-suspensiontm.docx. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  This email you are referring you, 
could you determine where it came from or was the 
addressor and the addressee? 
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, in the sense that we looked 
through the evidence that we got from the Commission’s 
systems, evidence previously seized from Eskom.  I could 
discover that the same documents and I could actually find 
this email in the mailbox of this khozazw@eskom.co.za. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And who was he addressing the email 
to? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It was exactly the same here as 
venete@kleininc.co.za. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Yes.  And you have a date for 
20 
this exchange of email? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, let me just go through this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the 14 t h? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   14 t h of March 2015 at 13:20 but that 
Universal Central Time ...[indistinct] add two hours from 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 31 of 371 
 
local time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  That date – that time is for 
what, for the sending of an email or what? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It was the email that – the image here 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   ...that was sent at that date and time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that was on the 14 t h of March. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   14 t h of March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And what time? 
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:   13:20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   36. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Plus two hours.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I see. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   ...in South African time it will be 
15:20.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay alright.  Okay.  Thank 
you.  You may proceed.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Then Prof Louwrens, the 
documents 
...[indistinct] 
were 
documents 
you 
have 
indicated as pre-suspensions, FD, MK and TM.  If you click 
on that, let us say the DM one first, what do you find? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It is a document that purports to be a 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 32 of 371 
 
pre-suspension document addressed to addressees.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just look at page 373. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 373? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   373 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where there are three suspension 
letters.  Is that right? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
PROF LOUWRENS:   Right.  And so, if we look at CL-2, the 
pre-suspensiondm.docx.  It is a document from reportedly 
10 
Dan 
Marokane 
to 
Projective 
Capital 
dated 
the 
11 t h of March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did say addressed to him, né, not 
from? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Ja, addressed to Dan Marokane. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
And 
the 
date 
given 
is 
11 t h of March 2015 on the document? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And it is an invitation to a pre-
20 
suspension meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   In a – two points follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the document, reading: 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 33 of 371 
 
“Dear Mr Marokane.  Invitation to a pre-
suspension meeting..” 
 
Correct? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  For the sake of completeness 
because I think they are the same, is it not? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let us read one into the record.  
Prof Louwrens, would you please just read that one into 
the record. 
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:   The whole letter? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That one of Dear Mr Marokane. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Okay. 
“Dear Mr Marokane.  Invitation to a pre-
suspension meeting. 
The 
company 
is 
presently 
conducting 
an 
investigation into allegations of misconduct 
allegedly committed by you. 
20 
The allegations of misconduct which will be 
investigated relate to, amongst others, the 
following. 
1.1. 
As the Chairman of the Emergency 
Committee, you have been negligent in the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 34 of 371 
 
management of the electricity system during 
the times of emergency that resulted to 
unnecessary load-shedding. 
1.2. 
You 
were 
grossly 
negligent 
in 
managing the Bill Programme for Medupi 
that 
has 
resulted 
in 
delays 
and 
cost 
overruns. 
1.3. 
You 
acted 
irregularly 
in 
administrating 
and 
managing 
the 
coal 
purchase 
contracts 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
10 
Eskom. 
2. The 
company 
has 
not 
completed 
their 
investigations. 
 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
investigations is to establish whether there are 
grounds for disciplinary action and in regard to 
that: 
2.1. 
[Indistinct] of the allegations and 
2.2. 
The possibility that your presence 
may jeopardise the investigation into the 
alleged misconduct. 
20 
The company is of the view that you should be 
suspended on full pay pending the finalisation 
of the investigation. 
3.  You are temporarily suspended until further 
notice. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 35 of 371 
 
4. You are invited to make a representation to 
the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. 
5. The meeting will be held on 12  March 2015 
at 09:45. 
6. During 
the 
meeting 
you 
will 
have 
the 
following rights: 
6.1. 
You are entitled to be present at the 
meeting. 
6.2. 
You are entitled to be represented at 
the meeting by a fellow employee or an 
10 
employee representative. 
6.3. 
You are entitled to have the facility of 
an interpreter if so required. 
6.4. 
You are entitled to confer with your 
representative at reasonable times before, 
during and after the meeting. 
6.5. 
You are entitled personally or through 
your representative to question us as to the 
reasons why we believe that you should be 
suspended. 
20 
7. 
 We envisaged that our investigation should 
be completed within a period of four weeks...” 
 
And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  There is no name for the but there 
is a space and then there is a sentence saying:   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 36 of 371 
 
“I, Dan Marokane, acknowledges receipt of this 
notice in the suspension hearing.” 
 
And a space is provided for his signature and 
date.  There is a space provided for the signature of the 
person serving the notice but those were not signed.  
Okay.  I see they are not exactly the same in terms of the 
allegations. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The allegations.  That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Let us deal with this for now and 
then, this one, and then we take it from there.  Or unless 
10 
we should – you think we should deal with all of them and 
then you want to deal with all of them? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Then ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the others ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Then continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then continue, Mr Seleka.  Just proceed 
as you intended to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Prof Louwrens, so that would be 
20 
the first annexure to the email on page 372.  The other 
annexures – there is another on titled pre-suspensionfd.  
Look at page 377.   
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you go to 377.  Would you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 37 of 371 
 
let him tell me what the document at 375 represents?  
Which comes immediately after the letter he has just read. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Speaker moves away from microphone 
– unclear.] 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Page 375, we have got the metadata 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   ...extracted from that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And that is the metadata that you 
used to interpret and come to certain conclusions? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  That is fine.  And are they 
at 376 and 376? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes.  What I did there then, we have 
got two systems as – the one is the – the one that I have 
extracted(?) the EnCase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And on 376, is our system relativity 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
 
...of 
extracted 
metadata 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 38 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And what is important there is that 
the on 376 at the bottom the MD5#. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I will explain what the hash(#) is.  
The hash is like a fingerprint for a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It is a unique number that represents 
the document.  If one bit changes in that document then 
that number will change. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So it is important that that number is 
the same as the number that – the document that I actually 
investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So you would see that on page 375, 
the second line of that table is an MD5#. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And in the last line of 376 is also an 
MD5# and those hashes are exactly the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Which is important because that 
means that I have dealt with exactly the same document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And that also referred to that 
document and if we go into the evidence later on the other 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 39 of 371 
 
expert report, they also use that MD5 to identify the 
documents.  So it is important just to note that those 
documents are exactly the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Okay.  Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chairperson, I think we can go 
into the metadata ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us go there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Prof Louwrens, you were asked to 
conduct digital forensic assessment of the metadata.  You 
are saying at page 375 – and we will deal with each letter 
10 
at one time – page 375 is the metadata in relation to the 
letter pre-suspensiondm.   
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is addressed to Mr Dan Marokane.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before you proceed.  Just to make 
sure one can follow.  You have said that – you have 
confirmed that you were asked to conduct a forensic – 
digital forensic assessment.  Is that the correct? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  When a person conducts that 
20 
assessment, digital forensic assessment, what would they 
be looking for?  You conduct that assessment in order to 
get what?  To achieve what?  What is the outcome of such 
an investigation? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Chair, in this case, I have only had 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 40 of 371 
 
the actual Word documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And obviously the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Okay.  So what – let us deal with the 
Word documents first. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.  And you must take it that I 
know nothing about IT and so on.  So do not feel that you 
should not explain some of the basic terms to me. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I will do that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So the Word documents, it is 
Microsoft Word.  It is a product from Microsoft.  It is part of 
the Office products, Microsoft Office.  And it is widely used 
as word processing tool, called software.  Now what is 
specific about the documents that we are dealing with here 
is they are docx.  If you look at the latter part of the name 
it is the name of the document and then it has got a docx.  
That qualifies that document as a certain type of Word 
document.  Now docx is the latest standard that is used in 
20 
Microsoft Words.  And it also then indicates that it is 
certain metadata, EXIF, we call it EXIF metadata which is 
imbedded 
in 
that 
document 
which 
you 
could 
then 
investigate.  So by using digital forensic tools, like in Face 
for instance, you could then extract that information. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 41 of 371 
 
 
Information 
is 
also 
visible 
or 
some 
of 
the 
information is also visible on the document itself if you go 
into the document and you go into what we call info, file 
info, it will display a page and the page will then display 
who created the document and who last modified the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you use some instrument to look at 
the document. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you can see certain images 
10 
and information. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And that information would tell 
you a number of things including who may have had 
something to do with the document in one way or another. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So if you look at the table, 375, that 
is the information that I would then extract or could extract 
from the document. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So I do not know if you want me to 
deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And using what we just talked about or 
using a number of instruments? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 42 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   A number of instruments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I use – normally using Face but, as I 
said, I verify it and I verify this specifically with another 
tool to make sure that I understand it correctly because it 
is also a bit open to interpretation, they do not always give 
you all the information, maybe they – say for instance you 
get a value of 3, the question is, what does it mean?  You 
have to corroborate with other tools to see three minutes, 
for instance. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Continue, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prof Louwrens, just before you move 
on, does it mean if I do not have the NKS tool on my 
computer, I will not be able to generate this information or 
to come up with – to pull out this information. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No, you could use various other tools 
to actually do this but Encase enables you to do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes – just say that – you could what? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   You could use a number of other 
tools also to extract other [indistinct – dropping voice] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, what I am asking you is, take my 
standard laptop. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I buy it from whichever shop.  I have 
the normal word processing, Microsoft, but I do not have 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 43 of 371 
 
the tools you are referring to.  Does it mean without those 
tools I will not be able here to extract this information? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   You would be able to extract some of 
the information, not all of it because Word does actually 
display some of the information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  So then let us go to – clearly in 
this case you are given the emails and you were given the 
attachments to the emails.  You are then asked to do or 
conduct digital forensic assessment of the metadata in 
relation to what you have been given.  Tell the Chairperson 
10 
what then – what should we understand you to be doing 
when you conduct a digital forensic assessment in relation 
to the documents that you were given, do you know  - 
firstly, is what we understand you to be doing and 
secondly, what is the objective in your exercise? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   In this case it was specifically to look 
at who created the document and also who last modified 
the document but also, if we look at any analysis you 
would also always look at time, when it was done, does it 
make sense?  For instance, was the document created 
20 
before the email was sent because it is impossible to have 
it created and if it was created after as in one of the – or 
some of this metadata indicates, you could maybe look at 
why the dates are inconsistent and then you have to know 
a lot about the file system, how it actually creates dates, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 44 of 371 
 
changes dates, if you move files from one drive to the 
other and also if you access the file, how it is updated.  So 
you look at all those things, ancillary things as well.  But 
what is important to note here, these are the values 
recorded.  How they relate to real life is something 
different so in this case the values recorded for the creator 
was 
Suzanne 
Daniels 
and 
the 
last 
modified 
field 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the date when she created 
the document or you are still going to come to that?  It is 
10 
fine if you are still going to come to it. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Ja, I can give it to you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I would not be able to say if she 
created the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you can say when the document was 
…[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:   I can give you the create date of the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So the create date of the document 
was 2015, the 10 March, 16.39 and that is also then 
universal central time, so plus two hours, so it is about – it 
is 18.39, South African time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, continue, Mr Seleka. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 45 of 371 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So we will come to that.  Let us 
just lay the groundwork relative to your investigation or 
forensic assessment.  Please go back to page 357. 
CHAIRPERSON:   357? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
357. 
 
So 
your 
first 
task 
is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just mention, Mr Seleka, for what it is 
worth, we – I was hoping we would finish within an hour, I 
will be having the witness for today in due course.  I had 
said he should be here at half past ten, so - but it is 
10 
important that we cover this properly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought I must just mention that 
because when we previously spoke, today was vacant. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I just want you to know that we do 
not have a lot of time but we must do Prof Louwrens’ 
evidence properly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – okay, let us continue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Prof Louwrens, page 357, just to 
lay the groundwork.  Paragraph 10 you have already stated 
what the first purpose is or the first requirement to you was 
in regard to the documentation that were given to you and 
then in paragraph 12 you also say that you have also been 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 46 of 371 
 
asked to express an opinion on the forensic report issued 
by a company called Cyanre. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, let us go to paragraph 13, we 
will come to your opinion in regard to that opinion of 
Cyanre.  Paragraph 13 says: 
“The evidence that I examined was forensically 
acquired and processed.” 
When you say forensically, what do you mean quickly on 
that? 
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:   What I mean is that we have got a 
principle that whenever you acquire or source evidence or 
data you take care not to change anything.  So when it is 
then acquired, that media or disk or whatever is write-
protected so that you cannot change it.  The tools actually 
enable you to verify that it has not been changed, so an 
exact copy of the data. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this will be your again computer-
related tools? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You then say: 
“I 
have 
examined 
the 
chain 
of 
custody 
documentation associated with the evidence and 
found it intact.” 
The chain of custody documentation, what does that mean? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 47 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Chair it means that whenever we 
seize date or source data or acquire data we fill in a form 
which extracts exactly who is involved, what the source of 
that data, we get the signatures, the timing, the note, the 
media, the serial numbers, etcetera, on that form and then 
that documentation that accompanies the evidence to the 
point where we sign it into our storage facility and we can 
then verify that the data or this evidence was not tampered 
with and we know exactly what every hand-off would be 
from one person to another. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that you confirm in this case was 
followed and it was found to be intact. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Turn to page 358.  Paragraph 14 you 
say: 
“The email in question was sent from the mailbox of 
Khoza.” 
You have already testified on that. 
“…on 14…” 
Let me read the brackets: 
20 
“Khozazw@eskom.co.za, the Khoza email mailbox 
on 
14 
March 
2014 
at 
1.20.36 
p.m. 
UTC 
to 
Venete@kleininc.co.za.” 
Paragraph 16: 
“I do not find an email received via the Khoza email 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 48 of 371 
 
mailbox with the said documents attached to it on 
the 
Commission’s 
eDiscovery 
platform 
for 
the 
purposes of performing my assessment.” 
Yes, the question is, given what you are saying there, 
could you see where did Mr Khoza obtain the documents? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No, not from the evidence that I had, 
I could not see that.  There are many other ways that he 
could have gotten that other than receiving it through his 
email box like for instance another email or a physical USB 
drive. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So are you saying there is not an 
indication that his email to Ms Venete was an email he was 
forwarding from somewhere else and then sending it to Ms 
Venete Klein? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct, I could not find any. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You could not find. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he would have been the creator of 
that email and then I touched the letters which were sent 
to Ms Venete Klein. 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That would be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure I understand 
that.  Did you have access to his computer and is that what 
you would need to have access to to see whether he had 
received documents from somebody else? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 49 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, Chair, I only had access to the 
mailbox, the image that we collected from his mailbox. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   If I had access to his computer, I 
might find more information relevant to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   For instance if he had other email 
addresses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Or if that document resides – or 
10 
those documents resides on his computer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   But at this stage this is all I have, I 
cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, okay.  And about the creator 
the documents you say there is a possibility that it could 
be – could have been dated in his computer but you do not 
know that for sure. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, for the – the reason is that the 
creator and the last modified metadata can be changed.  It 
20 
is very easy to change and if you know what to do, you can 
actually change that.  So you cannot rely on that on its 
own.  You have to have corroborative information or 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But if it has not been changed 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 50 of 371 
 
it would be giving one information about who created it, if 
we knew that it had not been changed. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   If we knew it was not changed.  It 
normally picks up the user of that computer.  In other 
words, if you have an account on that computer you have 
got a user name but user name is then reflected in those 
fields and if it not changed it is normally the user name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the user name will be the name of 
the person who uses that computer or who owns the 
10 
computer. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No, I would not go that far.  It is the 
user name that was assigned to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  So my computer could have 
SLK as the user name as opposed to Pule as the user 
name. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that what you are saying? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is what I say, you can have 
Mickey Mouse as the user. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can have Mickey Mouse as the 
user name. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if your computer reflects that – or if 
a document reflects that – reflects your user name, let us 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 51 of 371 
 
say your user name is Bucks(?) that does not mean, does 
it, 
that 
that 
email 
was 
necessarily 
created 
in 
your 
computer, somebody can use another computer and just 
put in that user name. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct, you could do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But if that user name, which 
happens to be your user name, is reflected in relation to a 
document that is found in your computer, is that not 
sufficient basis to say until somebody comes up with 
evidence that somebody else interfered with this computer, 
10 
with your computer, you must be the person who created 
that document.  Is that not a basis to say this document is 
found in Prof Louwrens’ computer, it reflects that as the 
user name, that is the user name that Prof Louwrens uses, 
therefore until somebody tells me otherwise, I should take 
it that he created it.  Is that – can that – is that something 
that technologically sound or not? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Not from a technological point of view 
but it is a reasonable assumption if you look at, say for 
instance, if it was a corporate computer where the user 
20 
names were defined and where there are specific rules and 
policies not to share passwords and not to have whole 
access to that computer then it would be reasonable to 
hold that person responsible for the actions on that 
computer.  So yes in that sense.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 52 of 371 
 
 
Forensically, there is nothing that I can tell other 
than if those policies were in place.  I cannot say that from 
the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you refer to policies, that is 
the corroborative evidence you are talking about in your 
opinion in your affidavit. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So you look at what forensics 
provide us with and you look at surrounding evidence. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you use the two and based on 
that you might be able – you might be justified to reach a 
certain conclusion. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Prof Louwrens, you 
mentioned having access to the mailbox of Mr Khoza but 
you did not have access to the computer. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Maybe you need to explain to the 
20 
Chairperson how does that work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what difference it makes to have 
access to the mailbox and not the computer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Chair, it makes a huge difference.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 53 of 371 
 
What 
we 
got 
was, 
every 
big 
company, 
corporate 
environment, has go its own mail management systems, 
mail servers and so on.  So what we have got is a copy of 
the mailbox on the server, not a mailbox on his personal 
computer.  So I only had access to the mail-related 
evidence and not to any other system-related evidence that 
might be on the computer.  Now on the computer we would 
find logs, we would find the master file table.  It would 
provide us with a list of documents on that computer, 
events, etcetera, that we can corroborate.    
10 
 
We could also look at the specific setup of the 
users, the access rights of those users, what they could 
and could not do.  So that would make a huge difference in 
evaluating – if any tampered with a document or if 
somebody created a document. 
 
We could also look at the templates for that 
document if that resides on that computer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so his mailbox, Mr Khoza’s 
mailbox, were you able to access it from the Eskom 
20 
server? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No, it was actually seized by our 
investigators 
and then subsequently loaded 
onto our 
Relativity database or eDiscovery platform and I could 
access it from there. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 54 of 371 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it was seized from where? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   From Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From Eskom? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that what you are dealing with 
…[intervenes] 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
 
In 
the 
chain 
of 
custody 
documentation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
 
In 
the 
chain 
of 
custody 
10 
documentation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the chain of custody documents.  
Page 360, you may turn there quickly, 360 from paragraph 
21 to 25, is that what you are dealing with there about 
obtaining this – Mr Khoza’s mailbox from Eskom ultimately 
to the Commission? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So in paragraph 21: 
“I have located an alternative source of the four MS 
Word documents in the email mailbox of Khoza 
20 
email mailbox on the Commission’s eDiscovery 
platform, Relativity.” 
So you call it an alternative source.  Explain to the 
Chairperson? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Chair, the primary source was 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 55 of 371 
 
documents that we received relating to the submission of 
those 
four 
documents 
to 
the 
Commission 
and 
also 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that means the actual document as 
provided by Mr Khoza? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No.  Well, I did not get those actual 
documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I got photocopies of the documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the Eskom work stream provided 
10 
you with those documents. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Electronic copy, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you are saying that is the primary 
source. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the alternative source is what 
you are referring to here? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you went - in your exercise, you 
went – you did not just relay on the documents given to 
20 
you, you took a step further. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes I did because in terms of the 
electronic analysis I needed electronic copies of those 
documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 56 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   And as I said previously Cyanre, the 
other company, provided us with the MD5 hashes for those 
documents so I could find the exact documents, so I knew I 
was working with the same documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  So that is right.  Then 
paragraph 23 explains further: 
“The 
Khoza 
email 
mailbox 
was 
subsequently 
forensically extracted and loaded onto the Relativity 
eDiscovery platform.” 
And you refer to annexure CL8. 
10 
“…for the Relativity container path and unique 
evidence number recorded on Relativity as…” 
And you give the whole number there. 
“A copy of the chain of custody document for this 
unique evidence number as well as its entry in the 
DFT 
digital 
evidence 
register 
is 
contained 
in 
annexure CL9 hereto and reflect the following: 
The evidence was collated on 22 February 2019 at 
14.04 a.m. from one Nondumiso Ubi…” 
I have seen from the confirmatory affidavit that the spelling 
20 
should be corrected.  Zibi, Chairperson, Z-i-b-i. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Chief Information Officer and also 
she says she was the Acting Chief Information Officer.  You 
saw that, Prof Louwrens? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 57 of 371 
 
“...at the Eskom head office by another DFT..” 
That is digital forensic team member. 
“…Mr Tshepo Maleku.  The evidence was elected on 
a 1 terabyte Western Digital hard drive with the 
serial number…” 
Which you give there. 
“…see the second page of annexure CL9.  The 
evidence was signed into the DFT Commission’s 
digital evidence register as number 104.” 
And you refer to the annexure. 
10 
“From the above the COC…” 
What does COC stands for? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Chain of custody document. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chain of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What does it mean? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Chain of custody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That refers to the process undertaken 
to obtain the information forensically, is that correct? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    
“So from the above, the COC or chain of custody 
seems to be intact and the evidence can be relied 
upon.” 
And you attach the confirmatory affidavits.  Okay.  So you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 58 of 371 
 
are confident that the Commission can rely on this 
information. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   I am confident that the chain of 
custody is intact and that the evidence is what it purports 
to be. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is what it purports to be.  Thank you.  
So then in the interest of time, maybe you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember, Mr Seleka, you have got 
to do it properly so the interests of time must not 
compromise the …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Prof Louwrens, let 
us go to page 358. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Paragraph 16 you 
say: 
“My examination of the metadata of the four MS 
word documents attached to the email in question 
reveal that all four of the MS Word documents were 
created from the custom office templates folder 
using 
the 
letterhead 
template 
GEN2015.EOTX 
20 
template 
on 
a 
computer 
with 
a 
user 
name 
DanielsM.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, where are you now, Mr 
Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 358, paragraph 16, Chair.  Sorry, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 59 of 371 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also just remember to let him give 
the evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prof Louwrens …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, at some stage we were on the 
metadata relating to the first document. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought that might be quicker if he says 
this is what the information that has been revealed, this is 
what it means. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the first document, that pre-
suspension letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe would it not be easier that way?  
Prof Louwrens, because as I understand it, you looked at 
20 
that first document, pre-suspension and that document that 
comes after that is the one that tells you what you find. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if we deal with that ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 60 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will tell us what you found and then 
we take it from there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let us do it that way, then we can 
do that with each one of the letters.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Prof Louwrens did not, ja because I 
thought that paragraph 16 was also important but you will 
address is in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can do paragraph 16. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, just explain that.  What you are 
saying there in paragraph 16 to the Chairperson, just 
before we go on to ...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Chairperson, it is important the 
template that was used, it is like a format for that type of 
document, was stored in a computer which the username is 
Daniels M.  So that is the closest connection I can make to 
a computer and a user. 
 
Obviously I could not say if the user Daniels M is 
Susanne Daniels.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So all you can say is your 
assessment or investigation of the document revealed this 
name as the user.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the face of it, and you must just tell 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379

me if I am putting words into your mouth.  On the face of it, 
it means unless there is evidence to the contrary, it one 
can read it to mean it is Daniels who created it, without 
saying it is Susanne Daniels who have, or you say whoever 
created it, used this user name, or is that not correct? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Just to be correct, that this template 
that was used ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Came from a computer with that 
name, does not mean there is no connection between the 
10 
creator and the template username.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The template used ...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
To 
create 
the 
document, 
had 
that 
username.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is as far as you can go.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is as far as I can go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  So if I can explain it to you, if I send 
20 
you a template. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That template would reflect or the 
META data would reflect that that template came from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 62 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  If you then use that template to edit a 
document or create another document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  It would reflect your name.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Yes, okay alright.  Right.  If 
you have sent me a template reflecting your name and I 
alter it before I send it to somebody else not to reflect your 
name but to reflect Mr Seleka’s name.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Only on the creator data or the last 
modified data.  The other date, the template folder name is 
10 
imbedded so that ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot change that.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  You cannot change, well I cannot say 
you can never change that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but generally speaking. 
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
Generally 
speaking 
you 
cannot 
change that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so if you have sent me a document 
using 
your 
template 
reflecting 
your 
name, 
generally 
speaking if I forward this to somebody else, it would still 
20 
show that it came from a template with your username.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Okay, so therefore is it 
correct and you must just tell me where, when I am asking 
you 
something 
that 
falls 
outside 
of 
your 
expertise, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 63 of 371 
 
therefore what you cannot say is that it was Professor 
Louwrens who created the document.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That you cannot say. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That I cannot say.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But what you can say is that the template 
on which it was created, if that is technologically correct to 
put  it like that, the template on which it was created had 
Professor, had this particular username.   
PROF LOUWRENS:  Ja, had a particular username.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and then it is up to somebody else 
to determine who used, whose username was that.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is something else. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  No, that is helpful, ja.  
Okay, Mr Seleka.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  The, is the template 
or did the template in this case Prof Louwrens, remain the 
same?   
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It is impossible for me to say. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  I can only say that if you prepare it as 
to other documents that looks the same, not does not have 
necessarily the same template name, then there is a small 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 64 of 371 
 
difference in like the address block below where the names 
of the directors were reflected, that was absent from the 
documents that I looked at.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  What was absent? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  The address block, if you look at the 
directors below, at the footer of the document.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  There is normally a list of directors 
and in the documents that I examined, those were absent.  
That is all that I could maybe pick up.  I could not tell if 
10 
that was part of the original document or not, template or 
not.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Could we quickly go to Eskom Bundle 
12 Chairperson, just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  To exhaust this point.  Page 50.  Prof 
Louwrens,  I want to show you something and you can 
explain this to the Chairperson.  On Eskom Bundle 12, 
page 50.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, there is a document there Prof 
Louwrens, which appears to be a template as the date 
enquiries tell.  It says dear, it is on Eskom logo.  It says: 
 
“Intention to suspend, pending an investigation 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 65 of 371 
 
into allegations of misconduct.” 
 
And the details are there: 
 
“Eskom has received information in terms of 
which it is alleged that you committed various 
acts on misconducts.  The allegations relate to 
the following.” 
 
A space is left open there to fill in: 
 
“In the light of the serious nature of the 
allegations 
of 
misconduct 
against 
you, 
I 
believe that your presence in the work place 
10 
will have a negative impact on the organisation 
and your contractual duties.  I have therefore 
taken the preliminary decision to suspend you 
from work, with full pay pending the outcome 
of the disciplinary hearing.  My preliminary 
decision to suspend you is informed by the 
following.” 
 
Then a space is left open to complete as well.  This 
appears to be a template, it goes on to page 51 with 
information to be filled where there are open spaces.  Now 
20 
could you explain to the Chairperson what were you talking 
about in regard to the information that is not, or that has 
been excluded from the pre-suspension letters that we are 
talking about.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Chair, if we refer to page 373 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 66 of 371 
 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of Eskom Bundle 19.   
PROF LOUWRENS:  You would see that there is an image 
of the pre-suspension, DM.docx and at the bottom of that 
page, the bottom left there is a black line, a vertical line 
and right next to it, it is open space, nothing there.  If you 
look at the Eskom file page 50, the document handed to 
you now. 
 
At the bottom of that page ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay, 
we 
are 
now 
comparing 
the 
10 
document with Eskom Bundle 19 page 373, and the 
document at Eskom Bundle 12, page 50.   
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  You would see at the bottom of the 
page 50 document, there is a human resources division 
and address, etcetera and if you refer to the other one that 
is absent ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is the only ...[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Difference.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Difference that I can see from the 
templates.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well, 
I 
guess 
that 
is 
one 
set 
of 
information that is not there, but of course the information, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 67 of 371 
 
the contents of the two documents the way it is structured 
does not seem to be the same.  It may well be that the 
substance is the same.  
 
Mr Seleka, I do not know if you have had a chance 
to compare them in terms of substance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair, in terms of particularly the 
rights of the Employee to be legally represented, to make 
representations, to just well the wording seems to be the 
same.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, the heading on the one at page 50 
10 
is intention to suspend an investigation into allegations of 
misconduct.  The one at page 373 the heading is indication 
to a pre-suspension meeting.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Chairperson, you will see what 
comes before this particular document is an exchange 
between 
certain 
Eskom 
officials 
and 
the 
attorneys 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The document at page 50. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The document at page 50 is a 
correspondence of emails, starting on page 43 in Eskom 
Bundle 12, where instructions are being given to Bowman 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 68 of 371 
 
Gilfillan and they have requested to be provided with the 
suspension policies and the suspension process.   
 
This is what they were provided with.  Amongst 
others ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what date is that?  It is 16 March.  I 
see at page 43 ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Email dated 16 March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the suspension process.  From Mr 
Neo Tsolanko to Jerry Kapo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that there is an email at page 44 
...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Bundle 12. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  From LC Phule to Phillip Mashego dated 
11 March 2015 at 09H27 which says: 
 
“Please urgently compile the step by step 
20 
process 
to 
follow 
when 
suspending 
an 
[indistinct]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And when you turn the page to 45 you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 69 of 371 
 
see suspension process.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And they give the process there.  Then 
on page 47 is what appears to be a template of an 
intention to effect the suspension pending an investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you have on page 48 a notice of 
suspension which is also on the face of it appears to be a 
template.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And lastly is that also what appears to 
be a template on page 50 which is an intention to suspend.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So these were exchanged within Eskom 
and then ultimately with the attorneys Bowman Gilfillan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Okay, let us continue.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Prof Louwrens, let us deal then with the 
META data.  When you did, when you performed the 
forensic assessment of the META data, and you can take 
the Chairperson to whichever relevant page you wish, 
20 
particularly in respect of the first letter and explain your 
findings in respect of your forensic investigation. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Thank you.  Chair, if we turn to page 
375.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 70 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  The suspension DM.docx and I would 
not go through all of the META data because all of them 
are not relevant to this case.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  So I will deal with what is relevant in 
my opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and the document at 373 to 
which the META data relates is a letter addressed to Dan 
Marokane, Group Executive, Group Capital.  Ja, okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct, yes.  So I have dealt 
10 
with the MD5 as previously, so that is just to verify that I 
have been working with the correct document and it was 
not changed by anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you say it is the same 
document, that is now the same document that came from 
the mail box of Xhosa dot whatever.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That and also the same document that 
Dihandre, the other forensics company evaluated.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Right.  We have dealt with the 
template and you can see that the path there, the template 
path is users and the username in this instance is Daniels 
M / documents.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 71 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just tell me where about in the, on the 
page that is? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It is ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where it says templates? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Template ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Alright.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Okay.  Then it is / users and after that 
normally the username is listed, the user that is registered 
on the computer.  In this case the name there is Daniels M 
/ documents / custom office templates / letterhead template 
10 
Jan 2015.x.   
 
Now the .ex is different than the docx.  .x means it 
is a template.  So you can use it to create your own 
documents but using that template as a framework.  What 
is also important here, if you go down to application, it is 
about one, two, three, four down.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I can see that.  
PROF 
LOUWRENS: 
 
The 
application 
is 
Microsoft 
Mackintosh Word.  That is important.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What does application mean? 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It means that the software that 
created that document, was Microsoft Mackintosh Word.  
The Word Apple computer.  It runs on an Apple computer.  
Mackintosh is Apple computer.  So ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, you will have to just speak up a 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 72 of 371 
 
little bit more so that we hear this very important part of 
your evidence and it can be recorded properly. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  So it means it was created on an 
Apple 
computer 
or 
Mackintosh 
computer 
and 
the 
application or the software that is running and created that 
document, was Microsoft Mackintosh Word.  Why this is 
important is I have looked at Ms Daniels’s email box and 
documents that I found in her email box and that was 
created by Microsoft Word and not Mackintosh Word.  
 
Okay, so there is a difference.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, that is the difference.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is consistent with the username.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes, but what it means is that the 
documents I found on Ms Daniels’s mail box.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
PROF 
LOUWRENS:  Was not created on the same 
computer as this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So her ones are not Microsoft 
Mackintosh. 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And her ones are what?  Her one is 
what? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Microsoft Word for Windows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, not Microsoft Mackintosh Word.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 73 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say from that the conclusion is 
what? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Well, I can refer that it was not 
created on the same computer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the same computer.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Alright, yes continue.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry Chair.  Prof Louwrens, just by 
way of illustration.  Of the two different computer products.  
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have an Apple computer on my right 
and here on my left is a Bell computer.  This one uses 
Microsoft Word. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the Apple computer uses? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Mackintosh Word.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mackintosh Word.  So what you are 
saying to the Chairperson is the creation of the document 
in terms of the META data or just before that.  The 
20 
software in the two are different.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Used by two different companies.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is why you are able to see that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 74 of 371 
 
Mackintosh Word you can ascribe it to an Apple computer 
as supposed to a normal computer that uses the Word 
software. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what you are saying to the 
Chairperson is according to this META date the application 
Microsoft Mackintosh Word, which shows that the letter 
would have been created by an Apple computer.  That 
would have been a different product altogether. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And what you find in, the documents 
that you find in Ms Daniels’s computer, are from MS Word 
and not an Apple computer.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You could not find any documents, is 
that what you are saying to the Chairperson in her, is it her 
computer or her mail box?   
PROF LOUWRENS:  Her mail box.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You could not find any document that is 
created on an Apple computer? 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I could not say that.  I did not do an in 
exhaustive search on that, I only looked for similar 
documents.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if I have two or more computers, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 75 of 371 
 
they could obviously be different.  One could be Microsoft, 
Mackintosh Word, another one another Word.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have to examine mail boxes in 
all of them to exclude me completely from or to exclude the 
possibility that the document was created in one of them.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes, I would ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
You 
would 
have 
to 
examine 
...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:  I would have to examine both, ja.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The mail boxes in all of them.  Okay, 
alright.  Right, so what you are able to see is if you have 
examined a mail box in relation to a particular computer, 
you are able to say if there is no relation between the 
words, then it was not created in the particular computer.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you.  Prof Louwrens, you 
may carry on in your explanation of the META data. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  The next point there of interest is that 
20 
it says: 
 
“Titles of parts.” 
 
Basically the heading which is the business unit or 
division, that is the bottom part of that document.  Just the 
title of that place holder and the company that this 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 76 of 371 
 
computer is being registered to, is Eskom.   
 
Okay.  Then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What does that mean?  That the company 
that is registered is Eskom.  Is that the company that is 
registered as the owner of the Microsoft ...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:   Of the software, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the software.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and I take it that from that you can 
safely infer or conclude and you must just tell me if that is 
10 
not justifiable.  Conclude that an Eskom computer was 
used or Eskom software was used whether it was an Eskom 
person or somebody from outside, but it was Eskom or can 
you not say that in terms of technology? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It depends how the software was 
registered, but when you register your operating system, 
the company as entity and as part of the licensing 
agreement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  So it is reasonable to assume that it 
20 
was part of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is it reasonable to infer that the 
document was created using an Eskom computer, or that is 
going too far? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  It is going too far, because this 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 77 of 371 
 
relates mostly to the template ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  And the software and so on, but the 
ja.  I think we could infer that it definitely leans towards 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  Otherwise ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because what are the chances that 
somebody ...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:  You have to register your own 
10 
computer if you are not part of Eskom as Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So we can say an Eskom computer 
was used to create it, in all probability.  Is that fair to say? 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is fair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Prof Louwrens, I see there is a 
little bit of hesitation there.  Let me ask the question this 
way.  You have said the template I mean the document 
used here as a template.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They would have used a template to 
create a letter.  Then that template is or is it not in an 
application that is owned by Eskom.  The computer 
application owned by Eskom, or I cannot make that 
...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 78 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  No, you cannot make that distinction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  What normally happens is that a 
company would create templates for use by its staff.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  And those templates would then be 
stored on the individual computers.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  For use and you could then edit those 
templates for your use.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
PROF LOUWRENS:  So it is not to say that the person that 
edited the document was part of Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see, okay.  I see what you are saying.  
So are you saying then, with my computer which is not a 
MacBook, it is not an Apple computer, I could have stored 
these templates and sent it to my junior who has a Mac 
laptop and she could then have used the template to create 
a letter and that is why the application would then reflect 
her computer application and not mine.  
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that what happened, what you 
...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Continue.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 79 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Right, then the field that is very 
important here is the creator field, and the value in that 
field was Susanne Daniels.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, where about are you on the 
document?   
PROF LOUWRENS:   Page 375, the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Near the bottom, the creator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The creator, yes okay. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So that was what was recorded as 
10 
the creator, as I said previously it could have been picked 
up by the system from the user, but that’s because I then 
edit, very easy to edit, I can change this creator to 
whoever I want. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.   So you say that part, one 
cannot rely a lot on it, on its own. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   On its own you cannot rely on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you can rely on it together with other 
information? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What if the – what if the – well with the 
information about application from that information you 
said we can say that probably the template or the letter 
that was created was created on an Eskom computer, is 
that right? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 80 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So then we can say well there is 
somebody or there was somebody called Suzanne Daniels 
at Eskom at the time, but you are saying that on its own is 
not terribly helpful because somebody who is not Suzanne 
Daniels if they want to falsely implicate Suzanne Daniels 
can easily tamper with the system to make sure that it 
reflects her as the creator, is that right? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I would imagine that somebody who 
10 
does 
that 
would 
obviously 
be 
seeking 
to 
implicate 
somebody, if I create – if I interfere with the system so as 
to make sure that the creator of the document is Professor 
Louwrens in circumstances where it is not, and I know it, I 
would be seeking to falsely implicate Professor Louwrens 
in being the creator of the document, is that right? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes I did really, if you do not 
understand how easy it is to change that field you would be 
led to believe that that person created the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, could it be changed negligently? 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have got to intentionally change it. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   You have got to intentionally change 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and when if you – if I change it I 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 81 of 371 
 
have to know what it was before I changed it, isn’t it? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No, not necessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I might not know? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It is displayed so you would know in 
any case what it was and then specifically on this field 
what you would do is you would then add another creator, 
type in your own name or somebody else’s name and then 
you would remove the original name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but is the position that if we go to the 
true creator, the one creator of the document, when he or 
10 
she creates it, it is reflected that this is the person who 
created it? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If somebody else – if it is sent, the 
document is sent to somebody or somebody else comes 
and uses this same computer they can change it, but when 
they change it they know who the creator was immediately 
what is reflected as immediately before they change it? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no way they would not know. 
20 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct, because you have to 
replace that name or that value, you cannot just delete it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So you can’t negligently just do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you have got to have the intention to 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 82 of 371 
 
change it. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   You have to add another one, then 
remove the previous one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so which therefore means that I can 
only change the original creator to effectively distort the 
position, otherwise I have no reason to change it?   Is that 
correct? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Ja, I would suppose that is the 
inference one can draw there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, because why change who 
10 
created it?   Ja, okay, alright.   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prof Louwrens so we have the 
template and then we have the creation of the letters 
themselves.  Could it be that the template would show for 
instance in this case Ms Daniels as the creator, not of the 
letter but of the template? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   If we have the template, if we have 
that computer and we could access that template then we 
could see what the creator was, so ja, I think that is 
basically the only thing that we can say. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay so you will need access to the 
template on the computer which has the template in order 
to determine who the author of the template is. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In this case this author is the author 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 83 of 371 
 
not of the template, but of the letter itself. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the creator that we are talking 
about, it is the creator of the letter. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Creator of the letter yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not necessarily of the template.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Anything else on ...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes, the next just below the creator 
on the same table, last modified by the value there is 
Salim Essa.  So again the last modified information is also 
10 
easy to change but you cannot do that directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that please.  It is easy to 
change but? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   You cannot do it directly, you can – 
he has to go to another screen to actually change that 
value, so you go to an option screen and you do a 
personalisation of that document and then you can change 
the name.  Now the name reflected in the personalisation 
options is usually the name that is connected to the user, 
so that is where it picks up who the user is, so I can then 
20 
change that user to somebody else and when I save that 
and I apply it the next time I save that document the last 
modified would then be reflected as that new user that I 
have furnished.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So what do we -  what do you make of 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 84 of 371 
 
the fact that here the information or what you found is that 
it said last modified by Salim Essa – well what do you 
make of that?   
ADV SELEKA SC:    Well firstly as with the previous 
creator you cannot rely on that solely because it can be 
changed to any value but if the user was called Salim Essa 
on a computer it would pick it up as Salim Essa, but on its 
own it is very easy change, but that is all I can say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   Now this information that was 
modified by Salim Essa that part of the information you get 
10 
by examining the letter itself, is that right? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   The metadata on that letter yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The metadata on the letter? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the metadata doesn’t tell you where 
or in what computer the modification happened? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No it doesn’t, unfortunately in this 
case we only had the word document itself to analyse. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So I don’t have that much, the only 
20 
relationship to the computer was or is the application used, 
the Microsoft Mackintosh Word. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Which then was the last application 
used to modify that document. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 85 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the modification are you able to say 
as you did with regard to application are you able to say 
whether the modification, the last modification was effected 
in the Microsoft Mackintosh Word or the other? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Microsoft Mackintosh Word. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Microsoft Mackintosh Word. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The modification took place in that, it 
was effective. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Last saved. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so does it mean that one can infer 
reasonably that the letter was probably created using an 
Eskom computer and that the last modification was also 
effected using an Eskom computer or not? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   No, I would not say that, the fact that 
the software belongs to Eskom but it could have been 
edited on another computer and could have been modified 
and sent so it does not mean necessarily an Eskom 
computer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what would you need to look at in 
20 
order to be able to be more precise on for example what 
computer was used, or is that something that you can’t – 
Eskom computer or non-Eskom computer what would you 
need to be able to reach a conclusion on that or is that 
something that’s difficult to achieve? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 86 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:  I would say the best option would be 
to have access to the computers involved or seemingly 
involved, the analysis of those computers Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Without the it is very circumstantial in 
the things that can be easily changed and forensically I 
cannot support anything more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  If you were to get the 
computer that – or computers that may be Ms Daniels’ 
whilst she was at Eskom was using having access to those 
10 
computers would that help in one way or another seeing 
that she is alleged to have been the creator here? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That would definitely help.   I can’t 
say if it will definitively give an answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but it could help. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It would help definitely yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   Okay, has that been tried Mr 
Seleka?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Obtaining her computer, I don’t know 
off hand Chairperson but I know they have imaged her hard 
20 
drive, something to that effect, even during her disciplinary 
hearing which information has been made available to the 
Commission, I will follow up with the investigators to find 
out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you need the actual computer or as 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 87 of 371 
 
long as you have ...[intervenes]  
PROF LOUWRENS:   If I have a forensic image of that 
computer that should be fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you should be able, okay, but I 
think that should be pursued. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  And then I guess the same can 
be done with in regard to Mr Khosa’s computer. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prof Louwrens would it help to find out 
from Eskom whether during this time, 2015, March 2015, 
Eskom would have provided its employees with Apple 
Computers 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes it would.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It would help? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It would definitely help yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because as you say the last 
modification was in an Apple Computer. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you have obviously the last three 
columns, it is about the dates, or the last three rows, it is 
about the date when the letter was last printed, created 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 88 of 371 
 
and modified. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the date of creation of the letter, 
date of modification, date of printing, how certain can you 
be that those are the dates you give or the dates that 
appear here are definitely the dates?  
PROF LOUWRENS:   It can only be certain to the extent 
that the computer ’s clock was set correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so assuming it was set correctly 
that should be correct, ja. 
10 
 
Well that suggests to me that in the absence of any 
evidence that it was set incorrectly that you would be able 
to say the probabilities are that the creation and the 
modification of the letter and the printing was on that day. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes we – probably that, if it is a 
corporate computer the times, the time and date settings 
are normally managed centrally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   So the user would not be able to 
change it on their own, so if this was a corporate computer 
20 
chances are that the dates are correct, if not the it can be 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so maybe you could explore 
all of those aspects because then I think you need to come 
back to say I have done this part as well and in the light of 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 89 of 371 
 
this part this is what I am able to say. 
 
Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prof Louwrens I see that the last, the 
times there’s a discrepancy of some interest there in 
respect of the creation date and modification date and 
time.  The dates are the same, the 10 t h of March 2015, but 
I see the dates for creation and modification, I mean the 
times, I beg our pardon, are identical, 16:39, 16:39. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the last print time is 16:25. 
10 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is before 16:39. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Before it was created. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Before it was created yes.  What do 
you say to that? 
PROF LOUWRENS:    Ja, that’s an anomaly that is within 
the Windows file system.   If you copy a file across from 
one volume to another, in other words from one drive to 
another it assumes the creation date of that time that you 
copied the file, so the file then would have existed and at 
20 
this stage been available to print, but then the file was 
copied across to another drive and then it assumed the 
new creation date, and that explains it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you say it is an anomaly? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 90 of 371 
 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It is an anomaly, it’s a peculiarity, I 
don’t know how to explain that, it is not something that you 
would expect, you would expect that the creation date 
would stay the same, but it does not work that way with 
Microsoft Windows. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So there is nothing strange about that?   
PROF LOUWRENS:   Nothing strange here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think Mr Seleka we should stop 
here, because obviously there is a need for Mr Louwrens to 
come back. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we can do the rest when he comes 
back, so then let us stop here.   How long do you think it 
might take you to be ready to come back after doing the 
outstanding ...[indistinct]. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   It is difficult to say Chair but if I have 
got access to information a couple of weeks maybe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe two weeks, or maybe more 
20 
than that? 
PROF LOUWRENS:    Maybe more than that, because it 
takes time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is alright, okay let us say 
as soon as you are ready let Mr Seleka know and he will 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 91 of 371 
 
tell me and the I guess you will have prepare an affidavit I 
think and the we can call you, yes. 
PROF LOUWRENS:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, but thank you very much, I 
will excuse you but you will be coming back, thank you 
very much. 
PROF LOUWRENS:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am going to adjourn to enable the 
PRASA work stream to come in and then I will continue 
with them.    
10 
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may be seated Mr Montana.  Good 
morning. 
ADV SONI SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I am very poor with estimating time 
so I am sorry that I thought we would finish within an hour 
and we ended up taking so long.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I apologise for that.  Let us continue.  
Yesterday’s oath will continue apply today Mr Montana.  
Okay alright. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chair.  Mr Montana I now 
want to deal with the allegations made by Ms Martha Ngoye 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 92 of 371 
 
in her affidavit of 17t h of February 2020 that affidavit 
appears in Bundle E1 as Exhibit SS7(b) and it starts at page 
277. 
MR MONTANA:  Through you Chair I am sorry Mr Soni I – I 
just decided to put one matter on record emanating from 
yesterday Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  I think – I think that we dealt with the issues 
of the companies and I kept on referring to one company as 
Mashonesa that Mr Molefe referred to as Mashonesa.  The 
10 
name of the company is Mazwe Financial Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  So I wanted to put that on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  And secondly Chair that I want to put on 
record there was a report that there was placed before me I 
think the report was written by Mr Jabulela Majola.  And 
Chair I – I did raise a concern with one of his conclusions.  
At that time I did not know and on enquiry I find that those – 
this was a – in fact a junior chap who wrote that report.  In 
20 
fact some of the people had indicated that the chap is not 
even capable of writing such a report.  Now it was placed 
before 
me 
yesterday 
Chair 
so 
I 
wanted 
to 
ask 
the 
commission to – of course concern the position of this chap 
with PRASA number 1 and confirm whether that is their 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 93 of 371 
 
report because if it is Chair I may want to – I am considering 
exercising my rights in terms of Rule 3.4 to apply for cross-
examination for – of the – of I think Mr Majola.  I do not know 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  But I think that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  From what I could gather people said look 
there is just no way he would have written this report and so 
I want to confirm that formally and exercise. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  And exercise my right Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Sorry Mr Soni I just wanted to do this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I do not know how much you know 
about the author of that report Mr Soni but if you do not then 
the information can be obtained. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what his position is – is he still 
at PRASA, what was his position at the time of writing the 
20 
report and any other relevant information about him.  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  We will make this inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I guess another issue would be why 
would he have been identified as the person to conduct the 
investigation or to do the reports – is that because of the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 94 of 371 
 
position he held or why was it? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that information can then be shared 
with Mr Montana.  And it may well be that because it is just a 
report it may well be that consideration should be given to 
whether he should not be required to depose to an affidavit 
and say whether that is his report and say how it came about 
that he – he did that report of the investigation bla, bla, bla.  
Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  As you please Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Of course we with all of that in 
mind Mr Soni there would also be the question of what the 
place and role of that report is in our – in these proceedings. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether it was just – it was attached 
simply because somebody who was deposing to an affidavit 
had to mention that there was some reports that was put 
together and this is the report. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether it is going to – to be relied 
20 
upon much or 00:06:24 on these proceedings.  
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know when people do an affidavit they 
can attach a lot of things and everything they attach is 
important for a particular proceedings. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 95 of 371 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you could reflect on that.. 
ADV SONI SC:  I will Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Montana can we then go on with Ms 
Ngoye’s allegations.  I want to start at paragraph 8 which is 
on page 279.  The page numbers are on the right hand side 
in red.  She says: 
“I have been asked by the commission to 
provide information on maladministration at 
10 
PRASA of which I am aware insofar as it 
relates to state capture.” 
And then in paragraph 9 she says: 
“In dealing with these matters I consider it 
will be helpful to begin with the following 
observation. 
In 
my 
respectful 
view 
maladministration 
and 
possibly 
corruption 
are quite widespread at PRASA.  This was 
particularly while Mr Montana was the CEO.” 
You want to react to that? 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I – I totally reject that I think in effect 
she con – she starts with that view from paragraph 6 of her 
affidavit – of her affidavit.  I reject that Chair I think in my 
testimony I will show in fact that Ms Ngoye was herself at 
the heart of some of the issues that have been made here. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 96 of 371 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And then she says – she finishes 
paragraph 9 saying? 
“That there is certain entities which and 
persons who were known to be close to you.” 
And at paragraph 10 she says: 
“Among those are two individuals Mr Roy 
Moodley and Mr McKenza Mabunda.” 
Like to react to that? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I dealt with these matters yesterday 
that entities were identified linked to me and those that – 
10 
they were doing work for them were even appointed 
irregularly.   They were being championed.  So – so again 
Chair I will be consistent with that – with that view. 
ADV SONI SC:  I am – she says: 
“The entities with which Mr Moodley were – 
was alleged to be associated are Siyagena 
Technologies, 
Strawberry 
Worx, 
Royal 
Security and Prodigy can we accept that Mr 
Moodley was associated with those four 
entities.” 
20 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair I do not want – I know that with – 
with Royal Security yes he was but when I was still at 
PRASA there was no relationship – I do not know of any 
relationship of Mr Moodley with Strawberry Worx.   
I do not know of any relationship and I think I will 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 97 of 371 
 
deal with Strawberry Worx in much greater detail Chair.  And 
I read after I have left PRASA that there was a close 
relationship between Siyangena and Mr Moodley that did not 
happen when I was there.  I was not aware of it at that point 
in time.   
We dealt with Mr Mabunda’s Siyaya and I think I 
explained that in great detail about our relationship with the 
Germans Chair and its involved – and this involved them with 
that.  They do not make them my – entities closer to Mr 
Montana they were appointed by PRASA and its board. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  And of course Prodigy we dealt with 
yesterday. 
MR MONTANA:  Yesterday indeed Chair indeed. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Can we look at paragraph 11 she 
says: 
“These are individuals and entities which 
have 
benefited 
most 
handsomely 
from 
contracts that were dubiously awarded to 
them or implemented in a highly dubious 
manner.” 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Chair the most – one of the companies that 
benefited handsomely from PRASA was Werksmans 00:10:48 
and Ms Ngoye dispose – deposed to an affidavit when she 
was aware of the facts.  So you can see Chair this is the 
same kind of – of things so if you look at again Mr – Mr Soni 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 98 of 371 
 
to go back to paragraph 6 of her – of her affidavit.  If you 
read what she say in there consistent with what Mr Molefe 
said consistent with what Mr Dingiswayo says that these are 
people who – who project themselves that is so clean who 
want to point fingers at other people but four fingers in fact 
pointing at them Chair.   
It is so false and I think Chair that that we have to 
deal with the individual contracts still I think yesterday was – 
we dealt with Prodigy so this broad 00:11:44 is not going to 
help the commission to actually get to the facts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  I mean just (talking over one another) facts 
rather than the broad branch ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no we will deal with it.  Ja we will 
deal with them ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  And then she says: 
“Most of these contracts are the subject of 
litigation.” 
Can I just mention those that have come before the 
commission? 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Of course. 
ADV SONI SC:  And have been dealt with or will be dealt 
with.  One is Swifambo we know.  The other is Siyagena 
which we are going to deal with when we deal with the rest 
of Ms Ngoye’s affidavit.  Then there is Prodigy which Mr 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 99 of 371 
 
Dingiswayo dealt with and this – the Siyaya matters which as 
we know it was in your absence that there is litigation 
between them and – between PRASA and them.  And I can 
perhaps just deal with one matter.  You are aware that 
PRASA has refused to pay Siyaya DB and you in fact 
testified at the liquidation hearings Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright can I then ask us to go to paragraph 
14 there is that she is going to deal with the following 
matters oh she became – this is Ms Ngoye how she became 
10 
aware 
of 
the 
influence 
of 
Mr 
Roy 
Moodley 
and 
her 
interactions with you as CEO and the dispute between 
Strawberry Worx and Siyaya Group.  We are not going to 
deal with the Siyaya Group here for different reasons.  But 
these are the matters we will deal with. 
MR MONTANA:  Well Chair I would like the Chair to note the 
fact that in almost exactly the same formulation is what you 
find in Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit.  So you could see Mr 
Molefe says – traverse the same route.  So it is very 
interesting Chair but again I think it is the focus on facts will 
20 
help us to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  To deal with the matters properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Now she says in paragraph 15 which I 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 100 of 371 
 
am going to deal with in some detail when I say detail I just 
want us to establish the extent to which you dispute what 
she says.  She says she first encountered Strawberry Worx 
whilst she was the CEO of Intersite.  She was in fact the 
CEO of Intersite. 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct, that is correct Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  And she says: 
“It came about as follows.  First on about the 
23rd of July 2011 PRASA through Intersite 
assets investment SOC Limited which is a 
10 
wholly 
owned 
subsidiary 
of 
PRASA 
and 
Umjanji 
Media 
concluded 
an 
advertising 
agreement 
following 
an 
invitation 
for 
companies to submit proposals for media 
broadcasting advertising and broadcasting 
services in respect of various assets held by 
PRASA.” 
Do you accept that as a general? 
MR MONTANA:  Yes Sir. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then she says: 
20 
“The agreement had commenced on the 1s t of 
June and was for a five year period unless 
terminated or renewed by the parties.” 
Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:  That is correct Chair. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 101 of 371 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Then she says: 
“But on the 31s t of August 2011 and I am just 
going to point out it is not in her affidavit it is 
about five weeks after the contract was 
concluded and with the consent of PRASA 
Umjanji ceded portions of its rights under the 
advertising agreement Strawberry Worx.” 
And another entity called Siyathembana – Siyathembana 
Trading are you aware of that? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I was aware with them ceding to 
10 
Strawberry Worx but I was not aware I am hearing about 
Siyathembana Trading for the first time. 
ADV SONI SC:  But can we accept that that may have 
happened? 
MR MONTANA:  It may be – it may be Chair but I was not 
aware. 
ADV SONI SC:  No I understand thank you.  Then at 
paragraph 15.3 she says? 
“Although Intersite and not PRASA was the 
party to the agreement during the contract 
20 
period we at Intersite received instructions 
from Montana -  Mr Montana on how to deal 
with 
the 
advertising 
portfolio 
more 
specifically the Strawberry Worx contract.” 
But she is making two points there.  Firstly she says that the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 102 of 371 
 
contract was between Umjanji and thereafter Strawberry 
Worx and Intersite.  That I understand is correct.   
MR MONTANA:  It was between the main contract was 
between PRASA and Umjanji. 
ADV SONI SC:  Umjanji and that that was ceded to 
Strawberry Worx. 
MR MONTANA:  No, no part – part of that contract. 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh sorry part of it. 
MR MONTANA:  Part of that the outdoor advertising part of 
that contract is what was – was ceded to Strawberry Worx. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes.  Now she says that they received 
instructions from you how to deal with the advertising 
portfolio and particularly Strawberry Worx. 
MR MONTANA:  Well Chair it was not – I never gave such an 
instruction.  There was a – there was a – there was a draft 
that was submitted to me on how the relationship between 
Umjanji and Strawberry was going to be structured on our 
portfolio.   
So I had written notes to say no, no it cannot be dealt 
with in that way because we will lose money as PRASA. And 
20 
chair I want to make it clear I think that after I present I want 
to make a more detailed response to what Ms Ngoye say 
because the – the facts are being somehow too 00:18:33 a 
bit to present a particular picture.   
But – but I think let us distinguish the facts first and 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 103 of 371 
 
then before I make my comments. 
ADV SONI SC:  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess – I guess you will have a 
better feel Mr Soni whether it is better that he should deal 
with that now or whether a little later.  He – he is saying at 
some stage he would like to give a more substantive 
response. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is more convenient for him to do that 
later he will do that later but I am just saying be aware that 
10 
he … 
ADV SONI SC:  No I understand perfectly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chair it may be – it may be better to follow 
the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  Know the extent to which Mr Montana agrees 
with what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  The disputes what Ms Ngoye is saying. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then in regard to any inferences or any 
allegations that Ms Ngoye makes about improprieties we can 
deal with that at the end of what it has been agreed are the 
basic facts on which there is common cause. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 104 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – so where would that put us at 
the end when we are done with the affidavit or at some 
stage? 
ADV SONI SC:  It will be at the end of paragraph 15 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright that is fine.  You may 
proceed. 
ADV SONI SC:  She says there at paragraph 15.4 she was 
once summoned to a meeting with representatives of 
Strawberry Worx.  Now I take it and she is not making 
allegations about you on this.  Are you aware of this 
10 
meeting? 
MR MONTANA:   No Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay.  But she goes on in paragraph 15.4. 
“I was given instructions by representatives 
of Strawberry Worx on how I ought to 
manage the advertising portfolio and how I 
was 
expected 
to 
take 
instructions 
from 
them.” 
Are you aware of that? 
MR MONTANA:  No I was not part of the meeting Chair. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:   
“I was even – I was even told that they have 
the power to remove the portfolio from 
Intersite.” 
I take it that too you do not know about?  Is that correct Mr – 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 105 of 371 
 
you – are… 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I was not part of the meeting. 
ADV SONI SC:  YEs. 
MR MONTANA:  Just looking at it I can see that this is – you 
know afterthought?  Ja it makes people draft things that – 
but I was not part of the meeting so for the record I would 
not confirm or deny. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  I was not part of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think Mr Soni you can go on with 
10 
the paragraphs that he – where – that relate to what was 
discussed at the meeting but he does not know anything 
about it. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no I understand.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you – he can… 
ADV SONI SC:  It is a necessary because it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  It has a consequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  And I can understand why Mr Montana is 
20 
saying this is a malthought[?] because there is a thread that 
is followed through thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  Then at paragraph 15.5 she says: 
“That 
she 
was 
told 
that 
there 
were 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 106 of 371 
 
instructions from Mr Montana to remove 
instructions 
we 
had 
given 
to 
our 
legal 
representatives 
Hogan 
Lovells 
who 
were 
representing PRASA in a litigation instituted 
by 
Primedia 
challenging 
the 
advertising 
tender process.” 
Now I just want to deal with two things Mr Montana.  Did you 
give instructions – oh did you say to Strawberry Worx that 
you were going to remove Hogan Lovells as PRASA’s 
attorney’s of record in the dispute with Primedia. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  Chair – Chair that – that is not correct but I 
think she is saying it as – she says is still part is at the 
meeting? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Which I was never party to. So I do not 
know who said that to her specifically. She does not mention 
she just mentioned that – she was told by a representative.  
She mentioned three representatives Mr Maraj, Mr Ashvier, 
Mr Selwyn Moodley those are the three people who were part 
of the meeting. She does not say so this person said this she 
20 
says representatives so it is a general I do not even know 
but I never – probably at this time because she is describing 
the earlier period of the contract.  I had not interacted with 
any of these players in the industry 
ADV SONI SC:  I – I hear you Mr Montana but I just want us 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 107 of 371 
 
to if you just bear with me for a moment or two to deal with 
another allegation and then come to the extent to which she 
says she communicated with you  So let us deal – I 
understand you say you did not know about this, you were 
not part of the meeting. Then she says … 
MR MONTANA:  Sorry Mr Soni I accept that except that the – 
I am not saying communicated with her I am saying com – I 
have never communicated with Strawberry at the time that 
she is describing. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, no, no I understand ja.  She says: 
10 
“I was told that Mr Montana had instructed 
that I terminate the 
mandate of 
Hogan 
Lovells and appoint BBM Attorneys.” 
I take it you had never told anybody from Strawberry Worx 
that that should be done. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I had the legal advisor who was 
dealing with this particular matter other than the – our Group 
Corporate Function in my office.  I had the legal advisor who 
conceded quite a number of things and this was one of the 
issues precisely because there was a major litigation issue 
20 
on this matter.  And – and probably I would discussed with – 
but I can see that my legal advisor was not even part of the 
meeting that was mentioned.  So the question still arises 
who said all of those things to Ms  Ngoye and that is why I 
say I do not know, I was not part of the meeting but for me it 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 108 of 371 
 
sounds like a good afterthought Chair for the – in her 
affidavit. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Now I just want to make this one 
point.  She says that whether you said it or not BBM 
Attorneys were not on PRASA’s panel of attorneys at the 
time.  Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I would not know. 
ADV SONI SC:  You would not know. 
MR MONTANA:  I would not know.   In the same way that the 
– I also learnt that Werksmans were part of the PRASA panel 
10 
and when I checked at the time they were not so again here 
someone who – who picks up on this one and ignores on to 
this one.  So Chair I do not deal with panels – I do not even 
– in my entire period I never knew who was on the panel or 
was not. 
ADV SONI SC:  And she says at paragraph 15.6. 
“I did indicate to Mr Montana that the move 
would amount to wasteful expenditure and 
that I was not willing to account for that and 
further that it was not possible to appoint a 
20 
firm that was not on the panel.” 
Now is that correct or not? 
MR MONTANA:  No Mr Soni.  You know Chair I did Bantu 
Education as well but sometimes the style of writing 
becomes very important so that you follow a sequence.  This 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 109 of 371 
 
person is told by someone at a meeting but in paragraph 
15/16 it say he indicate to Mr Montana who was never party 
– party to this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I notice that Mr Montana that we 
were – we were – she was telling us in a few paragraphs 
about the discussion at the meeting and she did not include 
you as one of the people who were in that meeting and as 
you pointed out she did not say who among the people who 
were at the meeting told her that you had instructed that she 
should terminate the mandate of Hogan Lovells and appoint 
10 
BBM Attorneys and then in the next paragraph 15.6 she says 
– she did indicate to you that the move would amount to 
wasteful expenditure but she does not say when in relation 
to the meeting but in the – in the paragraph that comes after 
that she is talking about what happened after the meeting.  
So I do not know whether it is just a question of the 
arrangement of paragraphs or whether it is something else. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I think if you look at the – the 
previous paragraph there they underlying message is that 
the firm was appointed outside of the panel.  I think the 
20 
question will come who appoint people to the panel, how 
they 00:28:45. In all of that.   
I was not – I mean that is why I was checking my 
legal advisor if she was part of the meeting I would have 
said maybe she reflected discussion she had with me but she 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 110 of 371 
 
was also not party to the meeting.   
And I would not say what the other people said at the 
meeting specific she also does not also specify who said and 
unless if the commission is provided with perhaps a record 
of that meeting an actual record you know of that meeting so 
that we can – you should know. So there are three people 
and it’s her, it is Mr Holele who was Mr Holele’s what was his 
role in the meeting?  You know all of those things Chair that 
I think that raised a lot of questions and answers as it were 
but Chair there was never even subsequent to whatever 
10 
meetings that were held any discussion about wasteful 
expenditure that is not consistent with my own narrative 
which I will present after Mr Soni had dealt with paragraph 
15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright.  Mr Montana can we just now – I just 
want to put a question directly to you. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Did she speak to you about there was a 
suggestion that Hogan Lovells be removed as PRASA’s 
20 
attorneys of record. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   I think my legal advisor had later – at a 
later stage did, when we were dealing with the – what is it 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 111 of 371 
 
called – Primedia’s review application. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  When you say the only - 
advisor did.  You mean did talk to you?  Did talk to her, 
Ms Ngoye? 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair.  Did talk to me, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About? 
MR MONTANA:   About the - our team in respect of the 
litigation that we were ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...involved with Primedia.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And I think that is a separate matter to 
this Chair.  And that is why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MONTANA:   I think ...[indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I ...[indistinct] issues are being – because 
somebody is in the organisation.  She is aware of what is 
happening but she structures this thing in a way that 
supports – so that is why it does not speak to each other.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   And I will deal with the issue Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...when I ...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 112 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  But I think what you are 
saying is that there was a time when – in connection with 
the litigation relating to Primedia when your legal advisor 
in 
your 
office 
spoke 
about 
changing 
the 
law 
firm 
representatives. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is what you are saying.  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Well, not only spoke about it but a 
10 
decision was actually made and implemented to remove 
Hogan Lovells as PRASA’s attorneys of record.  Is that 
correct? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think so.  I did not know who was 
ultimately our team there but I think that that decision was 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was made. 
MR MONTANA:   ...was taken and it enjoyed my full 
support Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   And I will explain why. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   She says then at the end of 
paragraph 15.6...  Oh, sorry.  Your legal advisor is 
Ms Malani(?) Naidoo.  Is that correct? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 113 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now Mr Montana, just – and you must 
accept that we tried to keep in our minds all the goings-on.  
When you made application to the Secretary of the 
Commission to bring a delegation, one of the people whose 
names you mentioned in the letter to the Secretary was 
Ms Malani Naidoo.   
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now it is also said that the last group 
of attorneys who handled the matter for PRASA when 
10 
Maharaj(?) Attorneys.  Are you aware of that/ 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  I am not aware. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Because she says then that 
they 
coincidentally 
were 
the 
attorneys 
of 
record 
of 
Strawberry Worx.   
MR MONTANA:   Attorneys of record for – on which matter? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In the Primedia matter. 
MR MONTANA:   Is it? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I am not aware of that. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  Can I just ask you as a 
general proposition though?  And I accept that it would be 
improper for PRASA where this is a dispute raised by 
Primedia against PRASA and perhaps Strawberry Worx to 
have the same attorney as Strawberry Worx. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 114 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  It would be improper.  
Unless if the parties ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, I understand. 
MR MONTANA:   ...agree and there is no conflict of 
interest there but generally you want to separate these 
things. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.   
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Paragraph 15.7, she says: 
“After 
the 
meeting, 
Intersite 
continued 
to 
10 
manage the portfolio but under very difficult 
circumstances 
as 
threats 
were 
constantly 
received about the mandate being removed 
from Intersite...” 
 
Now, of course, that is not a matter that 
concerns you.  I mean, she is not making an allegation that 
the threats came from you.  She says the threats came 
from Strawberry Worx.   
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think the – in the – you see, she 
makes that point and then she says:  But we told 
20 
Mr Montana that he was required to provide a resolution 
from the board.  No such resolution was provided to 
Intersite.  I do not know where this discussion took place, 
Chair.  And what I think is happening here, Chair, is that 
Ms Ngoye maybe – because she was a member of the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 115 of 371 
 
Executive.  She may be aware of a matter taking place 
there.  So she conveniently brought these things.   
 
So for example, when she talks about the issue 
of the panel or when we had the discussion about 
Primedia, she then conflates that to support the view that 
she wants to advance.  So I want to – for us to separate(?) 
those issues.  If we deal with Strawberry, we deal with 
Strawberry.  If we deal with Primedia, we do so, so that, 
Chair, we can separate fact from fiction because I think 
that is what is happening here.   
10 
 
So orphans are put in there and here is a hero, a 
heroin.  I told Mr Montana.  When the meeting takes place, 
I am not part of it.  I told Mr Montana.  And I think, Chair, 
the only matter that she discussed with me, by the way, 
was when Ms Hope Zinde, the late – Hope Zinde, so rest in 
peace, had gone to her office because they took some files 
from there and she said that was done properly by the 
two(?) respective people. 
 
And she raised that with me.  She wanted to 
enquire where was the – they were sent by me.  I said no 
20 
and shall explain.  Again, this matter does not relate to this 
context.  It is a completely different context.  And I 
supported her because I said that it cannot be done that 
way.   
 
So again, Chair, it is said because we are going 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 116 of 371 
 
to discuss the matter.  Ms Zinde is late.  She cannot even 
depose and I would not want to discuss that matter of 
someone who is no longer no there and able to defend 
herself.  Not that I was going to speak ill of her.   
 
No, that is not what I am saying but I think that 
Ms Ngoye’s is scratching at straws, trying to mix issues 
and I want to separate them so that this Commission has a 
clear picture.  I mean, yes, she tried to chase Mr Moodley 
but I think she is doing it in a wrong way, Chair.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Let us just look at the part 
10 
you have dealt with in paragraph 15.7, the second 
sentence.  She says she told you that you were first 
required to provide a resolution of the board but there was 
no resolution that was provided.  Now I am going ask you a 
direct question on this.  Did she raise the issue of the 
threatened removal of the oversight of the contract from 
Intersite to PRASA with you? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  Again, Chair.  Perhaps 
maybe let me see this paragraph 15, it is long and some of 
the issues that I need to deal with.  I think I want to 
20 
address them in that context.  Chair, there was no such a 
threat.  I think that Ms Ngoye is confusing the issue of us 
getting a new division which is called PRASA Operate Real 
Estate Solutions.  In short called PRASA Cres(?).  Now this 
is a new division that handles our properties.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 117 of 371 
 
 
So because Intersite, historically, was what we 
call Intersite Property Management Services.  It changed 
its role.  So that it became Intersite Asset Investment.  And 
the new company that we created was then because it was 
then going to manage the property portfolio with everything 
that goes with it including advertising on those properties.   
 
Chair, the reason why we took that decision had 
to do with the – it was a tax efficiency issue because what 
happened is that PRASA would pay Intersite a management 
fee that because Intersite was a subsidiary it was paying 
10 
tax when its parent company was not paying tax.  So we 
pay them R 15 million to manage our properties and it paid 
almost 18% to 20% of that money back to SARS. 
 
So we get a subsidy from government and we 
pass the R 50 million, R 100 million whatever amount in 
the form of a management fee and it goes back to 
government in the form of a tax.  So we wanted to ensure 
that we maximise our revenues, our income.  So that is 
why I am saying Ms Ngoye is confusing all these issues 
into one to say:  No, no these things were happening, not 
20 
because of the strategy of the business but to support 
Strawberry Worx.   
 
In fact, Chair, the facts will show evidence that I 
will put before this Commission which is part of my thing.  
The notion that we managed the portfolio under very 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 118 of 371 
 
difficult circumstances is actually so false that Ms Ngoye 
worked with Strawberry.  The agreement to see this 
contract from Strawberry from ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Umjanji  
MR MONTANA:   ...Umjanji or Provantage, the entity that 
won the contract, it was signed by Ms Ngoye.  So she says 
there in one of the – in the closing paragraph – I wanted to 
go back to paragraph 15 point – I think it was 15.2.  The 
conclusion of that paragraph says: 
“At that time, I was already the CEO of 
10 
Intersite...” 
 
You see, Chair, here – that is where you find the 
solace(?).  It does not say at the – I signed this agreement 
to see it.  Sign between her and Strawberry as CEO of 
Intersite.  She says at the time I was already the CEO of 
Intersite.  Now the Chair, of course, you look at that, it 
does not tell you the story, the truth.  Part of my annexures 
I provide where she signed.   
 
Then I have got, Chair, is volumes of emails 
which shows, for example, the nature of the – and between 
20 
Intersite under Ms Ngoye’s, okay?  And more specifically 
her right-hand person who was managing this at Intersite 
was a chap by the name of mister – his surname is 
Chauke.  Mr Chauke – when is that? 
 
The emails that exchange, Chair, is one where 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 119 of 371 
 
our subsidiary was actually working and forging this 
relationship because they had to do that.  Now she comes 
five years later.  The country has got Commission on state 
capture, corruption.  She changes tune.  She does not 
remember the facts.  It is part of my annexures, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, Mr Montana.  And I do not 
want to.  You might remember, I think on Friday, what we 
agreed on is when you have a version which maybe 
contained in your affidavit, you will set it out here so we do 
not have to be looking in different places.  So I am going to 
10 
suggest, Chairperson, that Mr Montana refers or sets out 
his version on these matters here as agreed on Friday 
otherwise we are going to be all over the place.  I do not 
want to stop him.  I am just saying that we are going to be 
back and forth on the same question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure that I follow.  What I do 
remember is that on Friday one of the things I said was 
that he could tell me what is in his affidavit without 
referring to the paragraphs. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell me ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what I will later find in the affidavit 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 120 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when his affidavit is sorted out.  I am 
not sure whether that is what you are talking about. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is exactly what I am saying, 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That instead of now saying:  It is 
contained in my affidavit but not saying what was said in 
the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I have got no – in fact, I want to hear 
10 
what Mr Montana’s version is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So we all have it.  We know what 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the reason he may be doing that - 
but he is here, he can say - maybe is that, you remember 
in regard the issues under 15 ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the arrangements that has been made 
is that when you are done with para 15, he then get a 
20 
chance to give a substantive response to what Ms Ngoye 
has said under para 15.  I take it that is why he has not 
gone into details because that is the arrangement. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 121 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   And that is why I even said, it seems 
paragraph 15 is very long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Because I realise that Mr Soni was then – 
he wanted the answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I want to – and I think perhaps it is 
better, Chair, I suggest I make that input now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And so then when Mr Soni then takes me 
10 
on, takes these issues in the paragraphs, he is fully aware 
of what my view is on this particular matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You suggesting an amendment of the 
earlier arrangement? 
MR MONTANA:   Of the arrangement.  If I do it now 
...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I have got no difficulty with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that fine? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  That is fine. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, thank you very much.  I think this 
matter is dealt with, of course, in detail in my affidavit and 
I think it was done so Chair as a direct response to 
Rule 3.3. 
 
You 
said 
the 
time 
I 
suggested 
to 
the 
Commission, I am going to deal – I am going to do only 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 122 of 371 
 
buts ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But I will specifically indicate where I am 
dealing with a response to a particular allegation. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, PRASA did issue a tender on 
advertising.  I think it was in February 2010.  This tender 
would 
then 
later 
awarded 
to 
a 
company 
called 
Provantage/Umjanji Consortium.  If you look at the – one of 
the issues the Public Protector mentioned, Chair, is that 
10 
you have this Provantage which put a bid and it does not – 
the Public Protector – we do not understand Umjanji as a 
consortium, comes in there.  So I think that is a context 
that the matter is raised in the Public Protector report.   
 
Chair, 
the 
- 
what 
has 
happened 
is 
that 
Provantage – I think that there were 19 companies that 
then responded to the PRASA tender.  PRASA then had a 
team that evaluated this and the head of that team, Chair, 
was none other Mr Tiro Holele.  So Mr Tiro Holele led the 
team, and then they selected Provantage/Umjanji Media as 
20 
a company to all of that.   
 
This company – this tender, Chair, was for – was 
mainly not only about advertising but it was for media and 
broadcasting services.  It was advertising, media and 
media advertising and media as well as broadcasting.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 123 of 371 
 
They were all in one – under one tender. 
 
Now what happened Chair.  Strawberry, I think it 
was one of the companies that put a bid, it lost.  There is a 
passage.  It lost Chair.  It had nothing to do with Roy 
Moodley.  They lost the bid but what happened is that big 
as they do, they then agreed to themselves – among 
themselves, rather, my strength is on this, your strength is 
on that.  Let us work together. 
 
So after we had signed, PRASA had signed the 
contract with Provantage.  Provantage came back to 
10 
PRASA.  Provantage/Umjanji came to PRASA and say:  We 
want to see it.  Part of the work was to want to bring a 
company that will help us manage – because they have 
won the tender – the right on broadcasting, advertising and 
media, they have won – they got that right.  They were 
awarded ...[indistinct]. 
 
So they say:  No, we want to bring Strawberry.  
So that matter is elevated because when they want to bring 
a company in terms of – or to see part of a contract or 
subcontract, our SCM policy provides that they must then 
20 
formally apply to PRASA so that PRASA can satisfy itself 
that this company has the capacity to meet the obligations 
that are there.  So Chair, it was done, they applied.   
 
Then the agreement, the draft agreement was 
presented to us that what Strawberry would do, we will 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 124 of 371 
 
then make – we will work on the portfolio, pay Provantage 
and pay them – Provantage to pay to PRASA.  I said:  No, 
but if you love that model it means, therefore, that 
Provantage/Umjanji will take a cut before passing on the 
money. 
 
If they want to sit, then they must agree that 
Intersite was in a direct relationship so that you do not 
have a middleman in that process.  So when she says she 
spoke to me, Chair, it was not me actively going as the 
CEO.  I am approached to say:  Here is an arrangement 
10 
and as a CEO acts in the best – she says in her affidavit – 
we must act in the best interest of the company. 
 
There is one instance where I act in the best 
interest 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
revenue 
for 
outdoor 
advertising does not go anywhere else but goes to PRASA.  
Then I say:  No, that is how she structured the contract.  
So I think the Commission, Chair, should of course go to 
Provantage and ask them questions rather than relying on 
the affidavit of one conflicted individual who signed and 
who 
want 
today 
to 
dissociate 
herself. 
 
And 
ask 
20 
Provantage/Umjanji under what circumstances did you guys 
enter this agreement?  Who initiated it?  And all of those 
things, Chair. 
 
There are many letters.  They are part of my 
annexures but I think that we had agreed that she put 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 125 of 371 
 
those things now.  Now Chair, so that is the one part of it.  
Provantage wins the tender and then later on to decided to 
sit.  It selects amongst the 19 people that the 18 other 
companies, Chair, and the names, I have got all of them.  
Outdoor network.  I do not want to go into detail about this 
company. 
 
Who, Chair, that will recommend that this thing 
should be managed?  It is none other than Tiro Holele who 
recommended that:  No, we have gone through that.  We 
have selected this company.  Mr Holele was also here, 
10 
Chair, and he did not remember this thing.  He spoke about 
other 
things 
but 
this 
fact, 
she 
does 
not 
tell 
the 
Commission, Chair. 
 
In 
the 
same 
way 
that 
they 
withheld 
such 
information on the Swifambo matter.  Now Chair, why then 
did you go out on tender?  And I know later on when we 
discuss judgment...  A month ago or few weeks ago there 
was a judgment on this decision on the ...[indistinct] 
 
Primedia succeeded, Chair, even though this 
things comes nine years later.  The contract had expired.  
20 
So that judgment is of academic – it is academic in the 
sense that it does not have an impact because I think that 
time has passed, the contract has expired, PRASA is 
dealing with the matter and they never got it done.   
 
The big issue, Chair, is that and I elaborate on 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 126 of 371 
 
this.  What is the issue?  And why will we be fighting over 
who represents us on this matter?  And my legal advisor 
was...?  Because you calculated the numbers, Chair.  And 
the numbers were very clear.  Primedia, Continental were 
the 
two 
leading 
companies, 
Chair, 
onto 
the 
PRASA 
network. 
 
They were making more money than PRASA 
itself, Chair.  So as a CEO of PRASA I am required and I 
never accused Ms Ngoye that you are acting in the interest 
of those...  But we are already seeing instances of 
10 
collusion, Chair.  And one of the major issues was in the 
recent judgment on this Primedia issue. 
 
I think that the court noted the fact that PRASA 
did not oppose.  And why did it take nine years, Chair?  
You know why?  Because it took many years precisely 
because the review application is on the table, the 
beneficiaries, the people who had occupied PRASA’s sites, 
continue to make more money on the sites than PRASA 
itself.  So here I have got an instance of a state-owned 
enterprise that is being robbed of much needed revenue. 
20 
 
I come as you, I say:  No, these guys have been 
here for long.  Issue a tender and let us get the benefit for 
that.  If you look at the numbers Chair you will be shocked 
because 
both 
Primedia 
and 
Continental 
– 
Primedia 
occupied 29% of the sites that PRASA had.  Continental 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 127 of 371 
 
was the second biggest one, Chair.  But if you look at the 
amount they were paying – the smallest companies were 
paying the highest amount, okay? 
 
So they were paying us – some of the companies 
were paying us over a thousand per site.  Continental and 
Primedia were paying us even two hundred per site.  Yet 
they own the property.  There was no way as CEO I would 
allow that situation to persist and that is why we saw for 
example 
that 
our 
own 
people 
colluding 
with 
these 
companies that has made in PRASA’s things. 
10 
 
And that is why our – when you look at some of 
the companies that were there and you look at the role of 
my legal advisor, it is things like this because she is not 
performing the function.  She is not managing cases for 
PRASA.  I choose a CEO.  Here is the direction that you 
take.   
 
Now these people, Chair, will not come and 
testify that they go and talk about Strawberry, okay?  And 
when we look at the arrangement we had with Strawberry, 
it was giving us more money than even the companies per 
20 
site, Chair, when you look at each site, okay? 
 
But if PRASA goes to court and say:  We are not 
going to oppose the Primedia’s thing because they are 
fighting.  It was awarded under Montana’s terms.  Who 
draft the affidavits and the statements?  Ms Ngoye and 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 128 of 371 
 
Mr Holele.  The very same people who were at the heart of 
this thing and the one wash their hands and say:  No, it 
was an irregular contract awarded by – under Montana’s – 
during Mr Montana’s tenure, okay? 
 
They do not take accountability and say:  This is 
our role.  What is my role as CEO?  To act.  The primary 
responsibility to act in the best interest of PRASA is with 
me Chair.  Now when we created PRASA Cres - and 
Ms Ngoye does not say that in her affidavit Chair, our 
property and we changed the mandate.  We changed the 
10 
mandate a bit earlier but we had to then separate these 
functions.  And Ms Ngoye then, of course she brings 
suspicions.  She says all of these things.   
 
No, Chair.  In fact, I had meetings between 
PRASA Cres and Intersite, a subsidiary and a new division 
because they were refusing to – there were instances 
where their collaboration was very important for us to 
achieve our goals as it were.  It has got nothing to do with 
Mr Moodley.  It has to do with the fact that we had the 
property portfolio or rather an advertising portfolio where 
20 
PRASA was not making money and two private companies 
were making money at the expense... 
 
Again, Mr Soni, I want to bring to your attention 
that when you look at the documents because I want to ask 
someone to go – to bring me the entire file and they 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 129 of 371 
 
brought the file.  The figures are mentioned there, they are 
shocking Chair.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Somebody from PRASA? 
MR MONTANA:   What? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Did you ask somebody from PRASA? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, no.  No someone, a lawyer.  A 
lawyer and say:  Can you get me that file?  I want to look 
at that.  Chair, the numbers there are shocking.  We are 
looking at state capture.  We say state-owned enterprises 
do not work but here big private companies who are having 
10 
a feeding frenzy on the assets of these companies.   
 
And so that relationship, I took that on and I did 
not leave that Chair.  I think it was a right decision.  When 
you look at the papers that have been filed, you look at 
some of the numbers you will actually see Chair that one of 
the papers mention the numbers and say Primedia and 
Continental made R 300 million out of the portfolio.   
 
PRASA only made just a mere R 70 million.  So 
the owner of the asset gets R 70 million, okay?  The 
private companies who had not even invested in that 
20 
assets all of them to put a board(?).  They make almost 
R 300 million. 
 
And I read in the judgment that particular fact 
was not even challenged in that – I am not saying you must 
accept it here.  I am simply mentioning the fact that in my 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 130 of 371 
 
affidavit I deal with this issue ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, look.  Mr Montana, we have 
agreed that whatever is in your affidavit you will present 
now. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no.  I am not changing that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  Ja, he is not changing it. 
MR MONTANA:   I am just simply saying that I am not 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He is just mentioning that ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   I am not urging ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...I am not saying the Commission should 
accept the – what is it called – the court judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That is what I am referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But I am elaborating on the point as 
agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think maybe to clarify because I think I 
can see what maybe causing Mr Soni concern.  My 
20 
understanding is that when you say in your affidavit, you 
are not saying that where you need to state what is in your 
affidavit, you are not stating it because we will see it.  You 
are not saying that?  You just mention that. 
MR MONTANA:   I am dealing with it now. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 131 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I am dealing with it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  That is my understanding. 
MR MONTANA:   I am dealing with it now Chair so that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Soni was concerned that we 
had one agreement earlier on and if you deviate from it, it 
should not just be left like that.  But I think you have 
10 
clarified.  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, in my affidavit Chair and you will 
remember I submitted this to the Commission in October 
last year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not remember when in last 
year.  Ja. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 Yes, 
but 
it 
was 
in 
October, 
the 
15 t h of October.  This is almost four months before this 
court’s judgment.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I want to indicate that I state in my 
affidavit that Primedia and Continental together occupied 
55% of the sites, advertising sites of PRASA but they paid 
on 3% of rental income whilst companies that occupied 
45% of sites paid almost 67% of the rental.  So on 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 132 of 371 
 
average, these companies Chair will pay 1100 per site but 
when you look at Primedia and all of – and the other 
companies, they would pay you, Chair, R 200,00.  So it is a 
huge...  Now – and I made the calculation that if we were 
to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now let me just – just to recollect the 
whole context about this.  This is a transaction in terms of 
which a company that...  
[break in recording] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on property belonging to PRASA or its 
10 
subsidiary. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They put up whatever they want to 
advertise.  It is on PRASA’s property or on the subsidiary. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they – as long as that advert is 
there, they pay per month.  Is that right? 
MR MONTANA:   They pay per month, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja.  So Chair, you will see that there – 
20 
and I say that if they were to pay the same amount, 
Strawberry – Primedia and Continental would basically 
increase the revenue income for PRASA on the advertising 
portfolio 
by 
almost 
122% 
Chair 
and 
these 
numbers 
correlate exactly with what is contained in that court – in 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 133 of 371 
 
that litigation that was unfolding Chair. 
 
But the court, I think, I am not saying made a 
wrong decision but the court – if PRASA does not oppose 
and say PRASA – Mr Holele is there, Ms Ngoye is there.  
They allow Primedia to go to court and then PRASA 
ultimately does not file(?).   
 
And you see – my legal advisor said but this law 
firm that is representing us is giving us advice that we do 
not – that we think is actually not protecting our own 
interest.  And we think we should change.  We should 
10 
change that. 
 
But Chair these are the factual issues, and I 
thought, in some way, it was fair.  Like Ms Ngoye who says 
you must act in the best interest of the company, should 
raise all these issues.  And if she feels that Strawberry – 
Chair, there is no evidence.  I have listened to these 
things.   
 
I have never heard one evidence that says the 
relationship between Provantage/Umjanji is broken.  If 
someone says:  Well, that relationship was started by 
20 
Montana, he has got interest in it.  They would be having a 
discussion here.  Nothing of that sort.  What we have are 
insinuations.  You know, that after the contract had been 
signed, at that time we have also now shifted the portfolio 
to PRASA Cres, not to PRASA Corporate. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 134 of 371 
 
 
Chair, this is an ongoing thing.  Ms Ngoye was 
part of discussions on – when I went to the Board of 
PRASA in 2010, I said three things to the board, Chair, 
which is relevant to this.  I said we want – after the World 
Cup we want to have a different organisation.  So we need 
– we are going to do three things. 
 
One, of course, as to recapitalise the asset of 
this thing.  The second thing was of course to sustain rail 
operations.  But the third one Chair was to ensure that we 
will maximise income from the properties and the assets 
10 
that we have and that we will then separate PRASA 
Intersite and create a new division. 
 
The other one will continue being a subsidiary.  
Invest in assets.  For example the assets that include 
telecoms 
lines 
so 
that 
we 
can 
rent 
that 
to 
telecommunication companies and they pay a fee for that 
to access that.  But the property portfolio, our landlord will 
become a PRASA Cres and that is why that...  To this very 
day I understand that that portfolio is still being managed 
there Chair.   
20 
 
But at the heart of this thing Chair is the fact 
that 
we 
have 
people 
who 
project 
themselves 
as 
revolutionaries, anti-corruption busters but in real times 
are 
actually 
protecting 
the 
interest 
of 
established 
companies that are making money at the expense of 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 135 of 371 
 
PRASA. 
 
Strawberry, Chair, I do not even know who is the 
shareholder there, Chair.  I have never – the only time that 
Mr Moodley would speak to me and he wanted to talk to me 
about security, either what work you are doing and all of 
those things.  Not Strawberry, Chair.  It was not one of the 
companies. 
 
And I think the Commission is obliged to go and 
obtain an affidavit from the CEO of Provantage or what has 
– the consortium that was called Umjanji.  How did you 
10 
come to that?  But the documents that I have Chair 
including the main emails, it shows that Ms Ngoye is 
making a major U-turn, creating a story where email 
evidence at that time suggested that she was working... 
 
That 
is 
why 
she 
cannot 
even 
tell 
this 
Commission that the agreement to sit and that Intersite 
had to enter into an agreement with Strawberry as a result 
of that concession that PRASA approved and it was signed 
by me as the CEO of Intersite.  And she must then say:  I 
did not want to sign it.  I was forced by Mr Montana. 
20 
 
Chair, at that time, there was none.  Now she is 
trying to think about it to bring – and that is why she can 
conclude 15.2 Chair by saying I was - at the time I was 
already the CEO of Intersite.  She does not take it to its 
logical conclusion. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 136 of 371 
 
 
At the time I was already the CEO of Intersite 
and I could not sign the agreement between Intersite and – 
so it is about Lucky Montana.  Lucky Montana was 
captured by Roy Moodley when the facts are very clear 
Chair and that is what I am outlining. 
 
And she never – you know this affidavit Chair, it 
is so disappointing because the entire affidavit does not – 
it talks about a law firm that is removed but the most 
important issue is.  Is PRASA as a public entity getting 
value from the portfolio it owns?  It has not even been 
10 
dealt with and I think that is where the problem is Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
MONTANA:   So that would be – that is my 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...and of course my submission and this 
submission Chair, you will find it – it is – when we deal 
with my affidavit later on I elaborate on the details in 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright.  So that is what you 
20 
had to say about paragraph 15 and its sub-paragraphs? 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As it pleases.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that we are at twenty past one. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 137 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I did not want to interrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no but it is fine.  Maybe we should 
adjourn now? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us adjourn now and then we will 
resume at twenty past two. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chairperson.  
Chairperson, just to finalise Mr Montana’s last point.  We 
were not aware of the judgment given in the Primedia.  I 
have raised with Mr Montana that we would appreciate a 
copy of the judgment.  We can look at it and then decide if 
there are matters that arise, that would have to be 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana, can we go on with what 
20 
Ms Ngoye says and I think we were at paragraph 15.8 on 
page 284.  She says that the threats of removing the 
portfolio, that is the Strawberry Worx portfolio, were 
carried out on the 20 May by Ms Naidoo, I think this is I 
think Ms Malini Naidoo the legal assistant in your office.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 138 of 371 
 
Were you aware of that? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think that there are two separate 
issues here.  I earlier on …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, let me first establish, which 
paragraph are you on? 
MR MONTANA:   Oh sorry, Chair.  It is 15.8 on page 284. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Okay, alright, yes.  Yes, Mr 
Montana?  Your mic? 
MR MONTANA:   My apologies - after lunch.  The legal 
adviser in my office did not have such authority, Chair, she 
10 
would not have done anything of that sort.  We had the 
general manager who was running what do you call public 
affairs and that the late Hope Zinde. 
She – they did not take – move the function.  The 
movement of a function, the corporate function is a 
structure of a company.  They would not do something like 
that.   
But there was of course the issue of the files in 
respect of Primedia and Continental and I think that is 
what I confirmed she called me – she called me about to 
20 
say they came and they took some files here and I said 
look, that is not the right way to do it when people pitch 
and took and removed files from a subsidiary.  That is not 
how we should do it.   
But the issue of the movement of the function from 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 139 of 371 
 
Intersite, it has got nothing to do with this fight, it has to 
do with the strategy of the business about this portfolio 
and where we allocate some of these functions of which Ms 
Ngoye was party to.   
So I think for me she is conflating those two into 
one to make the argument that because she had taken a 
different position – and, Chair, I think all evidence will 
show that at a particular point there was not even a 
dispute between Intersite under her leadership.   
I think a guy by the name of Mr Chauke, Mr Martin 
10 
Chauke, she had written a lot of emails on her own behalf, 
on behalf of Intersite and the CEO confirming how they 
were going to work with Strawberry. 
Now, 
Chair, 
remember 
we 
are 
discussing 
advertising 
portfolio, Umjanji ceded, it is not the whole portfolio, they 
have ceded the outdoor part of that advertising portfolio 
and I think it is very important that we emphasise that 
particular issue.   
So she is talking about Ms Ngoye’s affidavit, she 
send advertising portfolio in total but I do not know if 
20 
taking out that entire advertising portfolio, that speaks to 
Strawberries because that speaks only one part of the 
entire function [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I just want to understand, Mr 
Montana, if I understand your evidence correctly, you are 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 140 of 371 
 
drawing 
a 
distinction 
between 
removing 
the 
function 
relating to advertising from the files concerning Primedia’s 
complaint about the unlawfulness of the award.  Is that the 
distinction you draw? 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, I am saying that they are related but 
they are not one and the same think, Chair.  So I think in 
her affidavit, she is basically taking a position – let say we 
talk about Primedia or we talk about Strawberry or we talk 
about changing of these functions.  She says the function 
was 
changed 
because 
it 
was 
aimed 
at 
benefiting 
10 
Strawberry and I am saying, Chair, that is incorrect.   
 
Her starting point is that she is listing entities that 
were entities that belonged to Mr Moodley.  Now we have 
not 
been 
presented 
with 
evidence 
that 
who 
owns 
Strawberry, who are the owners of this company, that is 
this particular company and I think those facts are lacking 
here, Chair. 
 
So my view is that I am saying some of the things 
she is saying may be true but they belong to a different 
context yet she has conflated them to support her own 
20 
argument and I think that is why I am making a distinction 
in those matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the – so you said that she called you 
in relation to …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   The files. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 141 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The removal of the files. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you told her that what they had 
done was wrong, it was not the way to …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   The removal of the files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The removal of the files. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were with her on that. 
MR MONTANA:  Exactly, Chair.  Chair, I am in agreement 
with her on that, I still do. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But she is now taking that, Chair, and you 
will see that there has been ongoing conflict there, that is 
confirmed in even emails, fights that were there.  When 
people have fights amongst themselves, it is official, 
someone that elevates her position and make it as the 
absolute truth, that no, this is what is right, I am making 
the best interest of the business, the others are not. 
 
And I am saying no, it cannot be, you have to look 
at that, for example I am saying if you look at the 
20 
argument, Chair, and analyse this affidavit and I look and 
say what was facing PRASA at that time, it was the fact 
that it was not about this legal frame that we said is being 
changed.   
 
The primary issue from someone in leadership 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 142 of 371 
 
position is that are we achieving our strategy goals or 
objectives that we set ourselves as a business?  Are we 
making money, getting – maximizing the revenues from the 
advertising portfolio that we have?   
Throughout in this affidavit she is so preoccupied 
with something else, that the primary – she lose sight of 
the much bigger picture that we are trying to achieve and I 
think that is part of why we have some of this five issues, 
she is confirming that.  So she is trying to put it in two 
contrasting lines.  You are dealing with good people and 
10 
she is part of the good people and you are dealing with 
bad people and Montana are supporting Moodley and they 
were supporting Strawberry and I am saying there is false 
dichotomy that will not help the Commission because it 
does not provide the facts. 
So what I was trying to do before we went onto the 
break, I was trying to say here are the facts of the matter.  
Did you go out on tender?  Who tendered for that?  Who 
won that tender?  Who signed the letters and those are the 
facts that I am proving, Chair, and they do not support the 
20 
line that she has taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So to the extent that Ms Ngoye says that 
Ms Naidoo said she had been instructed – I think I saw 
something along those lines but I do not think she says - 
she said she was instructed by you. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 143 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   In the last sentence of that 
paragraph, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, she said she had strict instructions 
all from Mr Montana to remove the files.  So you say you 
were in agreement with Ms Ngoye that files should not be 
removed either – or not be removed in the manner in which 
it was done. 
MR MONTANA:   No, the manner it is been done, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And I think the fight had to do with how 
10 
there was a dispute between the legal adviser and how 
Intersite was dealing with the issue of the litigation, the 
Primedia litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR MONTANA:   So I am saying this specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And within one organisation, just imagine, 
Chair, as CEO I greed that files are taken in that way, 
there is no proper handover, so things – going have chaos 
and you are creating a precedent where people can just go 
20 
into – especially subsidiary, it was subsidiary though I was 
the Chair, it required board resolution to make even 
decisions like those.  So, Chair, I agreed with her in that 
specific matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 144 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   But she is now saying we could not 
manage the portfolio because we were now – we manage it 
under very difficult conditions and I am saying that it is not 
correct because if you look at the very documents, emails 
that are available, actually show that you managed the 
portfolio and you interacted with the very Strawberry as 
Intersite, not at the instigation of anyone.  You signed a 
contract, the main – the executive at Intersite was 
managing this portfolio, it is written where they are making 
arrangements on how they should implement the outdoor – 
10 
what is called the outdoor of the type role that is there. 
 
Now if – and I was going through those emails, 
Chair, to try and pick up whether there was any area of 
disagreement and dispute.  There was none, Chair.  Okay?  
And it is at a particular point that Ms Ngoye take the thing 
and that is why I kept on using the word afterthought, that 
she wanted to find out how do you support this story that 
Moodley was running the show, let us bring Strawberry. 
 
Now 
does 
Roy 
Moodley 
control 
Umjanji 
and 
Provantage who won the tender?  And if that is – Chair, the 
20 
last point, if indeed he controls those, the people who 
made the award – now who made an accusation against 
Moodley that he is controlling things?  It is Mr Holele.  Now 
Mr Holele, if Provantage works with Strawberry after being 
awarded, was he aware of that?  At what point did he 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 145 of 371 
 
become aware of that?  Was he controlled by Mr Moodley?   
 
So, Chair, we need to find out.  It is either these 
people were given instruction by me to say award this to 
Provantage and Provantage then after being awarded I say 
work with Strawberry.  None of these people are saying 
that, that we are seeing a story that says Moodley was 
involved by association and not by evidence, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, now just to get clarification.  You 
were against the way in which the files were sought to be 
removed but did you give an instructions that they should 
10 
be removed by some people just did it the wrong way or 
you had not given any instruction? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, I have not given the – I 
have not given any instruction …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the removal of files. 
MR MONTANA:   It did not require, I mean, what is called 
even instruction from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   These are an interaction between our 
teams on this particular matter and I do not know whether 
20 
it was requested, the others removed and the others 
decided to use their own strict approach in getting these 
particular files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   But I had nothing to do with the function 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 146 of 371 
 
and it did not come from me because the function issue 
about where and how this portfolio should be managed, it 
is far beyond Strawberries or that thing and that is a 
decision that we make as a company, as an exco. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   As well as a board, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chair.  Now if – and I 
know you were not there, if Ms Naidoo said to Ms Ngoye 
that she had instructions from you to remove the files and I 
10 
know the distinction you draw, so let us not go back to 
that, Mr Montana.  She would not have been reflecting 
what you told her, Ms Naidoo.  If she told Ms Ngoye you 
had instructed to remove the files because you did not 
instruct [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, well I would say, Ms Ngoye would 
have a legitimate [indistinct] to believe that that comes 
from me, Chair, particularly from a legal adviser but she 
would also would want to confirm that with me and if she 
has got a different view, she will do exactly that but you 
20 
will see in this submission, Chair, that in her affidavit the 
meeting where all these things are said is a meeting 
attended by three representatives of Strawberry, Mr Holele 
and Ms Ngoye.  The legal adviser is not even there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   No, Mr Montana, I am sorry to 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 147 of 371 
 
trouble you, this is a very separate meeting, this is now the 
20 May 2013, the meeting that we are talking about is in 
2011. 
MR MONTANA:   What page are we, sorry/ 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   23 July 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is page 284, paragraph 15.8. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am sorry, I am on page 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Go to Ms Ngoye’s affidavit which starts – 
you know, these are red numbers only, there are no black 
numbers, it starts at page 277 and then you go to page 
10 
284. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, I am there.  Sorry, Mr Soni, I am at 
the right page now. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  So I am saying to you at 15.8 
Ms Ngoye is talking about an interaction that happened on 
the 20 May 2013.  The meeting you are talking about was 
in July 2011.  So my question now is directed to the last 
sentence in this paragraph where Ms Ngoye said Ms 
Naidoo told her that she had instructions from you.  I just 
want to confirm, you did not give those instructions to Ms 
20 
Naidoo. 
MR MONTANA:   No, not at all, no. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  She then says at 15.9 
…[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   Before you move, counsel.  Chair, I just 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 148 of 371 
 
want to – as you can see 15.8, the point I was making, that 
there are two issues there.  There is a removal of the files 
and there is a threat of the removal of the portfolio and 
they are being used as one thing and that is the point I 
was trying to clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We have got that, Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright then at 15.9 she says: 
“I immediately called Mr Montana but he did not 
10 
respond.” 
Then she called one of the independent directors.  That 
does not concern us.  It carries on though in the last 
sentence, she is saying that Ms Naidoo removed the files.  
Now when did you become aware that Ms Naidoo had 
removed the files? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, if you recall, I said earlier – and I 
am surprised the – we are talking about – unless we were 
talking about two different things.  I spoke about Ms 
Naidoo, who was the legal adviser, and I am talking about 
20 
the late Ms Hope Zinde.  Now – and I was told that Ms 
Zinde accompanied by Ms Naidoo removed the files.  Ms 
Zinde was a general manager for the public affairs 
portfolio. 
Now throughout, Chair, the submission, there is not 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 149 of 371 
 
even any reference to Ms Zinde in the file.  I do not know if 
it is out of respect for her but I think that that very same 
day she did call me and we spoke and I said I agree with 
you that that is not the way to go. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   So when …[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am asking a different – because Ms 
Zinde is mentioned in paragraph 15.10.  
MR MONTANA:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You know, Mr Montana, we are not 
10 
going to make much progress if we do not answer 
questions.  The question I asked is when did you become 
aware that Ms Naidoo had removed the files? 
MR MONTANA:   But, Chair, that is an issue of dispute, it 
is not a factual issue.  I am saying that the issue that was 
there – and now that is why the people who removed the 
files, I am saying that in my understanding it is supposed 
to Ms Zinde accompanied by Ms Naidoo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay?  Now that is a factual issue and I 
20 
am saying that – now I was not aware that she is 
mentioned in the next page but there it is mentioned in a 
context of a meeting, not in the context of the removal of 
files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take this bit by bit.  To your 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 150 of 371 
 
knowledge were the files ever removed? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I was told – when she called me, 
yes, she confirmed they came to remove the files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when she spoke to you, according to 
her the files had already been removed? 
MR MONTANA:   Had already been removed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   I think it was late in the evening when 
she called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   And said look, I was trying to reach you 
during the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And I spoke to the meeting independent  
director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   This is what happened.  So we spoke 
over 
the 
phone 
on 
that 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was on the same day. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   It was on the same date, Chair, but late. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, late.  Okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And when you say she called you, 
you are talking about Ms Ngoye. 
MR MONTANA:   Ms Ngoye, sorry. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 151 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But she says then – and I understand 
you are drawing a distinction between who was present 
when the files were removed.  I understand you to say you 
thought Ms Hope was also there – sorry, Ms Zinde was 
there.  Can I ask you this?  Is it correct that, as Ms Ngoye 
says, a board meeting was scheduled for the following 
day?  Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   The board meeting of what, of Intersite? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That is what it seems like.  And she 
says she confronted you with this issue at that board 
10 
meeting. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I cannot recall such a 
conversation, no. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Okay, let us just look at 
what you agree with and disagree with. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:    You do not – you cannot recall if 
there was a meeting on the following day, that is the 21 
May.   
MR MONTANA:   Of the board, no.  I assume this is the 
20 
board of Intersite, Chair.  I cannot recall it. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Okay.  And then she says 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there seems to be a problem, Mr 
Soni, because ion paragraph 15.8 Ms Ngoye says the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 152 of 371 
 
…[intervenes] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The meeting took place on 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The removal of the files seems to have 
happened on the 20 May and then in paragraph 15.10 she 
says a board meeting was scheduled for the following day 
but then she says 27 May 2018, unless it is an error. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You will recall, Chairperson, she 
corrected that when she gave evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, so it is meant to be 21? 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   It is meant to be 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  This supplementary affidavit was 
filed?  It is [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   She corrected when she was here, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, I am saying even if they correct 
it here it always convenient if a supplementary affidavit is 
done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that in the bundle one can see oh, 
20 
this was corrected.  So that could still be done. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That could still be done.  Ja, okay.  So 
that is 21 s t.  Okay, you may proceed. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   She says at this meeting she asked 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 153 of 371 
 
you why you had not told her of the instruction to remove 
the file.  Now I know you say you did not give that 
instruction to her.  I just want to know whether you recall a 
conversation with Ms Ngoye about the removal of the file 
except on the phone on the previous matter. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, only that night when we spoke 
about it on the phone as in 15.9, yes, ja. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So can I take it that as regards the 
rest of paragraph 15.10 you say either you cannot recall or 
it did not happen. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, let me – I do not recall 
having a discussion for 15 – 10.15.11 with Ms Ngoye, no. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright, she …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   In the meeting she is referring to. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  She says present at the 
meeting where Ms Hope Zinde, Ms Naidoo, Mr Holele, 
yourself and herself.  I take that those would all be the 
board members of Intersite? 
MR MONTANA:   Those would be? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   The board members of Intersite, the 
20 
people whom she names there. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, no, this – she was the CEO of 
Intersite, the other people were the PRASA corporate 
office. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, I see, okay, alright.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 154 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   So there were no board members at all 
involved in that discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, she in the first line of paragraph 
15.10 talks about a board meeting and now of course she 
does not specify whether that is PRASA board or Intersite 
but one might assume that because at that time she was 
CEO of Intersite that she is talking about the board of 
Intersite. 
MR MONTANA:   And then she was also not participating in 
the board of PRASA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So I agree, Chair, that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That must be Intersite. 
MR MONTANA:   Intersite, it should be Intersite board, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  But would Ms Zinde, Ms 
Naidoo, Mr Holele normally have been entitled to attend 
board meetings of Intersite? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, only myself as – because I 
was 
chairing 
the 
board 
at 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
20 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And Ms Ngoye. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Ngoye as CEO.  If these were to 
attend they would attend per invitation or something? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 155 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Sorry, Chairperson, can I intervene?  
I am the cause, that is why I want to intervene. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You will see on the fifth line, this is 
something I – because I was trying to use a broad stroke to 
deal with 15.10, she says: 
“At the board meeting he asked Mr Montana to 
schedule a meeting with all the relevant parties so 
that the matter could be dealt with.  He scheduled a 
meeting for a few days later.” 
10 
So these are two different, I [inaudible – 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, these are two different meetings, 
okay, okay.  No, that is fine, that is fine. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am sorry about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  No, no, that is fine.  Okay, 
you may proceed. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now can you recall a meeting – now 
we know it is not the board meeting, where the six of you 
discussed or the five of you discussed. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Not at all, Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When one looks at the contents of 
paragraph 15.10 is it possible that she is mistaken about 
the day when that discussion took place?  Maybe it took 
place over the phone on the evening when she called you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 156 of 371 
 
or…? 
MR MONTANA:   I think so, Chair, I think - and that relates 
to 15.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   She did make a call to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   We spoke, that I remember vividly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And she was, she was unhappy about 
that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   The board meeting, of course, if she 
raised it at the board meeting of the 27 t h – of course that 
should be reflected in the minutes and the other meeting, I 
cannot recall whether there was such a – that there was a 
meeting to discuss this specific issue, Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But that is the point I am making, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That some of these things are mixed and 
20 
I think that is a bit of problem that I have, also with the 
sequencing of what you are trying to portray but I think let 
us deal with the affidavit as it is, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because she does say in paragraph 
15.10 that your response when she asked you why you had 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 157 of 371 
 
not told her about your instruction that the files should be 
removed from Intersite, she does say you responded by 
saying that you had nothing to do with that instruction and 
that you did not know what she was talking about.  
 
Now that might not be exactly in the same way you 
put it but it reflects – it is consistent with what you said. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, you say you had not given 
instruction and that is what you told her. 
MR MONTANA:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the only next thing is the 
question of the suggestion of a meeting. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where the people she lists there would 
be present.  You say you do not recall …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   No, I do not recall, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That part. 
MR MONTANA:   I am not denying, it is possible, but I do 
not recall us having that meeting, Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Can I just put to you - and I 
understand your answer – I just put to you and we know 
what your answer is, so that you fully responded to 
everything that she has said because she said at the 
meeting and it have not even gone on for five minutes 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 158 of 371 
 
when you accused Mr Holele and her of not following your 
instructions, and I will just tell you what those instructions 
are.  
 
That, sorry Mr Holele then said you had no authority 
to just remove the mandate of the advertising portfolio 
from Intersight without a proper board resolution and thus 
he could not have carried out that instruction.  Can you 
recall that?   
MR MONTANA:  Chair, no.  But let me also say that this 
very point is made earlier in the earlier pages, where she 
10 
said she said to me that she is asking for a board 
resolution and none was provided.  Later on in the 
affidavit, Mr Holele says that. 
 
Chair, the I am not sure if Mr Holele would disobey 
a lawful instruction from me, unless if he stated it and say 
that I cannot clearly, but this PRASA that is described here 
Chair, it really shocks me that this Mr Montana was so 
haphazard, he just arrived and said move a function. 
 
A function Chair, let us part the files a bit.  A 
function is a big thing.  It has to do with budget and a 
20 
number of Employees Chair.  They do not just come and 
say move the stuff there, and I think Ms Mboye because of 
what she is trying to portray or present to the commission, 
she is dealing with the issue of files and elevating that to 
the issue about the function.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 159 of 371 
 
 
I think here possibly what she was trying to do is 
she was trying to debate how PRASA was dealing with the 
issue of litigation of [indistinct] Chair.  So I, that is what 
my thinking is and that is why I have a problem with all of 
those things there.  
 
Mr Holele never said that I do not remember sitting 
in a meeting where he said that, I mean if you look at it Mr 
Holele was still at PRASA corporate office, not even at 
Intersight and I think this time Chair you will see even the 
stuff that he was writing, that he would not even express 
10 
such a critical view Chair.  
 
It only became, it became so vocal when I have 
taken disciplinary action against him Chair, for other wrong 
things that he has done.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  As you please Chairperson.  Mr 
Montana, I do not want us to enter this debate, but I am 
saying to you when one reads 1511, the one thing that is 
quite clear because I accepted the distinction you drew 
between removing the file relating to the case that Prime 
20 
Media was going to bring, and removing the advertising 
function in relation to Strawberry Walks.  
 
But if nothing else, 1511 makes that quite clear, 
because Ms Ngoye says that you said they, he told you you 
had no mandate to move the advertising portfolio.  So I 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 160 of 371 
 
accept the distinction you draw.  I am saying that they are 
not mistaken about it.  
 
They know the tune.  She says they removed the 
files on the one day and now she is talking about the 
removal of the advertising portfolio as well.  I do not want 
you to react to it, you have given your view.  I am just 
saying to you that based on this, that is not consistent with 
what is contained in Ms Ngoye’s affidavit.  
MR MONTANA:  No, no Chair, I note that but I do not agree 
with 1511.  That is the point that I made, ja.  
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes no, no, no I understand.  
MR MONTANA:  Chair, let me say Mr Soni you keep on 
confusing I think probably even the Chair, because you 
then say and I think you have corrected it now, advertising 
portfolio and then earlier on you were talking about 
removing the Strawberry Portfolio.  
 
So I think that sometimes when I respond, it is 
because of ... I do not think  it happened consciously, but I 
think then when I respond ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
20 
MR MONTANA:  I just wanted you to note that point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay.  I am just again, sorry I know 
you say that you cannot recall that this happened or 
probably it did not happen.  She says at 1512: 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 161 of 371 
 
 
“I was taken aback by this approach.  I thought 
the purpose of the meeting was to deal with 
the alleged instruction which she had denied 
giving you.” 
 
Then she says Ms Naidoo accused her of fraud and 
maladministration 
of 
the 
portfolio 
and 
that 
she 
was 
preferring other media players over Strawberry Walks.  Can 
you recall whether it happened at this meeting or some 
other meeting? 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair.  I think that Chair, my advisor ... 
10 
my advice, my advisor was not performed or [indistinct] 
Chair.  At that time an advisor does not perform executive 
function.  She advises me.  She interacts, pull out the right 
kind of information and she would not make, she would not 
make Chair, I do not know but I think the relationship 
between Ms Ngoye and Ms Naidoo was not, it is clear it 
was not a good one, and you can see that how she is 
pumping this issue.  
 
But Chair, if she were to say that to an executive, I 
would not she rather say that to me, that so and so I think 
20 
is guilty and here are the facts, but if I sit with my 
executives and she says that, I will never accept that 
Chair, because it will be a disrespect not of the executives 
themselves, but for me as the CEO, and I will not accept 
that.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 162 of 371 
 
 
So I do not think, I think Ms Naidoo has a great 
professional, 
a 
sharp 
legal 
mind. 
 
I 
think 
she 
did 
tremendous work for us.  The fact that on this one within 
the business, there was this big confrontation and that 
there was, and I think this was in fact unfortunately her 
timelines are not in this affidavit.  
 
It will even make us understand at what point we 
were Chair.  So yes, things were not smooth.  There were 
those type of tensions and conflicts between people, but I 
think Ms Ngoye had made a choice to put them to say no 
10 
this were happening to Strawberry, Strawberry is supposed 
to be linked to Mr Moodley.  
 
That is the point she is making Chair, even if the 
facts ... so she is trying to harness the facts or the 
particular experience to support that view, and I do not 
share that view Chair.  That is what I am saying to you, to 
Mr Soni.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright, but she says something quite 
significant thereafter at the top of page 286.  She says: 
 
“I told Mr Montana he will have to put me on 
20 
suspension 
if 
he 
believed 
the 
allegations 
against me, so that he could conduct an 
investigation [indistinct].” 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, this did not happen.  It did not 
happen.  The only time that Ms Ngoye get me to do that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 163 of 371 
 
she knows that she left PRASA.  When I tried to speak to 
her and she shows, she showed signs of insubordination, 
she disrespected in fact the meeting, the fact that I was 
having people there.  
 
I said look, I hear your concerns and this related to 
Mr Dingiswayo.  So if she had dealt me in that way if there 
was such a meeting Chair, I know that I would have acted 
immediately without any hesitation.  It did not happen 
Chair.   
 
So I think that for me, I note that it is in line with 
10 
the narrative that she wants to present.  I am saying it is 
not the truth and the commission will evaluate whether 
what she is saying and what I am saying, once my affidavit 
is presented Chair, what actually could be the truth in 
these matters.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Then she goes on in relation 
to that proposition to you, that she be put in suspension.  
She says: 
 
“However, instead of taking steps against me, 
Mr Montana outraged as  he was instructed the 
20 
manager 
who 
was 
responsible 
for 
the 
advertising portfolio at Intersight, and had 
recently been moved to report to Ms Zinde, Mr 
Martin Chauke be suspended with immediate 
effect.” 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 164 of 371 
 
 
Now she is dealing with a lot of things here.  She is 
talking about different people, but the essence as I 
understand it she is saying you then instructed that Mr 
Chauke be suspended.  Having regard to the call on you to 
suspend her, pending an investigation into the allegations 
Ms Naidoo made.  
MR MONTANA:  Chair, it is unfortunate that Ms Zinde is 
not with us, because I know, I know the reason why she 
wanted to take action against her.  Mr Chauke, and I think 
at that time if I remember he had reported that to her, to 
10 
the ER department at PRASA on why there should be such 
an action. 
 
Again a separate activity which is linked to support 
the narrative that she wants to make.  I think that Chair I 
have never made such an instruction.  Mr Martin Chauke 
when he was at PRASA, I think he was a senior manager 
Chair.  
 
He was not even a general manager.  I only dealt 
with group executives and general managers.  So I do not 
think Chair, it was right to present it in that way and Chair, 
20 
also I do not like the way Ms Zinde comes to the picture.  
Remember, before I saw these paragraphs, I spoke to her 
in a different role.  
 
Now she comes out there and she is acting in, 
under my instructions and I was outraged.  That is what 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 165 of 371 
 
she is saying.  Outraged as he was.  Chair, it takes time 
to, for me to be provoked and surely I do not know what Ms 
Ngoye is describing here Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Soni to the extent that this may 
not have been done or it may be necessary to obtain the 
affidavits of Mr Holele and Ms Naidoo to give their version 
about what happened at this meeting. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously Ms Zinde is late, there is 
nothing we can do about that, but I am sure Ms Naidoo can 
10 
be found somewhere and Mr Holele.  We do not have an 
affidavit from Mr Holele about this? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Holele, you will recall Chairperson.  
He was the first witness in PRASA.  He made a general 
statement besides dealing with what Ms Moodley told him.  
He made a general statement that he had read the affidavit 
of Ms Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo and he confirmed the 
correctness 
of 
those 
allegations 
in 
so 
far 
as 
they 
concerned him. 
 
But obviously this is now a different issue.  It is not 
20 
just simply a concern free affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We will have to get details about it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja and attempts can be made by Ms 
Naidoo as well.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 166 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, well Mr Montana I am sure will 
help.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is assuming they are still in touch.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Well, you will recall Chairperson, I 
asked earlier ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  If he had asked is Ms Naidoo can 
attend these proceedings.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, I did not know that.  
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 Yes, 
that 
is 
the 
Ms 
Naidoo 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Context of ...[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, I wanted to invite her ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MONTANA:  Especially because there were matters, I 
would ask a number of people.  Some of them former 
PRASA Employees ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MONTANA:  Will remember the details and I consult 
with them on these issues, so I will speak to her Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine and then you can give 
her number to Mr Soni. 
MR MONTANA:  Soni, ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or somebody.  Ja.  Or Ms Rangata or, ja 
okay.  Alright, let us continue.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 167 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  Then she goes on to say, this 
is Ms Ngoye: 
 
“Mr Montana then instructed me to call Mr 
Chauke and tell him to bring back all PRASA 
property that evening as he was suspended 
with immediate effect.”  
 
Which is obviously, now this is the 27 t h because it 
is a few days later.  
MR MONTANA:  Chair, can I see the copy of the letter? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  There are no letters.  Whatever we 
10 
have Mr Montana, we have presented it.  
MR MONTANA:  No, I am saying Mr Chauke is still there 
Chair.  He received a letter of suspension.  Can we have 
that letter?  Was it a letter signed by me or who signed the 
letter? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Can I ask you let us, and I do not 
mean to be disrespectful Mr Montana.  This is an 
investigation into a whole number of allegations.  If you 
want to deny it, deny it and we will talk to Mr Chauke, but 
20 
we cannot keep saying can I see this and can I see that.  
 
It is not going to be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no Mr Soni.  No, no, no. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, I just want to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Mr Montana 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 168 of 371 
 
is not a lawyer.  He has denied some of the things that are 
being said by Ms Ngoye.  I suspect that if Ms Ngoye says 
Mr Chauke was suspended in the light of the fact that he is 
denying some of the things, if he wishes to see the letter 
of suspension I think that is fine.  
 
But if we do not have it, we do not have it.  So if we 
can find it that is fine, but if we cannot find it, then that is 
what we can just have.  We do not have it or we cannot 
find it and then it may well be that there is something that 
he wants to look at there which might help his version. 
10 
 
Or it may well be that there is nothing, but let us 
see if we can find the letter from Mr Chauke.  
MR MONTANA:  Chair, the reason I am asking for it is not 
to argue.  I am saying I just want to remind myself, 
because here and we are dealing with a factual issue 
which is very important Chair, and because the ... we are 
told that two people handed the letter to Mr Chauke.  
 
The letter, so that is why I am saying it will help me 
to make even the recollection and what was the context.  
Was the letter signed by me, signed by somebody else.  
20 
We are told it is being handed over but we are not told who 
signed the letter, who suspended Mr Chauke and what was 
the specific, what was the specific transgression that he 
was suspended.  
 
So I just wanted to do that to assist the commission 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 169 of 371 
 
Chair.  Not to argue against what Ms Ngoye is saying.  It is 
possible but I do not want to disclaim that Chair, hence I 
was asking for the letter. 
 
But I will accept it Chair if the commission does not 
have it, but noting that Mr Chauke is there and he has 
deposed to an affidavit I think on the matter of Mr Moodley, 
I think he probably has a copy of that letter and he could 
share it to the commission Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  I think Mr Soni let us just, 
somebody maybe the investigator can check and if it is 
10 
there it is there, if it  not there it is not there.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, I was not being short 
with Mr Montana.  I am trying to get a version out of him 
and I think if you did not do it, tell us.  Then we know that 
we need to go and look Chair, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  It was not intended as anything else 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But to extract from Mr Montana an 
20 
answer to the allegation that you instructed that he be 
dismissed but that does not prove ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But we just want a version on record 
so we can say that ...[intervenes] 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 170 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is the allegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  That is the response.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, maybe it would have been more 
helpful if Mr Montana had started by saying that is not true 
and then he could enquire about the letter.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes, no no I understand.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us just ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But we leave that point Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  We know we must try and get the 
letter to the extent that ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  Ja.  That is fine.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Mr Montana, and please I am not 
being disrespectful of you.  As I say, if you cannot 
remember or you say look, I do not recall it, but if I am 
shown the letter I do not mind, but at least we know that is 
20 
your reaction. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, I think that is what I was trying to 
say, ja.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  Thank you. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 171 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  But can I ask you this just as a 
general question.  Do you know whether you suspended 
him or not, do you know if Mr Chauke was suspended? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, I do not know.  I do not know, that 
is why I need to go and verify exactly that information. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Because it is said that he was 
suspended with full pay for two years, but he was brought 
back, that is at 15.15.  But obviously if you do not know 
that he was suspended, you cannot meaningfully react to 
that.  
10 
 
At 15.15.   
MR MONTANA:  I see that Chair, I see that.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Alright, now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you know whether he was charged 
or not charged? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, I do not have the details.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know.  Ja, okay.  
MR MONTANA:  The only thing Chair that 15.15, the first 
part I would not, but I take note of what is said in the 
following lines.  He was one of the Employees who was 
20 
brought back to the office after the board of Mr Popo 
Molefe had instructed that all suspensions of Employees be 
investigated.  
 
I also record that the auditor general had noted that 
several PRASA Employees were on suspension for very 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 172 of 371 
 
long periods without any charges and that this could 
constitute wasteful expenditure.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  Now at 15.17 he makes the 
point ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:  No, Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Ja.  
MR MONTANA:  Sorry Mr Soni, and Chair just to why I 
read that part, is because at that time Ms Ngoye herself 
was suspended.  The paragraph that she is describing on 
how she came back and I think it was Norton Rose or one 
10 
of those law firms which came back. 
 
I think after I had left PRASA, but I think I have 
seen where a lot of Employees who were suspended Chair, 
not in one centre, in divisions everywhere.  Ms Ngoye 
recalled she was suspended amongst the charges she was 
facing was the issue of the regular payment or approval of 
variation of 58 million to SA Fence and Gate.  
 
She was suspended by me Chair for a number of 
things, including that and immediately after I have left, she 
is  one of those people that were brought back through the 
20 
same process Chair and a lot of people were not, did not 
take accountability as a result of that.  
 
So I am reading it Chair, because it then tells you 
that we if the board, I am not sure if the board of PRASA 
had taken a specific decision and say that specific person, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 173 of 371 
 
but people were brought back and some of them are issues 
that I am pursuing with the commission that in fact these 
people should be held accountable for some of their 
actions Chair.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Alright.  In regard to 15.17 you have 
made this point before Mr Montana, that there is no 
evidence that you have seen linking Mr Moodley to 
Strawberry Walks.  That is 15.17. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, with what we have discussed I 
agree with you and Mr Soni. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Yes.  
MR MONTANA:  With what we have discussed about these 
meetings and everything.  It actually tells us about the 
ongoing battles within a public entity at a particular point.  
I thought that will be shown, it is on the same fence, you 
know the hand of the one that is manipulating this.  
 
There is no evidence that does that and then the 
conclusion is drawn ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember to translate that Mr Montana.   
MR MONTANA:  The hand, what is it called ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am not going to help you. 
MR MONTANA:  If ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Soni must hear what you are telling 
me.  
MR MONTANA:  Manipulating hand.  We always say it is a 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 174 of 371 
 
monkey’s hand Chair.  That is my, ja it is a saying that you 
cannot translate.  [Indistinct] changing this.  We have not 
Chair, we have dealt with fights between PRASA people, 
okay.   
 
We have dealt with ups and downs and then at the 
end, with the stroke of a pen, this shows how Mr Moodley, 
surely we can do better than this Chair in terms of 
evidence.  I thought Chair let us, because the meeting 
where Mr Moodley was said and I have seen the affidavits, 
where Mr Moodley was said to have interacted with 
10 
PRASA.  
 
Was 2017 after I have left.  I left in 2015.  He is 
interacting with PRASA in 2017.  So maybe he became 
powerful Chair in 2017 after I have left PRASA and when 
him and the Chairman of the board were playing golf 
together or arranging golf trips all over the world.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Soni, did you skip 15.16 deliberately 
or was it oversight or I did not hear you deal with it.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Chairperson, I in my notes I did not 
think it was relevant. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, maybe let me clarify.  Let me 
clarify.  You see at paragraph 15.16 Mr Montana, Ms Ngoye 
says: 
 
“The effect of moving the advertising portfolio 
from 
Intersight 
to 
PRASA 
is 
that 
the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 175 of 371 
 
management of the portfolio was not in the 
interest 
of 
PRASA 
and 
PRASA 
benefitted 
legally if anything from the portfolio.” 
 
Now I know that you have said a lot about the 
distinction between removing the portfolio and removing 
the files.  It is clear from this paragraph that Ms Ngoye’s 
version is that the portfolio was moved.  Now I want to ask 
the question whether while you were there as group CEO, 
was the portfolio ever moved from Intersight to PRASA? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, indeed.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was moved. 
MR MONTANA:  The portfolio was moved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  At the point, I think I admitted that at the 
beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I missed that.  
MR MONTANA:  But I said the reasons for moving the 
portfolio ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
Has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
fight 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you said it was about ...[intervenes]  
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
But 
the 
point 
I 
am 
making 
Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was about what the strategic objectives 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 176 of 371 
 
of the company and whether ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:  Indeed Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The company was making money out of 
this portfolio. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair, in fact when I was there I think the 
portfolio was moved probably twice.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MONTANA:  But it had nothing to do with Ms Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MONTANA:  As she wants to complete in 15.17. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In terms of timing, is it possible 
that the two of you are talking about the moving of the 
portfolio on the same occasion?  You just differ on the 
reason why it was moved.  Is, do you think that might be 
the position? 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair, I think there are two things from 
where I sit.  The first one is that we both know the 
objective reasons why the portfolio moved and why there 
were changes and all of that.  I think that is, and this was 
not a secret.  
20 
 
If you look at the, at PRASA’s corporate plan in 
particular, for the years that we are discussing here, you 
will see that there is a lot of discussion about that and 
what we should get from the advertising portfolio, more 
specifically. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 177 of 371 
 
 
Now the, it is also a separate issue that there were 
files and these files did not start at the beginning.  It is 
just as I said the email show that this, we did not wake up 
in the beginning and there was this big fight.  Excuse me, 
this big fight about advertising, or rather let me put this big 
fight relates to how we deal with the litigation of Prime 
Media and which law firm should represent PRASA and all 
of those things.  
 
Now 15.6 Chair, I said earlier on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  15.16 or 6? 
10 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
15.16, 
the 
one 
that 
we 
just 
said 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MONTANA:  I do not share the view Chair.  I think that 
what is the interest of PRASA in that, except to maximise 
revenues from portfolio and it did not get any of that at 
that time, and that is why I spoke about even the judgment 
that I shared, and shared some of the numbers that I dealt 
with. 
 
So Chair, I think what I think this could be 
20 
happening, that when Ms Ngoye was recollecting some of 
those things, she may then have confused some of the 
dates and some of the processes, but I think for me the 
biggest thing that she is trying to deceive 15.17. 
 
So she is trying to harness these things towards 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 178 of 371 
 
supporting the point she makes, because that is ... 
remember when we started Chair on the other side, she 
mentioned companies that were favoured and we got into 
Strawberry and then he says I submit that what I have 
narrated you know just how powerful Mr Rory Moodley was 
at PRASA, and I am saying but Chair we classified that this 
is a friend and didn’t see all in this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now at some stage when you were 
talking about the issue of moving the portfolio I understood 
you to say something along the lines that Miss Ngoye 
10 
would have been part of a discussion of such a matter. 
MR MONTANA:   
Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  
When the decision was taken to move 
the portfolio, as you say it was. Was she part of that 
decision?    
MR MONTANA:    
Chair Ms Ngoye - was part of all 
these meetings, these were discussions at our Exco, they 
were not secret meetings.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
H’m 
MR MONTANA:   
And she had my – you know she had 
20 
my support Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
H’m 
MR MONTANA: 
And that is why when - her name 
came up to be appointed as CEO of Intersite, firstly, when 
she was appointed the CEO of Intersite at that time spoke 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 179 of 371 
 
to me and said, 
“I think that – when we transferred some of our 
businesses, Metrorail, Shosaloza from Transnet to 
PRASA, 
the 
person 
on 
the 
other 
side 
was 
negotiating with us...”, 
You understand the portfolio. I’m not referring to the 
portfolio, but the – the assets of the [indistinct].  
“And I think that we should head hunt her”. 
I supported that Chair. When he left – or he went to 
become a CEO of a different division within PRASA and – 
10 
and he said that, 
“We think that, we need to bring a woman into that 
leadership position”, 
And Ms Ngoye was nominated. I supported her Chair. The 
fact that when Ms Ngoye was moved, from Intersite and 
she came to PRASA, and let me say one thing – one other 
thing Chair, by the way. When – when there were these 
changes. One of the biggest fights was not about this, was 
about the – was about the, the creation of PRASA Cres. I 
had to sit with the team from Intersite and PRASA Cres 
20 
who didn’t want to co-operate Chair, to implement a 
decision that was now not even a – a decision of the CEO, 
but was now a PRASA body, that were now going to have a 
division manger of property portfolio and advertising, and 
they were going to have an Intersite focusing on asset 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 180 of 371 
 
investment.  
Chair so you can see, for me I won’t write and say it 
shows that Ms Ngoye was there, because CEO’s and their 
managers fight for their businesses within a group. I was a 
group CEO, sometimes I have to manage and sometimes 
this one win over this one, sometimes visa versa. I had to 
play a balancing role. But what she s trying to do here 
Chair. She – you know it’s one thing when she says, 
“I didn’t agree with Mr Montana’s strategy”, 
And all of those things, she is trying to say this was the 
10 
lackey, of Mr Moodley. But the evidence she provides or 
the events – her narrative doesn’t even support – haven’t 
had – haven’t seen the hands of Mr Moodley. I’m still 
waiting for it Chair. Maybe as we proceed I’ll come across 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, should there be minutes of an Exco 
meeting where these decisions were taken which would 
show that she was present, you would expect such 
meetings to exist at PRASA? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, they exist, in fact one of 
20 
the things we did, I think I took the entire Intersite and 
PRASA Cres teams to, I think we went outside because of 
the fight I said, guys maybe we need to think, you know the 
bit of fresh air let’s go and see, we went to go and see 
together and we crafted what became known as a PRASA 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 181 of 371 
 
real estate strategy, which teams from both sides drafted, 
presented, I tell you I was happy with it, we took it to the 
Board and everything so, Board minutes and other things 
will support all of that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but in particular, because you said 
it would have been Exco which made this decision? 
MR MONTANA:   Exco discussion Chair would hear all of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there should be minutes. 
MR MONTANA:   And Ms Ngoye would have participated, I 
10 
think if we call for those years, for the minutes Chair, they 
will show that these were Exco discussions especially 
when we were preparing and drafting the PRASA corporate 
plans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We’ll try and see if we can secure 
that.  The part of the problem of course, I’m not saying we 
won’t try. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   That the lockdown has created a 
20 
serious of ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  ...issue because many of their senior 
employees still work from home, in respect of matters that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 182 of 371 
 
we’ve been trying to get it’s been a bit difficult but in 
respect of our access to PRASA itself, until Ms Hlatswayo 
was suspended he was one of the contracts and then Ms 
Ngoye is now under suspension.  I’m not raising difficulties 
I’m only explaining that we may …[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no that’s fine I guess that in 
their absence you’ll just have to either approach the 
company secretary or the CEO or the Chairperson of the 
Board, ja, okay, alright. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Montana I just want to understand 
10 
just finally on the issue of the removal of, either the files 
or the portfolio, the advertising portfolio from Intersite.  
Now, there were differences between you and Ms Ngoye 
would that be correct, or am I missing something that she’s 
inventing those differences now, in this affidavit? 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, with what she has submitted 
here, I’m not sure if – when you translate that we have 
brought strategic area I’m not sure if you’ve heard, we’ve 
heard a thing on the bigger issues, we’ve debated issues, 
people have given their views but on these specific issues 
20 
raised I think, clearly, Chair we stand on opposite sides. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And that’s always been the case from 
at least 2013 when she complained about the removal of 
the files and you say she did phone you so at least from 
that time you knew that she held a different view, not 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 183 of 371 
 
necessarily with regard to the movement of the advertising 
portfolio but in relation to the movement of the Primedia or 
the file relating to the Primedia disciplinary. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes Chair, Chair, you know for me 
removal will be fine, if somebody say, I wasn’t happy, 
Martha said she was – Ms Ngoye rather, said she wasn’t 
happy with the way this thing was done. Now, a CEO 
managing a big asset may get angry with that and say 
we’ve got a different view Chair about…[indistinct].  So, 
I’m 
saying 
Mr 
Soni, 
that 
– 
and 
you’ll 
see 
2015 
10 
notwithstanding all the to and fro’s in the files you’ll see – 
and in fact I think she says it in the next page about the 
nature of our relationship and that was that.  That is why I 
view many of the things that she writes as manufactured 
lies, Chair, more than anything else and I say she even 
taken an event and then she subject it to 15.17, that’s the 
point I’m making.  So – but if you go to paragraph 19 chair 
or rather paragraph 18 and 19, I think that it tells you that I 
didn’t treat Ms Ngoye in the manner that you saw, I don’t 
think the differences were profound until I formed a view, I 
20 
explained that I formed a view that Ms Ngoye and Mr 
Dingiswayo were not working in the interest of the company 
and that was only in 2015 after I came back from Cape 
Town Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, this – I wanted to ask this, the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 184 of 371 
 
removal of the files, did it happen prior to December 2015 
when you recommended that she should  - 2014 you 
recommended that she should act in your absence when 
you are on leave? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair, I think this happened, two, 
three years earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   So, you can see, Chair, that we all have 
our own personal irritations and everything but for me it 
didn’t – it was not a matter that I should be furious or 
10 
angry about.  I asked her to act because I thought – and I 
explained yesterday that when somebody acts in a position 
it was an opportunity for them to – as part of developing 
their leadership skills to have an opportunity of what it 
means because they get submissions, they’ve got the full 
powers and authority that I have as Group CEO, they have 
to make those decisions in my absence.  So,  Chair, I think 
to answer Mr Soni’s question, I don’t think, until that time 
there was this big difference and at that time there was not 
Mr Moodley’s hand in only came when now the explanation 
20 
why certain contracts should be investigated and to be 
linked to certain people that’s what this story is all about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of who would be appointed as 
Group CEO in your absence with whom did that power lie.  
Did you make a recommendation to the Board and the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 185 of 371 
 
Board made the decision or would you make the decision 
yourself, did you have the power to make the decision 
yourself? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I had – well I think I’m sorry, I 
think I have to look at the delegation of authority 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but your recollection. 
MR MONTANA:   My recollection and the practice, Chair, 
was that it will be my decision but I will consult the Chair 
of the Board so that has been the practice and in this 
10 
particular case I did consult with Mr Molefe because when 
we leave – [indistinct] was leaving – going for a relatively 
long period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   So, I had to inform him that …[indistinct] 
would be acting in that position and if the Chairman has 
got a problem he will say, but – I think we agreed because 
we had one on one meetings with the Chair and then I’ll 
sign documents, including forms that I’m going on leave 
and who authorised the leave, is the Chairman of the 
20 
Board and then I indicate whose acting in that position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess one of the points, either, that 
you are making or would be entitled to make is that, at 
least from your point of view as at November/December 
2014 you didn’t – your relationship with her has been 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 186 of 371 
 
negative because if you viewed it as being negative, it’s 
unlikely you would recommend it that she would act in your 
position or that you would get he to act in your position, 
because when you are going to be away you can’t take 
your enemy and put them in your position. 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair later on- I agree with what 
you’ve said Chair, I fully agree with that but I think later 
events will prove that I’ve actually taken an enemy  and 
put it in that position Chair, which then resulted in a 
situation that culminated on the 15 t h of July when I left 
10 
PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
Certain 
things 
were 
independent 
directors,  he didn’t discuss, even without me, Chair, with a 
seat on their own so that where they realise that there 
might be issues between PRASA and Intersite as the Group 
CEO, you are Chairman here you are Group CEO, you are 
conflicted.  So, that relationship was managed, Chair, so 
she mentioned Mr …[Indistinct] here and then at Autopage 
you had, I think it was, Ms ..[Indistinct] to make sure, 
20 
Chair, that I don’t use my position, abuse my position and 
impose a view on a subsidiary.  So, there was a system of 
control which is in line – guided by what the Company’s Act 
or – in that respect.  So, we had that interest and Chair the 
Board was not hostile …[indistinct – dropped voice] but 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 187 of 371 
 
they were saying, you as Chairman of the Board and as 
Group CEO have to take a view because we think there’s a 
– and I then sat with them, I say, - and I said, look let’s 
take it through a process of non-performance I did convey 
it in a meeting but I said we do not want to do that, 
considering where you are coming from, we headhunted 
you 
from 
Intersite, 
from 
Transnet, 
brought 
you 
into 
Intersite you became CEO but he said, we see that you are 
not achieving those goals, you are not performing at that 
level and I said to her, I advised the Board of Intersite 
10 
that, no I think I must speak to the Board of PRASA that, 
because we are restructuring our Risk Compliance and 
Legal Portfolio that she comes there.  So, in a meeting she 
– of course she was not happy, Chair because in terms of 
profile and everything, being a CEO is more important than 
being a Group Executive and Chair she was, I don’t know 
the word, upset, not upset but – and there were tears 
Chair, she cried and I know, Chair, then she then consulted 
the Chairman of the Board, of PRASA, Mr Buthelezi and 
said, look I’m being removed from my position and 
20 
everything.  The Chairman is someone - and I explained 
the circumstances, looked at the numbers we think that we 
are not winning with her but we don’t want to be firm with 
her and take it – and make an appraisal thing and then get 
rid of her, I suggest – so she’s where she is, Chair, there, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 188 of 371 
 
because you know one of my weaknesses is that even 
when 
people 
have 
made 
big 
mistakes, 
I’ve 
always 
remained human, think of their families and say, how do I 
support them and if Ms Ngoye is fair she will tell this 
Commission and say, look indeed what Mr Montana is 
saying is true, Chair. Now, afterwards, a few months later, 
Chair, I then – brings us to the moment you just described 
about December when I had to go on leave and maybe 
Chair, I was trying to close the bridges and I said Ms 
Ngoye should act and Chair, I nearly used a word which is 
10 
inappropriate 
here 
that 
we 
use 
in 
Mamelodi 
but, 
Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is not Mamelodi. 
MR MONTANA:   This is not Mamelodi, Chair, I agree and 
then she showed me flames Chair, let me put it in that way, 
she showed me flames and they used that time of acting 
Chair, and I was to discover, only later, not at the time 
Chair, and I think, Chair, the point you are making is 
supported by paragraph 18 and paragraph 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Soni? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As it pleases.  I just want to 
understand that.  Ms Ngoye says that she didn’t want legal 
advisor in regard to the Primedia matter that’s …[indistinct] 
to be replaced.  Was it your view that they should be 
replaced? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 189 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, yes, I think that when I got the 
report at that time, what we were being told, if I remember 
the details very well, Chair, I think that the – my biggest 
instruction was that, look, we are not going to win this 
matter as long as Primedia and Continental still occupy the 
site, because they make money and fight us with the same 
money that they make out of the portfolio, and they were 
trying to suggest a completely different route and I need to 
think, Chair, I think in the course of the discussion what 
they were proposing.  Chair, it was presented to me Chair, 
10 
I think it was at the time when the draft – some draft 
affidavits were being prepared for Court.  I think that some 
of the scores and everything and I think they felt that my 
legal advisor was taking a more aggressive approach in 
respect of, what is it called, in respect of that litigation.  I 
think, Chair, they had appointed one of the counsellors it 
was Mr [indistinct] Twala who was representing us in that 
matter which was an instructing attorney, I can’t recall the 
exact detail Chair, they were not appointed by me but 
Chair, I think that the – we did come to a determination at 
20 
that time, that Intersite, in fact, they were following an 
approach on advertising, that is not consistent with what 
we’re trying to achieve.  Now, that may have given rise to 
this 
war 
that 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
that 
we 
are 
describing…[indistinct - dropped voice] and that, I will 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 190 of 371 
 
accept that but Chair I think when people go and pull files 
and do all of those things, I’m not part of that file and that 
is why Ms Ngoye had to call me for …[indistinct] to me, 
raise with me, I’m saying she called, she says of course at 
the Board meeting she raised that matter with me.  So, I 
think – I think, Chair, that we had differences on that issue 
but did it affect our relationship, no Chair, until probably 
around 
January 
2015 
I 
think 
we 
still 
had 
a 
good 
relationship and I bumped into her numerous times, we 
were pleasant, we exchanged pleasantries Chair, we talked 
10 
about things and we also recognised, we say, hey – she 
says to me, you are really fighting me and I said the same 
Chair and this thing, Chair, is like a …[indistinct] isn’t it 
Chair.  Maybe in coming battles we’ll become great friends 
again Chair, but for now we stand on opposite sides Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please, Chair.  I just want to 
finalise this issue because I want to understand.  Was 
Hogan Lovell effectively less firm on its opposition to 
Primedia’s case than you and Ms Naidoo would want? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, look, my view I was very – I had 
taken a very hard line stance on the issue of Primedia, 
22.44], they had put a bid they lost the bid and I said to 
the team, the one – the main reason why they are taking 
this is for them to continue to remain on site and I had 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 191 of 371 
 
actually given a specific instruction that they should be 
thrown out of the site because they are unlawfully there 
okay, and I remember this as one of the issues that we 
fought about in this matter. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   You and Ms Ngoye? 
MR MONTANA:   No I’m referring to the – Me, Ms Ngoye 
and all the people that we describe here – that she 
describes in her affidavit. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, is it – okay, so that was the 
difference that you wanted a more aggressive stance to 
10 
opposing the application by Primedia as opposed to what 
Hogan Lovell’s and Ms Ngoye was? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, my view was very clear those who 
lost the tender and who were being dominating this 
portfolio for how many years, I think – for years, must be 
thrown out of the portfolio and I think somewhere Ms 
Ngoye says, Mr Montana, says we didn’t follow his 
instructions but she does in that paragraph – I’m answering 
your question that – I want to clarify this thing, Chair, Ms 
Ngoye links it to – she links it to Strawberry, whereas the 
20 
instruction that we’re talking about was that there must be 
– there must be an order where these entities are actually 
thrown out of the PRASA portfolio, and I remember that 
time both Intersite and the law firm, I didn’t remember their 
name…[intervenes]. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 192 of 371 
 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Hogan Lovell. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, I think that they were not in favour of 
that approach and I was unhappy with that but that was not 
only the reason Chair, I think that there were a couple of 
reasons in this thing. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But do you say that, that difference 
between you and Ms Ngoye was not the reason for what 
the removal of the file? 
MR MONTANA:   Ms Ngoye and I, even with the differences 
that we had, we -  I wouldn’t describe at that time, that our 
10 
relationship had collapsed where I’d do that, and I was the 
Chairman of the Board and she had presented reports to 
the Board and I think that, in fact, to confirm what I’m 
saying an assessment of the minutes or the Board of 
Intersite 
where 
she 
was 
CEO, 
you 
actually 
see…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were civil to each other? 
MR MONTANA:   We were civil, but I was supporting her, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MONTANA:   I was supporting her throughout.   It’s not 
like we differ on this issue, she’s saying, we differ on this 
issue because for her, as I said, 15.17 I’m saying that no, 
there’s much more dynamic environment, there were other 
issues involved, let’s deal with the issues for what they are 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 193 of 371 
 
and not trying to fit them into what I call, Isando’s Inferno, 
which is actually playing itself out there. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Why then remove the files, why don’t 
you just instruct her, I’m telling you to remove Hogan 
Lovell and if you don’t obey that instruction it’s going to 
constitute insubordination? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes I could have dealt with it in that way 
Chair, but again I am saying she also agrees with me that I 
said I have never instructed for any person to be removed 
Chair, there were wars between these people Chair, you 
10 
can even see how she described Ms Naidoo in these 
pages, so it is people who are at war with each other 
...[indistinct], no, no, no they should have – they are acting 
with the authority of the Group CEO and when she called 
me I said no, that is not the case.   Indeed Chair one of the 
reports, and I will check, I think I may still have it that way, 
when I was given a report from the Legal Advisor, it is 
called Litigation Matter, it deals with a whole range of 
issues there and ...[indistinct] and evaluate for me the 
litigation strategy that PRASA is following to respond to 
20 
particular matters and I don’t think Chair that there are 
probably a couple of this – of these matters Chair and she 
would also for example trace even cases that are before 
courts involving PRASA, so I don’t think Chair that’s what I 
had intended.    
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 194 of 371 
 
 
Yes, it was an option but I then at that time come to 
that determination as it were, and Ms – by the way the late 
Ms Zindi when she assumed her position Chair she was 
running and she of course had said that – and again she is 
not here Chair to speak for herself, but she had spoken 
about her own difficulties in dealing with some of the 
things that were there, even the Public Affairs portfolio was 
a relatively new position Chair.  
 
We had also created a new Chief Strategy Officer to 
accommodate 
a 
couple 
of 
these, 
so 
this 
was 
an 
10 
organisation that was evolving and yes people were – may 
have been unhappy about some of the decisions but you 
can’t then put it and say 15.17, that’s my main objection 
there and I am not saying everything that Ms Ngoye is 
saying is false, I am saying that what she does she creates 
a motive and she wants to fit and try to say Montana his 
part was working for this, so he is vested in this thing 
because of that, and I am saying that is – that I cannot 
agree with her Chair.  That is basically what I am saying. 
ADV VAS SONI:   May I ask you why didn’t you when she 
20 
raised it with you, Ms Ngoye, that this is – this was 
removed, these files were removed, you say you didn’t 
order the removal, why didn’t you ask Ms Naidoo to return 
the files to Intersite? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair I think this speaks to even a bigger 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 195 of 371 
 
issue about the relationship between Mr Chaukin and her 
boss, not Ms Ngoye, but Hinde, and I can tell you Chair we 
need to check with the PRASA probably in their own – what 
do you call it, employee information is then why she was 
suspended.  She says she was suspended for the reasons 
that – that are stated there which I then rejected Chair 
earlier. 
 
So yes I do not think we took a decision to – for 
those parts.  We spoke about it I just said we did not – we 
ended up there but I think that they continued Chair in their 
10 
own way what was happening there. 
 
Was it in the interest of the business?  No but I think 
Chair people in the – you have the kind of dynamics where 
people undermine each other, fight over things around that 
but it was never an instruction from me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Soni’s question is here you find that 
according to Ms Ngoye files that should be at Intersite have 
been removed and she was told according to her that the 
instruction came from you and you know that that was not 
true, you never gave such an instruction.   Mr Soni’s 
20 
question is the most logical thing is for you to say Ms Naidoo 
those files must be taken back why did you not say that?  
That is what the question is. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I explained earlier on so let us bring 
back what I said.  I hear Mr Soni’s thing but two things here.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 196 of 371 
 
The first issue is that a fact Ms Naidoo never removed the 
file.  Even that her own version – in my own version when 
she spoke to me Ms Ngoye she said Mazinda removed her 
file supported by or accompanied by Ms Zinde – Ms Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Naidoo. 
MR MONTANA:  Ms Naidoo okay.  Then there was a 
discussion Chair a separate discussion with Ms Zide – Zinde 
where she said she is trying to get what is called her own 
hold on the specific matters that she had deal with but 
00:02:01 what is called on the – as a head of public – public 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Relations. 
MR MONTANA:  Public Affairs and that Ms Muckend [?] was 
being transferred to him who was responsible for some of 
those activities was actually not cooperating with him.  That 
was the explanation and that is why Chair the reason why I 
ask for the letter is because I am trying to verify exactly how 
that process in fact – what was the reason why Mr Chauke 
was actually suspended – what was stated in there?  
Because that will – that will actually Chair enable us to 
answer Mr Soni’s question Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure that I follow. Ms Ngoye calls 
you and says certain files which belonged at Intersite was 
removed and she says they were removed by Ms Naidoo and 
(inaudible).  Ms Zinde I am not sure or with Chauke. 
ADV SONI SC:  Ms Zinde. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 197 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Zinde in a manner that you agree is 
unacceptable and she says to you Ms Naidoo said it was you 
who gave instructions for the files.  You say to her that is not 
true I never gave those instructions.  You have said you 
could tell she was unhappy about this so now I am not sure 
that what you have told me in your last answer helps me to 
understand because Mr Soni is in effect saying you see your 
Intersite CEO is unhappy she feels strongly about something 
and you agree that it should not have happened.  The most 
natural thing to do is to say well those people must return 
10 
those files maybe until you are given a proper explanation or 
something but they must return them.  So the question is 
why did you not do that, say that? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I think again maybe we are – maybe I 
am starting in the middle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Let me go back slightly.  I was saying Chair 
that there was a process I said let us not complain two 
things.  Removal of the function and the removal of the fine 
and I said these two things are related but they cannot be 
20 
explained in the way she explained them. 
 
Now I think at that time when we created the position 
that Ms Zinde was responsible for Chair the decision had 
been made… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was responsible for what? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 198 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:  For Public Affairs Chair involved – it was 
mainly our media side of things.  It involved some part of 
advertising.  So it was a number of functions that we called – 
we called Public Affairs and then it also dealt with our – our 
public image and when we undertake some of the public 
campaigns like the Nelson Mandela events – so at that time 
Chair there was no dispute.  We have made a decision those 
functions were there again.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Doing affairs functions. 
MR MONTANA:  Public Affairs functions Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were with – is it Ms Zinde? 
MR MONTANA:  Ms Zinde. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  If you recall Chair I said this portfolio has 
moved a number of times at various stages she will take any 
decision around that.  Now Ms Zinde at that time… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Public Affairs did it include this advertising 
outside advertising? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair it included? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it include the outside advertising? 
20 
MR MONTANA:  It included – there were some – there were 
issues about signage, there were issues about some part of 
advertising Chair, some part of the broadcasting function. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  It involved – so there were a number of 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 199 of 371 
 
functions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  I will have to verify it Chairperson.  So that 
decision has been made.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And I think that was one of the reasons 
why.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To move the function. 
MR MONTANA:  To move the function Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Public Affairs. 
10 
MR MONTANA:  Of – to Public Affairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To move the function of what to Public 
Affairs? 
MR MONTANA:  Part of that advertising and media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MONTANA:  And remember… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which had been – which had been sitting 
at Intersite? 
MR MONTANA:  At Intersite Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, alright. 
20 
MR MONTANA:  At Intersite.  That is a separate – it has 
been made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MONTANA:  So the new incumbent at that time says I am 
having difficulties with this. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 200 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Zinde? 
MR MONTANA:  Ms Zinde. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  And Chair that is why I apologise that she is 
not here to speak for herself.  She says here is a chair who 
is not cooperating with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Referring to who? 
MR MONTANA:  Mr Chauke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Who is now reporting to her but who insists 
10 
on working with – on the other side with Intersite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With Ms Ngoye? 
MR MONTANA:  With Ms Ngoye.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Okay.  And that decision Chair – so it was 
not about we are not moving functions to Ms Zinde so there 
is a transition there.  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you mean you were not moving files 
you were moving a function. 
MR MONTANA:  We are moving a function Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Now that function when it moved she then 
said – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is she now? 
MR MONTANA:  Ms Zinde. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 201 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  She is saying that Mr Chauke is not 
cooperating which resulted in her taking the step that she 
did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is? 
MR MONTANA:  Which is to go and collect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take the files. 
MR MONTANA:  Because she says Mr Chauke is not 
cooperating with me is not – he is supposed to report to me 
but he is not working with me and then went to the office to 
10 
collect the files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so she seeks to solve the problem of 
Mr Chauke’s cooperation by taking the files? 
MR MONTANA:  By taking the files indeed Chair that is why I 
said I did not support.  So I would not then resolve that issue 
in that way.  Ms Ngoye was not raising the issue about 
function at that time.  She was saying the manner of this 
thing was bad even though she had her own views about 
these functions but had taken a decision as a collective.  So 
when the files were taken she says these people they just 
20 
come barge into the office and said – and then she says 
when Ms Zinde was doing that she was supported by Ms 
Naidoo.  Ms – and I confirmed Chair Ms Naidoo never 
collected any files there from Intersite and in – in the later 
discussions and that is why I say I want to see the letter and 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 202 of 371 
 
part of the letter say it will explain precisely  and I think Mr 
Chauke should still have the letter – precisely the reason 
why Ms Zinde support – sus – wanted her suspended or 
suspended her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you think there is a possibility 
that she suspended Ms – Mr Chauke because of his failure 
to cooperate with her in relation to these… 
MR MONTANA:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To this function. 
MR MONTANA:  Indeed Chair but I am saying those issues 
10 
are conflated in this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  That is the point I am making Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but now then I shift Mr Soni’s 
question from – from Ms Naidoo then I say why did you not 
ask her Ms Zinde to take the files back? 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I would not ask her to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MONTANA:  Because I – I would not ask – I would 
criticise – I would criticise and say no, no but that is not how 
20 
we should be doing – we should be managing the transition 
when you deal with our functions.  But I would not say return 
the function because if they were doing something about the 
function that was not there then that was a completely 
different matter Chair. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 203 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the story that – I mean what you have 
told me suggest to me that it may not have been necessary 
at least in that stage to change files if only Mr Chauke was 
cooperating with Ms Zinde.  It was because Ms Zinde seems 
to have sought to solve one problem by creating another 
problem in a sense that she had a problem with Mr Chauke 
not cooperating and then she thought well if I take the file 
from Intersite then he will cooperate.  And maybe she did 
succeed maybe she did not succeed. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair that was the complaint by Ms Ngoye I 
10 
agree but you would not solve by then say return the file.  
That is why the discussion and my thing that the nature 
where we are going to get the right answer about whose is 
telling the truth the answer would be in the reasons provided 
by Ms Zinde to suspend Mr Chauke. Because – and secondly 
you will recall Chair what Ms – what Ms Ngoye says is that 
the instruction to suspend Mr Chauke comes from Mr 
Montana and she says that the letter was delivered by Ms 
Zinde and Mr – Ms Naidoo.  So she is saying that Chair.  I 
suspended Mr Chauke and if I did Chair that in itself would 
20 
have been irregular because a senior manager will not be 
suspended by a Group CEO Chair.  He is suspended or 
disciplined by the immediate supervisor as it was – so I do 
not think Chair that the right approach would have been say 
to return them back when they were transitioning. So the key 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 204 of 371 
 
thing was managing whatever changes that were taking 
place at (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why would not – why would that not be 
the right thing to do because you are agree what has been 
done is wrong.  The CEO of Intersite feels very strongly 
about it.  What would be wrong with saying Ms Zinde the way 
you have gone about this is unacceptable.  The files must go 
back.  If there needs to be a discussion then there can be a 
discussion.  It may well be that later on they can be taken 
but then they must be taken in the right way but let us – let 
10 
us right this wrong.  It was not the right way.   
MR MONTANA:  Chair the discussions about that had taken 
place subsequently but I am simply saying that – that the 
answer about files and maybe Chair – maybe to with 
hindsight when you say you want to – to what is it called – 
remove or reduce a tension and unhappiness maybe that 
would have been a right way but would it have been symbolic 
to say oh I am taking serious my concerns are being in the 
interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I – I accept that in a situation like 
20 
that it may be that somebody who is supposed to resolve the 
matter might decide look in the end the files were going to 
end up there. 
MR MONTANA:  There indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe there is no point in saying they 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 205 of 371 
 
must go back but the manner in which they were taken is 
unacceptable.  Let us address the unhappiness that is 
associated with the manner in which they taken.  Assuming 
for example that Ms Ngoye might not have had an in 
principle objection to the files going but she might just have 
had an objection to the manner in which this was done. 
MR MONTANA:  No she did Chair I think it was in the 
manner in which it was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  And that is what she conveyed to me that 
10 
people just arrive and enter then say we are coming to take 
the documents.  And she says is this how we work Chair?  
Yes we have taken a decision but is that how we are going to 
do it Chair?  Of course at that time Chair I did not think we 
should return there were engagements around those issues 
on how we dealt with the – with the function but Chair I think 
the answer to our question lies in this letter of suspension 
and that is why I think it would be better if we get it.  So I 
would want to suggest to park it.  I am given that when I 
come back for my testimony I deal specifically having seen 
20 
the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR MONTANA:  If it was signed by me I will say Chair it was 
irregular.  If it was signed by Ms Zinde and the reasons for 
that Chair we do not discuss it on that basis Chair. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 206 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Soni I took over your question. 
ADV SONI SC:  No, no I was going to go in a similar 
direction though not as well as you did it Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay 
ADV SONI SC:  Mr Montana I am not going to deprive you of 
the opportunity of revisiting this issue and I know it is – I do 
not mean it – say that you – you doing it to avoid it you 
doing it because you want the facts in front of you relating to 
a letter.  But I have a related question and it is this.  The 
contract that is signed is between PRASA – I mean between 
10 
Intersite and Umjanji okay. 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair there are two contracts there.  The 
first contract is – it was initially signed between PRASA and 
Umjunji 00:15:56.  The second contract is when Umjanji 
applies to PRASA for the ceding of part of that function 
which is – which is then – which is the outdoor – specific 
outdoor function.  Okay.  And therefore that was between 
Intersite and Strawberry. 
ADV SONI SC:  Right okay.  Now where was Ms Zinde based 
at the time – around the time of this? 
20 
MR MONTANA:  At the – at the – she was based at the 
PRASA Corporate office. 
ADV SONI SC:  So the function was now moved to PRASA. 
MR MONTANA:  The PRASA – the function – no Chair the 
function that funds the full advertising function Chair was 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 207 of 371 
 
initially at PRASA Corporate.  And when the tender was 
agreed Chair was done I think it was in 2011 it then was then 
placed with Intersite and then later on if you recall Chair I 
spoke to the function moving a couple of times to be – and 
then it was – it was when the new portfolio was created to 
say you must manage part of that advertising portfolio more 
specifically – and in fact I think the advertising work – 
advertising is one part of a bigger portfolio Chair that was 
there.  So I think – I think the – we then sat with the Public 
Affairs under Group Strategy which was led by Mr Holele.  
10 
Yes so Ms Zinde was the Group – was a General Manager 
reporting to Mr Holele   And I think that is when this issue 
about files Chair happened in that process. 
ADV SONI SC:  So – so on that score there can only be two 
possibilities.  One is that the files had to move because the 
function was now at PRASA not at Intersite.  That must be 
correct is it not? 
MR MONTANA:  No, no that is correct. 
ADV SONI SC:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  With the function yes. 
20 
ADV SONI SC:  Now did you tell Ms Ngoye that – that look at 
the end of the day I accept that the files were removed 
wrongly but at the end of the day they now belong to PRASA 
because the function is now with PRASA. 
MR MONTANA:  But Chair I – that is why I am saying we are 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 208 of 371 
 
also – we are confusing ourselves because the issue  - and 
that is the point I have been making throughout of the day.  
The issue of the files and the decision about the movement 
of functions did not happen at the same time that the – today 
we are making a decision and people know there has been 
an on-going process Chair and that is why we need to find 
the time that decision was made and I think you ask an 
important earlier was Ms Ngoye part of those decisions that 
were made about where this function should be kept and that 
is – I think that is a big issue around it.  It clarifies what 
10 
needs to be done Chair.  When the position was created and 
then somebody will say appointed to that position Chair then 
that is where the fight in fact happened okay.  So I think the 
– I do not think that it is actually – there are more even more 
possibilities than actually only those two.   
ADV SONI SC:  No, no Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sorry Mr Soni.  I think Mr Soni’s 
question requires that I know whether at the time of the 
removal of the files a decision to move the function from 
Intersite to PRASA had been taken or not? 
20 
MR MONTANA:  Chair it had already been taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  And that is the point.  It has already been 
taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 209 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:  And Ms Ngoye was part of that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was part of that. 
MR MONTANA:  That is why – that is the point I am making 
and that is why when Mr Soni asked the question did not the 
logical thing have been for you to say let them be returned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  For me I say but that is not the solution 
because then you are returning – let us rather manage this 
thing in a proper disciplined fashion as a company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Soni’s last question says or 
10 
suggests that because you knew that the decision to remove 
the function from Intersite to PRASA had been taken and 
because you knew that on your version Ms Ngoye knew that 
as well. 
MR MONTANA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have expected you when Ms 
Ngoye was complaining about the removal of the files to – 
for – would expect you to say to her yes I definitely agree 
with you Ms Ngoye that the manner in which the files have 
been removed is unacceptable it is wrong but remember that 
20 
you were party to the decision.  We already made the 
decision that the function must go to PRASA.  They are 
where they are supposed to be or they are where they were 
meant to be ultimately.  So he is asking whether you – you 
raised that with her. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 210 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:  No, no Chair I do not think I did in that 
discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Maybe I took it as a matter of common 
cause but both of us know about it but that – that was a 
decision Chair that we made but the specific discussion is 
that she raise it was that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are quite clear that the decision to 
remove the function had to be made.  You are not mistaken. 
MR MONTANA:  No, no Chair it was made much earlier. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Much earlier. 
MR MONTANA:  She was part of that thing – and we have 
made not only this decision Chair we have made other 
decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other decisions. 
MR MONTANA:  Which – that is why I explained that there 
were other decisions that related to how do we split the 
portfolio for example and I am referring to the property 
portfolio between Intersite and the newly created PRASA 
00:22:27.  Okay – and they were filed Chair they were big 
20 
files 
because 
PRASA 
was 
being 
restructured 
as 
an 
organisation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the – it is one thing to make the 
decision that this function should move from Intersite to 
PRASA you make the decision today but there may be the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 211 of 371 
 
question of from when?  Had that issue been also sorted out 
by the time of the removal in terms of when the function 
would move or had it definitely move in accordance with 
this? 
MR MONTANA:  So the functions at that time were being 
performed in Public Affairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes already? 
MR MONTANA:  Already Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MONTANA:  That – that discussion and that is why I am 
10 
saying the letter that I am asking for will then help us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will clarify 
MR MONTANA:  To 00:23:20 exactly that thing – this thing 
Chair so that we do not deal with it that Ms Ngoye did not 
know – she was party to it Chair.  We have taken that 
decision.  Ms Zinde was employed as part of her duties and 
when she took that decision Chair about Mr Chauke she was 
saying that he was not cooperating -  she was not 
cooperating in that particular matter. 
MR MONTANA:  Okay alright.  Mr Soni I hope I helped to – 
20 
to have the clarification. 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes, no, no it does but what it illustrates 
Chairperson and I will say this to Mr Montana is that it 
seems if you are correct that Ms Ngoye was not being 
reasonable at all so she had no reason to be unhappy 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 212 of 371 
 
because that as a lawyer she would know it is a logical 
function but not only must the function move for logical 
conclusion but not only must the function move but the file 
must move because it is being handled now at PRASA no 
longer at Intersite.   
MR MONTANA:  But Chair Ms Ngoye was not 00:24:33 she 
was saying the manner in which… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The manner in which it was done. 
MR MONTANA:  The files were moved was unacceptable to 
her.  And I agreed with her in that – in that particular issue. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Alright I just refer you to 15.6 but we must 
leave this now because I want to get on. 
MR MONTANA:  15.6. 
ADV SONI SC:  15.16 sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  Where she is saying even the removal of the 
function was not in PRASA’s (inaudible) 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it reads: 
“The 
effect 
of 
moving 
the 
advertising 
20 
portfolio from Intersite to PRASA is that the 
management of the portfolio was not in the 
interest of.” 
I am not sure that I follow this sentence properly but she 
says the effect is that the management of the portfolio was 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 213 of 371 
 
not in the interest of PRASA and PRASA benefitted little.  If 
anything from the portfolio I – from the way she starts the 
sentence I expect her to be saying it served the interest of 
PRASA better to keep the files – the portfolio at Intersite.  It 
did not serve the interest of PRASA to better to take them to 
PRASA. 
ADV SONI SC:  To PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she uses the word management but I – 
maybe that is what she intends I am not sure. 
ADV SONI SC:  Chairperson as I understood and I have 
10 
dealt with this affidavit before but there is a vagueness 
about it.  As I understood it she is making a distinction 
between PRASA as opposed to Intersite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV SONI SC:  Now if Intersite holds the contract then all 
the benefits go to Intersite and it would do as much as 
possible to secure the full benefit whereas PRASA is not 
receiving any material benefits from the contract and 
therefore may not nurture the outcome as well as somebody 
at Intersite as – as a complete – that is how I understand it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I guess what is also true is that if this 
is the view – if she held the same view at the time then one 
would expect that she would not have gone along with the 
decision to move the function from Intersite to PRASA.  So it 
would therefore be interesting if the minutes of whatever 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 214 of 371 
 
meeting revealed differently. 
ADV SONI SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MONTANA:  Chair I fully agree with that I think you 
raised the issue earlier on in this – on this issue. And my 
view Chair I think my answer was very simple.  I think the 
key issue about this portfolio advertising portfolio had to do 
the – with the maximisation of revenue for the company for 
PRASA as a group.  So I think it is more of a – not PRASA 
Intersite but it is a group PRASA Group structure as against 
10 
Intersite and it suggest Chair that here you know if you look 
at the previous – because they not flow logically Chair.  In – 
in 15.15 she deal with the issue of the suspension of Chauke 
and then she immediately goes and make that big point and 
then conclude in 15.17.  Okay.  Now – so the issue of the 
portfolio moving and the issue of Chauke are treated 
interchangeably somehow and that is why you – it raises the 
question did she actually support the decision?  What should 
we – let us look at the – what do we call the – the EXCO 
minutes – let us look at the Intersite board meeting – 
20 
minutes they will then – as well as the letter of suspension of 
Mr Chauke.  Those documents Chair will be able to help us 
to come to a determination and say which version is more 
probable than the argument that we are having Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 215 of 371 
 
ADV SONI SC:  Just one final question on that.  Where was 
Mr Chauke based?  Was he based at Intersite or at PRASA? 
MR MONTANA:  At some stage he was based at Intersite 
Chair. 
ADV SONI SC:  No at the time of his suspension.  At the 
time of this incident. 
MR MONTANA:  He may – I think Chair because the 
transition was happening he was reporting to – he was now 
required to report to Ms Zinde but she may have been 
physically still at Intersite as part of that process. 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Would you have the power as the CEO of the 
Group CEO of PRASA would you have the power to suspend 
him although he is based at Intersite and an employee of 
Intersite? 
MR MONTANA:  No Chair I think the – unless if – if he is 
based at Intersite – no Chair it would be different – 
completely different…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Entity. 
MR MONTANA:   But let us make a distinction, sir.  You say 
if it is based at Intersite? 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   You mean in the structure it is reporting 
to the CEO of Intersite? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair it would be regular but if he 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 216 of 371 
 
is physically at Intersite but he is reporting to, let us say, 
Ms Zinde – Chair, the decision is a completely different 
one.  I cannot parachute and come into Intersite and 
suspend an employee when there is a CEO there.  It would 
be inappropriate.  But if it is part of the corporate office 
irrespective of where physically he sits, if he reports to the 
– what is it called? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Zinde. 
MR MONTANA:   Ms Zinde.  And Chair, it depends on the 
nature 
of 
the 
transgression 
because 
there 
are 
10 
transgressions that may be serious, that may be dealt with 
there at the...  This impacts on the stability, on the assets 
of the company and I take a decision on the employees.   
 
You know, Johnny Strike(?) actions.  Some of the 
decisions are made by me because at that time the 
protection of the assets of the business it sits with me.  So 
again, it depends on but to answer in short Chair.  If he is 
an employee of Intersite, I cannot suspend him Chair.  It 
will have to be the CEO of Intersite that makes that 
decision. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if she – if he was employee of 
PRASA and according to Ms Zinge(sic) ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Zinde. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...generally speaking, even if you might 
ask me to have the power in certain circumstances, you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 217 of 371 
 
suspend him – then you would not suspend him.  You will 
leave that to Ms Zinde. 
MR MONTANA:   Ms Zinde will have to do that Chair.  That 
is why I said in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   If I did – and that is why – that is the 
reason why I am asking for the letter Chair because if that 
letter says Montana signed and suspended a senior 
manager, it means Chair that I will have to say to this 
Commission I concede that I acted at that time irregularly 
10 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m.   
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But something tells me that you would 
not forget if you suspended him.  [laughs] 
MR MONTANA:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did you suspend too many? [laughs] 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I know where you are coming from.  
Indeed Chair.  But that is why I think sometimes I have 
been hammered by the Public Protector where I did not 
20 
sign but I may have said but you need to take action 
against this chap. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may have authorised? 
MR MONTANA:   I am – well, not authorising Chair, I would 
say. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 218 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I mean, I would go to Park Station. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Certain companies do not clean their 
station.  I said to the boss, act against these people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Where if indeed the Public Protector said 
that seven companies were fired by Mr Montana.  I never 
fired them.  I said today, Boards of PRASA Cres, if you do 
not act against those who do not clean the company, I am 
10 
going to act against him.  And the finding of the Public 
Protector said dismissal of those companies were done by 
Mr Montana. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   So Chair, you could have that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So that is why in this particular instance, 
the reasons that Ms Zinde – they have advanced, they 
have justified – what is it called – taking action against 
Mr Chauke. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chauke, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And she may have said this is the route 
that I take and I may have supported that route Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   But that is why I am saying I want to 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 219 of 371 
 
remind myself ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To see that, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...and see the letter before I confirm or 
reject and what and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...asking me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   We may then turn now to – I take it 
until we get those documents ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
10 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...we will deal with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   With ...[intervenes]  
ADV 
VAS 
SONI 
SC: 
 
 
...the 
paragraph, 
I 
think 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.   
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We will ventilate some of the aspects 
when we ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have gone past four.  We are at half-
past four.  But I think we need to go at least after five. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then I will have the evening session.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 220 of 371 
 
So we will have to... [laugh]  And Mr Montana, he said to 
cooperate. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes-no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...clearly he has been now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Are you going to deny that you are 
ready to cooperate, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   Not with you, Chair, except that I would 
raise the issue of opportunity because that goes with my 
testimony Chair.  I was joking with your team earlier on to 
10 
say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...people like us who are hustlers – when 
I sit in the Commission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   ...the cost ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not make money. 
MR MONTANA:   ...you do not make money Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But Chair I have committed to assist the 
20 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And to cooperate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And I think I will continue doing that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 221 of 371 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  At five 
o’clock we will just talk about when Mr Montana should 
return.  But let us continue until five. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   As you please.  Mr Montana, let me 
express our gratitude to you. 
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now paragraph 17.  We have dealt 
with some of these matters and you just tell me where you 
disagree Mr Montana.  She says: 
10 
“I first encountered Mr Montana when I joined 
Intersite as an Executive in the Office of 
Intersite’s CEO in January 2011...” 
 
Is that something ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then she says: 
“That appointment was made by Intersite’s 
Board 
of 
which 
Mr 
Montana 
was 
the 
Chairperson...” 
 
That is correct? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   She says: 
“Nine 
months 
later, 
on 
the 
1 s t  of September 2011, the board still chaired 
by Mr Montana appointed me as Intersite’s 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 222 of 371 
 
CEO...” 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And then she says: 
“I was transferred to PRASA with effect from 
the 1 s t of September 2014...” 
 
Now Mr Montana, you have – and I – because I 
just want us to close that gap.  As I understand it.  You say 
it was effectively a forced transfer because the board was 
unhappy with her or she was unhappy that she was being 
removed as a CEO of one of the subsidiaries and made – 
10 
although she as an Executive – she was unhappy.  Does 
that capture ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair she was unhappy Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
“Just three months later, Mr Montana asked me 
to act in his position...” 
 
Well, you have confirmed this but let me just 
finish it. 
“...for two months in December 2014 and 
2015...” 
20 
 
That is correct... 
MR MONTANA:   Well, the total days, Chair, I think it was 
about 28-days but of course it was during the month of 
December and January.  It was not the two full months. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Oh, yes.  I understand. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 223 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it was 28-days? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...which straddled. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja, it straddled.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   It was in mid – mid – late December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   And then I think I went around the 22 n d of 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of January. 
MR MONTANA:   ...of January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   She says: 
“These 
are 
periods 
for 
the 
long-distance 
business of PRASA...” 
 
Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   And she says: 
“...Mainline 
Customer 
Services 
and 
Ultra-
20 
Packs(?) and it was at the time when the board 
was considering a very important tender for 
the construction of the biggest depot for 
PRASA...” 
 
Is that something you recall? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 224 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I recall that very well because in 
November the board had dealt with the Braamfontein but I 
were to learn, of course, later – the answer is yes, Chair – 
that on the 23 r d of December, the board met to discuss this 
issue again but I was on leave at that time.  So it is 
correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
“On 
his 
return, 
Mr 
Montana 
thanked 
me 
personally at the Group Exco Meeting for the 
hard work and having held the fort for him...” 
10 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   ...  You are fully in synced with each 
other. 
MR MONTANA:   No, that confirm what the kind of man I 
am Chair.  And I think that is one of the major findings that 
a Chair...  [laughs] 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Alright.  Then she says: 
“On the 18 t h(?) of May...” 
 
Now we have dealt with this issue to a large 
extent yesterday and we can, you know, without avoiding 
20 
any issues, this is the day on which you sent the email – I 
mean – yes, the email.  You remember this?  This was in 
Mr Dingiswayo ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Dingiswayo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 225 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   That was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the email about the campaign? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The email about the campaign? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Please have a look at it Mr Montana. 
MR MONTANA:   Ja-no, Chair I confirm but this was a 
different matter.  The email was on the 18 t h of April but the 
same – the matter is the same – it is almost the same 
matter Chair.  I agree with Mr Soni. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now please have a look at page 317. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, I see 317, 316 and 318. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the same email that we looked at 
yesterday in the context of Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit where 
you were talking about other people who you said were on 
the campaign.   
MR MONTANA:   But I remember the email, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   So what I am saying is, it is the 
18 t h of May, not April. 
MR MONTANA:   Not April.  Okay. 
20 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   But let us have it – well, I mean, I do 
not want to deal with it anymore but I just want to say that 
it is the same email and I would just like you to be 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 226 of 371 
 
comfortable with it that that is the email we are talking 
about. 
MR MONTANA:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Now, it says the contents are self-
explanatory.  And can I just – well, let us just finish this 
part: 
“...because the email was sent after the legal 
function of PRASA through Mr Dingiswayo and 
me had indicated that we were not in a 
position to deal with the Swifambo contract 
10 
which 
required 
some 
amendments 
to 
be 
effected to the main agreement that was 
already in place...” 
 
Is that correct? 
MR MONTANA:   Unfortunately, I think, in fact, yesterday – 
Mr Dingiswayo says in his affidavit that the reason why I 
took action, he says it was because I was defending 
Prodigy.  In this paragraph it is now saying it has to do 
with Swifambo. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes.  But she comes to that issue in 
20 
a moment but you say this had nothing to do with their 
refusal to be involved in the amendment to the Swifambo 
contract which would extent the price of the contract from 
R 3,5 billion to R 5 billion.  She said this had nothing to do 
with it. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 227 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  Chair, I think – look, I feel 
that Ms Ngoye is confusing things, okay?  The – and this 
thing about him not having – as a legal function that it had 
questions on the principle transaction through which...  It 
is – Chair, it is just – I think it is just a lie Chair.  You will 
recall that I said that Ms Ngoye was part of this process, 
part of the Bid Adjudication Committee that recommended 
this thing to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you said that. 
MR MONTANA:   I said that Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Now the issue of the 3.5 and you will see 
again in my – and let me explain about this thing – it is in 
my annexure.  In 2014 Chair – not – May 2014 with the 
board under Mr Sfiso Buthelezi ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Under Mr Buthelezi? 
MR MONTANA:   Mr Buthelezi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Not mister – this is 2014, not 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  The first part of 2014? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Of 2014 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   Just before the new PRASA Board of 
Mr Molefe was appointed.  We went to the board because 
we were dealing with the Euro rate exchange.  And Chair, I 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 228 of 371 
 
think the supporting documents are provided there.  Then 
we took a decision as the board that the contract is 3.5 but 
it is very important to renegotiate some parts of that 
contract and pass the risk – we should remember the risk.  
The risk of – the exchange rate risk was fitting with 
PRASA.   
 
So we wanted to pass that to Swifambo but that 
was on 201.  And I think the documents are very clear.  It 
was in – that decision was made by the board and the 
board further said:  Guys, with all these fluctuations whilst 
10 
things are happening, we do not want this contract to shoot 
off the roof.  So it is going – you need to practise so that it 
does not exceed R 5 billion.  So it does not say increase 
the contract to five billion.   
 
We said tried to do that but manage this thing in 
such a way when the – at that time, I think, the Rand had 
lost about almost 40% of its value to the Euro.  So for the 
same amount of money we could buy only fewer trains 
Chair.  So that is what happened.  Now I am saying, 
Ms Ngoye is confusing this thing.   
20 
 
It was in 2015, May 2015.  It was the board of Mr 
Molefe.  Mr Molefe and the new board were appointed on 
the 1 s t of August 2014.  So we discussed that matter three 
months earlier.  And let me say Chair that – let me say that 
at that time she was not in that same position.  She was in 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 229 of 371 
 
at Intersite as things stood because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now which time is that?  Is that three 
months before Mr Molefe’s board came or ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Yes.  And you will recall she was only 
transferred – Ms Ngoye was transferred, I think, in 
September 2014. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   2014, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Okay?   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the discussion that you are talking 
about would have happened about May ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   So it is recorded Chair.  The documents, 
the evidence is there to support that.  So it would not have 
been the reason.  The Swifambo matter would not have 
been the reason at this time because there was a new 
board and we knew that the board of Mr Molefe, when he 
comes to this issue, had even take a more ... approach.   
20 
 
And 
later, 
I 
think 
from 
December 
– 
from 
December or rather in 2015.  And these reasons, Chair, 
that she is saying that we were not prepared to do that 
because we were worried about the principle and we did 
not get the ... responses Chair.  I thought Ms Ngoye was 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 230 of 371 
 
going to say Annexure MN-10 or whatever contained a 
document that was sent to the ...  This – Chair, this is 
created – she is actually creating a reason Chair and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So part of what you are saying is that 
she says and they sent on the – well, they or you sent your 
email that we have referred to on the 18 t h of May 2015 
where you talk about the campaign, okay? 
MR MONTANA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she is saying that email was 
10 
sent – you sent it – that email after the legal function of 
PRASA, I guess that is the Legal Department, through 
Mr Dingiswayo and her, had indicated that you when they 
were not in a position to deal with the Swifambo contract 
which required some amendments to be effect, the main 
agreement that was already in place.   
 
So what you are saying is.  The – your email to – 
about the campaign could not have been prompted – could 
not have been prompted by their refusal, if there was a 
refusal, to deal with the Swifambo contract because they 
20 
are talking about May 2015 but this was during Mr Pop 
Molefe’s board ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   In 2015.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in 2015.  And you say the two do not 
go together. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 231 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   Even in terms of the timelines there is no 
correlation.  So Chair, it tells you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...that the reason she is advancing, she is 
actually 
advancing 
a 
reason 
which 
she 
had 
created 
thereafter and this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   ...and this social(?) deed(?) you must 
look 
at 
Mr 
Dingiswayo’s 
thing. 
 
He 
said 
me 
and 
Mr Dingiswayo.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Mr Dingiswayo is saying a different thing.  
He does not talk about Swifambo.  And if – even if the two 
of them were to – were in agreement that this – it is about 
Swifambo, I will say Chair it is false because at that time 
in May we never discussed – unless if she wants to be 
blinded and put it for what it is Chair.  But at that time, she 
says we did not get satisfactory responses.  You know what 
that suggests to me Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   That I said – it confirms my email, in fact.  
For me it brings to my email that there is now this 
campaign.  Mr Dell(?) said to the Commission they have 
identified contracts.  When I came in January, a call from 
Cape Town, a meeting with the chairman and sorting out 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 232 of 371 
 
the ANC’s transport plans, they were investigating.  So 
Chair, this has nothing to do with what she is saying here. 
 
In fact, for me, if I were to provide the list of the 
companies to be investigated, it suggests to me that 
actually she is trying to go around that because this issue 
was not there in 2015 unless if there was an investigation 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   While you were there as Group CEO, to 
your recollection, was there a time when the Legal 
Department refused to deal with the Swifambo contract? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Did not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...according to ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
[Speakers intervening each other – unclear] 
MR MONTANA:   And I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But they did refuse to deal with other 
contracts, certain other contracts that you know of? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, that is why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MR MONTANA:   ...that is why I wrote and that is why I 
called by even Mr Dingiswayo’ version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 233 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   When I request him to come to my office 
that:  No, you are now working against the business.  And I 
said the reason why he acted in that way is because he(?) 
was part of this broader campaign. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Now his ... Chair – I do not think she had 
intended to say that, okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   And she tried to find a reason that did not 
exist and she brought the Swifambo. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And nothing(?) is false Chair.  It is false, 
it is misleading the Commission.  It is not the truth, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Now I do remember that you did 
say yesterday that there were certain contracts that they 
identified and you talked about them being inconsistent in 
their approach.  Some contracts maybe could be having the 
same perceived problem or alleged problem but one gets 
investigated, another one does not get investigated and 
that it is part of what you had a problem with ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in their approach.  But – you are 
saying that – but you are also saying that there was a time 
when there was a decision in terms of which the board said 
we do not want to find after some time that the costs 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 234 of 371 
 
relating to this Swifambo contract had a short out(?).  They 
must be kept and that is where the issue of five billion was 
mentioned. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   That was in May ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   ...2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that would have been the Board of 
PRASA? 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Ms Ngoye would not have taken part 
in that one? 
MR MONTANA:   She was still the CEO of Intersite, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But I thought earlier on you said 
she would have been part of that discussion about five 
billion or something. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   She would not? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair.  Maybe I mixed up a number 
20 
of things in one – in my explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   I am saying, where she says we did not 
understand the principle.  We had several questions on the 
principle transaction. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 235 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   I am saying Ms Ngoye was part of the Bid 
Adjudication Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   So if the legal function, which was 
reporting to her raises questions - she writes here that I 
did not have.  So she is telling us Chair that she was part 
of the Bid Adjudication Committee that recommended 
something she did not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   Maybe that is why she is fighting it, she 
realised:  Oh, my God.  What have I been party to?  What 
have I done?  But this cannot be the reason Chair that she 
starts dancing here because this happened a year earlier 
in May 2014.  She was still at Intersite by that time.  She 
would not have been part of that discussion.  And my 
evidence, Chair, that I will submit will provide even the 
memorandum that was prepared by one Mr Siphiwe(?) 
Matyobeni(?).  It shows the movement of the Rand in 
relation to the Euro.  And the huge risk that we were facing 
20 
as PRASA at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  What is that you say happened in 
2014? 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, in 2014 there was a board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, about this ...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 236 of 371 
 
MR MONTANA:   The Rand/Euro exchange. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, capping the ...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   And the board said, number, one, go and 
renegotiate some parts of this contract ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   Because if the Rand, the value of the 
Rand continues to deteriorate, we are going to be in a big 
problem because the amount can shoot beyond.  So they 
say, continue doing that but cap this thing so that it does 
not even exceed R 5 billion.  They were not saying 
10 
increase it to R 5 billion.  They said go and negotiate.  But 
they do not want – when he comes back to us and say the 
Rand/Euro has changed to such an extent that this is 
R 10 billion, as an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   So that is what was happening.  You 
remember Chair, there is a formulation in the contract 
where if the Rand is at a particular level, we sit with the 
risk but if it goes – I think there is an entry and exit level.   
 
So the exit level, Chair - the material conditions 
20 
have change so much and that is why we had to discuss it 
in May.  So we are not changing the contract but we 
wanted to make sure that we still get under the new 
economy conditions or market conditions, we still get the 
same value for money that we have intended.  So that was 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 237 of 371 
 
the discussion in May 2014 about the Swifambo contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then to complete the point.  
Did the Legal Department and in particular Ms Ngoye and 
Mr Dingiswayo get involved in the negotiations which were 
– which would have been pursued following that decision 
by the board and did they refuse to do anything in regard 
to that? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you recall. 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair the – you remember when the 
10 
contract was done – it was signed in 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
MONTANA: 
 
 
Ms 
Ngoye 
was 
part 
of 
the 
Bid 
Adjudication Committee ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   ...that recommended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But in terms of our SCM policy and the 
composition of the committees, it requires of course that – 
consider these bids – what is it called – the - your finance 
20 
and legal...  It is actually pro – it specifies that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   So I would not know, for example, who at 
the time.  Ms Ngoye was sitting, not even coming from the 
Legal Department...  Because she was appointed even 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 238 of 371 
 
though she was at Intersite.  And I think she may have 
been even appointed before she was CEO, when she was 
the Head of the CEO’s Office at Intersite.   
 
Because this Adjudication Committee was for the 
entire group.  It involved a number of people who were at 
that level.  So Chair, somebody from legal could have been 
involved in the – both in the adjudication process but I 
would not know, as I sit here, who it was at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  What I am trying to establish is, 
whether she might have made a mistake by dealing with an 
10 
issue, namely their refusal to deal with the Swifambo 
contract.  She may have made a mistake by saying that 
issue – their refusal happened in 2015 when maybe it 
happened in 2014 if the discussion that you are talking 
about happened in 2014. So I was trying to see whether 
...[intervenes]  
MR MONTANA:   Chair – no, Chair.  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MONTANA:   Let me be honest – let me be direct on 
this issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   There was no confusion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MONTANA:   There is no confusion when I am the CEO 
of a subsidiary.  I am not at PRASA, okay?  There is no 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 239 of 371 
 
confusion that the new Board of PRASA did not discuss - 
and where the Board of PRASA even in 2015, Chair, in 
2015 discussed the Swifambo contract, that was done by 
me at the board and we were not asking for money or 
changes to the contract because the new board had asked 
to discuss the Swifambo contract in light of what was being 
reported in the media.   
 
And I went there.  I took the CEO of the Rail 
Division and I took some of our own engineers, Chair, and 
that is the day we had quite a lot of – even fights about 
10 
this particular contract.  This one, Chair, does not relate to 
any of that.  Martha was not – Martha was not part of – or 
was not at PRASA Corporate office.  She was still at the 
Intersite – she was an Intersite CEO.   
 
But Martha knew about this particular contract 
because she was a member of the Bid Adjudication 
Committee that recommended it to the board.  And I am 
saying the reason she is advancing, Chair, where she says 
I sent this particular email because of the Swifambo 
matter.   
20 
 
I want to argue that with all the facts considered 
that it is actually false.  It is a misrepresentation.  It was 
not – it cannot be a mistake Chair.  I know that you want to 
give her the benefit of the doubt but all circumstances 
show Chair that she lied.  And if she says in this affidavit 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 240 of 371 
 
that me and she - through Mr Fani Dingiswayo and me had 
indicated that we are not in a position to deal with the 
Swifambo contract which – no, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes-no, but the reason why I am 
asking is simply to make sure that I understand it from your 
point of view.  You are saying, this cannot be a situation of 
her being mistaken or taking something that happened in 
2014, thinking it happened in 2015.  You say she did this 
deliberately.  She knows the two have no connection.  Or 
whether there is room that she might have ...[indistinct] as 
10 
to when what happened, but you are saying there is no – 
as far as you are concerned, there is no room for her to 
have made a mistake?  She …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, in the earlier one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   In the earlier one where we were 
discussing advertising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   You recall I said this may have happened 
but she is confusing the – that I accept. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   In this particular one, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not confusion. 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, it is not correct and in fact if she 
meant what she had written here, Chair, one of the things 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 241 of 371 
 
she would have said, I annexure and email here to support 
what I am saying.  Who did she raise this thing with, 
Chair?  And can you see it is coming out that we were not 
prepared.  We had asked questions, several questions on 
the principal transaction to which no satisfactory response 
were provided.  Who did she ask, Chair?  Because now it is 
a general statement.  Did they ask Lucky Montana?  
Because, Chair, all she found was, Chair, I do not – and I 
think Mr Soni knows, I actually believe that the court 
judgment is even wrong on this issue, but that is not the 
10 
point here. 
 
They never asked me, Chair, they never sought my 
guidance. 
 
I 
am 
saying, 
Chair, 
the 
only 
probable 
explanation is that they were dealing with Swifambo as 
part of their list of contracts that they have now identified 
which led to me writing this particular email on the 18 May, 
Chair.  But that is the only explanation, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and I see that in the sentence you 
had written there she does not say with whom they raised 
those questions.  I think that is one of the points you 
20 
make. 
MR MONTANA:   Indeed, Chari, because if …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess because if she said they raised 
them with you, you would then be able to say yes, they did 
or no, they did not, and she does not say they raised them 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 242 of 371 
 
with Ms Zinde or whoever, she just says they raised 
questions. 
MR MONTANA:   Exactly, Chair, and if let us assume that 
the teams who were dealing with this matter will not be in a 
position to answer, Chair, the most logical thing would be 
to say hey, we think there is a risk, there is a big contract 
for the business, we want to elevate this thing to the Group 
CEO to deal with that. 
 
Chair, the intention of this entire paragraph is 
actually for Ms Ngoye to dissociate herself from the 
10 
Swifambo contract so that she can put it as if it is other 
people who did something wrong.  So she is projecting 
herself, I am this hero, I asked questions. 
 
Now this contract was recommended by Ms Ngoye, 
Tiro 
Holele 
and 
his 
adjudication 
committee, 
not 
for 
approval by Mr Montana but by the board of PRASA.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So when it is said that this contract was 
irregular, was unlawful, you would say the people who 
recommended that it be granted must share whatever 
blame in relation to that, if that is the position? 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, you seem to have read my 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I read your affidavit last year. 
MR MONTANA:   Last year, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I told you that on Friday, I read it 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 243 of 371 
 
but I cannot remember everything but I think …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair, the reason why I am saying 
that, Chair, is because PRASA under Mr Nathi Khena who 
was the Acting Group CEO after I had left PRASA, when 
they were busy doing this investigation they started 
creating new grounds of why they should challenge the 
Swifambo contract.  These were not, as I said, Chair, they 
were never raised by the Bid Adjudication Committee either 
to me or to the board that approved this thing.  They 
started coming new things, oh there was no proper 
10 
agreement between Swifambo and Vossloh.  They created 
– all of those are created, Chair.  I detailed them there. 
 
But the most important thing and here is the issue, 
Chair, Mr Nathi Khena prepared …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not go too far from the mic. 
MR MONTANA:   Mr Nathi Khena, the Acting CEO of 
PRASA who was appointed by the board to act there 
immediately after I have left, issues letters to all members 
of the Bid Adjudication Committee and the Bid Evaluation 
Committee and the Bid Adjudication Committee and asked 
20 
them please write to me and explain why I should not take 
action if those reasons are true.  You know what happened, 
Chair?   
Nathi gave an email written by Mrs Erasmus of Mr 
Bernard Hotz and saying taking action and saying taking 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 244 of 371 
 
action against these people.  So these are corruption 
busters, nè?  People who have been brought to fight to 
fight corruption, the tendency of PRASA, that something 
that violates the law, the violates the PFMA, if those 
reasons are true.   
 
You 
cannot 
take 
that, 
Chair, 
because 
it 
will 
undermine our strategy when we fight this [indistinct] and 
the reason why PRASA did not act against people like Tiro 
Holele, it is because it was an intervention of Werksmans 
[indistinct – dropping voice].  The same Werksmans, Chair, 
10 
that chases other people on other irregular contracts, as it 
were. 
 
So I am saying that if we look at 19, Chair, this was 
an afterthought, it is manufactured to drive – for Ms Ngoye 
to dissociate herself, Chair, from the Swifambo contract 
and she is an integral part of it, Chair, and she must take 
ownership for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you referred to two people. I think 
they may be from Werksmans that you say wrote and said 
action should not be taken against …[intervenes] 
20 
MR MONTANA:   Against all those people, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All those people, which included Ms 
Ngoye? 
MR MONTANA:   That included Ms Ngoye because already 
Ms Ngoye, Mr Holele and others had already received 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 245 of 371 
 
letters from Mr Khena. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   And Mr Bernard Hotz instructs – I think it 
is his PA to say no, no, no, send this email, so I think it is 
dictated to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is an attorney from Werksmans? 
MR MONTANA:   From Werksmans, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But on whose instructions would he have 
been writing to do that?  To issue those instructions to say 
do not – I mean, how PRASA or the Acting CEO disciplines 
10 
its employees, that is an internal matter. 
MR MONTANA:   Chair, I provide this Commission with an 
annexure.  So this I am saying, Chair, that these people 
are so truthful to this Commission, they are truly corruption 
busters, they tell us who they are.  The first thing, Chair, 
they will apply the same rule to themselves.  So it is quite 
clear that – and I think when Werksmans – that is why I 
said I welcome the opportunity to be cross-examined by 
Werksmans because I am going to read to their counsel 
this email and ask exactly the question, Chair.  Somebody 
20 
lobbied and because their own people, Chair, people like 
Dingiswayo or people like Martha, Holele are part of this 
group they felt oh, we cannot discipline here.   
Yet they were running a massive campaign at 
PRASA to discipline people for even things that are not 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 246 of 371 
 
even material and threw them out, Chair.  It is part of the 
list of contracts they were investigating and I think Ms 
Ngoye, she let - with this paragraph, Chair, for me and 
when I bring senior counsel to cross-examine, there will 
never be any other explanation, Chair.  She let the cat out 
of the bag.  When you look at the time, Chair, you ask an 
important question, the contract had already been in place 
and I think it was negotiated in 2012, it was signed in 2013 
and this is 2015, Chair. 
So this is – it has nothing to do with Swifambo, it 
10 
has nothing to do with Prodigy, it had to do with the fact 
that they were implementing a mandate, they had this 
particular thing.  But, for me, when I saw this email given 
to me by even Werksmans’ own employees and say look at 
what our company is doing.  Chair, I provided a lot and you 
asked the question, I did not obtain anything unlawfully but 
I want to salute those many employees at Werksmans who 
work for this company but who were unhappy, we have 
seen there are many wrong things that they are doing.  
This is one of them, Chair.   
20 
So Werksmans, Chair, they are telling us about the 
irregular appointment of other people, but not theirs, Chair.  
They are disciplining others for others and they are 
intervening, that others should not be intervened, Chair.   
So that is why the PRASA that has been created of 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 247 of 371 
 
corrupt people and when Martha was here again, Chair, 
she said I am being suspended because I am fighting 
against corruption.  It is so false.  It is not true, Chair, it is 
not even supported by fact.  That is why I offered this 
Commission to present as much information including this 
email written by Ms – it is coded, Chair, this thing but the 
essence of it is telling Mr Nathi Khena.  You cannot 
proceed with it, Chair, and that is why Mr Khena signed a 
letter of engagement with Werksmans, that is on their 
letterhead on their own terms which, Chair -  if Mr Soni, 
10 
yesterday we had a huge debate about violation of Section 
217 of the Constitution.   
Chair, there is no better illustration of a violation of 
Section 217 of the Constitution than what Werksmans did 
in this particular contract.  I will come back, Chair, to 
testify about it, so I am simply saying if we do 19, written 
by Ms Ngoye under oath, Chair – she deposed to this 
affidavit to this – and this issue was not there other than 
the investigations that they created with their list of 
contracts, Chair, of contracts. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go back to the Acting CEO who 
came after you.  So are you saying in the end – okay, 
maybe I should not say that – to your knowledge did the 
persons whom he had written letters to say tell me why I 
should not take action against you if these reasons are 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 248 of 371 
 
true, did they respond, as far as you know, or you do not 
know? 
MR MONTANA:   No, I do not know, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know. 
MR MONTANA:   What I know, Chair, is that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No action was taken. 
MR MONTANA:   No action was taken and that was at the 
instructions of Werksmans Attorneys, Chair, in black and 
white. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR MONTANA:   And I hope when Mr Khena comes here he 
will be able to say I wrote back to Bernard Hotz and told 
him that what he is saying is completely out of order, I am 
proceeding.   
Even after the matter been finalised in 2017 - the 
judgment on this issue happened in 2017, Chair, and most 
of those people were still employed with PRASA including 
Ms Ngoye, including Mr Holele and other people are still 
there that I know, who served on the Bid Adjudication 
Committee, Chair.   
20 
 
Yet the legal department, when Mr Molefe first laid 
a charge on Swifambo, they even said Swifambo and 
Siyangena were approved by Mr Montana when they know 
that they recommended to the board and these were 
approved by the board.  So they will tell even vital 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 249 of 371 
 
information from the board of Mr Molefe, as it were. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So speaking about the Swifambo, only 
leaving out others that you deal with, you are saying yes, I 
approved the Swifambo contract but I did not just approve 
it, there was a recommendation coming from – is it the Bid 
Adjudication Committee? 
MR MONTANA:   No, no, Chair, I am not saying that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying that. 
MR MONTANA:   I am saying I did not approve the 
Swifambo contract. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you did not, ja. 
MR MONTANA:   It was approved by the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By the board. 
MR MONTANA:   At the recommendation of the Bid 
Adjudication Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which included… 
MR MONTANA:   Which was checked by Mr Holele and it 
involves other people including Ms Ngoye. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR MONTANA:   And so you can see, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MONTANA:   So when you say that, you cannot then 
say we had asked several questions on the principal 
transaction 
to 
which 
no 
satisfactory 
responses 
were 
provided. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 250 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what you are saying is – part of what 
you are saying is how – insofar as the questions that she 
is talking about, that she says they raised, may have 
related to how PRASA awarded the Swifambo contract.  
She could not have raised those questions because she 
had been part of the people who recommended that 
Swifambo be awarded the contract.  That is part of what 
you are saying. 
MR MONTANA:   Yes, Chair.  If – let us assume, Chair, 
they were not involved in the negotiations, okay, but here 
10 
she 
is 
saying, 
she 
is 
talking 
about 
the 
principal 
transaction.  The board approved the principal transaction 
which – let us assume she does not even attend the let us 
say the Bid Adjudication Committee but when documents 
are served, they are served to members of the committee 
as a committee and they quorate, they present that to the 
board. 
 
So, 
Chair, 
I 
am 
simply 
saying 
this 
19 
is 
a 
manufactured story and it also tells you there, Chair, that 
is does not – it is not Montana against Ngoye, in fact you 
20 
could take it as – it is Ngoye against Dingiswayo, Chair, 
because they provide different reasons for that but I am 
saying that with 19 could not have been because the 
discussion on Swifambo – and I know the details on this 
thing at the back of my hand, Chair, the details on this 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 251 of 371 
 
thing was discussed in 2014.  May 2014 the Chairman was 
still Mr Sfiso Buthelezi    
In 2015 it was Mr – so this was part of – and for 
me, Chair, there is only one conclusion.  That is why I am 
blunt 
on 
this 
Chair, 
I 
say 
Ms 
Ngoye 
lied 
to 
this 
Commission, she needs to be asked to explain this and I 
am hoping that my friend from Werksmans, when they 
come, Chair, they will be able to explain simply things.  On 
what basis do they write a letter instructing the CEO not to 
discipline people because we said when the culture of 
10 
accountability, we want – what is it called now, into the 
consequence management.  Okay?   
So that it does not apply to the people we love, it 
must apply to Montana.  We even tell the board to go to 
court to say Montana approved a contract of 3.5 billion 
which is beyond – beyond its – so they manufactured the 
reasons, Chair.  When you look at the – and I explained on 
Friday, I went to a legal firm, I asked …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want to stop you because of time. 
MR MONTANA:   Okay, okay, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Soni, I know you may have still 
wanted to ask something but I see we are way beyond five. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   Yes, no we are way beyond. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 252 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about – if I were to be 
available – Mr Montana laughs – if I were to available this 
coming Saturday – just that I do not know if I will be 
available, if I were to be available this Saturday, is there a 
chance that we could continue starting in the morning, 
maybe we see how far we go, maybe up to lunchtime or 
so?  From your side, Mr Soni? 
ADV VAS SONI SC:   [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  From your side, Mr Montana? 
MR MONTANA:   Well, Chair, I will be guided by you.  I 
10 
would be available.  I know – I just have to confirm, 
though, Chair, because I know that this weekend it is my 
turn to look after the kids, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   So I think that may be an issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That might be an issue, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But I can quickly negotiate that in case, if 
I can come and honour, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MONTANA:   Because I think it is very important that 
20 
we conclude this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is very important.  Okay, I am 
going to indicate and you will be informed if I am available 
for Saturday. 
MR MONTANA:   Saturday. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 253 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if I am not available for this 
Saturday, unless something unforeseen happens, I would 
be available Saturday of next week.  So maybe if we do not 
sit this Saturday we could sit Saturday of next week.  Does 
that sound …[intervenes] 
MR MONTANA:   No, Chair, I said, Chair, because I have 
been losing money as a [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, yes. 
MR MONTANA:   But I think from a national interest point 
of view it is my priority, Chair, so I will come. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  As for next week, I 
will check what the situation is about evening sessions.  
My impression is that it is full already but if I do have a 
space, so we might explore even sitting during the 
evening. 
MR MONTANA:   That is fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  But thank you to everybody, we 
will then adjourn for – we will adjourn the hearing of Mr 
Montana’s evidence and then arrangements will be made 
for him to continue on another day.  I will adjourn this to 
20 
allow the evening session team to get ready so that we can 
then start with the evening session.  Thank you very much, 
Mr Montana, you are now excused. 
MR MONTANA:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379

ADV VAS SONI SC:   Chairperson, can we from the 
PRASA’s team be excused? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused as well, yes, thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon Mr Pretorius, good 
afternoon everybody.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Afternoon Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We are.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon Dr Dintwe.  Your mic is 
not on.   
MR DINTWE:  Good afternoon Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the oath you took yesterday will 
continue to apply today, okay.  Alright.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Before we 
continue with questioning, may I place something on 
record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We received a communication from 
20 
Shaun Pillay Attorneys on behalf of a party that is 
implicated in the evidence of Dr Dintwe.  They have 
provided us with a statement attested to by their client on 
behalf of a company, both of which are identified in the 
statement under pseudonyms.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 255 of 371 
 
 
They say in the letter: 
 
“We attach hereto a statement by our clients 
which must be carefully studied, as we are not 
certain 
whether 
any 
of 
the 
information 
contained 
in 
this 
statement 
falls 
in 
the 
category of being classified.” 
 
Then they continue to say: 
 
“We take no responsibility in that regard.” 
 
The first thing that we need to place on record 
Chair, is that the fact that they purport to absolve 
10 
themselves from any responsibility, is not a statement that 
we accept that responsibility, it remains with them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But never the less, we are checking 
the statement carefully.  We will check it with the SSA so 
that we do not inadvertently release any confidential or 
classified information.  For that reason, despite the 
invitation to put the statement to Dr Dintwe in evidence, we 
will not put it at this stage, but at a later stage.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Dr Dintwe, are you at page 789 of 
Exhibit YY15 where we left off yesterday? 
MR DINTWE:  Yes, I am on that page.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 256 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you deal in paragraph 52 with 
the topic as you describe it, executive over reach.  
MR DINTWE:  Yes, I do.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Evidence has been given on the 
topic of executive over reach by more than one witness to 
date, and there is an opinion that has been expressed that 
it is undesirable for a minister to become involved in the 
operations of the SSA.  
 
Another view that has been put is that there is 
nothing that makes such involvement and operational 
10 
affairs unlawful or improper but that such practice has 
been avoided by at least one minister who has testified or 
by the minister who has testified, or the previous minister 
who has testified.   
 
What is your view in that regard?   
MR DINTWE:  And Chairperson, my view will be firstly be 
confined to our role as an oversight body and what problem 
is imposed by that kind of involvement or the executive 
over reach general.  The first point is that you have a 
situation where the ministers bring themselves into our 
20 
oversight space.  
 
So ordinarily we will not investigate the ministers.  
We will not even make findings as far as they are 
concerned.  But an example of what the legislation 
provides, is that the minister of state security shall have 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 257 of 371 
 
super retendence[?] over the agency, over the intelligent 
service.  
 
Now that super retendence, the examples thereof is 
that 
the 
minister 
gets 
involved 
in 
issues 
such 
as 
purchasing and leasing of property and I am just going to 
take that example and try to demonstrate our problem as 
the oversight.  
 
Now, now that we deal with maladministration, let 
us say for instance the property is being leased in KZN, 
and they did not follow the procurement process and so 
10 
forth and so forth, it means that as and when we conduct 
our monitoring or our review, if we find that that particular 
process, I mean the procurement process was not properly 
followed, it will mean that we will have to make a finding 
against the minister.   
 
Because it will be the minister who would have 
made that kind of a decision.  So that is a problem as far 
as we are concerned of that executive over reach or the 
involvement in operations, because we oversee operations 
in general. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, we will in due course place 
before the Chair an analysis of the legislative provisions 
dealing with the powers and duties of the minister in 
relation to the operations of the SSA.  We are not going to 
deal in detail with it here Chair, but maybe to give this 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 258 of 371 
 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because the legislation does at 
least on the face of it, the minister direct oversight powers 
and responsibilities in relation to matters falling within the 
purview of the administration and operation of the SSA.  At 
least at an oversight level.  How that is applied of course 
is a matter of controversy and certainly one of our 
submissions may be to you Chair, in due course that these 
issues should be clarified one way or the other.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine, but let me ask this 
question Dr Dintwe.  Why would it be a problem for you as 
an oversight body to make a finding against the minister? 
MR DINTWE:  It is because Chair, the Oversight Act says 
that we shall monitor, review and investigate complaints 
which involves the heads of services.  So the heads of 
services are defined as a director general in the case of 
SSA, as the divisional commission of sub CI, crime 
intelligence and also the others.  
 
So there is no provision basically which says that 
20 
we can investigate, monitor or even review their actions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No, then I understand, but 
obviously if the, if a minister does what the head of the 
department is supposed to do and in doing it he or she 
acts improperly or breaches the law, then obviously you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 259 of 371 
 
can say that what you were investigating was matters that 
fall within your jurisdiction. 
 
It so happens that one of the players is somebody 
who should not have ventured into that kind of issue and 
then you venture into it and you have to pronounce that 
you did not go out of your sphere of operation to deal with 
matters that were outside of your jurisdiction. 
 
So the subject matter would still be within your 
jurisdiction, but the person who would have acted in 
breach of the law or improperly, would be the minister, or 
10 
are you saying your understanding is that the moment you 
hear that in this operation the minister was involved, you 
have to leave it, because you do not have jurisdiction over 
a minister, even if the subject falls within your jurisdiction 
subject matter? 
MR DINTWE:  I know that I would have provided the 
Chairperson with a pedantic view ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  As far as the provisions are concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
20 
MR DINTWE:  But we have dealt with that issue.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  I have received complaints against the 
ministers ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 260 of 371 
 
MR DINTWE:  Previously ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  And I have worked on them.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  The position of the office is that we do not 
follow the rank ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  Or a person ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  Or an official.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR DINTWE:  We follow the activity.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The activity, yes.  
MR DINTWE:  Yes, and that is the advice that has been 
preferred to myself ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  The [indistinct] also asked our office 
whether they could refer certain matters that involves the 
ministers, but I think that the reading of the legislation and 
I think the legal team here will assist ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR DINTWE:  Is to say that we look at intelligence and 
counter intelligence activities.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR DINTWE:  So it does not matter who is doing it.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 261 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  In fact, I think that even in the spirit of the 
legislation, if you like, it even goes beyond because there 
is a provision here which says that I may also invoke the 
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, if there is any 
other organisation which is not the three that I have 
mentioned that gets itself involved in intelligence.  
 
So we can see that the intention of the legislature 
is to make the scope a little bit broader.  We have dealt 
with the issue and I think that is our position Chairperson, 
10 
is that we follow the activity and not the person.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So if a minister by their action 
brings himself or herself within the purview of the IGI’s 
office, you will investigate as I understand it. 
MR DINTWE:  That is exactly what I am saying.  The 
example that I was giving Chairperson, was to say that let 
us say a lease of a property.  So there I am not concerned 
who is doing it.  If it is done by even a private citizen, as 
long as it is one of the resources that belongs to 
20 
intelligence services, it will be an activity that I can 
investigate if there is any maladministration coming out of 
it.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But that does not mean to say that 
the legislation could at the very least be tidied up.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 262 of 371 
 
MR DINTWE:  I have never ever had a challenge.  I wish 
for a stage where there will be findings against a particular 
minister and maybe they take us you know, on review, but 
from where we are seated, because I think that a person 
sitting somewhere may think that now that the legislation 
does not say that you can investigate a minister, that then 
it means that you cannot investigate.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We will leave that to a later stage.  
MR DINTWE:  Alright.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would you then deal with the 
10 
examples you give in paragraphs 53 and 54 of your 
affidavit?   
MR DINTWE:  Alright.  Now according to the Intelligence 
Service Act, as well as the regulations of the SSA 
specifically here, is that when a member gets dismissed for 
example, and this is the case that I would have worked on.  
It was just basically [indistinct].   
 
Then that member can appeal to the minister and 
our view has always been but the director general, the 
moment you see that the minister has super retendence, it 
20 
means that a dismissal that is metered out by the director 
general, is tantamount to a decision of the minister.  
 
If they have super retendence.  So it creates a 
problem, because then the minister becomes a player and 
a referee at the same time, because it says that then that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 263 of 371 
 
member would have to lodge an appeal with the minister.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The SSA member so dismissed may 
lodge a complaint then with your office, and that minister ’s 
decision may then be subject to your oversight as I 
understand is what you are saying in paragraph 53. 
MR DINTWE:  That is exactly also what I am referring to 
Chairperson.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And what if a minister were to 
involve himself or herself in the operational matters of the 
services that fall under their superintendence.  Would you 
10 
investigate such a matter if the complaint arose? 
MR DINTWE:  I do not have a choice.  I will investigate it, 
but then you can understand the [indistinct] that I will find 
myself in because it will be almost like double jeopardy.  
The minister would have committed an error the first time 
around and the second time around.  
 
In any event, the end result is that I have to 
recommend to the same minister again for rectifying.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Now you deal in the next section of 
your affidavit, Dr Dintwe, with the ministerial delegation of 
20 
powers and direction of payments, and you make out the 
case that this document or this direction of payments 
document has been used or even abused to undermine the 
provisions of the Oversight Act and the Intelligence 
Services Act, and to undermine the oversight role of the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 264 of 371 
 
IGI. 
 
Would you explain please, as succinctly as possible 
to the Chair how this comes about and you deal with it in 
paragraph 55 onwards.  
MR DINTWE:  Alright.  Now submission Chairperson, is 
that these MPD’s have been manipulated and used to 
undermine primary legislation.  Because this is a document 
developed by the minister and its main purpose is to 
delegate certain powers to the director general.  
 
So which means that basically the director general 
10 
does not have any powers to run that institution.  So the 
MPD’s are used to delegate.  So it will be written there to 
say that for instance any procurement which is less than 
five hundred thousand, the director general can make a 
decision.  
 
Procurement of buildings for the provinces will 
reside with the director general.  We do not have a problem 
with that.  It is a good instrument of punishment, a good 
one.  But now it has been used over and over again to 
undermine and to blend the lines between what the road of 
20 
the director general is and what the role of the minister is.  
 
It is creating a serious problem for us as an 
oversight, because then we cannot really tell whose 
decision is it, because if you delegate a power, the power 
still remains with myself.  If I delegate a power to a 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 265 of 371 
 
manager in my office, I am still a decision maker in that 
instance.  
 
I do not know if you wanted me to go a little bit 
deeper than that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, do you have any examples of 
how this delegation has been used?  As I understand it, 
paragraph 57 you say that paragraph 1.1 of the MPD reads: 
 
“Delegation 
refers 
to 
an 
institutionalised 
activity 
whereby 
certain 
activities 
and 
authority are handed down from the minister to 
10 
the 
director 
general 
and 
by 
the 
director 
general 
to 
subordinate 
members 
of 
the 
agency.” 
 
Do I understand you to be saying when the minister 
hands down one of his or her powers, in relation to their 
authority over you, you might find the director general or 
the 
director 
general’s 
subordinates 
exercising 
that 
authority over you.  
MR DINTWE:  Exactly my point.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That I understand you to say is 
20 
undesirable because in fact you have oversight over those 
persons who may be exercising authority over you.  
MR DINTWE:  Yes, that is our submission Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that that has actually 
happened in your statement.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 266 of 371 
 
MR DINTWE:  It has happened.  There is a specific 
incident of December 2017. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  December 2017? 
MR DINTWE:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened? 
MR DINTWE:  Alright.  Now in December 2017 we had a 
minister who served for a very short [indistinct] there.  
Court Advocate Bongani Bongo.  When he got there, he 
clearly had an instruction Chairperson.  I would have had 
some engagements with him which were not recorded 
10 
unfortunately, but that was the [indistinct] that they wanted 
to remove me from the office.  
 
That they did not want oversight.  What happened is 
that ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry. 
MR DINTWE:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If I may just interrupt.  That is your 
opinion and inference you draw from what happened.  
MR DINTWE:  It is an inference that I draw from that.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, okay. 
20 
MR DINTWE:  Yes, it is an inference.  Okay, now what he 
did is that he then amended the MPD’s and they never told 
anybody what was wrong with the MPD’s which were in 
place, and there were few amendments there and I am 
going to give an example of one.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 267 of 371 
 
 
Where they said that the inspector general of 
intelligence shall be clothed with the powers similar to 
those of a deputy director general.  Yes, so let us put that 
in motion.  Like they started by demoting myself, to say 
that now I am a DDG and in that MPD, obviously the point 
that I think that we attempt to drive home here, is that the 
MPD is secondary to the Oversight Act, which does not put 
me at that level.  
 
So that was the first problem.  The second problem 
with the then MPD’s was to say that in my absence and in 
10 
the absence was not qualified.  So I could be sick, I could 
be on leave, I could be on suspension and whatever.  They 
said that the director general of the SSA shall have the 
power 
to 
appoint 
an 
acting 
inspector 
general 
of 
intelligence.  
 
So they are right there, because they have been 
struggling.  The Oversight Act does not and it is a point 
that we conversed yesterday, to say that in my absence no 
one can even appoint somebody to act in my position.  I 
am the only person who can do that.  
20 
 
So I do not know if the commission will see it as an 
inference, because I mean it was straight forward that 
these are the people who want to action something,  but 
they are preparing the ground, so that when I am not there, 
there will be MPD’s in place which will then say that Mr 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 268 of 371 
 
Arthur Fraser at that time will then appoint an acting 
inspector general of intelligence, as that I am actually 
subordinated to him, because now I have been demoted to 
a level of a deputy director general or a head off a 
spending centre as they called it.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well, let us just summarise that 
then to show how the MPD was used or even abused.  
Depending on which way one looks at it.  You say in 
paragraph 62 that the MPD provided that your powers 
would be such that you would have the administrative 
10 
authority and financial limits of a deputy director general of 
the agency.   
 
That would in effect make you subordinate to the 
director general of the agency.  Do I understand that 
correctly? 
MR DINTWE:  That is correct, yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Over whom you exercise oversight.  
MR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because he would then be the 
accounting officer and he would be senior to you.   
20 
MR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And in relation to your appointment 
and your standing, you are appointed by the president.  
You are accountable to the JSCI and your appointment and 
the appointment of the office or the person who occupies 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 269 of 371 
 
the office, is approved by parliament.  
MR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The effect of the amendment to the 
MPD, you have notes is that in your absence the person 
being 
monitored 
appoints 
your 
replacement. 
 
On 
a 
temporary basis.  
MR DINTWE:  That is correct.  That is exactly what 
happened Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you have drawn the inference 
from those facts that these efforts or these amendments to 
10 
the MPD were directed at undermining your authority.  Do I 
understand your opinion correctly? 
MR DINTWE:  You understand my opinion correctly.  Maybe 
also to add, to say that as we get deeper then towards the 
end of my evidence, you will see that there were other 
activities that were being carried out by the director 
general and the minister which were sort of supplementary 
to this particular taking or amendment to the MPD’s.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You make the point in 
paragraph 63 that the MPD is subordinate legislation.  You 
20 
call it secondary legislation and you make the point that for 
it to be valid, it must be consistent with the enabling 
legislation, the Oversight Act and indeed the constitution. 
MR DINTWE:  That is my submission Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 270 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Mr Pretorius.  You said 
yesterday in answer to one of my questions Dr Dintwe, that 
the IGI is ranked at the level of deputy minister.  What is 
the basis for saying that?  Is it the remuneration or is there 
some document that says that? 
MR DINTWE:  It will be the remuneration.  That is how they 
determine that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR DINTWE:  But as I said is that then we will develop 
something 
which 
looks 
like 
an 
agreement. 
 
So 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  Because I am not appointed in terms of the 
Public Service Act ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  We will have a document which is actually 
an agreement between myself and the employer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  And in that document it will tell me exactly 
what level am I and so forth. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR DINTWE:  Now the Act only says the conditions of 
service shall be determined by the president in conjunction 
with the joint standing committee on intelligence and they 
shall not be down variated, I have to read but they do not 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 271 of 371 
 
really use that word, by anybody during the tenure of the 
IGI. 
 
Maybe every time I could be [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  No, that is alright, thank 
you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You detail your inference in 
paragraph 64 of your affidavit on page 792 and 793 and 
you say in short that the amendment to the MPD was part 
and parcel of concerted efforts by Mr Fraser and later 
Minister Bongo to remove you from your position. 
10 
 
Now, or and if this tail to negate your oversight 
powers.  That is quite a strong inference to make from the 
facts.  Why do you draw that inference? 
MR DINTWE:  It is because it is based on the first 
sentence, which says that the mentioned MPD was issued 
by 
Minister 
Bongo 
following 
a 
flurry 
of 
[indistinct] 
correspondence received by the OIGI from Mr Fraser, 
regarding the complaints lodged against him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right, now ...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:  And then that formed the basis of that, 
20 
because you could follow the letters.  The letters would 
have started earlier, where they will say that I am not 
competent to possess state secrets, that they have got 
some intentions to revert myself, that I was spotted 
somewhere sitting with the members of the opposition. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 272 of 371 
 
 
So you could see where these people are going, 
and the letters in my bundles, I mean in my evidence will 
show you exactly that there was a concerted effort to 
remove me from my position. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you rely on what you have told 
the Chair, together with other evidence which provides the 
context for what you have told the Chair, including other 
evidence which, from which you conclude directly that 
there was an attempt to remove you from your position.   
 
Do I understand you correctly? 
10 
MR DINTWE:  I am understood there, that is ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You refer for example in paragraph 
64 to correspondence marked SD4.  You do not by any 
chance have that letter with you there or must we wait for 
the bundle to be prepared before we place that letter on 
record?   
 
You see, if you look at paragraph 64, you annex 
copies of the relevant correspondence marked SD4.  Do 
you see that?   
MR DINTWE:  I see that Chairperson. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That correspondence will be in the 
bundle that you were going to hand up to the Chair in due 
course.  
MR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You do not have it with you there? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 273 of 371 
 
MR DINTWE:  I always keep those letters ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, no but as you sit there 
...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:  No, I do not have here.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Can you just summarise for the 
Chair what that correspondence says? 
MR DINTWE:  Alright.  Now in that correspondence Chair, 
the Mr Arthur Fraser was telling me that he is going to 
revert me and it was followed by a letter which then said 
that my security clearance has been withdrawn.  I put them 
10 
in a single annexure, because it is three letters which 
follows each other. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you should explain to the 
Chair was preceded these activities on the part of Mr 
Fraser.  The fact that you were investigating complaints in 
regard to him.   
MR DINTWE:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you could just explain that to the 
Chair.  
MR DINTWE:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is an important contextual 
fact.  
MR DINTWE:  Thank you very much.  It started in a 
meeting Chairperson, where I met with Mr Arthur Fraser, 
his office manager and office manager from my office and 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 274 of 371 
 
myself, and in that meeting Mr Arthur Fraser told me that 
the caucus of the African National Congress in Parliament 
had told him that he should tell me to withdraw or to stop 
the investigation, because he said the investigation that I 
was busy with was now becoming personal because it was 
a repetition of what was investigated, so I understood him 
to refer to that panel which yes of course was investigated, 
but he  misunderstood what – which complaint I was 
investigating.  The complaint that I was investigating was 
from a leader of the DA in the Parliament, who said that 
10 
this issue was never followed through, may you please 
investigate 
what 
happened, 
because 
there 
were 
recommendations which were made, so what happened. 
 
So in that meeting I disagreed with Mr Fraser on the 
basis that you are not my messenger, you are not even my 
supervisor, I am reporting directly to Parliament and if the 
committee really wanted me to stop this investigation they 
must tell me directly so I am not going to stop any 
investigation and my due at that time the committee 
members were not there, so that is where the problems 
20 
started, because I make him aware that I am investigating 
this particular complaint and when I went back to the office 
I wrote a letter because he had misunderstood what I was 
investigating, so it was a courteous letter to say this is the 
complaint as received from I think I can mention Mr 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 275 of 371 
 
Steenhuizen here, as received from Mr Steenhuizen. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, then you can go back to 
the stage where you deal with your conclusion that action 
was being taken and the aim of that action was to either 
undermine your investigative capabilities, scope, or to 
remove you from office. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That’s the conclusion you drew? 
DR DINTWE:   Ja, the conclusion that I then arrived at was 
to say that it is either I should give in and say that I am not 
10 
going to conclude this investigation or that I was going to 
be removed but then the latter actually materialised 
because 
then 
I 
started 
receiving 
then 
a 
flurry 
of 
correspondence and they were saying only one thing, to 
say that I am not competent, because if I do not have 
security clearance then I cannot continue to occupy the 
position. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, well we will come to the 
security clearance issue in due course.   Let’s just 
complete the fate of the amended MPD.   You mention in 
20 
paragraph 65 that you made a presentation to the next 
Minister, Minister Letsatse Duba, on the 6 t h of April 2018.  
What did you say to her?   
DR DINTWE:   I told her that the – there was a frequent 
change of ministers in that period, so you had a minister in 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 276 of 371 
 
December and then you had the other Minister in April, so 
when I was still busy dealing with this issue there was a 
new Minister, so I informed, I went to make a presentation 
in fact, to say that these are ...[indistinct] ministers and we 
have serious reservations about this position and that 
particular position and I also informed her that we were 
intending to boycott, because that was the advice that I 
had received, to say that we are ready to go and challenge 
these MPD’s because they were outside ...[indistinct] but 
they were also inconsistent with the National Legislation. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The primary legislation, the 
empowering legislation? 
DR DINTWE:   The empowering legislation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what did the minister then 
decide to do? 
DR DINTWE: A day or three later there was a message 
which just circulated on our internet, because I will be on 
the same internet, to say that those MPD’s have been 
withdrawn and that we are relating back to the ones before 
the arrival of Minister Bongo. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the MPD to which you objected 
or the amendment to the MPD to which you objected was 
withdrawn? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct Chairperson.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Let’s then go to the next 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 277 of 371 
 
topic, the weaponisation of vetting or security clearance, 
what do you mean by that?  You deal with that in paragraph 
66.    
DR DINTWE:  The Chairperson would have heard evidence 
where they said that there were parallel structures in the 
State Security Agency.  One of the parallel structures was 
a structure that was used to vet different categories of 
people, let’s say two.   Now you will have that group that 
was seen as opponents of State Capture, I am expressing 
an opinion here Chairperson, and then you will have the  
10 
other group that will facilitate it, so we wouldn’t be vetted 
by the same team, or the same structure, you will have 
other structure which will deal with David because David is 
not liked, and then you will have the other one which will 
deal with Joseph because Joseph is liked, so they were 
using vetting or the security clearance as a weapon to fight 
against 
those 
who 
were 
opposed 
to 
corruption 
and 
malfeasance in the State Security Agency. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Was this occurrence a rare 
occurrence, was it a more frequent occurrence, was there a 
20 
pattern, what do you conclude from what you learnt in an 
office? 
DR DINTWE:   It was a pattern, in fact we – when we 
wanted some information we got to the other office and 
there were no less than twelve files that were never seen 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 278 of 371 
 
by the adjudication committee, so they will have an 
adjudication committee, they use the other term there, but 
after the investigator, that investigator and the polygraph 
and all those other things, they would then take it to this 
mini committee to then sort of you know make a final 
decision before it gets signed, so we had files which were 
no less than 12, which were never seen by anybody and 
they were being dealt with by this other structure that we 
say was parallel, parallel to the other main structure.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, you then in your statement 
10 
in that paragraphs which follow give three examples, and 
we will deal with those now because those examples have 
been raised in other evidence before you Chair.    
 
In paragraph 67 you make reference and you cite 
the Intelligence Services Act at Section 14, that is a 
Section which provides for the vetting of SSA members by 
the Director General of the SSA, am I correct? 
DR DINTWE:   You’re correct, that is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and because there is a 
provision in the legislation that says that you must also 
20 
have a security clearance similar to the security clearance 
that a member of the SSA must have are you subject to 
these particular provisions that you quote here? 
DR DINTWE:   Yes I am. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So who performs your security 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 279 of 371 
 
clearance, or who is responsible for your own security 
clearance? 
DR DINTWE:   It is the same person that I oversee, the 
Director General of the SSA.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Alright, and then you deal in 
paragraph 
69 
with 
another 
section, 
14[8][a] 
of 
the 
Intelligent Services Act which deals with the facility of an 
appeal to the Minister in relation to anything that happens 
to your own security clearance, for example if it’s been 
degraded, withdrawn or refused, you see that? 
10 
DR DINTWE:   I see that Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you refer in paragraph 70 to a 
related regulation under Chapter 26 of the Intelligent 
Services Act which also deals with the possibility of a 
security clearance, including your security clearance being 
withdrawn or downgraded. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes I am also subject to those regulations. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if the Director General decides 
to withdraw your security clearance that is in effect 
removing you from office, is that not so? 
20 
DR DINTWE:   It is, it amounts to that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And we will come to what 
happened in that regard in your case in due course. 
DR DINTWE:   But may I please also impress upon the 
Chairperson that it should not have been the case, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 280 of 371 
 
because there is a difference between the regulations 
which deals with the members of the service.   I am not a 
member of the service myself, so the position which deals 
with the regulations is found in the Oversight Act Section 
78, which says if these were the regulations ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Section 74. 
DR DINTWE:   74, yes, it says a Minister acting with the 
concurrence 
of 
the 
committee 
may 
make 
regulations 
regarding, and then you have got paragraphs A, B, C, I 
want to go to F, which says security clearance for the 
10 
Inspector General and members of the committee, so these 
regulations were never promulgated, this 1994.  Yesterday 
I was counting the number of ministers there, we don’t 
have these powers but we have drafted them more than 
once, and because they deal with important issues they 
also deal with the performance of the functions by the 
Inspector General, the reports submitted by the Inspector 
General, the suspension or removal from office of the 
Inspector General and the termination of employment of 
the Inspector General. 
20 
 
So in the absence of these regulations which were 
never promulgated they then revert to the regulations 
which deals with the employees of the service as if I am an 
employee of the service. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So as I understand what you are 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 281 of 371 
 
saying to the Chair is that properly regarded there is 
legislation which would allow the Director General actively 
to remove you from office by withdrawing your security 
clearance. 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Or there is no valid legislative or 
regulatory provision to that effect. 
DR DINTWE:   There is not. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and we will later deal with 
an example where as I understand your evidence an 
10 
attempt was made to do precisely that. 
DR DINTWE:   Exactly and they invoked the same 
regulations which deals with somebody else other than this 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, we will come to that in due 
course, but I would just like to place on record Chair 
Section 74 of the Oversight Act, which reads: 
“The Inspector General may be removed from office 
by the President ...” 
That is the body that appoints you, but only on the grounds 
20 
of misconduct, incapacity, withdrawal of his or her security 
clearance, 
poor 
performance 
or 
incompetence 
as 
prescribed. 
DR DINTWE:   That’s what the agreement is.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if your security clearance is 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 282 of 371 
 
withdrawn it remains the prerogative of the President to 
remove you from office, as I understand that section. 
DR DINTWE:   That’s correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that your view as well? 
DR DINTWE:   That is my view as well Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right let’s deal with paragraph 72 
and following, and that is the issues surrounding the 
security clearance of Robert McBride, what happened 
there?   You deal with that at paragraph 72 and following? 
DR DINTWE:   ...[Indistinct] the notorious fact that the 
10 
tenure of Mr Robert McBride as the Executive Director of 
the IPID was not renewed after the expiry of his contract in 
2017, and if you follow the reasons that was provided by 
Minister Bheki Cele was to say that Mr Robert McBride did 
not have a renewed security clearance, or he was not re-
vetted. 
 
In the meantime Chairperson he had applied in time 
for the renewal, he did not have control over that because 
the State Security Agency is having that mandate to also 
deal with what we call external ...[indistinct], it involves 
20 
vetting of other officials outside the agency. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Including IPID? 
DR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And including you in fact.  
DR DINTWE:   Well of course yes I will be falling under 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 283 of 371 
 
external space. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have made that point.   Did the 
matter then arrive on your desk?    
DR DINTWE:   And then before it arrived on my desk is that 
a decision was made in Parliament and it was given that 
reason and so forth and I think that he was contemplating 
going to challenge that decision, but then he complained to 
me on something else.  His complaint to us was to say that 
there was a team that went to this foreign country that I 
want to call Jupiter, I don’t know how it was called there, 
10 
ja, but that country, so they went there and the allegations 
were that Mr McBride was in cahoots with some people who 
resided in that particular country or in Jupiter, which is not 
a problem, the problem is that you cannot go and 
investigate 
an 
individual 
without 
having 
a 
registered 
project to say that we suspect that Dintwe – ja I think it is 
in the public domain, people have been accused of being 
handled by foreign intelligence agencies, so the moment 
there is that allegation they must register a project, they 
must follow their operational directives and it must be 
20 
approved by the highest person in the SSA who happens to 
the be a Director General or his delegate, but in this 
instance nothing of that sort was done, but there was a 
second problem, the second problem is that there are 
people who were sent there were then accompanied by a 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 284 of 371 
 
certain gentleman ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Don’t mention the name, don’t 
mention the name or the company. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, we are using a pseudo name there, I 
think we call him Mr Ivanhoe. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   Now Mr Ivanhoe is a director of a company 
called Icebox Incorporated.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Both are pseudonyms. 
DR DINTWE:   It is also a pseudonym. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is very important to mention if it is a 
pseudonym, otherwise people accuse the Commission of 
not being responsible and mentioning names. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will get a complaint from the 
real Mr Ivanhoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, continue. 
DR DINTWE:   But who is this Mr Ivanhoe?   Mr Ivanhoe 
and his company were being investigated by the OIGI, my 
office and they were also being investigated by IPID, by Mr 
Robert McBride.   He had provided some equipment to the 
20 
Intelligence and the procedure was not followed.  There 
were 
also 
findings 
by 
Treasury 
that 
there 
was 
contravention of some of their directives and so forth, so 
that brought about that problem because obviously then it 
was Mr Ivanhoe who informed the State Security Agency 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 285 of 371 
 
that Mr McBride was not upright, so in the meantime Mr 
McBride did not get security clearance, his tenure could 
not be extended at IPID because he was fighting against 
this person who is connected, there is evidence later which 
shoes his political connections and to what extent was he 
involved also in fleecing the ...[indistinct] regions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As in many spy stories they get 
quite complicated and it is difficult often to follow the plot, 
but as I understand it Mr McBride was investigating this 
company. 
10 
DR DINTWE:   That’s correct Chairperson.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This company or the director of 
this company, Mr Ivanhoe, then lodged a complaint against 
Mr McBride which accused him of nefarious dealings in a 
foreign country. 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the very company that was 
being, and the person that was being investigated by IPID 
under Mr McBride was at the same time reporting to Crime 
Intelligence I think it was, that Mr McBride was not 
20 
behaving appropriately or properly or lawfully in relation to 
activities in a foreign country, do I understand that 
correctly? 
DR DINTWE:   But we should add that it was not only a 
complaint, he then becomes a source or an informer who 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 286 of 371 
 
then even accompany the team that is going to investigate 
in Jupiter.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the company or the director 
being investigated by IPID and Mr McBride is now a 
source, protected as a source, and accompanies the 
investigators of Crime Intelligence to this foreign country, 
do I understand that correctly? 
DR DINTWE:   You understand correctly. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is the additional part of the 
plot that you delineate. 
10 
DR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, what happened? 
DR DINTWE:   And when he gets to that country at the 
cost, full expenditure being carried by the SSA and they 
get to Jupiter, they meet with the people that had informed 
the investigators here that they have evidence of even 
offshore accounts that belongs to Mr McBride, but they 
returned empty-handed because that was never – it was 
never a reality, it was never the truth. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But there is a further twist and that 
20 
is that this director and this company are actual service 
providers and potential service providers or bidders to the 
extent of tens of millions of Rands to the security 
establishment, am I correct? 
DR DINTWE:   For Crime Intelligence to be specific. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 287 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For Crime Intelligence and that you 
will deal with in due course. 
DR DINTWE:   We will deal with that in due course. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is there anything you wish to add 
then in relation to that? 
DR DINTWE:   ...[indistinct] they come back and they say 
that no the information was negative but by that time there 
is somebody already appointed to act at IPID, Mr McBride 
is out already, so they have done that and it is one of what 
we can call a modus operandi they just dismiss you and 
10 
they just delay things and they know that there is no truth 
in what they are alleging, but the prejudice was still 
suffered. 
 
Maybe not even call it prejudice to Mr McBride but 
maybe some prejudice to the citizens of this country 
because at that time he was fighting tooth and nail to make 
sure that he reverses the damaged caused by State 
Capture, corruption, police brutality and all those issues. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We have summarised these events 
but they are detailed in your statement and the Chair has 
20 
the report.  Let us move on then to the facts surrounding 
the security clearance of Mr Nqasana, you deal with that in 
paragraph 82 and following.  What happened there? 
DR DINTWE:   In Mr Nqasana’s case Mr Nqasana gets 
appointed, they opened the files to vet him, he signs, he 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 288 of 371 
 
consents to everything and then they go through all the 
processes and at the end he then they qualify him, he 
didn’t get awarded top secret.  There is communication to 
the Minister, the then Minister of Justice to say that no this 
candidate is now okay and then he resumes his duties and 
then something happens between himself and the former 
President, there is a disagreement, there is a mistrust that 
he could charge the former President.    
 
They did not come back to him and withdraw the 
security clearance, what they do is that they then request 
10 
his file, because then the file would be stored for the 
coming five years or until such time that you want to 
reinvestigate or withdraw. 
 
They go ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say they you mean people 
within SSA? 
DR DINTWE:   Ja, I just want to see if they maybe didn’t 
use the other two names that I mentioned but ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh pseudo names obviously. 
DR DINTWE:   No, those would not be pseudo names. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh those would be real names? 
DR DINTWE:   Oh no, they are pseudo names. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair Mr Nqasana may have named 
those persons, or those persons may have been named, 
the persons who dealt with his security clearance, they 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 289 of 371 
 
were not operatives, but I am not sure whether rule 33’s 
have been issued in that regard.  Well they are not named 
here anyway. 
DR DINTWE:    87.2, no 87.2 the last but one sentence on 
page 801. 
CHAIRPERSON:   801. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   87.2? 
DR DINTWE:   It will be one, I mean that first sentence on 
that page.  So it will be paragraph 872 which starts on 800. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The name in paragraph 87.2 can 
be mentioned, he has received an 33 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is the ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But anyway you tell the story. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say instead of the pseudonym, you 
say ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  No, there’s no pseudonym here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On mine there is a pseudonym on 
paragraph ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is a pseudonym for the first 
20 
person mentioned in paragraph 87.2, that pseudonym 
should 
remain. 
 
 
The 
second 
person 
mentioned 
in 
paragraph 87.2 has received a Rule 33 and you can 
mention that name and they are two different people 
although they – ja, they are two different people, well they 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 290 of 371 
 
are mentioned ...[intervenes] he same context. 
DR DINTWE:   Alright.  So Chair after that six – I mean 
after the 6 t h of March 2014, which was the date that the 
certificate was issued of top secret to Mr Nqasana they two 
days later and unbeknown to Mr Nqasana the then general 
manager, we call him Danny, in the SSA gave instructions 
that further investigations should be conducted on Mr 
Nqasana.  The file was then allocated to a different vetting 
investigator who interviewed certain unidentified referees 
in KwaZulu Natal and those referees can be identified by 
10 
Mr Thulani Dlomo, who was then the Deputy Director 
General in the Domestic Branch of the SSA. 
 
Now vetting is intrusive, they even ask funny 
questions, sometimes they ask are you ...[indistinct], are 
you, have you ever had a problem of drugs and so forth, so 
it is an intrusive kind of a method.   Now the reason why 
you got informed that you sign, you are consenting, that 
you can go to the banks and check my actions, you can do 
this, you can go even talk to my referees.   Here in this 
instance Mr Nqasana’s consent ends on the 6 t h of March 
20 
when this certificate is issued, but then this General 
Manager called Danny then takes the file again, he speaks 
to a different vetting investigator and give that instructions 
that Mr Thulani Dlomo will give you names, you must go 
and talk to these people in KwaZulu Natal. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 291 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you investigate this vetting 
process or this re-vetting process? 
DR DINTWE:   I investigated that and I called for some 
documents during the course of our monitoring. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes and did you look for the file? 
DR DINTWE:   We could not locate the file, we could only 
get some other documents which were then given to us.   
Some of those documents suspecting me were not even 
signed, I think there is one left that was still signed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the evidence which would have 
10 
assisted you in your investigating to what you regard as an 
improper 
or 
unlawful 
re-vetting 
process 
quite 
frankly 
disappeared? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What do you say in paragraph 87.6 
then? 
DR DINTWE:   Right, now what we found to be very strange 
was that when we looked at the digital vetting files, so 
remember that we could not get the physical file, but we 
could be assisted to get onto the system and check what 
20 
they call digital, so – because they cannot delete that, 
there will always be an auditable trace there.   What we 
found was a letter which was uploaded there which said 
that Mr Nqasana’s vetting process was not complete. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that a correct statement of the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 292 of 371 
 
facts, was that a correct statement of the facts? 
DR DINTWE:   It cannot be a correct statement because 
there was a certificate issued and signed on the 6 t h of 
March 2014. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct, and was that letter ever 
signed? 
DR DINTWE:  The letter, this letter was not even signed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So someone put that letter in a file 
presumably intending it to be signed at some stage but it 
never got to be signed, is that correct? 
10 
DR DINTWE:   It never got to be signed and the Chief 
Directorate dealing with that advised or informed us that 
they had no knowledge of the author of the alleged letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes, you say in paragraph 87.6: 
“The management of the Chief Directorate stated 
that 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
denial 
letter 
remains 
questionable.” 
That means the denial of the certificate, does it? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There was no letter of denial 
20 
written by the Chief Directorate External Vetting and 
Advising, that does not mean to say of course that some 
parallel vetting process might have drafted that letter. 
DR DINTWE:   Look certain letters, like in my office you 
will have ...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 293 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That may be an unfair inference on 
my part so ...[intervenes]  
DR DINTWE:   Yes, I understand what made it more strange 
was that if an official in my office writes a letter they will 
write on top the reference or an inquiry at least even if I sign 
that letter.  This one did not indicate who at least the drafter 
is in the bare minimum. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The conclusion you drew 
after all your own investigations in relation to whether Mr 
Nxasana had a valid security clearance or not what was 
10 
that? 
DR DINTWE:  I will have to read that one because I – ja on 
paragraph 87.7 I think you are referring to that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   
“It is not worth that Mr Thulani Dlomo’s name 
featured prominently in the findings of the 
HLRP 
the 
panel 
concerning 
the 
rogue 
intelligence 
unit 
within 
the 
SSA 
and 
20 
reportedly 
took 
instructions 
from 
and 
reporting directly to the then President Mr 
Zuma.  President Zuma…” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Just before you go on.  What is your 
source for that conclusion? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 294 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:  It is the high level review panel it is . 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well it may not be stated in the high 
lever review panel in so many words but we can always 
check it.  But what you are saying is you relying on what you 
stated in that HLRP report?  Is that correct? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Of course we do not have the full 
report certain portions of that report remain classified even 
to the commission but I am concerned that – that conclusion 
that you draw may not be accurately reflected in the report.  
10 
Were you satisfied that it is? 
DR DINTWE:  It is fine Chairperson I am always amenable to 
us putting it on hold until you have checked those facts and 
then you are raising it Advocate because it is raising a very 
important issue so I am sitting with an unredacted version of 
the HLRP and I think that everyone else may be having a 
redacted version. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The second sentence how 
does that read or what does it read? 
DR DINTWE:  The second statement? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In 87.7. 
DR DINTWE:  Alright.   
“President Zuma relied upon the alleged lack 
of security clearance of Mr Nxasana as a 
basis for instigating an inquiry into his 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 295 of 371 
 
fitness to hold office notifying Mr Nxasana of 
his intention or to suspend him.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So your understanding of the facts 
which you investigated is that Mr Nxasana was issued with a 
valid Top Secret Security clearance. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Subsequent to that a further 
investigation into his security status was conducted you say 
that that was improper or not – or properly authorised, am I 
correct? 
10 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
So 
that 
his 
original 
security 
clearance remained in place? 
DR DINTWE:  It remained in place as far as my investigators 
– as far as my investigators could establish. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Notwithstanding that you say 
that the issue of the security clearance, its status, its validity 
and question marks around an alleged lack of security 
clearance were used as one of the reasons for questioning 
Mr Nxasana’s fitness to continue to hold office as NDPP 
20 
National Director of Public Prosecutions, am I correct? 
DR DINTWE:  Yes that is correct.  Would not maybe the 
commission wants the Chairperson allow me to just mention 
that there is an abstract that I would have taken from an 
opinion piece but it says here: 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 296 of 371 
 
“It is absurd to suggest that a murder charge 
which 
resulted 
in 
an 
acquittal 
could 
conceivably 
affect 
a 
person’s 
security 
competence.” 
 
So the second round of vetting then revealed this 
charge of Mr Nxasana from which he was acquitted. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that has been canvassed in 
evidence in fact thank you Mr Dlomo but you say as I 
understand it in your… 
DR DINTWE:  I am not Mr Dlomo Chairperson. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In your statement that… - sorry 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dr Dintwe you said Mr Dlomo. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I am very sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not even say Mr Nxasana. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let me repeat all that.  It is 
noteworthy that the grounds on which the subsequent 
investigation into whether Mr Nxasana should retain his 
security clearance or not was based on grounds that you say 
are entirely fallacious. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you detail that in these 
paragraphs of hearsay? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where were you reading just before Mr 
Pretorius asked you where you say it – you started with It is 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 297 of 371 
 
– I am not sure what you (talking over one another). 
DR DINTWE:  No alright yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Charge of murder. 
DR DINTWE:  Yes it will be paragraph 85 where I refer to a 
statement made by Mr Paul Ngobene of the Progressive 
Professionals Forum Western Cape.  And then I had just 
went – it says a lot there but I had turned to the next page 
which will be page 800 and it will be line – not even a 
sentence 123456. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh now I can see where it says it is 
10 
absurd. 
DR DINTWE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the middle of a sentence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes perhaps – perhaps for the sake 
of completeness that comment should be placed on record 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 85 you say Dr Dintwe: 
“That it is my submission that the vetting and 
security 
clearance 
of 
Nxasana 
was 
not 
20 
properly handled.:” 
And 
you 
referring 
there 
to 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
investigation after the issue of a certificate I presume? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 298 of 371 
 
“The statement by Mr Paul Ngobene of 
Progressive Professionals Forum Western 
Cape elucidates my submission – that is your 
submission as he writes and I quote – or you 
quote “it is disconcerting that justice ministry 
officials appear to conflate the issue of 
whether an NDPP is fit and proper with the 
issue of his security clearance” there – these 
are not the same.  Security clearance is 
simply an official document indicating the 
10 
degree of security competence of a person.  
This reflects a person’s ability to act in such 
a manner that he does not cause classified 
information 
or 
material 
to 
fall 
into 
unauthorised 
hands 
thereby 
harming 
or 
endangering the security or interests of the 
state.  Security competence is normally 
measured against certain criteria focussing 
on his susceptibility to extortion or blackmail, 
amenability to bribes, susceptibility to being 
20 
compromised due to compromising behaviour 
and 
loyalty 
to 
the 
state 
or 
institution.  
Measured 
against 
these 
standards 
it 
is 
absurd to suggest that a murder charge 
which 
resulted 
in 
an 
acquittal 
could 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 299 of 371 
 
conceivably 
affect 
a 
person’s 
security 
competence. 
 
In 
similar 
vein 
a 
killing 
committed when Nxasana was a teenager 
long before he qualified to be a lawyer and 
before he was declared fit and proper by a 
court during the attorney admission process 
cannot be grounds for questioning his fitness 
now.” 
 
As I understand it you endorse those comments? 
DR DINTWE:  I endorse those comments. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  I hope that clarifies that 
issue Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I understand the issue ja.  I 
just – I just had not seen where he was reading from. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I have – he has told me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Then you deal in paragraph 
88 and following with your own security clearance.  Would 
you tell the Chair about that please. 
DR DINTWE:  Ja.   
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Before we do that you have made it 
clear to the investigators and the legal team all along that 
you are not here to raise personal grievances. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson.  But before I go 
there if you allow me Chairperson can we… 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 300 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes sure. 
DR DINTWE:  Can we go back to 87.7 to say that the – the 
issue of Mr Nxasana took the other turn and it ended up by 
thinking the highest court of the land.  I think that during my 
investigation I would have also made some reference 
because by that time when I was doing this affidavit and 
when I was doing that monitoring that decision was then 
made and – and the involvement of – of the SSA and the 
endorsement to say that it is so surprising that why would 
you go for the second round of vetting investigation without 
10 
even informing the subject.  It could also be part of that and 
I will request the – Advocate Paul Pretorius but maybe we 
need to look at those decisions and just check what were 
some of the facts that could have influenced my submissions 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well to the extent that you may be 
referring to the judgments of the constitutional courts we 
have dealt with it.  Mr Pretorius led the – was the evidence 
leader.  He had dealt with it in relation to Mr Nxasana. So Mr 
Nxasana himself gave extensive evidence but obviously he 
20 
would not 
have known 
some 
of the things that you 
discovered I think in your investigation.  But he has given 
extensive evidence and – and we have looked at that 
judgment so – so we are quite familiar with it. 
DR DINTWE:  Thank you Chair.  So an earlier question… 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 301 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I should just say also not only are 
we familiar with the judgment we are familiar even with the 
affidavits that were filed in that matter and the record of the 
constitutional court – the commission has got all of those 
affidavits that were before the courts in relation to these 
matters. 
DR DINTWE:  Thank you very much Chair.  So Advocate 
Pretorius the Chairperson had prefaced his question – his 
next question by saying that again this should not be taken 
as a personal grievance.  What I have done here I have 
10 
taken examples of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR DINTWE:  Different people that in my opinion were 
opposed to fraud in government, malfeasance, state capture, 
corruption if you like.  So I have taken them and I am trying 
to create a pattern here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR DINTWE:  So that the Chair can see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR DINTWE:  How did this parallel structure operate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I would say while there is – 
there is certainly something to be said for the view that it 
should not be not seen as personal grievances on the other 
hand it is important to make sure that you do not end up not 
putting before the commission what should be put before the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 302 of 371 
 
commission in the interest of the office as opposed to in the 
interest of a particular incumbent but in the interest of the 
office because you are now too apologetic that you may be 
seen as ventilating personal grievances.  So it is a striking 
of the balance.  Okay. 
DR DINTWE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And of course these matters do 
deal with the office of the Inspector General in Intelligence 
and the vulnerabilities related to that office.   
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Would you then tell the Chair what 
happened in this regard as you deal with it in paragraph 88 
and following? 
DR DINTWE:  So my – my security vetting was done and it 
was completed.  There was in fact I think some threats from 
the other political parties who were saying that their 
President was taking too long to appoint me because the 
Parliament had already – had already voted in November of 
2016 and here we are talking around January/February of 
2017.   
20 
 
So 
my 
security 
clearance 
was 
done 
in 
an 
extraordinary kind of speed if you like.  I think that he had a 
little trim just to deal with that so I got a certificate yes of 
course there were some issues there but they were not 
worrisome so I got the certificate.   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 303 of 371 
 
 
The problem only arose at a later stage.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you were duly vetted before you 
assumed duties as IGI and you were given a top secret 
security clearance, correct? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is the period of validity 
ordinarily of a security clearance certificate? 
DR DINTWE:  It is not legislated but they write in there they 
will say that this will be valid for the five years. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And you raise the issue of the 
10 
exercise of a power or an alleged power to re-vet you and 
that occurred during 2017 and 2018, correct? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What is the background… 
DR DINTWE:  A few months after – after the all depends on 
the office. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Oh you suddenly find yourself subject 
to a re-vetting process, is that correct? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What were the circumstances 
20 
surrounding this?  You deal with that in paragraph 90 and 
following. 
DR DINTWE:  90 and then following yes.   May I please just 
refresh my memory?  So I think that I would have dealt with 
paragraph 90 where I said that Mr Fraser was aware of the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 304 of 371 
 
investigation that I was busy with. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So you were investigating Mr Fraser 
based on a complaint received by your office, is that correct? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
DR DINTWE:  And he was aware of that because I would 
have written a letter to him saying him that this courtesy. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
DR DINTWE:  I am in receipt of a complaint which implicates 
you. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right did he make any requirement of 
you in regard to the source of your information? 
DR DINTWE:  Yes then he wrote to myself saying that he has 
a counter intelligence mandate and his interpretation thereof 
was to say that if somebody comes to my office and reports I 
must tell him if they happen to be in possession of classified 
information.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So he says well I have a counter 
intelligence mandate you must give me all the information 
concerning the complaint against me. 
20 
DR DINTWE:  Exactly and the reason why he was saying that 
he knew that that matter had to deal with the pen 
investigation.  So the time investigation had lots and lots of 
documents that were classified.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Just maybe at it – mention it 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 305 of 371 
 
now but I understand it from a source in the public domain 
that the – at least one of the PAN reports or part of the PAN 
reports was leaked to the Ama Bhungani news service, is 
that correct, am I correct? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
DR DINTWE:  But there would have been a leak in 2014 
before I came to that office in the City Press in that instance. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Did you accede to Mr Fraser. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Mr Pretorius – just one 
10 
second Mr Pretorius for the transcribers reference to pan 
report and pan investigation is pan – just for the – for the – 
when they do the transcripts. 
DR DINTWE:  And they call is a Principle Agent Network. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Did you accede to Mr 
Fraser’s requirement that you disclosed this information to 
him? 
DR DINTWE:  No I refused and then I wrote to him telling 
him that his belief was erroneous that I should report receipt 
20 
of all classified information to his office and that that would 
defeat the purpose for which IGI was created. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What happened after the lodging of 
the complaint that you were investigating in respect of Mr 
Fraser – what had happened thereafter? 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 306 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:  He then wrote a letter to me saying that he 
instituting what he called – okay he instituted – he launched 
a counter investigation against me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  On what grounds or on what alleged 
grounds? 
DR DINTWE:  In the first letter that I received on the 8t h of 
November 2017 I am taking an extract out of that letter he 
said that: 
“The Inspector General had met representatives of political 
parties in Parliament and had on that occasion received 
10 
classified information which information relates to the state 
security agency and its activities.  So that was the 
accusation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So let us just put that in context so 
we understand the plot here.  The office of the Inspector 
General of Intelligence receives a complaint. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Included in that complaint is the 
disclosure to you of a classified document or documents? 
DR DINTWE:  There was not in fact.  His moles got it wrong. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well that is an incorrect fact 
upon which Mr Fraser appears to have acted. 
DR DINTWE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But there is an allegation then let us 
get it step by step. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 307 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson it is an allegation 
that he is making against me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The office of the IGI receives a 
complaint.  It is alleged or believed incorrectly that as part of 
that complaint you received classified documentation. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You are then requested by Mr Fraser 
to give that classified information which he incorrectly 
received? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You refused. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He says then immediately after that 
that he is launching a counter investigation against you for 
receiving classified information as part of the complaint 
which you investigating against him. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright I think we understand that.  
What happened then? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is after he had launched the counter 
20 
investigation against you – what happened? 
DR DINTWE:  Oh alright but I would have wanted to deal 
with the latter part of the same letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so please do so you deal with 
that in paragraph 91. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 308 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:  Yes of the 8t h of November.  That paragraph 
further said: 
“Section 26 of the Intelligence Services Act 
2002 65 of 2002 and Section 4 of the 
Protection of Information Act 1982 Act 84 of 
1982 and I think it is a SIC there but that is 
how the letter was and undermines the 
agency’s ability to fill its counter intelligence 
responsibilities as defined and set out in 
Section 21(b) of the National Strategic Act 
10 
1994 which includes information security.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right well let us just briefly examine 
the logic of Mr Fraser’s stance here.  The office of the IGI 
must investigate the activities of the security services 
including the SSA, correct? 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Does that mean that you would 
inevitably it seems logical to me from the outside that you 
would inevitably have to have to access to classified 
information? 
20 
DR DINTWE:  Always it is a daily thing. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And there could be no reasonable 
interpretation of your powers and duties to say that you can 
do – or you can investigate the procurement of stationery 
and leasing of buildings but you cannot deal with the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 309 of 371 
 
classified activities. 
DR DINTWE:  There would not be that is why you can see 
that Chairperson on paragraph 91 that he is struggling – he 
is bringing in the laws that are not even empowering that are 
not even establishing the office of the Inspector General of 
Intelligence that does not even deal with the appointment of 
the incumbent and so forth.  So those laws they not be 
applicable to myself in any event. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So – but it seems that they 
interpreted and applied in such a way as to say that if you 
10 
receive classified information in this – in the course of a 
complaint being made to your office you are somehow 
transgressing the law. 
DR DINTWE:  Yes that is exactly what the purpose of that 
letter was. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright well I am sure that the Chair 
will with our assistance deal with the legalities there.  Right 
what happened then?  You refer in paragraph 92 that there 
were further – letters sent to you. 
DR DINTWE:  Now on the 13 t h of November 2017 remember 
20 
the first one is the 8t h of November. On the 13t h he then 
writes a follow up letter in which he reiterates that I was in 
receipt of unlawfully obtained classified information from 
representatives of political parties in Parliament. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And you at the top of the or at 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 310 of 371 
 
the end of paragraph 92 what did the Director General state 
in addition? 
DR DINTWE:  He then refers to Section 7 10 of the Oversight 
Act and only that line which says that: 
“The Inspector General shall comply with all 
security 
requirements 
applicable 
to 
the 
employees of the agency.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So he was saying that the fact that 
someone had a classified document you must now report to 
someone else? 
10 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct and failure to do so will be in 
contravention of 7 10. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now what was the culmination 
of this series of events?  You deal with that in paragraph 93. 
DR DINTWE:  Okay then – and Chairperson I mean they 
were following each other that is why I said earlier that I 
think the commission would decide if it was inference that I 
was drawing with regard to the MPD’s.  Because you can see 
the frequencies of the letters there.  One message and one 
message only.  Then on the 15t h of November again he 
20 
writes in which I get informed that SSA will be re-vetting me 
because I had not reported or disclosed to the Director 
General the fact that I was in receipt of unlawfully obtained 
classified information. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 311 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:  But there is something very interesting about 
that letter.  This letter gets delivered by the DG himself.  We 
are not in Pretoria we are in Cape Town so we have got 
offices on the 18t h Floor.  Mine will be on the smaller 
passage his will be at the corner.  And his secretary or PA 
then tells me – knocks at my door and says that the DG will 
like to see you.  And I said no, no it is okay maybe in ten 
minutes I will be done with what I am doing because I was 
doing some preparation.  Then he comes there with that 
letter he puts it on the table.  Somehow violently and he 
10 
says that Sir I have decided to re-vet you and he observes 
me, he was looking at me and I 00:26:53 making me very 
angry because I then like took that letter and I demonstrating 
Chairperson I just put it aside and said okay I will see that 
when I get back to Pretoria.  So I did not show him any signs 
of frustration or off here and whatever.  He actually left my 
office an angry man on that day.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But he – so he did not want any delay in 
you receiving this letter. 
DR DINTWE:  There was no reason our head quarters are in 
20 
Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR DINTWE:  When we are in 00:2;7:36 even smaller in our 
offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 312 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:  Just for administration to go to the committee 
make your reports and come back here.  In fact our trips 
were not even arranged collectively.  He went there and I 
happened to be there.  I  think that earlier then he said oh 
this man is around let us tie this matter and sort of spoil 
00:27:56. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So just to summarise then Dr DIntwe. 
DR DINTWE:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You receive a complaint from a 
member of Parliament. 
10 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That complaint deals with the 
Principle Agent Network. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We know from other evidence at least 
in principle that implicated in the PAN report was Mr Fraser. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Fraser then says I want classified 
documents that you have received as part of the report, 
correct? 
20 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He then – you say you are not going 
to disclose the contents of the report to him at this stage or 
whatever you say to him. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct.  In fact if this was not a leader 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 313 of 371 
 
in Parliament who is a well known prominent person if it is 
other complainants I do not even disclose the complainants 
beforehand to the implicated parties.  I assure them 
confidentiality. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Anyway it seems that Mr Fraser is 
concerned to put it at its lightest that you are investigating 
this complaint without disclosing information relating to the 
complaint to him. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  He then decides to re-vet you. 
10 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And the grounds for the re-vetting are 
exactly your handling of the complaint against him. 
DR DINTWE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And then what happened on the – 
well what happened shortly thereafter you refer to a 
telephone call you received in paragraph 94? 
DR DINTWE:  Yes so when I was about to leave and I – we 
– I was already in the aircraft coming back to Pretoria.  
Then I received this telephone call.  The person informs 
20 
that he was instructed that I should be re-vetted.  So he is 
introducing himself as a vetting investigator and he is 
asking me ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What ...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:   ...ability.  How soon can you get to Pretoria 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 314 of 371 
 
so that we can fill in the form. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what happened on the 
3 r d of December 2017? 
MR 
DINTWE: 
 
 
No, 
he 
writes 
again 
on 
the 
3 r d of December 2017 and he advises me of an pending 
investigation by the SSA regarding the leaking of a 
classified OIGI report.  A copy of which letter is annexed.  
So I annexed that, okay.  But I do not have it here, 
Chairperson. 
 
He mentioned that he was informed that I had 
10 
been uncooperative with these vetting efforts of the SSA.  
So in other words, that was just another follow-up letter 
without giving me further reasons but here it is trying to 
bring something – the OIGI report was leaked.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You then deal with the applicable 
legislation. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did Mr Fraser give you an 
instruction or did he ought to give you an instruction that is 
referred to in paragraph 98? 
20 
MR DINTWE:   Yes, it was.  I saw it as an instruction.  May 
I continue and just ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, please.  You tell your story. 
MR DINTWE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SCA:   And if you need to refer to the 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 315 of 371 
 
legislation and its import, please do so. 
MR DINTWE:   No, alright.  I do not know did – by the 
evidence leader but I think that I submitted earlier to say 
that in fact there are no regulations which deals with my 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR DINTWE:   That is what I am saying, 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes.  So I was instructed by Mr Fraser to 
cooperate with the SSA in the process of my eviction(?) 
10 
and the email investigation into my alleged conduct.  And 
in the letter that was later sent to me, I would have to read 
that into record, it is at the paragraph.  Chairperson, if you 
allow me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINTWE:   It will be on paragraph 98. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
“The above, notwithstanding, your attention is 
brought 
to 
the 
media 
reports 
of 
today, 
20 
3 December 2017 
in 
the 
Sunday 
Times, 
concerning classified reports of the Office of 
Inspector General of Intelligence, IGI. 
It has now become, as a cause of concern, 
that classified reports of the IG have been 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 316 of 371 
 
leaked some four years after its finalisation. 
You are hereby advised that the matter of the 
leakage(?) will be investigated and as such the 
corporation 
of 
the 
Inspector 
General 
of 
Intelligence is required...” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And then in paragraph 99, 
you received further information. 
MR DINTWE:   And then I was informed by him again that I 
was to be re-vetted because now it is even something 
noble(?) there.  He says because he was in receipt of 
10 
disturbing information ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...disturbing ...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:   I have gone and I should consider that but 
he never told me what is that information.  To date I do not 
know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you later find out what the 
disturbing information was? 
MR DINTWE:   No, I have never to date Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You refer in the second sentence, 
paragraph 99 to disturbing information.  What is that? 
20 
MR DINTWE:   It is a recollection that I make because the 
first letter was seeing if I was in receipt.  So I am saying 
that the only inference that I could draw from that is that 
this disturbing information is about me receiving, because 
there was no intervening issue where he would have 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 317 of 371 
 
amended 
to 
changed 
the 
initial 
accusation 
or 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So this was a suspicion that you 
had that this was what he was referring to? 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   He never told you what he was 
disturbed by? 
MR DINTWE:   No, he never told me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You drew the conclusion that it was 
– that you have met members of Parliament.  You assumed 
10 
that or suspected that? 
MR DINTWE:   I actually just assumed that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  And you do say that. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And say:  Some credence for my 
suspicions was confirmed in the report of the High-level 
Review Panel. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Where it is recorded that Mr Fraser 
had alleged that I was “spotted” meeting members of the 
20 
opposition.  What do you say to that? 
MR DINTWE:   Chairperson, it is a disturbing thing.  I hope 
that one day, even if it is not myself, that somebody in that 
office or that office will say that we have been very mild 
about what happened here.  And, like, again, generally 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 318 of 371 
 
what is happening in the country.  How do you follow a 
head of a constitutional body survey(?) them, intercept 
them and even spot them and then even confirm?   
 
I think, Chairperson, that may be treasonable to, 
you know, to say the least.  I think it is just pure criminal.  
And I am also able to refer to some of the other occasions 
where he would even write a letter to me and make me 
aware that we are – whether you have been meeting this 
and other persons.  I am in possession of those letters.  
The team is in possession of those letters.   
10 
 
I think it is a serious thing.  I really got disturbed 
here to say that how do you spot a person who is doing his 
job? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, quite something.  Quite serious.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So you say and you 
stress, in fact, in the last paragraph of 99 that, of course, 
it is your responsibility to meet with members of the public 
or your responsibility of members of your staff to meet with 
people 
who 
are 
raising 
complaints 
and 
to 
receive 
information from them, whether classified or not. 
20 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have given that evidence. 
MR DINTWE:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you also refer in paragraph 
101 to Section 7(8) of the Oversight Act that where you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 319 of 371 
 
receive information, the disclose of that information is 
controlled by the provisions of Section 7.  You cannot just 
willy-nilly give it to anybody. 
MR DINTWE:   If I had to follow that process before I come 
to the Commission...  Chair, you can just imagine the 
accusations that I was going to get if I disclose to 
Mr Arthur Fraser.  It means that before that disclosure, I 
am enjoined by that provision that I should follow.  I should 
inform the Minister of State Security and I should also 
inform the President.   
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  But as I understand it, 
Director Generals talked to your position was that his 
power overrode any other provisions. 
MR DINTWE:   That is what he was telling me.  And it was 
in the letter also. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.   
MR DINTWE:   Chairperson, may I say that these letters 
were part and parcel of my application that I would have 
placed before the North Gauteng.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR DINTWE:   So they are – a majority of them are 
declassified so that we just wanted to clean our house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DINTWE:   And tighten a few screws. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 320 of 371 
 
MR DINTWE:   But you can see that I am quoting 
extravagantly from them.  It is because they are actually 
declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 103 and following, 
you deal with the legal provisions and you give your 
interpretation of how they should be applied to the 
particular facts that you have related to the Chair.  You see 
that? 
MR DINTWE:   I see that.  And those are the Intelligence 
10 
Services Regulations. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in paragraph 106, you say: 
“Beyond the clear conflict of interest apparent 
in Mr Fraser ’s claim to information in this 
instance...” 
 
Of course, he was claiming information relevant 
to your investigation of him. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   “It is stressed that the IPI does not  
report to the Director General or any of the 
Ministers responsible for Intelligence Services. 
He/she is accountable to the JSCI. 
There is no legal provision requiring me to 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 321 of 371 
 
account 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
any 
information required in the course of the 
discharge of my duties...” 
 
Correct? 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
And 
his 
plan 
to 
have 
counterintelligence responsibilities, in your view, does not 
supersede that? 
MR DINTWE:   Not at all, Chairperson.  He does not 
supersede me. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But in any event, arising out of all 
this.  If Mr Fraser then initiated a process regarding your 
security clearance.   
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson.  I am dealing 
with that, I think, on paragraph 108. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What happened in paragraph – 
what happened on 28 March 2018? 
MR DINTWE:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As you described in paragraph 108. 
MR DINTWE:   On the 28 t h, then, of March, Chairperson, I 
20 
was served with a letter from the Director General sent by 
him, informing me that the security clearance had been 
withdrawn with immediate effect based on the following 
reasons.  Very interesting.  The first one was to say that: 
“Failure to exercise my duty to report and 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 322 of 371 
 
action breaches of disclosure of classified 
information 
in 
or 
from 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Inspector General of Intelligence...” 
 
That was the first reason provided for the 
withdrawal.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So every time you received a 
complaint 
which 
might 
include 
classified 
information, 
according to this, you must go and report immediately to 
the SSA Director General whom you might be investigation 
in that very context. 
10 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
MR DINTWE:   And it was now becoming a harassment 
Chairperson.  You can see.  It is different letters, one 
accusation.  I am trying to write back to him.  I am trying to 
educate him, basically, because at a particular point I said 
that maybe I should sit down and assist this gentleman.  
Ad that was one of the reasons.  The second reason was 
that: 
“You failed to execute my fiduciary duty as 
20 
Inspector General of Intelligence towards the 
Intelligence Services by obstructing the due 
administration of justice...” 
 
The third one was: 
“You defeated ...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 323 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  That second one. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The allegation was that you had failed to 
your duty or fiduciary duty as the Inspector General of 
Intelligence 
towards 
the 
Intelligence 
Services 
by 
obstructing due administration of justice.  What did you 
understand that to mean or did you ...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:   I never even bothered to understand that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR DINTWE:   Because I was talking to my colleagues and 
10 
I was saying that now he is even accusing me of criminal 
offences. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINTWE:   That is actually a criminal offence.  So I 
was telling somebody, my legal rep, to say that if Mr Fraser 
was my employer or my supervisor, he would not even then 
be able to charge me with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR DINTWE:   So the reason why I decided not even to 
want to understand that today, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR DINTWE:   It is because it was clear that he was 
clutching at straws and he was just acting out...  He could 
not find any piece of legislation that he could use to deal 
with me. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 324 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
everyone 
was 
defeating 
or 
obstructing the end of justice by such failure.  And the 
fourth one:  Failing to comply with a request to submit to 
re-vet.  Those were the four. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes.  The fourth one, at least, I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR DINTWE:   The fourth one I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR DINTWE:   I get it.  The fifth one:  Defeat and 
obstructing the ends of justice. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR DINTWE:   This was a sign of a person that wanted to 
harass me, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR DINTWE:   He went beyond.  That was just a pure 
harassment.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  So to summarise the facts, 
at least, up to this stage.  You received a complaint from a 
member of Parliament. 
20 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That complaint concerns Mr Fraser, 
the Director General of the SSA. 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Part or involved in the complaint is 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 325 of 371 
 
the PAN, Principal Agent Network Report. 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
You 
immediately 
then 
are 
instructed or required by Mr Fraser to disclose what he 
says is classified information to him. 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And he gives the reasons that he 
has given but the culmination of this exchange between 
you, the Investigator, and Mr Fraser, the person being 
investigated.  As I understand, the train of facts that you 
10 
are giving now is the withdrawal of your security clearance. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes.  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  These facts, of course, 
may be contested by Mr Fraser but he will have every 
opportunity to come and do so.  But as I understand your 
evidence, it is based or corroborated by documentation in 
your possession which you will attach, the bundle to the 
Chair. 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  What happened on the 
20 
5 t h of April 2018? 
MR DINTWE:   Now that is what actually broke the 
channels, Chairperson.  On the 5 t h of April, then I received 
a letter which bugged(?) me from my own office, from my 
own premises, Chairperson.  An extract from that letter, it 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 326 of 371 
 
said:  You are here by advised that your security clearance 
has been withdrawn.  You are no longer authorised to 
access classified information and restricted premises.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would that include your office? 
MR DINTWE:   It will include my office because I am in a 
restricted area.  I am sitting in the same office with the 
Minister, with the Deputy Minister, with Head of National 
Intelligence Committee, with the Head of the ICCS. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  What is the effect of that 
communication or the occupation of the office of the IGI?  I 
10 
am talking about the office here in the official sense. 
MR DINTWE:   It was brought to its knees.  There I was 
Chairperson - and of course, I did not go to the office 
because I was scattered(?) - distanced off.  Maybe a 
physical fight between my protectors and his and the 
security officials.  So I wanted to act as a responsible 
person and I decided then to take that ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us understand the import of 
these communications to you.  It was effectively to remove 
you, both from your physical office and from your offices as 
20 
Inspector General. 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, but my other import is that, 
even go beyond that end.  Close that office because that 
will be the ultimate impact if the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It could not operate without you. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 327 of 371 
 
MR DINTWE:   Without – without.  That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So there is, in fact, not only you 
that were removed from the office but the office is 
effectively shut down. 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, the complaint against him 
could not be investigated further once you were not there. 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because even if, I guess, even if you 
could authorise somebody in your office to conduct the 
10 
investigation, they will only conduct it on your behalf.  And 
if you are not there, you have been removed, they cannot 
conduct – nobody can conduct any investigation lawfully. 
MR DINTWE:   I have been warned Chairperson which 
should – what would develop at that event(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINTWE:   And let me also mention that there was an 
email, an Outlook email which got sent to the Exco – my 
Exco – now my managers... informing them that they 
should not provide me with anything.  They should not even 
20 
communicate with myself because my security clearance 
has been withdrawn.  That Outlook is available also. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, h’m. 
MR DINTWE:   So I think that the point you are raising to 
say that I will not be able to delegate but again, it is 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 328 of 371 
 
cutting the communication between myself and the other 
members who could then continue with the investigation in 
my absence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m, h’m.  Yes, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   After the series of events, did you 
approach the courts? 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What relief did you seek? 
MR DINTWE:   It was a Part A and a Part B.  And Part A 
was on an urgent basis.  Part A was just to say that my 
10 
security clearance should be reinstated. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MR DINTWE:   And along with that, there were some issues 
of security.  So you would have worked on my security. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Did the then Minister 
intervene? 
MR DINTWE:   The then Minister ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did she do? 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did she do? 
20 
MR DINTWE:   She reinstated that – on the eleventh hour.  
So we arrived at court because the matter was set-down 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MR DINTWE:   Yes, there was an opposition ...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 329 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   From Mr Fraser? 
MR DINTWE:   ...from Mr Arthur Fraser. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So he opposed your application to, 
amongst other things, to restore your security clearance? 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What did the Minister do?  Was this 
at the doors of court? 
MR DINTWE:   Let us say that because when I was there, 
then they called and my legal representative was saying 
and think that Part A of your application may have 
10 
tempt(?), you know, moot, if you like.  I do not know if they 
used that word but then they said that there is no need for 
us because they have given you exactly what you are 
claiming(?) for. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the Minister then intervened, 
reinstated your clearance certificate? 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Or status? 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let me just go back.  You launched 
20 
your application in the high courts.  Is that right? 
MR DINTWE:   Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Mr Fraser launch any affidavit to 
oppose that application? 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 330 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was he the only one who was 
opposing – who lodged the oppose? 
MR DINTWE:   Chairperson, I cannot – really cannot 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot. 
MR DINTWE:   My application – my court application is part 
of the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the bundle.  We do not have 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR DINTWE:   ...but if – but I do not think he was the only 
respondent. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, but we do not need to check.  
I just want to get that. 
MR DINTWE:   Alright, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you had not filed a replying 
affidavit.  You had filed a replying affidavit by the time 
...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:   I had. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had? 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the matter was to be argued? 
MR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then, the Minister intervened.  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 331 of 371 
 
I assume the Minister was one of the respondents. 
MR DINTWE:   The Minister was one of the respondents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but she had not filed any papers? 
MR DINTWE:   The legal representative, as when he was 
communicating with mine, he was indicating that he was 
representing both the Minister and Mr Arthur Fraser. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But you ...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:   But there was still affidavit from the 
10 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the Minister.  Okay alright. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the effect of the intervention of the 
Minister, was it that your security clearance would be 
reinstated.  Therefore, there should be a settlement and 
withdrawal of the application or was it that an order was 
granted by concerned? 
MR DINTWE:   There was no order.  They were very 
allergic to that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR DINTWE:   Because there was other issue of security. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DINTWE:   That I was very much worried about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 332 of 371 
 
MR DINTWE:   So they did that but we just felt that there 
was sufficient intervention.  I was satisfied with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DINTWE:   Maybe also to mention that it was on the 
same day that I then get called by the then Chairperson of 
the Johannesburg Diplomat on Intelligence, Mr Charles 
Ngqula and I am not implicating him here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR DINTWE:   Who then said that there is a decision to 
move Mr Arthur Fraser from the state or out of the State 
10 
Security Agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR DINTWE:   So those things happened ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Those things happened  ...[intervenes]  
MR DINTWE:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MR DINTWE:   I thought that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR DINTWE:   I ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
ultimately 
you 
withdrew 
the 
application or it was just postponed sine die.  It was not 
pursued. 
MR DINTWE:   It was postponed.  I remember that I said 
that no, for now we will not ...[intervenes]  
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 333 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR DINTWE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DINTWE:   But we have never ever really pursued even 
the... of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Mr Pretorius, I 
think let us take some adjournment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about how far we would go so 
that we are all on the same page.  Otherwise, I just push 
10 
everybody [laughs] to midnight.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know, Mr Pretorius, what own 
assessment is? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, we can go as far as we can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To whatever time you deem 
necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You know my views on this.  They 
20 
have not changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we will not finish tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja- no, I think we will not finish tonight.  
Maybe we go up to half-past eight or nine.  [laughs] 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 334 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [laughs] I... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will take your main prayer 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...up to your... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Okay alright.  Okay let us take 
a ten minutes adjournment and then after that, we will 
come back and go up to half-past eight and take it from 
there. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may be seated.  Yes, let us proceed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In paragraph 
111, Dr Dintwe, you summarise the import of this section of 
evidence that you have just given.  Perhaps because it is 
well set out there you will read that paragraph onto the 
record? 
20 
DR DINTWE:   Paragraph 111, I am saying that: 
“I am required by law to serve impartially and 
independently and perform my functions in good 
faith and without fear, favour or prejudice.  This 
requires the protection of the basic tenets of an 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 335 of 371 
 
independent institution namely the manner of my 
appointment, my security of tenure (and due to the 
nature of my work, my security of person.)  The 
budget of my office and the manner of and the 
grounds for my removal, the importance of the 
independent and autonomous functioning of an 
oversight body is underpinned by the International 
Best Practice and has been applied by our courts to 
corruption fighting institution, as in the Glenister 
case, 
and 
oversight 
bodies 
of 
other 
state 
10 
institutions, as in the case of McBride.  In view of 
this, the power of vetting determining security 
competence 
given 
to 
the 
SSA 
should 
not 
be 
permitted to be used in order to undermine the 
independence 
of 
the 
OIGI 
or 
stifle 
its 
investigations." 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You deal in the next section, Dr 
Dintwe, with what you term questionable intelligence 
reports and you say in paragraph 112: 
“Mysterious intelligence reports have been used 
20 
repeatedly to deal with or target those who are 
regarded as opponents“ 
And you set out in the following paragraphs some examples 
of this.  Perhaps you could summarise these for the Chair. 
DR DINTWE:   I will summarise, Chair.  The first example 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 336 of 371 
 
is what happened in 2017.  2017 I received a complaint, 
this time from the Democratic Alliance, and it was followed 
by the other one from the South African Communist Party 
and the third one was from a private citizen residing 
somewhere in Gauteng and in that complaint I was 
requested to investigate the veracity of a report that was 
used by the former President Jacob Zuma to recall Minister 
Pravin Gordhan and his then deputy, Mr Mcebisi Jonas.  
And I was just quote what it said because it is very 
important later, it becomes very important latter.  It says: 
10 
“An investigation into allegations surrounding an 
intelligence report allegedly used as a pretext for 
the recall of the Finance Minister.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What was the allegation?  You can 
summarise it because there has been evidence before, 
before the Commission.  You deal with that in paragraph 
114. 
DR DINTWE:   The allegations were – and it was open 
because South African Communist Party went onto the 
media to report – they reported the matter to the OIGI and 
20 
the person who was speaking on behalf of the organisation 
was the now Deputy Secretary, first Deputy Secretary, Mr 
Mapaila.  And he had said that in one of the meetings of 
the top six at Luthuli House they were briefed verbally by 
the former President that he is in possession of an 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 337 of 371 
 
intelligence report which alleges that Minister Pravin 
Gordhan and Mr Jonas were overseas and were going to 
meet with some foreign agents who were calling for regime 
change in South Africa and he also informed them that he 
was going to recall them from that [indistinct], not the 
recall from their positions, they use the same words. 
But yes, of course, I think it is a matter of public 
knowledge that they were then recalled. 
He never told them what was the source of that 
report because I think that when we say that, that the 
10 
expectation will be that it will be coming from one of the 
three State Security Agencies. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   But we were not clear in knowledge of who 
exactly would have briefed the President on that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It was referred to or assumed to be 
an intelligence report of sorts. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, according to the witnesses that I talked 
to and – ja and in high place. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But in any event you were asked to 
20 
investigate the source of this report. 
DR DINTWE:   I was, yes, yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And did you investigate? 
DR DINTWE:   I investigated the matter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you say in paragraph 115: 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 338 of 371 
 
“The core issues that needed to be investigated 
were the origin, authenticity and veracity of this 
alleged intelligence report.” 
Who to your knowledge was the person or you were the 
persons in possession of this report? 
DR DINTWE:   It was only President Zuma who said that I 
am in possession of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ask him for the report? 
DR DINTWE:   I then – because at a meeting and 
requested for that report. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And what happened at that meeting 
and what was its conclusion? 
DR DINTWE:   In that meeting he – and he was welcoming, 
just a very, very, very nice meeting that I had with the 
President and he explained to me that when time is right 
he will then write to me and he will – he did not say he will 
send me the report, in fact maybe let me paraphrase what 
he said.   He said that he is hearing people saying 
[indistinct] report and so forth and so forth and so forth 
and that report may not be existent because he is not 
20 
going  to be dependent on written reports and he said that 
I saw something on the website, somebody was waving a 
report.  I remember the incident where somebody was 
waving the report, it was Minister Pravin Gordhan who was 
having 
a 
one 
pager 
typed 
in 
very, 
very, 
very 
big 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 339 of 371 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I also seem to think I have seen on 
television somebody saying… 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, yes.  So the President in that meeting 
never said that there is a report that he will send to myself, 
he only said that when the time is right he will explain this 
so that I understand that matter and that is how I left his 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you went to him as part of your 
investigation? 
10 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you ask him whether there was 
such a report and you asked him to give it to you but did 
he commit himself to whether it existed or not or what was 
the position? 
DR DINTWE:   I did that but our engagement was followed 
by a letter.  So in a letter where I was requesting a 
meeting I had already put a paragraph there which says 
this is the purpose of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR DINTWE:   And I request the President to favour me 
with that report so that I can check its authentic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So that was before you 
actually met him, that was a letter that was requesting a 
meeting. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 340 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and subsequently you met with him. 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the meeting he did not commit 
himself to whether such a report was in existence or not, is 
that right? 
DR DINTWE:   He did not commit himself to that, save to 
say that he is aware that people are saying there a report 
somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And then he said when the 
10 
time is right he would write to you and explain or he would 
explain to you. 
DR DINTWE:   He said he will explain to me so I just took 
that maybe they will invite by way of a letter to come there 
or I will get a letter which explains that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did he give an indication of the 
timeframe how long it might take for him to – for the time 
to be right? 
DR DINTWE:   He did not, Chairperson, this is the reason 
when I got to – when I got to the office I realised that I did 
20 
not understand him.  The nation will forgive me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   I realise that.  But what I did is that I then 
wrote another letter when our discussion was still fresh in 
my mind.  Basically because no minutes were taken of that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 341 of 371 
 
meeting so I wanted to put it in my own records to say that 
Mr President we met on this particular day and this is the 
discussion and let me also remind you that I will be waiting 
for that engagement and I have also indicated that I 
wanted to conclude that investigation as soon as it is 
possible and so that is how I dealt with it but there was 
never a commitment in terms of the timeframe as to when 
he was going to explain that, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   And which year was it when you were having 
10 
this engagement with him?  Was it 2017?  Well, the 
complaint was given to you in April 2017 so it must have 
been in 2017. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes it was in 2017, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and say actually in paragraph 114 – 
oh no, no, you talk about a meeting.  No, it is not your 
meeting with the president. 
DR DINTWE:   No, it is not that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it must sometime in 2017. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Two issues, Mr Dintwe.  Firstly, 
this correspondence to which your refer, do you still have 
it? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 342 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it could be provided? 
DR DINTWE:   It is I think in the documents that I have 
provided already. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No reference is made to it but 
perhaps we will check. 
DR DINTWE:   But I do have that letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   I am sure, I am very, very …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you want to check? 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, I am very, very …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, both letters, the one that went 
when you requested the meeting and the one that you 
wrote after the meeting. 
DR DINTWE:   It will be two letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR DINTWE:   Because the other one – I cannot remember 
if it was the one, I was getting worried whether - that I 
cannot just keep it open.  So we can even see it as a 
follow up, as a follow up letter.  So I will always keep those 
kinds of letters. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Then in paragraph 115 and I need 
to ask whether this is accurate or not, line three, sentence 
begins: 
“Despite numerous requests including one at a 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 343 of 371 
 
meeting with the former President and despite his 
promise to provide a copy of the report, nothing was 
forthcoming.” 
Is that correct or does it need correction? 
DR DINTWE:   Let us qualify it.  I am sitting with the 
President, he says when time I right I will explain to 
yourself. 
 
I 
hear 
people 
saying 
there 
is 
a 
report 
somewhere, that report may not be existent because as the 
President sometimes I get verbal.  But I never wanted to 
conclude that the report was non-existent because he said 
10 
it may not be existent.  So I was still harbouring under 
that, I will just as and when it happens what comes to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Pretorius, we have an affidavit, 
we have affidavits from Mr Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkhize, if I 
recall correctly and Ms Jessie Duarte.  If I am not 
mistaken, all three of them have deposed to affidavits at 
the request of – at my request maybe last year sometime 
or maybe 2019 where they were asked to give their account 
of what Mr Zuma said to them at a meeting of the top six 
the day before he – he, I think, he recalled or the day he 
20 
fired Mr Gordhan.  They have put up affidavits.  I may be 
wrong, we need to check whether in their affidavit they talk 
about him having a written report in their hands- in his 
hand which he did not give to them or whether they simply 
said he said he had a report but did not make it available 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 344 of 371 
 
to them because I do recall that it was not given to them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not recall whether they said he 
had it in his hand or whether they just said he said he had 
a report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   My own recollection, Chair, is that 
there has been evidence of the existence of a written 
report.  Yes.  Operation Checkmate it is called. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and I seem to think that the current 
President, there was – he gave an interview to one of the 
10 
TV channels around the time of the dismissal of Mr 
Gordhan because you might recall he went public to say he 
was opposed to it.  I may be wrong, I seem to think he may 
have spoken as if he had seen the report or had sight of 
some parts of it, I am not sure.  So there is that clip, so 
one can check. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, but …[intervenes] 
DR DINTWE:   I can assist the Commission further than 
maybe taking the tow from what the Chairperson just said. 
So 
the 
current 
President, 
at 
that 
time 
the 
Deputy 
20 
President, was also interviewed for this investigation and 
they wrote to myself through her legal adviser but the 
report was never provided to myself.  So that one I still 
remember succinctly.  His responses will be in the file 
because it will be the file from different witnesses that I 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 345 of 371 
 
would have spoken to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but do you recall whether he said he 
did not have it, because that would be one thing, or 
whether he said he did not have it and had never had sight 
of it or anything like that because I am just not sure, 
somebody has spoken about – as mentioned, I think, on 
television, features of it.  Features of it, so – but it is okay, 
we can check. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, and it does appear in 
certain media reports or not the report itself but copies of 
10 
a person holding the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja or holding an alleged report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Allegedly holding the report.  An 
alleged report, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Allegedly holding the reports. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let us just summarise it then.  
You were asked to investigate the origins and authenticity 
of this report. 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You interviewed various people 
20 
including the former President. 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You had a discussion with the 
former President about the existence or otherwise of a 
report. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 346 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 A 
report 
which 
you 
were 
investigating. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ask him for a copy of the 
report? 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, I asked him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did he ever give you a copy of the 
report? 
DR DINTWE:   Not at all until he left the office, 
10 
Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did anyone ever give you a copy of 
the report? 
DR DINTWE:   No, no one, there was only that badly 
written document which was on social media. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you say at the end of 
paragraph 115: 
“We were of the view that we could not simply rely 
20 
on the report leaked to the media in order to 
authenticate the veracity of the report allegedly 
provided to the former President.” 
Was that the outcome of your investigation? 
DR DINTWE:   That was the outcome of the investigation 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 347 of 371 
 
and that statement, I mean that when we had then was 
what we downloaded like anybody else. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
DR DINTWE:   And the President had not taken ownership 
of it.  So I say that you cannot deal with origin of a 
document, you cannot deal with the veracity if it is un-
owned at all. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In your view did you ever get a full 
and satisfactory report from the former President? 
DR DINTWE:   Not at all, Chairperson, until he left the 
10 
office. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 116 you refer to another 
so-called intelligence report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go that one, Mr Pretorius, 
you referred Dr Dintwe to his departure from office.  Do 
you know of anything that would have prevented him from 
making arrangements to ensure that he provided you with 
the explanation or the report even after he had left office if 
he wanted to assist on the investigation? 
DR DINTWE:   No, I am not aware of anything that we have 
20 
presented [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
DR DINTWE:   Maybe this point is also appointment that 
amongst the people that I would have talked to again, I 
wrote to the three intelligence services and I informed 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 348 of 371 
 
them, I mean it was in their knowledge and so forth and all 
of them said that that report was – the report and the 
briefing was not given by any of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So all the intelligence services in the 
country said they never gave such a report or [indistinct – 
dropping voice] to the former President. 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, Chairperson.  In fact the 
head of defence, they call them CDI, Chief Defence 
Intelligence, he even requested that should I come up with 
that kind of information I should decide to put them in the 
10 
loop because I think that it could be to embarrassment if 
somebody had to provide the report and none of the 
intelligence services in the country was aware of such. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So do I understand it correctly you 
could conclude after your investigations that it was not an 
authentic report emanating from any of the State Security 
Agencies? 
DR DINTWE:   No, my finding was that I could not reach a 
finding because I did not have any document that I could 
verify its authenticity and its origin. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But nevertheless the information 
you received during the course of your investigations from 
the intelligence agencies under your watch was that it did 
not come from them, is that correct? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct, yes. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 349 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay, alright, I understand. 
DR DINTWE:   But remember, that could not be a finding 
because I would have developed a hypothesis or, if you 
like, a question that I want to answer and the question that 
I want to answer was, is this report originating from any of 
the three?  Is it an authentic report?  And are we able to 
verify it, like the veracity thereof.  So the finding, I will 
only mention those points in the analysis of the evidence 
that I got, the witness and so forth, but it will not come 
there because I wanted to answer a specific question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there was the question of the 
authentic of the report, there was the question of the 
allegations made against the Minister of Finance, Mr 
Gordhan.  I guess the allegation or allegations would be – 
ja, would have been what those who were in the meeting 
with the former President save he said namely that he had 
an intelligence report to the effect that Minister Gordhan 
and Deputy Minister Jonas, while they were outside of the 
country, they were going to meet with – they were going to 
attend certain meetings which he viewed as unacceptable, 
20 
threatening the security or whatever.  I guess that is the 
allegation that you would be looking at and in the course of 
investigating that allegation, obviously you would want to 
see the report on which the allegation was made or in 
which the allegation was made.  Is that right?   
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 350 of 371 
 
DR DINTWE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Insofar as the allegation is concerned, 
you had interviewed the person who had said – who had 
made that allegation and said it was based on the report, 
that person being Mr Zuma and he had not given you 
anything to substantiate the allegation, you had – I do not 
know if you had interviewed Mr Gordhan and Mr Jonas 
because it seems to me that you ought to be able to say – 
you ought to have been able to say, if you had interviewed 
all the people that you identified, to say has this allegation 
10 
been 
substantiated 
or 
not 
and 
if 
it 
has 
not 
been 
substantiated then you say the allegation has not been 
substantiated and part of the reason why it has not been 
substantiated is because those who could have furnished 
you with the report that would have had information about 
that had failed to do so. 
DR DINTWE:   I did not go there, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   And I remember the reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
DR DINTWE:   Not that we are not careful with other 
complaints but this one, I remember that we were – I had 
several meetings with my team and we brainstormed.   The 
first reason why we could not look at the allegations is 
because the complaint was not even coming from Mr 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 351 of 371 
 
Gordhan or Mr Jonas so I declared them victims, if you 
like, but they were never my complainants. The complaints 
came from somebody else. 
 
But the second reason why we could not investigate 
the allegations was because Mr Gordhan himself and Mr 
Jonas cannot be viewed a say members of an intelligence 
service of they cannot be seen as a head of a service and 
our investigation will be about the intelligence and counter-
intelligence 
matters. 
 
So 
there 
is 
that 
little 
bit 
of 
confinement and we just did not want to go out of that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not sure whether it was right 
to approach it that way, you know?  I can understand when 
you say I could not make any finding or make any 
pronouncement on the authenticity of the report because I 
did not get the report.  That I can understand.  The fact 
that I got some alleged – the report from whatever source 
that you downloaded, you know, would not help in terms of 
the authenticity of the report.   
But in terms of the allegation, I would have thought 
that you would need talk to Mr Gordhan and Mr Jonas to 
20 
say I am investigating this allegation that when you people 
were oversees, official trip, you were going to meet with 
certain people for whatever, whatever purpose.   
They might say – if you tell them, they might say 
that is nonsense or they might say yes, we were going to 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 352 of 371 
 
meet such people but we were going to discuss legitimate 
issues relating to our ministries or government, you know?  
And you could have information from them saying there 
was no such thing as was alleged, you have nothing 
coming from Mr Zuma who had made the allegation, and I 
would think that they should be entitled to being cleared 
because Mr Zuma has provided no evidence to substantiate 
the allegation.   
But I accept that you – you may have looked at it in 
a certain way, but I am just saying, you know, it just seems 
10 
that might be unfortunate if some allegation that is not 
being substantiated by anybody seems to be left hanging 
instead of being dismissed if there is no evidence to 
substantiate it in circumstances where those who are in a 
position 
to 
provide 
evidence 
have 
been 
given 
an 
opportunity  to do so and they failed. 
DR DINTWE:   Chairperson, I may have omitted something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   And I do not want to do this when I am 
giving evidence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine. 
DR DINTWE:   Going back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
DR DINTWE:   But I was only saying that I declared them 
as victims other complainants. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 353 of 371 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   But I have met with Gordhan ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes 
DR DINTWE:   And he was even in the company of his legal 
representatives in Pretoria, we were also in possession of 
a transcript both a recording and a transcript that was 
done by his lawyers, where he denied those allegations.  I 
had extended the same invitation to Mr Jonas, but it was at 
a period I think he was appointed for and deal with 
something that’s maybe something, so he was just not 
10 
available, but I tried that and I also used a cell phone, 
because I don’t understand the record to say that, but I 
have given you some time of an audi you know even if you 
are not an implicated person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
DR DINTWE:   So we have those records, I don’t know why 
...[indistinct] or need that but part of my – and I accept 
criticism you know easily, part of my findings did not really 
deal with that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, to the merits of the allegations. 
20 
DR DINTWE:   If there is any information then you will find 
it somewhere in my report, but not under finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes, okay, no, no that is fine, it is 
fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 116 Dr Dintwe you 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 354 of 371 
 
give 
two 
further 
examples 
of 
the 
use 
of 
so-called 
intelligence report whether genuine or fake, would you tell 
the Chair about those briefly please? 
DR DINTWE:  Yes, let me preface just by saying that I am 
also 
observing 
a 
modus 
operandi 
here, 
I 
think 
the 
Chairperson remembers when I said that this means you 
suffer the consequences and then there is nothing, but 
they shall implicate, they even go the extent of saying ag it 
was a wrong ...[indistinct], but by that time the two people 
that I have referred to were out of their positions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
DR DINTWE:   Now the same thing here there were 
allegations, there was a report and in that report there 
were allegations that Crime Intelligence in this instance 
during their course of monitoring they came across an 
alleged plot by the following members, General Shadrack 
Sibiya, Mr Robert McBride and Mr Paul O’Sullivan and 
others that they were intending to overthrow government.  
This report purported to be – I mean, no, no, that report 
...[indistinct] 
further 
report 
into 
the 
alleged 
unlawful 
20 
rendition of foreign nationals involving Generals Dramat 
and Sibiya were questionable and have recently been 
proven to untrue. 
 
The first one that I dealt with said that there was a 
meeting somewhere in the East Rand where these people 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 355 of 371 
 
that I am mentioning here met and that they were plotting 
to overthrow the government.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the bundle of documents will 
include examples of these reports? 
DR DINTWE:   This one will include the example of that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps the conclusion that you 
reach in paragraph 117 of the existence of these reports 
and their use and outcome is summarised in paragraph 
117, perhaps you should read that on the record if you will, 
paragraph 117. 
10 
DR DINTWE:   These reports, and it is very strange, it is 
only these reports that raise a suspicion, they are often 
prepared in a very clumsy manner, with lot of spelling 
errors and sometimes they are even incoherent, and I am 
also using a word there to say that they are also 
unintelligible when you read it, that becomes a common 
denominator, it does not even matter whether they were 
coming 
from 
State 
Security 
Agency 
or 
from 
Crime 
Intelligence.  So you will not have those reports which 
deals with the Domestic Intelligence as their defence is 
20 
concerned, and there is a reason for that.   They fall under 
a particular regime, but that is how these reports are, you 
are asking yourself who is writing them and if they are 
submitted to anybody what are those senior officials saying 
about these reports. 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 356 of 371 
 
 
Not that I want them to be coherent and so forth 
and so forth, but I am seeking a standard ...[indistinct], 
they are dealing with lives and rights of individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No but they must be coherent.  They 
must be coherent and they must, when you look at them, 
when you read them they must show some seriousness 
because they deal with serious issues and as you say 
people’s lives and if they are to be taken seriously I would 
have thought that any report that is going to be sent to the 
President of the country would be a proper report and not 
10 
something that really looks something that has not been 
prepared by people who are serious. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In addition to the features you 
mentioned, you mention here in paragraph 117 that the 
identity of the compiler of the report is more often than 
not, not stated or evident. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, it is not stated in those reports.  I 
understand the security requirements but you cannot just 
have a report that you do not link to anybody, there should 
at least be a code name or even a number, these people 
20 
they will have numbers, so that they can know when they 
pay me, when they grade my report, they know that I am 
the one who compiled that report, but this one the one that 
was dealing with General Sibiya and Mr Robert McBride  in 
fact it was written a compiler but it was left blank, not 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 357 of 371 
 
knowing that when it was given to me maybe they would 
have tippexed that but I was expecting that the bare 
minimum at least I could find at least a code name or a 
number linked to the compiler. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the Chair has pointed out 
something which is very important and there is repeating 
that what is significant is not only who compiles the report 
and how the report comes about but the fact that people in 
senior position are prepared to make use of such reports, 
to take action against people. 
10 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps you can go on from line 3 
of paragraph 117, and just put that on record please. 
DR DINTWE:   You wanted me to read from? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes please, line 3, you have dealt 
with the first three lines of 117. 
DR DINTWE:    
“There seems to be no recourse for the citizens 
whose integrity and careers are destroyed by these 
reports.   Even in cases where the compilers are 
20 
known.   It is my view that these reports are relied 
upon fully knowing that they will not stand up in 
court as they achieve and they may not achieve the 
desired effect of removing key persons who stand in 
their way.” 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 358 of 371 
 
Maybe I must just repeat that, I made a mistake. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Read that sentence again yes. 
DR DINTWE:   Yes. 
“It is my view that these reports are relied upon full 
knowing that they will not stand up in court as they 
achieve 
their 
desired 
effect 
of 
removing 
key 
persons who stand in the way of State Capture from 
their positions.   The deleterious effect of this is 
that the names of these persons are irreparably 
damaged by these reports as by the time the cases 
10 
are withdrawn against them it is too late, their 
careers have been damaged.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, in paragraph 118 Dr 
Dintwe you deal with a new topic and that is irregular 
appointments ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before you proceed Mr Pretorius 
can I ask this question, to the extent that during your time 
you may have had the experience of investigating reports 
that 
are 
legitimate, 
that 
legitimately 
come 
from 
the 
Intelligence Services, are you able to say generally 
20 
speaking those that alert you to make do not have these 
features that you have identified in regard to the reports 
that seem not to be legitimate? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct Chair, the other reports will 
go through a vigorous – a vigorous process that I do not 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 359 of 371 
 
want to divulge here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no that is fine. 
DR DINTWE:   But it will not move from person A to person 
B and end there, there will be checks and balances 
throughout the system to an extent that some of them I 
think that they will be discarded and if there were compiled 
by 
somebody 
who 
was 
expecting 
some 
kind 
of 
remuneration they will not then be remunerated because 
they will be “useless”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
10 
DR DINTWE:   And you can see that – you can see the 
...[indistinct] Chair, it is only in this instance you want to 
look at those reports that are suspect, those reports that 
you 
could 
have 
some 
allegations 
that 
it 
was 
used 
knowingly to really with somebody who was standing 
against malfeasance or corruption, so there is a clear 
distinction between that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say generally they will, the 
legitimate ones, will have a compiler even if just a code 
that is given in terms of the compiler or the author and 
20 
then you say even in terms of the quality of the report it is 
different 
from 
these 
other 
ones 
in 
terms 
of 
how 
professional they look.   
DR DINTWE:   It is far better, in fact Chairperson they 
made a presentation to me with regard to an issue which 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 360 of 371 
 
came into the public domain about the intention of some 
group in Bloemfontein who wanted to attend the conference 
in 2012, very professional, even including the slides, 
where it started, where they registered the project and so 
forth, I was so much impressed and when you take that 
report and compare it to these ones that I have been 
mentioning here you can just see that no, no, no this one 
did not really go through the ordinary process of producing 
any grievance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair in relation to a query that 
you raised and comments made earlier about the so-called 
check-mate report, that was used at the meeting of the Top 
Six or referred to at the meeting of the Top Six, if I can just 
place on record and it is perhaps apt to do so in this 
context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I have in front of me the affidavit 
of Ms Duarte and at paragraph 10 of that affidavit she 
says: 
20 
“At a meeting of the officials on 27 March 2017 
former President Zuma informed the officials of an 
intelligence report which made reference to a 
meeting that Minister Gordhan had attended in 
London.  He did not produce the report but said that 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 361 of 371 
 
the contents gave him great discomfort.” 
That evidence is confirmed by Mr Mantashe who says in 
paragraph 10 of his affidavit, and I will put the references 
on the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“At a meeting of the officials on 27 March 2017 
former President Zuma informed the officials of an 
intelligence report which made reference to a 
meeting that Minister Gordhan had attended in 
10 
London.   He did not produce the report but said it 
gave him great discomfort.” 
And then it goes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And those are in Exhibit JGZ and I 
am not sure that these pages consist, I will ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think those affidavits have not been 
as far as I know have not been admitted as yet. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, well perhaps they should be, 
but I shall ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well they should in due course but my 
recollection is that they have – there has not been an 
occasion for them to be admitted, but we have obtained 
them. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we will see to that or discuss 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 362 of 371 
 
that with you in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 118 you deal with a 
new topic and that is instances of irregular appointments 
within the Intelligence Services, would you tell the Chair 
about those please. 
DR 
DINTWE: 
 
 
Yes, 
the 
problem 
about 
irregular 
appointments Chair is that they create instability, firstly, 
but they also create a fertile environment for State Capture 
itself because sometimes it is not only about this irregular 
10 
appointment but it is about the person that is being put in 
that particular position.  So we have made several adverse 
findings with regard to both the State Security Agency but 
also with the Crime Intelligence with – where recruitment 
procedures were not followed.  In certain instances there 
will be no criteria at all, you will ask which criteria do you  
use to recruit these people, they will just say that no it is 
not there.  Some of the positions will not be advertised, 
and those are the examples, but I have got a specific 
example here because it is of a senior person who was 
20 
appointed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, you give several examples 
but as I understand the point you make in the paragraphs 
that 
following, 
paragraph 
118, 
is 
that 
where 
proper 
procedures aren’t followed it does open the door to undue 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 363 of 371 
 
influence being exercised and other irregularities, do I 
understand you correctly. 
DR DINTWE:   That is my submission and my argument. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you give those examples in 
paragraphs 119, 120, right through to paragraph 124, is 
that correct? 
DR DINTWE:   That’s correct Chairperson.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, is there anything you wish 
to emphasize there for the Chair? 
DR DINTWE:   Let me emphasize this other one because it 
10 
is done by Minister Bongani Bongo, the former Minister, so 
there is this position ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that paragraph 119? 
DR DINTWE:   It will be paragraph 119, so there is this 
position 
at 
NICOC 
so 
NICOC, 
National 
Intelligence 
Coordinating Committee is led by a Director General, but it 
is seen as part of the Intelligence Service, ja, the Director 
General of the State Security Agency is the accountable 
...[indistinct] for NICOC, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That’s the National Intelligence 
20 
Coordinating Committee. 
DR 
DINTWE: 
 
 
Ja, 
the 
Intelligence 
Coordinating 
Committee, so in that they had – there was a vacancy, but 
they did not advertise that particular vacancy and what 
happened is that Minister Bongo on his third or fourth day, 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 364 of 371 
 
we can check because I have the full report in the bundle 
there ...[intervenes]  
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
And 
you 
investigated 
this 
...[intervenes]     
DR DINTWE:   I investigated and I produced that report.  
So what happened is that he met then with the head of 
NICOC and he instructed the head of NICOC to produce a 
submission which then will come to him for approval but 
obviously it will go through the other signatories like a 
recommender, it will be a compiler/recommender and I 
10 
think maybe sometimes a second recommender maybe from 
H R and then it will be approved. 
 
Appointing this particular member to a level of a 
programme manager and the reason that he provided to the 
head of NICOC was only to say that he knows this 
gentleman and he also knows that this gentleman is raising 
his kids alone because he lost his wife, so his argument I 
think that it was just to say that put him somewhere 
because he does not have a secondary you know income 
like other families will have, that was the reason that was 
20 
provided to the head of NICOC. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now however kind-hearted the 
gesture may have been what are the dangers that are 
attached to that sort of conduct? 
DR DINTWE:   It is that obviously those people will be 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 365 of 371 
 
gratified to the appointing officers so they can be told to do 
anything and they will really, really do that because I mean 
this was unexpected and it created a lot of problems also 
because there were then grievances from the other people 
who said that we could have contested for this position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was this person who was the beneficiary 
of this decision, was it somebody that was a member of 
SSA already or was it somebody from outside? 
DR DINTWE:   No a member of SSA already Chairperson, 
but they were placed at NICOC. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was a question of them being put 
into NICOC? 
DR DINTWE:   No, no, no it is in NICOC and then they are 
taking from let’s level 2 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Promoted? 
DR DINTWE:   ...to level 3 within NICOC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that they can earn higher? 
DR DINTWE:   Exactly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Right, 
did 
you 
make 
any 
20 
recommendation as a consequence of your investigation? 
DR DINTWE:   I made recommendations but I should have 
mentioned that he only spent a week in that promoted 
position, the position that he was promoted and then he 
was then appointed to become somebody higher than an 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 366 of 371 
 
acting deputy coordinator. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So he received two promotions? 
DR DINTWE:   Two promotions in a space of a month and 
yes of course I sent the recommendations to the Minister of 
State Security. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    You sent a recommendation to 
remedy the position or the situation?   
DR 
DINTWE: 
 
 
That 
is 
correct 
Chairperson, 
our 
recommendations was that the appointment for that level 
should be withdrawn, secondly that it should be advertised, 
10 
so that everyone can take part on that, but there was 
something where we also recommended sometime of 
disciplinary measures to be taken. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
DR DINTWE:   Because one of the junior members who 
works at HR in that entity his signature was then forged in 
that submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To recommend? 
DR DINTWE:   I think it will be a compiler but somewhere it 
will be a line of signatures and as I am saying that he 
20 
doesn’t make decisions but normally it will go to him to 
check whether the recruitment process, the selection 
process was so when he affixes his signature it is to say 
that I have assisted my principals to ensure that all 
processes are followed, but during that time he could 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 367 of 371 
 
remember very well that he was in Cape Town, he was not 
in Pretoria so his signature was forged. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how long ago did you submit your 
report to the Minister, more or less?  Or which year were 
you investigating this matter? 
DR DINTWE:   I do have a file of 120, I have got some few 
dates there, ...[indistinct] will need. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it must have been latter part of 
2019 and 2020, the early part of 2020? 
DR DINTWE:   Yes, so Chairperson I investigated that 
10 
matter, I made recommendations but at the time that I was 
writing 
this 
affidavit 
that 
recommendation 
– 
those 
recommendations were not yet implemented. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And as far as you know as you sit there 
have they been complied with? 
DR DINTWE:   No, no, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you been told that maybe the 
Minister doesn’t agree with your recommendation for the 
following reasons, a, b, c, d?  Has she told you anything 
20 
along those lines? 
DR DINTWE:   Ja, no Minister then after I think several 
follow ups she wrote to me agreeing with our findings and 
our recommendations. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is on the 22 n d of February 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 368 of 371 
 
2020? 
DR DINTWE:  Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Those recommendations have not 
yet been implemented. 
DR DINTWE:   Not yet implemented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so she has agreed with your 
recommendation but the implementation has not taken 
place almost a year after she indicated that she agreed 
with them? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So there were two problems as I 
understand it, one was your finding that a minister had 
exercised what I presume you regard as undue influence, 
is that correct?   
DR DINTWE:   That is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In the process of appointment, but 
secondly that the process itself was irregular? 
DR DINTWE:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And your recommendations have 
20 
not been implemented yet? 
DR 
DINTWE: 
 
 
The 
recommendations 
are 
not 
yet 
implemented.  But there was a series of ...[indistinct] of 
ministers during that period yet the appointment is done by 
Minister Bongani Bongo and then we had Minister Letsatse 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 369 of 371 
 
Duba, she wasn’t there for long, clearly I cannot recall 
whether I would have written to her but then she was just 
replaced by Minister Ayanda Dlodlo who I am certain that I 
would have written to her, not once Chairperson. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then in paragraph 121 you 
refer to another example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Pretorius it might be 
appropriate to establish from Minister Dlodlo what the 
position is because I think that when these oversight 
bodies 
make 
recommendations 
the 
relevant 
authority 
10 
should apply their minds, take a view whether they have  a 
problem with complying and if they think they have  a 
problem at least they should say so and give their reasons 
and it may well be that in regard to some of these maybe 
they might have to go to court to set aside, I am not sure, 
but one shouldn’t have a situation where there is absolute 
silence or there’s agreement with the recommendation but 
for a long time nothing happens. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will do a request for 
information Chair, I am sure we will get a response. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A similar circumstance arises in 
paragraph 121 but I see we are over time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was thinking now maybe I shouldn’t say 
anything but as long as you are pointing ... 
21 APRIL 2021 – DAY 379 
 
Page 370 of 371 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well Chair I am in your hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] no because I think I promised 
that we would adjourn at half past let us adjourn but there 
are going to be days when I am going to ask everybody 
that we all be strong and move much – move beyond eight, 
go to nine and so on, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will inform those accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ja, but that is fine, let us stop now.  
I think we should talk Mr Pretorius to arrange another 
evening session for Dr Dintwe to try and finish his 
10 
evidence. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair if we are able to start 
around four we will finish in one last session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, so – but there is a possibility that 
my evenings next week are full, there is that possibility, 
and if they are full I was thinking whether it might not be a 
good idea to look at a morning in terms of which we could 
say let’s start at eight, so by ten o’clock we might be done 
and then I continue with the witness for the day if we 
arrange that, how does that sound to you? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair that is fine, as long as it 
is
