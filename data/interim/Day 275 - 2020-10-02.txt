PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 02 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson we are ready to start.  
This is a hearing end of the BOSASA stream and this 
hearing today is as a result of Mr Cedrick Frolick.  He 
applied after he heard the evidence of Mr Agrizzi and after 
he had been served with 3.3 notices.   
10 
He applied for permission to file an affidavit and 
testify.  He has now filed – he filed an affidavit and today 
he is testifying in respect of those.  He filed two affidavits 
and then in August he filed a third affidavit which deals 
with only specific witnesses.   
Chair as the application and the affidavits are in a 
bundle – the BOSASA bundle and it is BOSASA Bundle 3.  
And 
then 
the 
affidavit, 
the 
application 
and 
the 
accompanying affidavits the – we marked them as Exhibit 
T17 but then the separate affidavits they have sub-17 
20 
number to T17.1, .2, .3 as we go along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said too many things Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Okay let me start with the first 
one.  The first one is today the file before you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is – there is BOSASA Bundle 03. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 4 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That has got Mr Frolick’s affidavit 
according to what you – has been written on the spine it is 
proposed that what is inside the file would be exhibits – 
Exhibit what T17. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which file do you want me to have here?  
Is it this one I have or is it another one? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is that file only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us… 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us deal with that one for now.  It is 
BOSASA Bundle 3. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can the witness then be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us – let us – let Counsel for Mr 
Frolick place himself on record first.  You can do it from 
where you are. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  May I remain seated? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    Chairperson name is Francois Van Zyl 
SC for – member of the Cape Bar.  I represent Mr Frolick in 
these proceedings on instructions from Danie Gouws 
Incorporated.  My instructing attorney is not here for cost 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 5 of 148 
 
saving purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    We are prepared to give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    He has previously applied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    To give evidence.  You gave him 
permission to give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    And that is why we are here today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no thank you. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    May this – there is one correction I 
have to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    I wonder if I should not make it now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay make it now so we get it out of the 
way. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    If you can go in Exhibit T17 to page 
34 paragraph 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 34? 
20 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you using the black numbers ha? 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    I am using the black numbers left top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    Paragraph 12.  The last sentence 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 6 of 148 
 
third line – first last line reads: 
“Travel 
arrangements 
were 
managed 
by 
EPRU office.  I only subsequently learned 
in a discussion with Cheeky Watson during 
Mr Agrizzi’s evidence that Blake’s Travel 
was the travel service provider to the 
EPRU” 
That should read to BOSASA not the EPRU – to BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  Okay I think what we will 
be necessary is later on for Mr Frolick to just do two lines 
10 
– one line supplementary affidavit to correct that. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    And may I also draw your attention to 
the fact that we have yesterday been sent a whole bundle 
of cell phone records.  I only received it when I arrived in 
Johannesburg and we only had very little time last – 
yesterday evening – yesterday afternoon late to look at it.  
It was virtually impossible because it is a spreadsheet and 
the computer only shows half the page.  It was very 
20 
difficult but Mr Frolick [00:05:19] did it and he is prepared 
to answer questions as best he can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    If he has a problem he will tell you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He will say so. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 7 of 148 
 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   And then we will have to take it from 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    Thank you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Notshe.  So I then please 
administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR FROLICK:  Cedrick Thomas Frolick. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
10 
MR FROLICK:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence 
you will give shall be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and 
say, I truly affirm. 
MR FROLICK:  I fully affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much you may be seated 
Mr Frolick. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Frolick I am sure before we 
started I took you – I show you the record and then let me 
20 
put it on record that we – we are using when we refer 
numbers – page numbers we are using the black numbers.  
You see it is called BOSASA – 3 and then – then there will 
be a number.  That is the page number we are referring to.  
You understand?  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 8 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:  I understand Chair. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Frolick… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you agree nodding will not be enough 
because the recording will not capture that so you need to 
say yes so that it is recorded. 
MR FROLICK:  My apologies Deputy Chief Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR FROLICK:  I agree. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Frolick can I take you to page 
8 that is the black page 8 and there you see an affidavit.  It 
10 
is a document called affidavit and it says: 
“I, the undersigned, Cedric Thomas Frolick” 
Do you see that? 
MR FROLICK:  You mean page 8 now? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 8? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 8 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR FROLICK:  Okay I have got the page. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Are you on the page? 
20 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You see the document named affidavit 
then Cedric Thomas Frolick, you see that? 
MR FROLICK:  I see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then go to page 12. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 9 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Notshe I am sorry I am interrupting 
you.  Do take note that that affidavit is just a condonation 
affidavit only. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes no I am just putting this – I am just 
putting it on the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why do we need a condonation 
affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Well the document is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have passed that stage is it not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes I am not going to lead on it but just 
10 
putting it on record as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you would go to his substantive 
affidavit.  The one where he tells his story. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No that is fine.  Then in passing Mr 
Frolick can you go to page 31.  There is an affidavit and 
then go to – can you go to page 42?   
MR FROLICK:  I am on page 42. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes there is – there is a signature 
above the name C T Frolick, is that your signature? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You confirm that this is your affidavit? 
MR FROLICK:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair can this affidavit of Mr Frolick 
then from page 31 – Mr Frolick just a minute.  Yes I am just 
looking at the exhibit number.  As Exhibit 17.4.  Yes.  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 10 of 148 
 
T17.4.  No Chair I am sorry I beg your pardon.  It is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is 17.1? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No I beg your pardon it is 17.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh where will be 17.1? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  17.1 is the index to the application.  
17.4 is the affidavit which is the application affidavit.  Then 
17.3. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Is 
17.1 
meant 
to 
the 
condonation 
affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Condonation application.  17.2 is the 
supporting affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us – let us do – let us do it even 
though we do not really need it.  If that is – that is already 
what is in the index.  But otherwise the condonation thing 
is something of the past.  We do not need it anymore.  
Okay so we start at page 8? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Let us go back – Mr Frolick can you go 
back to page 8 where –  
20 
MR FROLICK:  I am on page 8. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then if you turn to page – hold on 
page 8 and turn to page 12, is that your signature on page 
12? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 11 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Do you confirm that this is your 
affidavit? 
MR FROLICK:  I do confirm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Chair can this be admitted as 
17.2? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a T before 17? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  T17.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  T17.2 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where is Point 1 – 17.1? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  17.1 is the Notice of Motion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us – let us do that because now 
when they prepare the records there will be a problem 
when they can see 17.2 but they do not know where 17.1 
is.  So we may… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  17.1 starts Chair at 04.  Page 04. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but we do not need to do the index to.  
I think we should start at 6 where the Notice of Motion 
starts, is it not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Well the index forms part of the … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do they do that?   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not feeling you know happy about 
the fact that I am now going to admit as an exhibit a 
condonation affidavit when condonation is not an issue. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 12 of 148 
 
You know when that has been dealt with sometime back. 
But I was thinking not to mess up the index maybe we may 
as well do that but actually the condonation affidavit is 
irrelevant. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But do you not need it for purposes of 
record to say he applied for condonation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is been sorted out.  Ja that has 
been sorted out.  We do not need it for this.  I condoned it 
ended there.  You see. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at this stage we should be looking 
simply at the substantive issues. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us just say – let us say it is 
okay Exhibit T17.1 is the Notice of Motion.  Is that right? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us just – so that the index – the 
pagination is not messed up.  Then the affidavit starting at 
page 8 will be Exhibit T17.2, is that right? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay. 
 
That 
is 
together 
with 
its 
annexures. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then when is the – which one would 
be 17.3? 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 13 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  17.3 starts on page 33 – 31 I beg your 
pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Frolick’s affidavit that starts at page 
31 will be admitted and marked as Exhibit T17.3. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What else? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Mr Frolick can we then take 
you to page 54.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There is an affidavit there Mr Frolick 
10 
and the signature of that is on page  
CHAIRPERSON:  65. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Signature is on page 65.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Has he confirmed? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You confirm that Mr Frolick? 
MR FROLICK:  I am still trying to get to page 64 or 65 my 
apologies. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the – apparently the mask is not 
– is stopping the sound.  He is messing – it is interfering 
with the sound.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not stopping or it is? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is interfering with the sound of the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So the transcribers the – 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes the – received a note. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 14 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They cannot hear okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes they cannot hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Frolick what is – what is your attitude 
to removing it while you are giving evidence? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson I do not have any problem with 
it 
however 
in 
one 
of 
the 
correspondence 
that 
we 
communicated to this commission I indicated that I tested 
positive for Covid-19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  And that I have recovered from that but I 
10 
am still sitting with the after effects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  Of the impact that it had on my system.  So 
with your permission I am prepared to remove the mask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I mean from my side and I am 
sure from the side of everybody one would not mind if you 
put it on as long as we can hear you and those who are 
recording are able to hear you.  But if we cannot hear you 
or those who are recording cannot hear you then we cannot 
proceed because there needs to be a record.   
20 
So – but I – I mean I remember I know what you are 
talking about.  I know what you are talking about.  I am 
wondering whether – whether if you raise your voice more 
whether that might assist.   
Okay let us try with him raising his voice more and 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 15 of 148 
 
then we will see whether we can hear in the first place. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then whether they can hear. 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson I am prepared to remove the 
mask if you want to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I do not want you to feel 
uncomfortable but I am – that is why I was just saying if – 
the bottom line is that we must hear you.  I know that 
sometimes I do not know whether certain masks enable 
people to be heard even if they have them on but others 
10 
you cannot hear them.  Okay no that is alright then.  Okay.  
Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then Mr Frolick we were on – I asked 
you to confirm on page 65 whether that signature is yours? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then you confirmed that this 
affidavit if your affidavit? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Chair can this then be marked 
T17.4? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Frolick’s affidavit that starts at page 
54 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit T17.4. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then Chair there was an affidavit which 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 16 of 148 
 
was filed by Mr Gibson Njenje Lizo - Gibson Njenje.  That 
affidavit has never been part of the record but I am of the 
view that this is the opportune time that we place it on 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Because it deals with the – this 
witness.  The affidavit is on page 79.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can that be marked as Exhibit T17.6?  
T17.6. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit T17.? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Point 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  6. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes point 6 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair then on page 68 – 68 there – 
telephone records that my learned friend referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can those be admitted as T17.5? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit T17.5.  Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Chair that is the housekeeping 
exercise.  Can we then proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Frolick. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  Chair I am sorry to interrupt but 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 17 of 148 
 
[00:20:35] housekeeping. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  There is also a further affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  By Mr Frolick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  That was filed dealing with the affidavit 
of Mr Brian Blake of Blake’s Travels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  And with this affidavit of Mr Njenje. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  And attached to that affidavit is also an 
affidavit by Daniel John Watson or Cheeky Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  I think it is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  That that also be placed before the 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Where are those two – are they 
20 
here? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  They – we tried to print them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  In the local printer but we find that we 
– it is too voluminous. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 18 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is – but it is being brought up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay that is alright so… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And I must also put on record that they 
were kind enough to give me a copy of the affidavit – not 
the – not the annexures but the affidavit of Mr Frolick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so you will raise the… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  When we get there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later on ja okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Mr Frolick is it correct that you 
through your legal representatives you applied or Leave to 
File affidavits to the commission? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And that was your application to file an 
affidavit you thought to respond to the evidence of Mr 
Agrizzi? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And his affidavits? 
20 
MR FROLICK:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now you have filed the affidavit that we 
have referred to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr – I am sorry Mr Notshe it might be 
good for the purposes of those who are listening or 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 19 of 148 
 
watching to first give a brief background to Mr Frolick’s 
evidence because it starts with Mr Agrizzi giving certain 
evidence relating to him. So that people can follow as you 
put questions to him.  The gist of what Mr Agrizzi said in 
implicating him. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the evidence of Mr Agrizzi was to 
the effect that he was introduced to Mr Frolick by Mr 
Cheeky Watson the brother of Mr – the late Gavin Watson 
and subsequent to that they met and Mr Agrizzi – I am 
sorry Mr Agrizzi says then Mr Frolick visited the BOSASA 
10 
complex and accompanied with a Parliamentarian. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry Mr Notshe.  I think the – I 
think the story starts with Mr Agrizzi saying BOSASA had 
certain challenges.   
There was negative publicity about them and their 
contracts with the Department of Correctional Services and 
they had sought to – they had been trying to have meetings 
with Mr Smith who was Chairperson of the Correctional 
Services Portfolio Committee in Parliament at the time and 
Mr Smith was not positive towards them – had a negative 
20 
attitude towards them.   
They were not getting an appointment with him and 
then at a certain stage I think he says Mr Cheeky Watson 
or Mr Gavin Watson told you that – told him about Mr 
Frolick and then bla, bla, bla. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 20 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Cheeky Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so I think that is how it starts then you 
can continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  And then they visited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ja a visit was arranged for Mr Frolick 
together with the Parliamentarian Mr Komphela – Butana 
Komphela to the BOSASA business park it was called 
Mogale Business Park. There was a meeting held where he 
was introduced and then he says there – and then – then 
10 
they discussed the issue of Mr – they discussed the issue 
of meeting Mr Vincent Smith and then at some stage Mr 
Gavin Watson excused himself and he went to his vault and 
he came with a bag, security bag and later on he gave it to 
Mr Frolick.  
And 
thereafter 
there 
was 
– 
the 
meeting 
was 
arranged – there are details that Mr Frolick came back to 
say Mr Vincent Smith did not receive the letter but the 
upshot of that was that a meeting was arranged for Mr 
Agrizzi together with Mr Njenje to see Mr Vincent Smith in 
20 
Cape Town in Parliament.  They went and visited him.   
He says it was a short visit and thereafter Mr 
Frolick took them and they had lunch with him and then 
they flew back.  And then he says at some stage he was 
asked by Mr Gavin Watson to take some money to Port 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 21 of 148 
 
Elizabeth to the house of Mr Valance Watson wherein they 
waited there and Mr Frolick arrived.   
There was a discussion about local politics and 
then he also talked to Mr Frolick and thereafter as they 
were leaving Mr Valance Watson gave the parcel of money 
to Mr – to Mr Frolick.  And thereafter there was also the – 
because BOSASA was having a problem in Parliament and 
they also wanted to meet Mr Masutha and – who was then 
at that stage the Minister of Justice and Correctional 
Services.   
10 
Then an opportunity they saw was that there was 
going to be a political rally in Port Elizabeth where Mr 
Masutha was going to attend.  Then they arranged that Mr 
Masutha must be accommodated at one of the houses 
owned by Valance Watson and that happened but Mr 
Watson could not meet Mr Masutha.   
And then another issue was the – BOSASA had a 
problem with the Department of Correctional Services 
because they had tendered and their view was that they 
were the lowest tendered but despite that they did not win 
20 
the tender.  So they sought to – they sought to challenge 
that tender.   
And you will – and Mr Agrizzi says he was at home 
sick and papers had been drafted and all of a sudden Mr 
Gavin Watson came to his house together with their 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275

lawyers and he told him that the matter no longer going 
ahead.  They have been advised by politicians not to 
proceed with the matter.  They were told that will be 
suicide.   
Then Mr Agrizzi insisted that Mr Frolick should be 
called so that he Agrizzi can confirm what Mr Gavin Watson 
was saying to him about Mr Frolick.  So the call was placed 
on Mr Frolick – to Mr Frolick and the phone was put on a 
speaker phone and then Mr Frolick instructed them that 
they should not proceed with the matter and the matter was 
10 
not proceeded with.   
And he said – Agrizzi says he was very upset as a 
result he chased the team away from his home.  That is the 
sum total of the evidence of Mr Agrizzi and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think – I think the gist of it is that 
Mr Agrizzi said Mr Frolick facilitated their access to Mr 
Vincent Smith after Mr Vincent Smith had not been 
agreeing to see them and he said Mr Frolick facilitated that 
after he had been given some money by BOSASA. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  So I just wanted to make 
sure that … 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because some of his evidence was led 
some time back. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 23 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – why – who would be listening they 
can see where it fits in. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Where it is going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the – how the – then the 
evidence you – Chair you must have heard – seen that 
there are a number of affidavits that had been put together.  
What has happened is the – Mr Frolick filed his affidavit 
and – and applying to lead evidence.  And then he dealt 
10 
with the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi and Mr Agrizzi answered to 
that and then Mr Frolick replied to that.  And then the latest 
is and it is now reply to the affidavit of Mr Njenje and Mr 
Johan Blake, the affidavit which is outstanding which we will 
come to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Frolick, you have heard when I was 
summarising the gist of the issues today.  And although you 
have filed the affidavit... you filed an affidavit.  It has been 
heard and it reads smoothly and it is understandable if, for 
20 
instance, you give a summary of your version of the events.  
Can you do that?  But you are free to always look in the 
affidavit to check, if you want to check some issues in your 
affidavit.   
MR FROLICK:   Yes. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 24 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you start with the issue of, when 
did you meet Mr Agrizzi for the first time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Maybe let us start... 
Mr Frolick, you are a member of parliament, is that right? 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you become a member of 
parliament for the first time? 
MR FROLICK:   1999, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1999.  And you are a resident in the 
Eastern Cape? 
10 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that means you have been a 
member of parliament close... over 20-years? 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Over 20-years.  When did you meet Mr 
Agrizzi or Mr Gavin Watson for the first time? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, I met Mr Gavin Watson through 
the acquaintance of Mr Cheeky Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   He is the brother of Mr Gavin Watson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   And we have been involved in the non-racial 
sport movement ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   ...in the Eastern Cape.  I initially met 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 25 of 148 
 
Cheeky and after that I met the brothers ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   ...including Mr Gavin Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   The first time I met Mr Agrizzi was when he 
visited the parliament with Mr Njenje. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  Take it from there Mr 
Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And ...[intervenes]  
MR VAN ZYL:   Chair, if I may interrupt?  Perhaps to get the 
10 
chronology correct.  If the witness can just tell you from 
when he had this relationship with Mr Gavin Watson and the 
other Watsons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Frolick, if you are happy to do so, you 
can just tell your story as you wish to tell it and at a certain 
stage, Mr Notshe can then ask you questions.  But if you 
want to just deal with one, two, three points and then let Mr 
Notshe lead you, that is fine.  But if you want to just tell the 
story, starting from your relationships with the Watsons and 
so on, it is fine. 
20 
MR FROLICK:   Thank you, Chairperson.  I prefer to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
MR FROLICK:   To tell the story, to give the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   I think that is context is important. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 26 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, my relationship with Mr Daniel 
Watson, also known as Cheeky Watson, started in the late 
1980’s when I was still a student at university and became 
involved in non-racial sports and politics and we became 
personal friends. 
 
And subsequently to that, being elected to member of 
parliament, I served on the Sport and Recreation Committee 
in the National Assembly. 
 
And from 2004, I was part of the team that worked with 
10 
other local rugby administrators in the Eastern Cape to 
support the rejuvenation of rugby in the Eastern Cape 
Region as a whole. 
 
This initiative was strongly supported by the late 
Minister of Sport and Recreation, the late Reverend Arnold 
Stofile, as well as the then Chairperson of the Portfolio 
Committee, Mr Butana Komphela .   
 
In 2006/2007, Mr Cheeky Watson was elected as 
President of Eastern Province Rugby and immediately I was 
roped in as an advisor to Eastern Province Rugby and that is 
20 
where I was introduced to the other brothers who were 
involved in sport and all of them were also involved in the 
African National Congress. 
 
A very strong emphasis was placed on building and 
rebuilding the rugby situation in the Eastern Cape, especially 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 27 of 148 
 
in light of the decision that was taken by the government to 
build a new multi-billion rand sports stadium in Nelson 
Mandela Metro. 
 
The late Reverend Arnold Stofile informed me that, 
together with others, that they had to fight to get the stadium 
there.   
 
And one of the reasons that was raised, dealt with this 
phase, sustainability post the World Cup and thus, it was 
important for us and I...  
 
My constituency is in Nelson Mandela Metro in Port 
10 
Elizabeth, that we put a team together, working with the 
rugby administrators on the one hand but also working with 
the sport administrators at times to ensure that we get 
professional rugby and professional soccer to the stadium.  
And that was my involvement with that. 
 
Added to this strategy was also to encourage the hosting 
of other major sport and other events at the stadium and 
subsequent to the work that was done by the group 
collectively, we succeeded in hosting major international 
football and rugby matches including the International Rugby 
20 
Board Sevens for three years at the stadium. 
 
And we also secured two professional teams to use the 
stadium as their basis.  That is both the Southern Kings and 
Chippa United. 
 
During this period, I was a member of the ANC and the 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 28 of 148 
 
ANC 
whip 
on 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
on 
Sport 
and 
Recreation and worked very closely with all stakeholders.   
 
Although I initially only acted as an advisor to EP Rugby 
Union, I formally joined them on the board in 2012 and also 
served as a director on the board of the company, the 
Professional Arm of the Union. 
 
And it is a well-known fact that Eastern Province 
struggled financially and thus there were no demands made 
or any expectation for payment of services.  We did 
voluntarily with the understanding that logistical and travel 
10 
support would be provided when needed. 
 
These 
travel 
arrangements 
were 
managed 
by 
the 
Eastern Province Rugby office and I only learnt subsequently 
in the discussion 
with 
Mr 
Watson, after 
Mr Agrizzi’s 
evidence, that the travel agency that was used by Eastern 
Province Rugby Union at the time, is also or was also the 
service provider to BOSASA. 
 
That is the background to my involvement with the 
situation.  I want to get to the visit, if I may, Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
20 
MR FROLICK:   The visit to BOSASA Chairperson was 
initiated after there was discussions between Mr Cheeky 
Watson on the one hand and Mr Butana Komphela. 
 
Because Mr Watson mentioned that there was some 
youth facility where they are trying to get sport activities, 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 29 of 148 
 
soccer going at this youth facility on the BOSASA premises.  
 
And that they would like the parliamentarian to see it 
because at that stage, nobody was really aware as to what 
the exact operations were.  Everybody thought BOSASA was 
just dealing with one thing but in fact it was a group of 
companies. 
 
The purpose of the visit was to the youth centre that 
catered for these juvenile offenders and also to establish to 
what extent sport played in the process of rehabilitation of 
these youngsters. 
10 
 
The arrangements were made by Mr Watson.  I was 
requested by Mr Komphela to accompany to him, which I 
have one on numerous occasions before to other events and 
other meetings. 
 
Because as you may be aware that Mr Komphela has a 
physical disability and requires assistance and he was 
comfortable with me travelling with him.  And as such, over 
the years we have established a very close friendship both 
as comrades and also as friends.   
 
The visit to Johannesburg to BOSASA, Mr Watson 
20 
specifically requested me since I was going to be in 
Johannesburg to meet with a potential sponsor for Eastern 
Province Rugby Union in Johannesburg. 
 
We got to the BOSASA offices.  We went straight into 
the office.  I assume it was the office of Mr Watson.  And Mr 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 30 of 148 
 
Komphela was not happy with the programme that was 
arranged for the visit because it was said it will be quite a 
lengthy visit and it will require a bit of time for us to spend 
there. 
 
And since both of us had other commitments, we were 
not prepared for such a long visit and the specific reason 
why this visit was undertaken was in fact to go to the youth 
centre but those arrangements were not part of the plan. 
 
During that visit, we had a discussion with Mr Watson 
because I know Mr Gavin Watson.  I have known him through 
10 
his family.  I have regularly gone to their houses.  Politically 
they have been supporting us all the years.  So we had 
discussion about other things. 
 
And Mr Watson started complaining terrible about the 
bad 
treatment 
that 
he 
was 
getting 
from 
parliament 
specifically.   
 
He claimed that he was writing on behalf of his company 
numerous letters to the Portfolio Committee and Correctional 
Services and he does not even get a reply or a response to 
the letters. 
20 
 
He then also indicated that there is a narrative out that 
is in the media where the Portfolio Committee is giving an 
opportunity for certain information to be put in front of them 
without hearing the other side of the story. 
 
We then discussed it and we said that the best way we 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 31 of 148 
 
should approach it was to approach Mr Smit directly and I 
undertook to do it after the discussion with Mr Komphela 
because also at the social level, I am friends with Mr Smit 
and we were also together as colleagues in parliament. 
 
What happened during the interaction was when we were 
sitting there, I said but it is important if you want to go and 
visit the chairperson of a committee or parliamentary 
committee to write a letter and ask for an opportunity to do 
so. 
 
And Mr Watson reiterated and said but there is no 
10 
response.  I then said:  Okay write again to them and then I 
will talk to Mr Smit when I get to Cape Town which I did and 
then... I am summarising this part Chairperson.  If you wish 
me to go into details I will be able to do so.   
 
I had a discussion with Mr Smit and he said:  Man, you 
know, there are big problems surrounding this company.  And 
I said but it is important just to hear the other side.  You can 
meet them privately if you want to or you can take it to your 
committee. 
 
In fact, all... it is better to take it to the committee, I 
20 
reiterated also because all our meetings are open to the 
public.  Mr Smit then said he has not received anything from 
Mr Watson to request a meeting. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, Mr Frolick.  Now I do not want us 
to leave the visit.  The visit at the BOSASA complex. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 32 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, let us deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  I think what... unless I 
misunderstood.  I think what Mr Frolick wanted to do and I 
think his counsel wanted him to do, is to tell his story as he 
sees it to cover what he wants to cover. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, that is fine.  I do understand that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then... otherwise, you can go from the 
beginning. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let him cover what he wants to cover. 
MR FROLICK:   Then I am happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then after that, you can start from the 
beginning. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No.  Then I am happy, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR FROLICK:   No, thank you Chairperson.  That was also 
my understanding.  So I will proceed ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, proceed.  Ja. 
MR FROLICK:   ...with the arrangements that was made then 
for the visit to parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Watson then called me to say that they 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 33 of 148 
 
have sent the documents some time ago already and there 
was no reply.   
 
So I spoke to Mr Smit and he said:  Well, if they are in 
Cape Town on a certain day, then they can come and he will 
hear what they have to say and that is what happened.   
 
We did not expect Mr Agrizzi to visit.  That was not part 
of the discussion that... as far as Mr Watson was concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You did not expect? 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you expected Mr Watson. 
10 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR FROLICK:   He said he will come with the chairperson of 
the board, Mr Njenje to meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR FROLICK:   So we did not expect that.  So on a specific 
day, the meeting was arranged and I can clearly recall that I 
received a call from Mr Watson where he said he is not 
coming anymore but there are two people from his company 
and they are lost somewhere in parliament. 
20 
 
I found them in the passage and took them to my office 
and then I went to inform Mr Smit that they were there.  Mr 
Smit then said he does not really have time because he had 
another meeting to attend but he will quickly give them an 
ear and that is what he did. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 34 of 148 
 
 
He came in the office.  He extends and introduced one 
another.  At that specific point, my secretary came to call me 
out of my office because there was a sitting of parliament in 
the afternoon. 
 
At the time, I was also the programming work and it had 
something to do with the speakers’ list for that afternoon that 
we quickly needed to be resolved because it was about 
lunchtime.   
 
I then stepped out into the office just across from me to 
sort out the problem and on my return, they were no longer 
10 
there.  They had left.   
 
So I walked down the passage and towards the exit and I 
found Mr Njenje and Mr Agrizzi there, standing there and I 
asked:  So what happened?  Did you have time to discuss?  
And they said:  No, it did not go well.  They... Mr Smit was in 
a hurry and he left. 
 
I then, because it was lunchtime and we were standing 
virtually next to the old assembly restaurant.  I said to them:  
Well, I am going to have lunch here.  You, gentlemen, are 
welcome to join me and we had lunch.   
20 
 
And during the lunch conversation, Deputy Chief Justice, 
we discussed a number of other issues related to parliament.  
There was no tour that took place because we do not act as 
tour guides in parliament.  There is a specific unit that deals 
with that.  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 35 of 148 
 
 
But we walked past the old assembly where the original 
apartheid government sat and that is basically what I said.  
This is where they used to sit. 
 
We then had lunch and they reflected on the food that 
they were eating and the fact that they must rush back to 
Johannesburg and that was it. 
 
Insofar as Mr Agrizzi allege that there was reference to 
me as the Chair of Chairs during the visit that I referred to at 
BOSASA is not correct because I was only elected.  And with 
your permission Chairperson, it is a term that is being used 
10 
Chair of Chairs.   
 
It is actually a house chairperson responsible for 
committees and other things.  So that is not correct.  I was 
only elected on the 18t h of November 2010 by the National 
Assembly as the House Chairperson, commonly referred to 
as a Chair of Chairs. 
 
I also deny that I received money from Mr Gavin Watson 
or any other person during that visit to BOSASA as alleged 
Mr Agrizzi.  
 
I wish to point that it out that I was in the company of Mr 
20 
Komphela for the duration of this visit and I just see it as an 
attempt by Mr Agrizzi to create an opportunity for me to be 
alone with Mr Gavin Watson because that did not take place.  
It is untrue and artificial. 
 
I have dealt with the meeting with Mr Smit and how it 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 36 of 148 
 
played out.  I want Chairperson also to refer to a very 
specific reference that was made by Mr Agrizzi in terms of an 
invoice from Blake’s Travel.   
 
And I can confirm that that was for accommodation when 
I attended a rugby test match between the Springboks and 
the All Blacks at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on the 
22n d 
of 
August 
in 
my 
capacity 
as 
an 
advisor 
and 
representative of Eastern Province Rugby Union. 
 
These arrangements were made by the office of Mr 
Cheeky Watson in his capacity as the president and I was 
10 
under the impression that that costs was born by Eastern 
Province Rugby Union and no one else. 
 
I want to get to the point on advise on litigation because 
I think it is a very important point.  I did not have a 
telephonic discussion with Mr Agrizzi as he originally stated 
in his first appearance in this Commission. 
 
I think Advocate Notshe referred to it that I received a 
call on a Wednesday morning just after quarter past nine 
from Mr Watson. 
 
And he was complaining, like he previously did about the 
20 
bad treatment and this and that and he saw it as a whole 
attempt to undermine him and the companies that he has and 
all this and that and that they want to litigate against the 
Department of Justice and Correctional Services. 
 
He told me that he was on speaker phone and that his 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 37 of 148 
 
attorney was there as well as two of his directors.  And he 
was referring litigating the department for not awarding 
tenders to them and destroying the company in the process. 
 
I indicated to him very clearly, and this can be attested 
to other people who were part of that conference call, that it 
was up to them ultimately to decide whether to continue or 
not but they should consider the impact the litigation could 
have on their future business relationships especially with 
government departments. 
 
Before terminating this short discussion, I reiterated it 
10 
and I told them that if they do feel they have a case, they 
should do what they think is in the best interest but that is 
just my view.  Free advice. 
 
Contrary to what Mr Agrizzi stated, I did not issue an 
instruction on the course of action to undertake or for them 
to stop litigation. 
 
Chairperson, if I may?  I want to continue now with 
another point ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR FROLICK:   ...that emanated in the evidence that was 
20 
given to this Commission by Mr Agrizzi on his first 
appearance and it deals with the accommodation of Minister 
Masutha.   
 
Shortly after the 2014 General Election, I was deployed 
by the African National Congress in the Eastern Cape as the 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 38 of 148 
 
convenor of the Basil February Detachment that conducts 
sectoral work amongst minority communities in the province.   
 
A number of other members of parliament, members of 
the legislator and councillors were at the time members of 
the detachment. 
 
And as the convenor I regularly interacted with the 
Provincial Secretary’s office on the work that we are doing 
as well as the relevant executive council members that at 
municipal, 
provincial 
or 
national 
government 
level 
to 
intervene where we see blockages in service delivery and 
10 
resolve these issues. 
 
My responsibilities also include, because I am still the 
convenor of that detachment Chairperson, the organising of 
sectoral activities, networking events and securing the 
relevant members of the executives to attend these events. 
 
In the run-up of the 2016 Local Government Elections, 
the detachment did extensive work in the Nelson Mandela 
Bay Metropolitan area because of our assessment that we 
are in trouble in that metro. 
 
Issues raised by the community and sectors related to 
20 
issues such as the recognition of the Khoi San, allocation of 
fishing 
rights, 
gangsterism, 
challenges 
related 
to 
the 
Criminal Justice System, the non-payment of maintenance 
that is received by courts to the beneficiaries and so forth. 
 
The detachment then decided it would be important to 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 39 of 148 
 
get the relevant minister or deputy minister to come and to 
address these issues. 
 
Because we were in the final stages for the preparing for 
the Local Government Election Rally, the launch of the ANC 
election manifesto for the local government that was held in 
Port Elizabeth subsequently. 
 
I conveyed the views of the detachment to the regional 
office 
and 
requested 
that 
they 
secure 
the 
relevant 
deployments 
but 
found 
it 
was 
difficult 
to 
secure 
the 
necessary confirmations from the relevant ministers and 
10 
deputy ministers. 
 
I informed the detachment that we have difficulties and 
some of them said:  But you are with these comrades for 
years in parliament.  Can you not approach some of them 
and ask them.  If they are coming to the rally on the 
Saturday, can they not arrive earlier so that they can interact 
with the community on some of these issues? 
 
I subsequently had a discussion and one of the 
colleagues I approached is Deputy Minister Bapela who 
confirmed that he would be in Port Elizabeth and that he is 
20 
available for such a networking event on the Friday evening.
 
He indicated to me that even though he is confirming, he 
is having difficulties or his office is having difficulties in 
securing accommodation in Port Elizabeth and he said the 
hotels were full. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 40 of 148 
 
 
I then asked one of my colleagues to check and they 
confirmed with hotels and B&B’s were full because of the 
number of people that was going to attend the launch or the 
manifesto. 
 
I asked him whether he knew of any other members of 
the executives who would be in PE before the launch of the 
manifesto and he indicated that he knows that Minister 
Masutha, the then Minister Masutha, could be in Port 
Elizabeth before the launch but that he was also struggling 
in securing accommodation. 
10 
 
And 
he 
confirmed 
what 
my 
colleague 
from 
the 
detachment said, hotels, Bed and Breakfast’s were full.  We 
showed around and some of our local contact agreed to 
make accommodation available that will be suitable to the 
members of the executive who will be attending. 
 
I contacted Minister Masutha, who confirmed his early 
arrival in Port Elizabeth and his availability to attend some of 
these activities. 
 
He requested me to contact his office, which I did, to 
make the necessary arrangements.  In contacting his office, 
20 
his office informed me of the difficulties they had.   
 
I informed them that there is local accommodation.  It is 
private accommodation that would be available but we need 
the member of the executives to attend some of our activities 
as well. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 41 of 148 
 
 
The office then requested accommodation for three 
evenings, from the Thursday to the Sunday for Minister 
Masutha and his staff.   
 
Arrangements were then made of the minister and his 
support staff which ultimately included four people to stay in 
a house made available for this purpose by the wife of 
Valence Watson. 
 
As it turned out Chairperson, the minister only arrived in 
Port Elizabeth on the Saturday morning of the launch of the 
manifesto and he did not attend any activities.   
10 
 
Upon realising that the accommodation was not going to 
be used because we could see no one is turning up, an 
attempt was made to get the keys from the house from the 
minister’s drive who arrived in Port Elizabeth earlier to 
allocate the accommodation to someone else. 
 
Unfortunately, the driver had to leave to Bloemfontein to 
collect the minister there because there were no flights 
available to Port Elizabeth and he took the keys with him. 
 
The accommodation for the minister could thus not be 
reallocated to anyone else.  It must be emphasised that the 
20 
arrangements was not only for the then Minister Masutha but 
also 
to 
a 
number 
of 
other 
comrades 
who 
required 
accommodation. 
 
For instance, I had to secure accommodation for the 
support staff of Deputy Minister Bapela who also could not 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 42 of 148 
 
get accommodation on the Friday and Saturday evenings. 
 
Mr Masutha thus only made use of the accommodation 
on the Saturday night.  On the Sunday morning, I phoned 
Minister Masutha to make arrangements for the keys to be 
collected. 
 
He asked me to express gratitude and appreciation for 
the utilisation of the house to the owner.  I told him that the 
owner would come and fetch the keys and he could thank the 
owner himself. 
 
Contrary to the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi, the house used by 
10 
the minister is in a residential area literally a few minutes 
away from Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium and not in a private 
estate. 
 
On the allegation that I received money from BOSASA, 
Gavin Watson and Valence Watson.  Chairperson, I wish to 
state that I did not receive money from BOSASA, Mr Gavin 
Watson or Valence Watson, let alone monthly payments as 
alleged by Mr Agrizzi in his supplementary affidavit. 
 
During 2014 before the General Election, I received 
amounts totalling about R 25 000,00 from Mr Valence Watson 
20 
as a contribution towards the ANC Election Funds. 
 
At the time, I served on the Finance and Fundraising 
Committee of the ANC in the region and I am still a member 
of that fund raising committee and these monies were 
properly handled and handed over to the Regional Secretary 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 43 of 148 
 
of the ANC and it was also confirmed by the Regional 
Treasurer. 
 
I do not recall a meeting that Mr Agrizzi is referring to 
the house of Mr Valence Watson in Port Elizabeth as alleged 
or for that matter, anywhere else in Port Elizabeth and I deny 
his evidence that I received money from Mr Valence Watson 
as testified by him. 
 
I respectfully point out that Mr Agrizzi did not indicate 
how I would have received these monthly payments from him 
but for the one payment he alleges that he took to Port 
10 
Elizabeth and gave to Mr Valence Watson which Mr Valence 
Watson then allegedly gave to me. 
 
Surely, if there was such monthly payments, there 
should have been a certain process or procedure to record 
it.  Furthermore, one would expect Mr Agrizzi to recall for 
what periods such months the amounts were made.   
 
One would also expect that some entry would have been 
made somewhere for the monthly payments to me.  Mr 
Agrizzi’s failure to give any detail on the alleged irregular 
payments speaks volumes and unfortunately, it also makes it 
20 
difficult for me Chairperson to respond comprehensively to it. 
 
I have to add that, during the course of 2013/2014, I 
received a desktop computer for my constituency office that 
was arranged by Mr Cheeky Watson for learners and 
students to assist them in their studies. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 44 of 148 
 
 
And I also received Chairperson, two shirts, two pairs of 
shoes and a belt from Mr Cheeky Watson some time on my 
birthday and I subsequently declared that in parliament in 
the members register. 
 
I also want to add Chairperson.  At the time these 
allegations were made, I specifically went to the Registrar of 
Members Interest to go and see what I have declared 
because over time, therefore, a long, you forget if you have 
declared something or not declared something. 
 
And at that stage, they were busy and that office was... 
10 
there was a temporary or acting registrar that was there and 
they had difficulty retrieving the documents because they 
had a new system that they were busy implementing. 
 
I then explained to the acting Registrar, Advocate 
Venara what the situation was and he indicated to me that:  
You know, some of these things that you are mentioning that 
your constituency office and this and that, it is not things 
that you received. 
 
But I said to him:  No, I still want to make sure that it is 
declared and that it is there, right?  And I submitted again 
20 
the annexure that was included into the Registrar of 
Members Interest. 
 
That, Chairperson, is my first affidavit in response to the 
allegations that were made by Mr Agrizzi and I thank you for 
your time. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 45 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  We are at tea-break time.  So 
I think we will take the tea-break and then when we come 
back Mr Notshe can start with questioning.  Is that alright? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us adjourn now.  We will resume 
at half-past eleven.  We adjourn. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Notshe? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, I have now – we have now 
printed the latest affidavit of Mr Frolick.  I am not certain 
whether we should just deal with it and then see he wants 
to comment on it and then have it as evidence and then I 
can then clarify certain issues with him. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think 
you 
should 
proceed 
with 
questioning and when you come to it – I mean, obviously 
he knows his affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sure, alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will just continue and question him. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, Mr Frolick, I understand - you 
say you were elected as a Member of Parliament in 1999, 
am I right?  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 46 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja.  And then if I understand you were 
orientated about the rules of parliament and the different 
functions, the committees and all that. 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you were also orientated on 
the functions of the portfolio committees. 
MR FROLICK:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And, if I understand correctly, the 
portfolio committees are – they have an oversight on their 
10 
portfolios, 
meaning 
there 
is 
even 
oversight 
on 
the 
functions of the executive, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:   Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And they interact with the executive, 
am I right? 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And they are not there to advise 
members 
of 
the 
public 
about 
their 
issues 
with 
the 
executive. 
MR FROLICK:   I do not agree with you. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What do you say? 
MR FROLICK:      The role of the Portfolio Committee as 
an extension of the National Assembly in terms of the 
powers also that these committees have, they have the 
authority to call anyone not only the executive.  They 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 47 of 148 
 
exercise oversight over the executive but they can call 
anyone and, if necessary, summon anyone to come and 
appear in front of it and, as such, their programmes are in 
their hands and they execute it in terms of those rules. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And but the main thing is to 
ensure that the executive acts in terms of the constitution 
and their interaction – its interaction with the public is in 
respect of that role, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:   Well, their responsibility is to exercise 
oversight over the executive. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MR 
FROLICK: 
 
 
And 
to 
keep 
executive 
members 
accountable, that is one of their responsibilities. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now let us deal with the visit at the 
BOSASA Park. 
MR FROLICK:   Right.      
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now in your affidavit you say – you 
used these words, you do not recall whether – you say as 
far - I am on page 35 of the record, BOSASA 3, on 
paragraph 17, the last sentence, you say: 
20 
“As far as I recall, Mr Agrizzi was not present 
during this discussion.” 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja.  Now when you say as far as I 
recall, you mean he could have been there but you forgot 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 48 of 148 
 
or you say he was not there? 
MR FROLICK:   I can recall, sir, that in terms of the 
affidavit as I submit it, that I up to today cannot recall.  
The first time that I met Mr Agrizzi, was when he arrived in 
parliament.  He was not part of the deliberations that day. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Please let us – the word recall, cannot 
recall is pregnant in the sense that when you say I cannot 
recall, you mean I cannot remember and you mean it is 
something that could have happened, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:      Well …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is that what you mean here? 
MR FROLICK:   No, what I am specifically saying, sir 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please face this side, Mr Frolick. 
MR FROLICK:   Oh, my apologies, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR FROLICK:   My apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR FROLICK:   Now, I can – the context in which I used 
recall is that Mr Agrizzi was not present during that 
20 
meeting or discussion.  Three people were there, was Mr 
Gavin Watson, myself and Mr Komphela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand it is to simply say  - to say 
that as far as your memory is concerned you do not 
remember him being present in that discussion.  That 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 49 of 148 
 
suggests to me that you are saying maybe somebody can 
tell me things that might make me remember that he was 
present, maybe there is something that I cannot remember 
but as far as I can recall, I do not remember him being 
present in the discussion.  I understand you to be saying 
that. 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   That is exactly the context because we 
must keep in mind that the incidents referred to here 
10 
happened in 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR FROLICK:   And I no longer got a fresh mind and 
memory that I used to have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is a long time. 
MR FROLICK:   So it is in that context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  So that is how I understand it, 
Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If somebody else comes and say I 
20 
definitely was there then it would be subject to questioning 
to see whether that was so. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So when Mr Agrizzi says he was there, 
you are saying well, that is his recollection, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:   That is his recollection, sir. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 50 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you cannot dispute that he was 
there, that is his recollection. 
MR FROLICK:    I wish restate as the Chief Justice – 
Deputy Chief Justice, my apologies, I must get used to 
swinging around. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think a lot of witnesses like looking at 
the evidence leader not at me. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, Chair, it is fine, I know I look 
pretty. 
MR FROLICK:   Beauty is in the eye of beholder, Chief 
10 
Justice, if prettiness.  I fully agree with him.  No, I wish to 
restate as you correctly summarised it, Chief Justice.  If Mr 
Agrizzi comes and he can provide proof that he was part of 
that discussion then I can possibly refresh my memory or – 
and given the specific circumstances and then I will be 
able to deal with it. 
MR FROLICK:   Now can you just tell the Commission this, 
do you confirm that Mr Komphela had to be driven around 
in a golf cart? 
MR FROLICK:   On the visit that I am referring to? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Komphela was not driven in any golf 
cart.  He did not go anywhere out of that office that day. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did he come from the car to the 
office? 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 51 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:     Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   How did he walk from the car to the 
office? 
MR FROLICK:   He used his crutches. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And now I see here that there is 
a confirmatory affidavit of Mr Komphela but the affidavit is 
attached to your second affidavit.  Are you saying he is 
confirming your first affidavit as well? 
MR FROLICK:   The confirmatory affidavit of Mr Komphela 
confirms my first affidavit that I submitted. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As well.  Because I will tell you why I 
am saying that because he confirms an affidavit not 
affidavits but you say he is confirming both. 
MR FROLICK:      Well, what I know is, is that the affidavit 
that Mr Komphela is referring to is the first affidavit that I 
just went through with you now, Adv Notshe.  That is 
…[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Komphela’s affidavit? 
MR FROLICK:   That he is referring to that affidavit, my 
first one as it appears on page 8, I think, or – let me just 
20 
get the paging right.  Actually started on page 31. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Chairperson, if I may interrupt? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   In his affidavit signed on 3 September, 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 52 of 148 
 
which is a few days after the affidavit of Mr Komphela, at 
record page 57, paragraph 4.8, he says: 
“I attach hereto marked A a confirmatory affidavit by 
Mr Butana Moses Komphela deposed to him on 29 
August 2019…” 
And that is the one in question. 
“…in which he confirms inter alia what I have stated 
in my previous affidavit in regard to the visit on 
which I accompanied him.” 
That is the context. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The affidavit of Mr Komphela is on 
page 67.  Now this affidavit is attached to your replying 
affidavit, if I may so speak, and he says: 
“I have read the affidavit of Cedrick Thomas Frolick 
and confirm the contents thereof insofar as it 
relates to me.” 
So is he referring to this affidavit or to both? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that affidavit of Mr Komphela was 
attested to on the 29 August 2019. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As at that time – okay, I see that in his 
affidavit he refers to – he says: 
“…the affidavit of Cedrick Thomas Frolick” 
As at the 29 August 2019 how many affidavits had you put 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 53 of 148 
 
in to the – sent to the Commission, Mr Frolick?  Only one 
or…? 
MR FROLICK:   No, in total I think it is – with the 
condoning of it, it is about four different …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, four. 
MR FROLICK:   Four different affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Chairperson, if I may come in here?  
At that stage on the 29 August there were only the two 
affidavits, the condonation application affidavit, which does 
10 
not refer really to Mr Komphela, and then the affidavit of 
the 29 April 2019 which refers to Mr Komphela.  That is the 
first affidavit that he refers to in his affidavit on the 3 
September a few days later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now when you discussed this issue 
with Mr Komphela, Mr Komphela must have seen the 
affidavit of Mr Agrizzi, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:     I do not know if Mr Komphela had a look 
at the affidavit of Mr – I do not think so.  What I know is, is 
20 
that Mr Komphela was following the proceedings of the 
Commission and then I indicated to him that I am 
submitting an affidavit to respond to the allegations and he 
agreed with me that that is the correct sequence of events 
as it unfolded. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 54 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did he deny that Mr Agrizzi was at – 
that Mr Agrizzi was at the BOSASA Centre? 
MR FROLICK:   In terms of his affidavit he agrees to what I 
say that as far as his recollection is concerned, Mr Agrizzi 
was not part of the discussions that took place that I 
referred to in my affidavit that I just went through. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So also he does not deny it but he 
says he cannot recall. 
MR FROLICK:   That is – what he is saying is, as far as his 
recollection is concerned, unless proven differently, of 
10 
course, I cannot speak on his behalf, but he concurred with 
my response in the affidavit as it is there, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, Mr Agrizzi says at some state Mr 
Komphela stood up and took a telephone call and Mr 
Agrizzi had to hold a door for him.  Does Mr Komphela 
deny that? 
MR FROLICK:    Sir, what I can say as far as that is 
concerned, Chairperson, is that as far as my recollection  
goes is that Mr Komphela did not even leave the meeting 
room because it was such a short engagement that we 
20 
have. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you are saying a door was not held 
for Mr Komphela to take a telephone call?  Is that what you 
are saying? 
MR FROLICK:   What I am saying is, is that as far as my 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 55 of 148 
 
recollection goes, Chairperson, is that Mr Komphela did not 
leave the room or office that we were sitting in. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did he stand up?  Did he at any stage 
stand up? 
MR FROLICK:   As far as I can recall, Mr Komphela did not 
stand up.  Mr Komphela was seated. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And did he take a call? 
MR FROLICK:      As far as I can recall, best of my 
recollection, Chairperson, he did not take a call. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did you ask him about this? 
10 
MR FROLICK:   I asked him specifically that either he 
himself or me leave that venue that day and he said that 
he cannot recall that we ever left.  We came in together 
and we left together. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And did you ask him whether a door 
was held for him by Mr Agrizzi? 
MR FROLICK:   Since he said that he cannot recall leaving 
the office the issue of the door never arose, Chairperson, 
of doors being held for Mr Komphela. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did he say also he could not recall you 
20 
talking to Gavin Watson aside? 
MR FROLICK:      Mr Komphela is clear that my version 
that I am giving is also the recollection that he have of the 
meeting that took place, Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Does his recollection to the effect that 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 56 of 148 
 
he did not see you talking to Mr Gavin aside? 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Komphela, in terms of his recollection, 
confirms what I say in my affidavit, Chairperson, that I had 
no side discussions with Mr Gavin Watson.  There was no 
need to have side discussions with anyone. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now again, all of this, saying it is a 
recollection and it is not a denial of that this happened, is 
as far as you can recall. 
MR FROLICK:   As far as …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It could have happened but you cannot 
10 
remember now. 
MR FROLICK:   As far as I recall, Chairperson, if Mr 
Agrizzi comes and he gives concrete evidence of what has 
happened, so that we can look at it then we can interrogate 
that evidence that is there but my recollection is as it 
stated in my affidavit.      
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But the evidence he has given, Mr 
Frolick, is he says he can recall – he recalls this and you 
are saying you are not denying them but you say you 
cannot recall. 
20 
MR FROLICK:   No, I cannot speak for Mr Agrizzi, 
Chairperson.  I do not know what he recalls and can recall 
and cannot recall so unfortunately I cannot comment on the 
recalling ability of Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what Mr Notshe is trying to do is 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 57 of 148 
 
to say here is a situation where you cannot recall but Mr 
Agrizzi says he recalls what happened and giving you a 
chance to say what you might wish to say given that Mr 
Agrizzi seems to be clear that that is what happened. 
MR FROLICK:   No, I dispute what Mr Agrizzi’s version of 
events is, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So are you moving now from not 
recalling to disputing? 
MR FROLICK:   I can confirm, Chairperson, that as far 
10 
leaving the office room and as far as Mr Komphela, a door 
being held for him, those things definitely did not take 
place.  My recollection is, is that both of us remained 
inside in that office until we left. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now moving from not recalling to 
disputing does also comply to Mr Komphela?  He is now 
saying he now disputes, do you know? 
MR FROLICK:    Mr Komphela’s affidavit …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before you respond.  Mr Notshe, I 
am not sure that it is fair to ask him more details about 
20 
what Mr Komphela’s version is in circumstances where I 
think you want him to say what may or may not be in – 
what may or may not be confirmed by Mr Komphela’s 
confirmatory affidavit because Mr Komphela’s confirmatory 
affidavit simply seeks to confirm only that which in his 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 58 of 148 
 
affidavit relates to him or Mr Komphela.  So as long as – I 
think what you can ask him and you can tell me if you want 
to submit differently, I think what you can ask him, you can 
ask him his version and when Mr Komphela comes you can 
confront him with what he was confirming.  What do you 
say? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, there is this, Mr Frolick did not 
confine himself in his answers today to his – to the 
confirmatory affidavit and his affidavit, he goes on and 
tells you what Mr Komphela told him, so I think he is – then 
10 
he is able to tell you what Mr Komphela told him.  If 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he not say that in response to your 
question about what Mr Komphela – whether Mr Komphela 
confirms his version because if he was responding to that, 
that might be different. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, if – what I asked him was this.  
I said that when he spoke to Mr Komphela about this 
incident, does he confirm a, b, c, d?  One, he does not say 
I did not speak to him about it, he spoke to him about it 
20 
and he does not say to you Mr Komphela did not give me 
an answer.  He gives you an answer.  I will be fair to the 
witness …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you may be right.  I mean, if he is 
able to say well, I know what Mr Komphela’s version is on 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 59 of 148 
 
this point, this is what it is, that is fine, you know? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was just concerned that Mr Komphela’s 
confirmatory affidavit does not seek to confirm everything 
that is in Mr Frolick’s affidavit, it purports to confirm only 
those parts that relate to Mr Komphela.  So that has got to 
be borne in mind.  But, of course, if Mr Frolick deals with 
other matters that do not relate to – that are not confirmed 
by the confirmatory affidavit on the basis that he has had a 
discussion with Mr Komphela about those matters, he 
10 
knows what his version, that may be different.  So 
…[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Chair, that is – I was careful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so maybe …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I was careful …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can go ahead but bear in mind this 
discussion. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  No, I was – I am careful about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The only thing, I cannot be able to – to 
20 
be answered to ask him about what he has not been told by 
Mr Komphela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So, if I understand, Mr Frolick, is you 
are saying when you discussed with Mr Komphela he said 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 60 of 148 
 
to you he cannot recall whether one, Agrizzi was there.  Is 
that correct? 
MR FROLICK:   Well, Chairperson, my version of events is 
that Mr Agrizzi was not part of that meeting.  That was 
confirmed by Mr Komphela as well.  My version is, is that I 
never left that boardroom or office with Mr Watson for a 
side meeting or anything.  As far as my recollection goes, 
Mr Komphela remained in that office and that is what Mr 
Komphela in his affidavit is exactly saying. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And can we, just before I go further, is 
10 
this – are you saying this meeting at the BOSASA offices 
was – you were merely accompanying Mr Komphela as your 
friend, am I right.   
MR FROLICK:   That is correct, Chairperson, I was 
requested by Mr Komphela to accompany him and that is 
the reason why I went there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you were not going to the – you 
were not going to the offices of [indistinct – microphone 
off] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Okay, just ask that question 
20 
again, Mr…? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sir, the visit at the BOSASA business 
park, he was merely accompanying Mr Komphela, am I 
right? 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Komphela requested me to accompany 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 61 of 148 
 
him, I was – Mr Cheeky Watson indicated that Mr Komphela 
wanted to visit the facility and asked me am I going to 
accompany Mr Komphela, which I did, and that is how we 
ended up at the offices. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you – at that stage you were a 
member of the Portfolio Committee of Sports? 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you were not a member of the 
Portfolio Committee for Correctional Services. 
MR FROLICK:      That is correct. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now when Mr Cheeky – when Mr Gavin 
Watson asked you about matters regarding the Portfolio 
Committee of Correctional Services, why did you entertain 
him on that? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, it is not as if I did not know 
Mr Gavin Watson, I know him for a – I knew him for quite 
some time before that and the nature of politicians are that 
then they sit in a discussion and different matters come up 
and you interact with that because we are not only 
politicians or member of parliaments serving on specific 
20 
committees but you do have interest broadly in what is 
taking place.  So if a member of the public or anyone 
comes to you to complain about the lack of social services 
then you cannot tell that person I am the member of a 
Sport and Recreation committee, that is – I cannot 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 62 of 148 
 
comment on that, it has got nothing to do with me, and that 
is - was the nature of the discussion. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now did at any stage Mr Gavin 
Watson leave the place where you were seated or you 
cannot recall? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson, as far as my recollection  
goes, Mr Watson was there inside the discussion that we 
were having.  That is the best that I can recall and, as I 
said, it was a short engagement and as far as my 
recollection goes, he did not leave that room.   
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And he did not – did you see his vault? 
MR FROLICK:      No, Chairperson, I did not see a vault. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you will not dispute that there is a 
vault nearby where you were seated? 
MR FROLICK:   I was not taken around the offices, 
Chairperson, to show me the layout of the office and where 
this and that are.  We arrived and we went specifically into 
the one office. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Agrizzi recalls Mr Watson 
excusing himself and going to his vault.  What do you say 
20 
about that? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, I cannot recall, beyond my 
recollection for Mr Watson.  I have just indicated as far as 
my recollection is, he was part of the discussion and he did 
not leave the meeting. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 63 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now the travel costs, you say you will 
not dispute that they were paid by BOSASA but you are 
saying you do know that they are paid by BOSASA. 
MR FROLICK:      Chairperson, as far as those travel costs 
are concerned, the original arrangements was made by, as 
I indicated earlier, by Mr Cheeky Watson, and I had a 
second task and that was to go meet with a potential 
sponsor as well.  So I was under the impression that that 
was the arrangements that was made by Mr Watson and 
that is as far as I can recall those arrangements that were 
10 
made. 
 
I also wish to indicate, Chairperson, that when Mr 
Agrizzi made these different comments and things, I once 
again approached Mr Watson and I said to him but this – 
what do you say this stands, he struggled because he was 
no longer involved with Eastern Province Rugby at the 
time, he struggled to recollect and what to say and this, 
that and the other and that is why I also stated in my last 
declaration that I made to the National Assembly that since 
Mr Watson could not remember that there could have been 
20 
a possibility, could have been a possibility that BOSASA 
paid the costs. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you in the latest affidavit you 
filed, you filed also confirmatory affidavit of Cheeky 
Watson. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 64 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   Which is the latest affidavit you are 
referring to, Advocate? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The one you filed in August. 
MR FROLICK:   August? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You remember the one which was not 
in the bundle, the one you have just added now? 
MR FROLICK:      Oh, the one that was not part of your 
records? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   Is it now in the bundle? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is now in the bundle. 
MR FROLICK:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is if you look at page 121. 
MR FROLICK:      Oh yes.  Okay, I am with you, Advocate. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And did you ask him, when you 
asked for this affidavit, to deal with this issue that has 
come up that the payments were made by Blake Travel and 
not by EP Rugby? 
MR 
FROLICK: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
the 
nature 
of 
these 
arrangements between Blake Travel, I did not get involved 
20 
in the operational issues.  You will be told that there is 
travelling arrangements that has been made and will be 
going there and in executing those tasks, you are under 
the impression that it was arrangements that was done by 
the office of Mr Watson and Eastern Province Rugby Union.  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 65 of 148 
 
It only arose later, only arose later when here was a 
specific payment of from the office of EP that they came 
and they said there is an amount that they must payment 
because that was the agreement between me and the 
Eastern Province Rugby that if there a personal costs 
involved, for instance, if I struggle to secure a flight or 
whatever, then I will say to them make arrangements for 
me and give me the invoice then I will pay for it and in 
such instances I would go and on more than one occasion I 
paid the money to Eastern Province Rugby.  I did not 
10 
formal check of its small amounts in cash. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, I understand.  The affidavit of Mr 
Watson I see was commissioned in August 2020.  Why?  
This was after it has come out that the travel costs were 
paid by Blake Travel and BOSASA, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:   Well, what was presented to me and what I 
was made aware of – and that did not appear in the 
original evidence that was given by Mr Agrizzi here in front 
of the Commission, is that there were supplementary 
affidavits forwarded amongst other from Blake Travel 
20 
where they stipulate things.  So I said to Mr Watson, 
Cheeky, can you remember these things that were there?  
And he said no, man, those were things that through my 
office we have arranged and then he also said but in 
certain cases you came and you paid, right.  At that stage I 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 66 of 148 
 
realised that the Blake’s Travel that they were referring to 
here in the Commission, and it was confirmed also by Mr 
Watson then, is the same Blake’s Travel that is being used 
by BOSASA. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So also you confirm that then that Mr 
Cheeky Watson does not deny that your costs were paid by 
BOSASA? 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Cheeky Watson Chairperson when I 
took him through the list of things and he said no all of 
these things were things that were arranged for your 
10 
travelling 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
arrangements 
for 
Eastern 
Province Rugby or in other instances I would ask them to 
make a booking, they would come back with the invoice 
and somebody in the office will call you and say that you 
must either pay Eastern Province Rugby now, pay them or 
you must make out a cheque to the travel agent.      
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did he explain to you why your 
expenses were to be paid by BOSASA? 
MR FROLICK:   No, Chairperson.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did you ask him why?  
20 
MR FROLICK:   I asked him but how could it happen that 
the BOSASA issue and the work of Eastern Province Rugby 
got mixed with one another and he indicated to me to say 
that the Blake’s Travel Agency very often took a lot of time 
before they would send invoices through to Eastern 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 67 of 148 
 
Province Rugby and that is what they dealt with in the 
administration.  I was not told by Mr Watson that BOSASA 
is making this payment or making that payment.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I understand at the time he did not 
tell you but now that you came to know that this payment 
was made by BOSASA.  Did he tell you why was the 
payment made by BOSASA?  
MR FROLICK:   No, Chairperson.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He did not explain it to you? 
MR FROLICK:   No.  
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Right, now before we leave the issue 
of the boardroom at the BOSASA business centre are you 
now saying that Mr Komphela was with you all the time and 
if you had been given money he would have seen it?  
MR FROLICK:   That is correct sir.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And unless he cannot recall it.  
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson if I was handed anything since 
Mr Komphela was with me then Mr Komphela would have 
been aware of that, he would have seen it.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And unless he was busy with – on a 
20 
phone call and he was at the door.  
MR FROLICK:   I already indicated to you sir as far as my 
recollection go that Mr Komphela did not leave the meeting 
venue and did not have a phone call as far as I can 
recollect.   
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 68 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry perhaps - I do not want us to be 
at cross purposes.  The evidence of Mr Agrizzi is as I 
understand it is that Mr Komphela did not leave the 
complex of the office but he stood at the door to take this 
call.   
MR FROLICK:   No, I cannot recall that happening 
Chairperson, I cannot recall that.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And I am sure if Mr Komphela or 
maybe if Mr Agrizzi held the door of Mr Komphela, Mr 
Komphela cannot miss seeing Mr Agrizzi right in front of 
10 
him.  
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson I have indicated earlier Mr 
Agrizzi 
was 
never 
there, 
he 
was 
not 
there 
in 
our 
discussions he was not part of the discussions taking 
place.  So from where would he appear all of a sudden to 
come and hold a door.  I do not know from where he was 
making his observations, I cannot speculate.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Mr Agrizzi before I get to that – 
you know Mr Valance Watson? 
MR FROLICK:   I do know Mr Valance Watson, yes.  
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And have you been to his place? 
MR FROLICK:   I have been to his place a number of 
times, Chairperson.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And there was a visit that Mr Agrizzi 
mentioned that he visited Mr Valance’s place and then he 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 69 of 148 
 
met you there.  Do you remember that? 
MR FROLICK:   I cannot recall that Chairperson, I really 
cannot remember and that is why I also stated it in my 
affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now tell me…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Notshe before you move 
away from the visit to BOSASA I remember that between 
your affidavit Mr Frolick and the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi 
there seems to be a tension between his affidavit and 
yours in terms of what the purpose of the visit was, you 
10 
say one thing and I think he is say something else.  I was 
trying to look here Mr Notshe can you remember what that 
is about, there are two diffident objectives.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Agrizzi’s evidence was that they 
wanted to show Mr Frolick and his company what the 
BOSASA was actually doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, there was something about the 
youth centre or some centre because in one of his 
affidavits Mr Agrizzi challenges the purpose of the visit as 
stated by Mr Frolick on the basis I think Mr Frolick 
20 
mentioned something like they wanted to see his sports 
facilities for young people and Mr Agrizzi say in effect that 
could never have been the purpose because the area 
where the centre is, is tarred.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   There cannot be, yes.  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 70 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 There 
would 
not 
have 
been 
any 
facilities, I think that is what I would like you to get Mr 
Frolick to deal with.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   One listen - Mr Frolick just turn to 
page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Page 2-3, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2-3?  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.   
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      Chairperson if I may interrupt. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      I think what you are referring to is 
at page 55. 
CHAIRPERSON:   55?  
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      Paragraph 4.2 and 4.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But can we start at 23 before we get to 
55 Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe you said we must start 
where? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   At page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:   22? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   23. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So it is necessary to look at what 
the purpose of the visit was.    
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 71 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   As testified to by Mr Frolick and look at 
what the purpose, what Mr Agrizzi says the purpose was 
and to examine each one of them.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, at 23, page 23 it is what Mr 
Agrizzi says was the purpose, paragraph 51. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then do you see that Mr Frolick? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says: 
“The 
purpose 
of 
the 
meeting 
that 
was 
being 
10 
scheduled was to arrange a visit to showcase the 
business park to the two gentlemen so that they had 
an idea of the magnitude of the business in what it 
had 
to 
offer 
especially 
in 
terms 
of 
BEE 
development.” 
That is what Agrizzi says…[intervene]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then on page 44 paragraph 7 sorry 
before we get their Chair to 44 please turn to page 34 
which is the affidavit now of Mr Frolick, on paragraph 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 13?  
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, on page 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 7 at paragraph 13? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, on page 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:   34? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, 3-4 Chairperson.  Page 34 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 72 of 148 
 
paragraph 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes.  Whose affidavit is this?    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   This is the affidavit of Mr Frolick.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Where he says: 
“The visit to BOSASA office was initiated and 
arranged between Mr Komphela in his capacity as 
the Chairperson of the portfolio committee on sports 
and 
recreation 
and 
Mr 
Cheeky 
Watson. 
 The 
purpose of the visit was to visit the youth centre 
10 
that catered for juvenile offenders and to establish 
to what extent sport played a role and was used in 
the process of rehabilitation.” 
And then on page 44 of paragraph 7 Mr Agrizzi deals with 
that.  He says: 
“Save on noting the contents of this paragraph I 
wish to state that the real purpose, the real reason 
and purpose of the visit was to create more 
credibility for BOSASA with the relevant person.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then…[intervene]     
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then on page 55. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then page 55…[intervene] 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      Mr Chairperson may I interrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      If you look at page 44 where we 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 73 of 148 
 
have just been refer to paragraph 7.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      You should also read paragraph 8.1.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes 8.1: 
“I do not dispute the close friendship as comrades 
and friends between Mr Komphela and Mr Cedric 
Frolick but I state further that the main purpose of 
the visit was to resolve the position relating to Mr 
Smith and the portfolio committee at the relevant 
departments.” 
10 
I think you are correct Mr Van Zyl it is important, yes and 
then of course 55 in 4.1 and that is Mr Frolick’s affidavit.     
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   4.1: 
“I have in paragraph 13 of my original affidavit 
stated that the purpose of the visit to BOSASA’s 
offices was to visit the youth centre that catered for 
juvenile offenders and to establish to what extent 
sport played a role and was used in the process of 
rehabilitation of these youths, these youngsters.”  
20 
4.2, In reply thereto Mr Agrizzi in paragraph 7 of his 
affidavit in his response states that: 
“The real reason and purpose of the visit was to 
create 
more 
credibility 
for 
BOSASA 
with 
the 
relevant persons.  I presume his reference to the 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 74 of 148 
 
relevant person is a reference to Mr Komphela and I 
it is not clear why BOSASA would want to create 
more credibility with Mr Komphela and me as Mr 
Komphela was the Chairperson of the portfolio 
committee on sport and recreation whilst BOSASA 
was involved with the Department of Correctional 
Services and Justice.  I also had nothing to do with 
those departments.” 
Okay I just wanted here that maybe you deal with that – 
the issue of the different purposes. 
10 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Mr Chairperson it goes on in the next 
paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   To deal with the contradiction in Mr 
Agrizzi’s evidence as to the purpose.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let me just see…[intervene] 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   4.3.  
CHAIRPERSON:   In paragraph 8.1 he offers his affidavit 
in response: 
“Mr Agrizzi contradicts what he stated in paragraph 
20 
7 with regards to the purpose of the visits.  He 
stated therein that the main purpose of the visit was 
to resolve the position relating to Mr Smith and the 
portfolio committee and the relevant department.  
This is clearly not a reference to the portfolio 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 75 of 148 
 
committee of sport and recreation.” 
 Ja, Mr Notshe can you just put questions to Mr Frolick to 
deal with those different purposes or different versions 
about purposes.             
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Right Mr Frolick are you – you say the 
confirmatory affidavit of Mr Komphela, are you saying it 
confirms that the visit was arranged and initiated between 
him and Mr Cheeky Watson?   
MR FROLICK:   That is correct.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So is that what his confirming? 
10 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And – now as we have read to you Mr 
Agrizzi says that the meeting was for something different.  
It was to present the scope of the work of the company, 
you read that?   
MR FROLICK:   I have read that sir.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, and when you were there you also 
confirmed that there was an issue raised regarding the 
problem with the correctional services portfolio committee.   
MR FROLICK:   But that is what I state in my affidavit, yes.  
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And did you not ask as to why when 
the purpose of the visit was for the sports and recreation 
now you are asked about correctional services issue?  
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson as I stated earlier that when 
we deal with matters we are not restricted so that question 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 76 of 148 
 
did not arise to ask but why are you now dealing with 
matters of this nature, it did not arise.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now when you were there what was 
the issues of sports and recreation that were discussed at 
the meeting?  
MR FROLICK:   Mr Watson referred to the – they were 
apparently 
busy 
with 
the 
juvenile’s 
section 
and 
the 
youngsters who are there in the youth centre to get them 
involved with activities not in rugby as Mr Agrizzi states in 
his affidavit.  It has nothing to do with rugby and what he 
10 
said 
was 
that 
the 
difficulty 
they 
have 
with 
these 
recreational things is that it is expensive, it is not very well 
supported from people outside and there is no government 
support so he does it on his own as part of his social 
responsibility to the youth centre that is there.   
He also stated that they were in the process of 
establishing a football/soccer team so that they can 
participate and he would wish that he can get support for 
that as well and it is part of his attempt to then give the 
other side of what the company is really doing and it is not 
20 
sees only with the matter only of correctional services.     
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now as the person who had initiated 
this was Mr Komphela, am I right?  
MR FROLICK:   That is correct.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now why did it then come to you that 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 77 of 148 
 
you took over and start facilitating the meetings between 
the BOSASA and Mr Smith for correctional services? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson Mr – in the discussion Mr 
Komphela said that Mr Smith is a very stubborn person and 
since I know him better maybe I should discuss the issue 
with him as far as a possible a visit is concerned so that 
they can deal with their matters as far as the attempts that 
they have made in the past to make submissions to have a 
meeting that proved to be fruitless and it is from that point 
of view that I approached Mr Smith and asked him if he 
10 
would participate or want to be part of such a meeting.   
And as I have earlier indicated he said there is a lot 
of problems there and this and that and I said that it is 
important also just to give them a hearing you do not need 
to agree with them on anything that is being done but since 
the matters are then ventilated if it is possible give them – 
just listen to what they have to say you do not need to 
work with them, you do not need to agree with them for 
that matter. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you say that Mr Smith confirm that 
20 
BOSASA 
there 
were 
problems 
with 
BOSASA 
and 
correctional services? 
MR FROLICK:   He said they were dealing with problems 
as far as the BOSASA and correctional services issues 
were concerned.  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 78 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And when you became the – what they 
call it Chair of Chairs did you also see it in the minutes of 
the correctional services that there were problems that 
were being raised in that portfolio committee regarding 
BOSASA and correctional services? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson it was common knowledge at 
the time that when I became the Chairperson of committees 
that there were issues in correctional services because it 
was not only them who were dealing with the matter I know 
at a time the steering committee on public accounts also 
10 
had certain issues that they raised as far as the BOSASA 
correctional services matter is concerned.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You know one of the aspects about the 
purpose of the visit that strikes me is that from your 
affidavit I get the impression that you and Mr Komphela 
travelled all the way from Cape Town to Gauteng to the 
BOSASA offices to see, to deal with sports issues or to see 
there - I do not know youth centre or whatever you were 
coming about sports.   
And according to your affidavit I think you wanted to 
20 
see what facilities the sport facilities they had for the 
youngsters but having arrived at BOSASA I think on your 
version there are no facilities to be shown and you just tell 
me if I am misunderstanding what you have said in your 
affidavit.  And I get the impression that Mr Komphela was 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 79 of 148 
 
not to impressed that now there were no facilities to be 
shown but Mr Agrizzi says no but in effect as I understand 
him could never have been, the arrangement could never 
have been about us showing him any sport facilities 
because in that place you know that centre you know the 
whole place or the place around where the centre is, is 
tarred there would be no facilities.  So that strikes me as 
strange as if how could you have come all the way and 
made such a trip if no proper homework had been made as 
to what you could see and what you could not see.   
10 
That seems strange to me and yet when you look at 
Mr Agrizzi’s version which starts from saying we have been 
wanting to influence the portfolio committee on correctional 
services, 
we 
have 
been 
wanting 
to 
meet 
with 
the 
Chairperson of the portfolio committee on correctional 
services Mr Smith he was ignoring us he did not want to 
meet us and they were getting negative publicity.  We 
wanted to have somebody, he wanted the Chairperson to 
protect BOSASA interest in when my task come up in the 
portfolio committee on correctional services.   
20 
So when we had this stalemate we had to find 
somebody else to help us access Mr Smith and then Mr 
Frolick was the person that we got.  He came to BOSASA 
this was the purpose and then it transpired that during that 
visit if I recall correctly there definitely was a discussion 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 80 of 148 
 
about the challenges that BOSASA said they were having 
in accessing the Chairperson of the portfolio committee.  
So 
that 
issue 
was 
discussed 
and 
it 
transpires 
that 
subsequently you spoke to Mr Smith and indeed there was 
ultimately a meeting and according to Mr Agrizzi, Mr 
Agrizzi’s version indeed in due cause there was a change 
of attitude on the part of Mr Smith towards BOSASA.  So 
there is that part so I just want you to comment on the 
starting with the question of how could you and Mr 
Komphela come all the way to see a sports facilities if 
10 
there were no sport facilities.  Had there not been a 
discussion before because if one looks at what you say 
was discussed during that visit and when one looks at what 
Mr Agrizzi says was discussed there is a lot of conversions 
it seems to be dominated by BOSASA’s concern about 
accessing the portfolio committee.  You want to say 
something? 
MR 
FROLICK: 
 
 
Yes, 
no 
thank 
you 
Chairperson, 
Chairperson as I stated the intention of that visit and that 
is why we did not proceed with it, we did not proceed with 
20 
the visit because they wanted to take us on something like 
a four-hour thing of the entire complex and whatever they 
are doing and we said but where is the issue then of the 
youth centre and they said they were not ready for that, 
right.   
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 81 of 148 
 
And it was not about as Mr Agrizzi stated rugby as I 
have stated Mr Watson spoke about soccer/football being 
there and other recreational activities that they are trying 
to introduce.  So our purpose was specifically that and it is 
because of that reason that we did not proceed in going 
ahead with that visit because it had also the element in it 
that you cannot just then walk into an entire setup that is 
there for four hours and you do not come to the youth 
centre that the primary purpose of it was and that the 
youth centre they are not ready to scale down the visit at 
10 
least just to include that that was the intention of our visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But can you understand my…[intervene] 
MR FROLICK:   I follow what you are saying Chairperson, I 
follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You come all the way and then the 
purpose of the visit is defeated in a way because what you 
are looking for is not there and I guess most people would 
be upset to say you why did you bring us here if you do not 
have A, B, C, D because that is what we are interested in.  
Could it be that you and Mr Komphela might have had a 
20 
different purpose of the visit?  Your purpose of the visit 
might have been different from the purpose of the visit of 
BOSASA than Mr Watson and Mr Agrizzi maybe and maybe 
they were focussed on seeing how you could help them 
resolve their challenges with Mr Smith while you might 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 82 of 148 
 
have gone there for something else.          
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson as I said that the reason why 
we visited was to focus on the youth centre that we were 
told about that is there operating so well they doing such 
excellent work.  And maybe they I do not want to speculate 
on behalf of Mr Agrizzi and the late Mr Watson maybe they 
had also an intention to share with us the other difficulties 
that they may be experiencing as far as their company is 
concerned but that was not our intention.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay Mr Notshe.  
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What is also interesting is that Mr 
Agrizzi 
recalls 
the 
conversation 
you 
had 
with 
them 
regarding access to Mr Smith.  Do you agree with me?  
MR FROLICK:   I cannot agree with that Chairperson 
because if Mr Agrizzi was not part of what we were 
discussing inside the office how can Mr Agrizzi then have a 
recollection of that and how can I agree with that.  I do not 
know what the discussions were between whoever were left 
there after we left, so I do not agree with that.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No sorry…[intervene] 
20 
MR FROLICK:   Maybe I misunderstood you sir.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The question did not come out clearly.  
He states – he tells the Commission about what was 
discussed between you and Mr Gavin Watson regarding the 
difficulty to get access to Mr Smith, he testifies about that.   
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 83 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   No, Chairperson I was not part of those 
discussions that took place so I cannot attest to that.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, sorry Mr, perhaps you do not 
understand Mr Agrizzi says Mr Watson told you that he had 
a problem to get to talk to Mr Smith.  Do you recall that in 
his affidavit?   
MR FROLICK:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So I am saying he is testifying about 
what Mr Gavin Watson said to you at the meeting.  
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson as I said and I clearly 
10 
indicated to this Commission what our intention purpose 
were for that and also then subsequently throughout to 
what we were discussing that he mentioned the difficulties 
that he had and I also said that Mr Agrizzi was not part of 
those discussions.  So I do not know what discussions Mr 
Watson had subsequently with Mr Agrizzi.    
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what Mr Notshe seeks to check 
with you is whether Mr Agrizzi’s information irrespective of 
whether he was present at that meeting or not whether his 
information that Mr Watson raised this issue with you is 
20 
correct namely the issue of their challenges to try and get 
hold of Mr – to have a meeting with Mr Smith.        
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson it can only be that Mr Watson 
had that discussion with Mr Agrizzi and shared with him 
what we were discussing amongst ourselves and that is 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 84 of 148 
 
probably where Mr Agrizzi got his information from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no but the question is, is it correct 
is it true that during that meeting Mr Watson raised the 
issue with you?    
MR FROLICK:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct, ja.  
MR FROLICK:   That is correct, Chair.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you saying that Mr Agrizzi could 
have known about that discussion because Mr Gavin 
Watson shared it with him, am I right?   
10 
MR FROLICK:   The only way that he could have known 
about the discussion I do not know where else he could 
have heard it from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Unless…[intervene] 
MR FROLICK:   Because we were not in discussion at any 
stage in – with Mr Agrizzi. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Unless he was in the meeting?  It is 
either he heard it from someone or he was in the meeting? 
MR FROLICK:  He was not in the meeting Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FROLICK:  He must have heard it from someone. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Tell me are you moving from saying – 
remember when you started your evidence you say well you 
cannot recall whether he was there or not.  Now you are 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 85 of 148 
 
saying that definitely he was not there. 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson as I have stated earlier this is 
my recollection of events that occurred way back in 2010 
right and I am saying that as far as my recollection or recall 
for the lack of a better word is Mr Agrizzi was not part of our 
discussions. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now what … 
MR FROLICK:  So he was not part of the meeting. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What jolted your memory to say that 
definitely Mr Agrizzi was not there when you started by 
10 
saying as far as your memory is concerned? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think he – it is true that he certainly 
was saying earlier a number of times it is – as far as he can 
recall Mr Agrizzi was not there.  And then at a certain time 
just two minutes ago he said Mr Agrizzi was not there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you raised the – you asked a 
further question then he went back to saying as far as he 
recalls.  I take that to mean your – your actual position is 
20 
that you cannot recall.  Am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson as far as my recollection goes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he was not there. 
MR FROLICK:  As far as I recall he was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 86 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then you said he said unless there is 
some concrete evidence to support Mr Agrizzi’s evidence, am 
I right that he was there? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And what Mr Agrizzi has done is to tell 
the court – sorry – the commission about the conversation 
that occurred in that room and you confirm that conversation 
did occur. 
MR FROLICK:  But Chairperson as I have indicated that he 
could have only heard it from someone else.  He could have 
10 
only heard it from someone else because if my recollection 
is that he was not there then he must have heard it from Mr 
Gavin Watson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you would agree with me that there 
are two scenarios – situations he could have heard it from 
someone else or he was there? 
MR FROLICK:  Can you just repeat the question? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You say you will agree with me there are 
two scenarios.  It is either he heard from someone else or he 
was there – he heard it himself. 
20 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson I – my scenario is that as far as 
my recollection goes Mr Agrizzi was not part of that 
discussion or in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think… 
MR FROLICK:  The [00:02:43] scenario… 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 87 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FROLICK:  Excuse me – my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think your – I think your answer 
would be in line with what Mr Notshe is saying because you 
say as far as you recall he was not there.  But you are not 
saying you are hundred percent sure that he was not there 
because you say it has been a long time but as far as I recall 
he was not there.  So I think your answer would be if my – if 
your version is correct that – if your recollection is correct 
that he was not there then the only other way he could have 
10 
got information is if somebody else told him.  But if your 
recollection is wrong then he could also have got the 
information because he was there.  But your recollection that 
he was not there. 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be your answer. 
MR FROLICK:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you.  Now we – excuse me – the – 
you said you have visited on a number of occasions the 
20 
house of Valance Watson, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you have walked around his house, 
am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson when I arrive at – even if it is 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 88 of 148 
 
my friend’s houses I do not walk around in their houses.  I 
move from the reception door to the lounge area wherever 
you going to sit.  So that is how I know the house of Mr 
Watson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And did you notice that he has a gym 
which is not used there? 
MR FROLICK:  No Chairperson I am not aware of a gym. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that at Mr Valance Watson’s house? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Valance’s – yes.  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh well that is important because I think 
10 
you said earlier on Mr Frolick you have been to Mr Valance 
Watson’s house a number of times.  You – you – and Mr 
Agrizzi said that on the day that he went to Mr Valance’s 
house on the occasion when he took with him some money 
that was meant for you which he says he gave to Mr Watson 
– Mr Valance Watson and Mr Valance Watson gave it to you 
in his presence.  He says that Mr Valance Watson showed 
him a gym in the – well I do not know whether in the house 
or in the premises that was not being used or had not been 
used for some time.  So I – are you saying despite the fact 
20 
that you have been to that house many times you do not 
know whether there is such a gym or are you saying you 
know that there is no such gym? 
MR FROLICK:  I am not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or at least there was no such gym at the 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 89 of 148 
 
time? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson as far as I know is that I have – 
it is quite a big house that Mr Valance Watson is staying in 
and unlike the courtesy that was extended to Mr Agrizzi to 
show him a gym I have never seen a gym there.  I was not 
shown so I am not aware of any gyms in the premises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you do not know whether there is 
or there is not? 
MR FROLICK:  I do not know.  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now does he have – so you must have 
seen this – does he have a beautiful brown lounge suite in 
his house Mr Watson?  You must have sat on it. 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson as far as my recollection goes 
Mr Watson has a lounge suite.  Now whether it is beautiful or 
not I do not know.  I cannot say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Look in line with – in line with what you 
said earlier that the – when you wanted to take the glory 
from me about being pretty.  When you said the – that beauty 
20 
lies in the eyes of the beholder.  Let us leave the beauty 
does he have a brown lounge suite? 
MR FROLICK:  As far as my recollection goes Chairperson 
of the house of Mr Watson and I have the area to where I is 
there is a lounge suite that is brown in colour.  That is what I 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 90 of 148 
 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  There is a lounge suite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With a brown colour. 
MR FROLICK:  With a brown colour yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Does it have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The suburb – the name of the suburb Mr 
Notshe do you want to cover that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he should know the name of the 
suburb at least. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Maybe – the – the suburb is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Agrizzi gives the name of the 
suburb. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As Waverley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that where Mr Valance Watson’s house 
is? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson I beg your indulgence to say 
that the area that I know the house of Mr Valance Watson is 
20 
in fact Milpark. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  In Port Elizabeth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not Waverley? 
MR FROLICK:  I do not know an area called Waverley in Port 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 91 of 148 
 
Elizabeth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so.  Okay. 
MR FROLICK:  There is no residential area called … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are familiar with the – with the 
suburbs in that part of Port Elizabeth? 
MR FROLICK:  Well Chairperson as far as Mr Watson’s 
house is concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FROLICK:  That area there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR FROLICK:  That is I am saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you would say certainly the area where 
Mr Valance Watson’s house is not called – is it Waverley? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Waverley yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not called Waverley? 
MR FROLICK:  I know it as – I know the area the suburb that 
Mr Watson stays as Milpark. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Does he – does he have where this 
lounge – I do not want to say it is beautiful – you do not like 
20 
the word.  Does he have Persian carpets? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson I do not know what the Persian 
carpet what is meant.  I know there is – there is carpets in 
his house whether it is Persian or not I know there is carpets 
in Mr Watson’s house.  Part of the house is carpeted. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 92 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Okay now let us deal with that – the visit 
of Mr Agrizzi and meeting you at Valance’s house.  On page 
41 of the record paragraph 33.  Again you use your famous 
word, you say: 
“I do not recall a meeting with Mr Agrizzi at 
the house of Valance Watson.” 
You see that? 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So does this again mean it could have 
happened but you cannot remember now? 
10 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson as I have stated I have been to 
that house of Mr Watson numerous times and I cannot recall 
being in a meeting with Mr Agrizzi in Mr Watson’s house.  
Once again taking into account that this happened – in fact I 
do not even know what the date of the meeting is. What year 
it is that Mr Agrizzi is referring – maybe you can assist me if 
you have that information?  What date it is that this meeting 
took place and also the time that the meeting took place and 
that can possibly assist me.  But just to say that there was a 
meeting and this and that I cannot recall the version that Mr 
20 
Agrizzi gave. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now what is important here Mr Frolick is 
this.  You do not deny – you do not say I never met Mr 
Agrizzi.  Remember by the time you deposed to this affidavit 
you had now seen Mr Agrizzi am I right? 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 93 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You saw him in Parliament, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You saw him on TV, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now by the time you deposed to this 
affidavit you know the face that was talking – that was 
saying it met you at Valance Watson’s house.  You say you 
cannot recall whether you met that face there or not.  Is that 
your evidence? 
10 
MR FROLICK:  That is my evidence Chairperson I cannot 
recall that. And as I have said if I could get more particulars 
and specifics Mr Agrizzi if he says it happened then he must 
have details of that visit as to when it happened.  And that – 
that is my best recollection of what I have as far as that 
statement of his is concerned. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now I see – I see that you are 
enthusiastic in checking people who are mentioned to have 
been involved with you.  You checked with Mr Komphela.  
You check with Mr Cheeky Watson.  Did you check with 
20 
Valance Watson about this? 
MR FROLICK:  I checked with Mr Watson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What did he say? 
MR FROLICK:  Mr Watson also cannot recall such a meeting 
taking place.  He said no.  I asked him and he said no he 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 94 of 148 
 
cannot remember that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But he does not deny it? 
MR FROLICK:  His direct words was that he cannot 
remember such a meeting taking place Chairperson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So you are saying he did not deny it?  
He just says he cannot recall. 
MR FROLICK:  He simply said that he cannot remember 
such a meeting taking place.  He said – he said to me when I 
asked him, he said there is people coming in and out of his 
house who are working for his brother or whenever they in 
10 
PE or whatever so he said he cannot recall this specific 
instance that is being referred to here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now the – Mr Agrizzi’s evidence is this 
that this was not just a social visit.  He came with money to 
be given to you.  Am I right?  As far as his evidence is. 
MR FROLICK:  That is what he says yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes and Mr Watson says he cannot recall 
this – he does not deny it but he says he cannot recall this. 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is strange. 
20 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson as far as I know and even when 
this money thing is concerned I have never received money 
from what Mr Agrizzi is referring to here from Mr Watson.  
Even where there is other people there or not I – I have not 
– I have not received that.  Mr Watson simply said and I am 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 95 of 148 
 
going to use his direct words if I may? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ja. 
MR FROLICK:  He says Angelo is talking nonsense.  That 
was his direct words. Because I asked him.  This man says I 
got money from you in a meeting that he was in.  And he said 
no.  He said no. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He says no he cannot recall? 
MR FROLICK:  He says no. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No. 
MR FROLICK:  He simply says no he never ever passed 
10 
money onto me in the way that is being referred to here by 
Mr Agrizzi.  That did not – that did not happen right.  As far 
as meetings and things are concerned he says he cannot 
even recall that taking place. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Tell me did you refuse to give to you a 
confirmatory affidavit as others did?  Refuse – the others did 
give you did he refuse to give you? 
MR FROLICK:  I – I did not request any confirmatory 
affidavit from Mr Valance Watson Chairperson.  Maybe if is 
Mr Valance Watson is requested to make available an 
20 
affidavit you can find out. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Why did you not ask him?  You had 
asked others? 
MR FROLICK:  Mr Valance Watson when I discussed these 
matters with him as a family they are very upset with the fact 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 96 of 148 
 
that firstly their brother Gavin Watson died under mysterious 
circumstances and they have a particular view.  And I do not 
want to – I do not share easily into what they discuss as a 
family.  I am not involved in those type of discussions but 
you can see whenever the situation is – if he gets angry he 
is very upset and he is agitated with the allegations that Mr 
Agrizzi is making.   
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
And 
I 
suppose 
under 
those 
circumstances he would have easily given you a confirmatory 
affidavit if you had asked for one. 
10 
MR FROLICK:   I did not request any affidavit – confirmatory 
affidavit from his Chairperson.  I asked him actually what is 
our view in terms of interacting with – because it is 
mentioned – it was – a lot of things are being said or 
whatever.  And he simply said to me that he is still consulting 
with their legal advisors on the matter.  And given that 
answer Advocate Notshe I did not pursue the matter any 
further.  Because if he says they are consulting as a family 
on the matter with their attorneys then I cannot enter into the 
space to say and give me then a confirmatory affidavit. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But you managed to get it from Cheeky 
Watson the brother and family as well? 
MR FROLICK:  Chairperson I do not want to go into the 
dynamics of that family which is quite a sensitive issue.  Yes 
they are brothers but the levels of interaction is completely 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 97 of 148 
 
different from one another.  I do not want to – to go into that.  
They will be in a better position to explain that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I understand.  Because Mr Watson – Mr 
– Sorry Mr Agrizzi has seems to have a clear recollection of 
what happened.  Turn to page 50.  Paragraph – look at 
paragraph 24.  24.1 I want to read it for you: 
“As I confirmed that I did meet with Mr 
Cedrick 
Frolick 
at 
Mr 
Valance 
Watson’s 
house and we joked about the beautiful 
brown lounge suite and Persian carpets and 
10 
we stated that we would not be able to afford 
such items.” 
Is – this is the evidence of someone – he does not say I just 
saw he says I interacted with Mr Frolick we spoke and we 
joked about things.  And you say you cannot remember this? 
MR FROLICK:  I do not remember that Chairperson.  That is 
the version of Mr Agrizzi for whatever reason he is 
mentioning it in that way I cannot remember that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now I see in your – I read in your 
affidavit – in your affidavit you say that it is strange that Mr 
20 
Agrizzi says he gave the money to Mr Watson and then Mr 
Watson gave to you.  And you ask him why did Mr Agrizzi not 
just say give the money to you.  Am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And am I correct to say that if Mr Agrizzi 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 98 of 148 
 
was making up this story it would have been easy for him to 
say well I have got him the money and then I gave it to him.  
He would not create all this giving the money to someone to 
give it to you.  Am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  That is also what I questioned Chairperson in 
terms of the version of events as Mr Agrizzi said.  Logic tells 
me if that you coming there with this load of money that you 
give to somebody why would you give it to something – 
someone else and then that one gives it to someone else.  
That is the – I simply in terms of what I state in my affidavit 
10 
say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FROLICK:  It does not make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the – the one possibility at least that 
I can think of is that if Mr Gavin Watson had given him the 
money on the basis that he should give it to Mr Valance 
Watson for Mr Valance Watson to pass it on to you maybe he 
would not want to give it directly to you to say I am giving it 
to the person that I was told I must give it to.  But he must 
give it to Mr Frolick.  That is the only thing I can think of. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I have a – my view is quite different 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I just… 
MR FROLICK:  I understand what you saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just saying a possibility. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 99 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know it may be that somebody else 
will say well there is no need for the money to go via 
Valance Watson we are all here – here is the money.  So that 
is possible as well. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And – and just whether I was putting – 
whether I was putting to you that would not Mr Agrizzi’s story 
if you are creating be more simple.  He says when I got there 
I gave the money to Mr Frolick rather than creating this long 
route? 
10 
MR FROLICK:  Well my view Chairperson is that I struggle to 
follow the – why Mr Agrizzi would come to this type of 
conclusion around money that was passed from one person 
to the other side.  I do not know what his thinking is in terms 
of what he has put to the commission.  Because I share a 
different – a completely different perspective in terms of the 
approach of this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what Mr Notshe is suggesting to you 
is look if Mr Agrizzi was fabricating all of this and wanted to 
falsely bring you in corruption would it not be an easier thing 
20 
for him to say we met in Mr Valance Watson’s house.  Mr 
Frolick was there and I handed him the money and he took it 
from me.  So in other words I can testify positively I gave it 
to him as opposed to saying I gave it to somebody else for 
that person to give it to him.  So he is saying would that not 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 100 of 148 
 
be as an easier thing for somebody who wants to frame you 
rather than talk about this version of giving it to somebody 
else? 
MR FROLICK:  No I follow what the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You follow what I am saying yes. 
MR FROLICK:  I follow what Advocate Notshe is bringing to 
the fore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say it did not happen? 
10 
MR FROLICK:  It did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you know his evidence perhaps then 
it can tie in with what you had been asking for.  His evidence 
says this within a week after you had been given money you 
managed to arrange a meeting with Mr Vincent Smith. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  Chairperson that is not as I recall the 
evidence.  What he said was about ten days after the 
meeting at BOSASA’s offices this incident happened in Port 
Elizabeth, that is what he said.  With respect. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I cannot recall Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  On page – on page 26.  Paragraph – 
starting from paragraph 70. 70 he says:  This is the evidence 
of Mr Agrizzi.  He says: 
“I gave the package of cash to Valance 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 101 of 148 
 
Watson who later gave it to Cedrick Frolick 
as we left the house.  Within a week of 
meeting Mr Gavin Watson Mr Gavin Watson – 
sorry.  Within a week of the meeting Gavin 
Watson received a call from Cedrick Frolick.  
Gavin 
Watson 
told 
me 
that 
I 
was 
to 
accompany Gavin – Gibson Njenje on an 
introductory meeting with Vincent Smith.” 
There it is. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:  I stand corrected Mr Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you. 
MR FROLICK:  So what is the question Advocate? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The question is – he says within a week 
after he met you you had then arranged a meeting to see 
that they see Mr Frolick – to Mr Vincent Smith. 
MR FROLICK:  No I do not agree.  I do not agree with that 
Chairperson.  I – my – if I must go back. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  To after the meeting that took place 
Chairperson at BOSASA is that we returned to Cape Town.  I 
20 
returned to Cape Town personally and it was in Cape Town 
because we had duties to fulfil there and it was during that 
period that I had interaction with Mr Smith.  This thing of a 
meeting in Port Elizabeth at Mr Valance Watson’s house I do 
not know where it fits in or where it comes in and that is why 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 102 of 148 
 
I say that maybe if – since Mr Agrizzi kept such meticulous 
record of the gym and furniture in the house and all of that 
then surely he must know the date that this meeting took 
place in Port Elizabeth. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is it not so…sorry. 
MR FROLICK:  I… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, no continue.  I beg your pardon. 
MR FROLICK:  No, no.  So I cannot – I do not understand 
where this meeting fits into after the engagement from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because the date – no date is given or 
10 
timeframe. 
MR FROLICK:  There is no date. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But are you not able when you try to jolt 
your memory to look at – think about when Mr Smith agreed.  
Because you said Mr Smith is a very busy person.  Now at 
some stage he agreed to meet them.  But then looking back 
a week before that and think where you were – the week 
before that. 
MR FROLICK:  It is long ago Chairperson but that – this type 
of incident that is referred to here it would have assisted me 
20 
if the specifics were available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FROLICK:  Because I know I was in Cape Town and it 
was within probably two weeks after being to the office there 
that Mr Agrizzi and – and that is the first time by the way 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 103 of 148 
 
that I met him.  Mr Njenje came to Cape Town and I cannot – 
I do not know where this fits in.  And that is why I say give 
me more details but I can definitely say Sir that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I think that your evidence will not 
be to deny having facilitated a meeting between BOSASA 
and Mr Vincent Smith? 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is what Mr Agrizzi also says.  I think 
the difference between your version in relation to facilitating 
the meeting and Mr Agrizzi’s version is that Mr Agrizzi says 
10 
the facilitation came about because they had started giving 
you money.  Or – whereas you are saying yes I did facilitate 
but it was not because of any money that I had received.  Am 
I right in putting it that way? 
MR FROLICK:  That is my submission Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  And that is why with respect that is why I say 
this episode now of Port Elizabeth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  And Waverley coming in. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FROLICK:  I really cannot remember that Sir. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now – but your  then your – your version 
responding to the Chairperson is this that – oh before I do 
that.  We know at the time you were not in the Portfolio 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 104 of 148 
 
Committee for Justice and Correctional Services? 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you just came to be involved in this 
BOSASA Correctional Services because you accompanied Mr 
Butana Komphela to the BOSASA complex right.  And then 
insofar as you were concerned you were just helping Mr 
Gavin Watson whom you had seen – whom you knew to meet 
Mr Smith, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And thereafter you had no reason to be 
10 
involved with BOSASA and their problems with the Portfolio 
Committee.  It was not your committee? 
MR FROLICK:  No Chairperson I – as I said earlier I have 
never served on that committee.  Never ever served on that 
committee and after that visit that took place and I think Mr 
Agrizzi also if I am not mistaken in his verbal evidence that 
he gave – when they reported back to Mr Watson that they 
were not happy with the outcome of the discussion.  And 
after that I had no reason to be further interested in the 
matter as it is – as that specific matter is.  Not meaning that 
20 
I seized my inter – friendship with Mr Watson and his 
brothers and all of that.  The friendship still continued.  And 
even up to today we are friends. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now when did you again discuss the 
BOSASA issue with Mr Watson – Gavin Watson after the visit 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 105 of 148 
 
to the Parliament? 
MR FROLICK:  Mr – after the visit to Parliament and Mr 
Gavin Watson was not part of it.  He called me and he said 
to me you have heard that the meeting did not go well. 
These guys said they just left nothing happened.  And that 
was the time when he called me to say that it did not work.  
They tried to engage but – have a discussion with the 
Chairperson of that committee but it did not work.  That was 
basically almost I think if I can remember well almost on the 
same day or the following day. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And that was it? 
MR FROLICK:  That was it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you never spoke to him about 
BOSASA? 
MR FROLICK:  No.  You know what Chairperson I think and I 
want to make use of this opportunity of the type of person 
that the late Gavin Watson was.  A very persistent person.  
Very persistent person probably that is why he got involved 
in business and things like that.  But Mr Watson always had 
a passion for what he was doing and he believed in what he 
20 
was doing and the way that he was doing it.  So that even on 
occasion when you discuss the broader politics of which he 
followed in the ANC and call you and he will come and he 
talk about this or that.  Or when the – the sport situation in 
the Eastern Cape unravelled, did not work out he would 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 106 of 148 
 
speak to me.  He called me, speak to me and say, but you 
know what why you guys – because at one stage I left 
Eastern Province Rugby I resigned.  I think it was 2014 I left 
the union.  He said:  But why do you not speak to Cheeky as 
well?  So he can also leave this thing because that thing is 
never going to work.   
 
But he would continuously say that he is getting a raw 
deal in terms of his business operations and he does not 
know why he is treated like that.   
 
He is an ANC member and he is a supporter of the 
10 
African National Congress.  So he raised it afterwards.  He 
will come continuously back to it.   
 
But then, at the point, then you tell him:  But listen here, 
I cannot assist you with that.  I can give you an opinion or a 
view but more than that I cannot do because that is not my 
area of operation.   
 
As a friend I can advise you but in terms of the dealings 
of what is happening there, I cannot share any information 
with you that I do not have because I do not serve in that 
capacity.   
20 
 
And 
even 
having 
being 
the 
chairperson 
of 
the 
committees, Chief Justice.  We do not get involved.  The 
rules of parliament says the committees, they follow their 
own programmes.  They do whatever they do.  They report 
on those matters.   
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 107 of 148 
 
 
And Advocate Notshe referred earlier to minutes.  He 
referred to minutes of meetings.  I do not read minutes of 
committee meetings.  That is something...  
 
Because if you read minutes of a meeting that you were 
not part of, what are you trying to achieve?  So I do not read 
it.  I oversee and work with 38, at least, chairpersons who 
are dealing with various things.   
 
And the forum where they discuss minutes and where 
they deal with their issues is in the portfolio committees.  So 
I would simply, when Mr Watson would, whether it is about 
10 
elections that he is talking, internal issues in the ANC and 
whatever he wants to bring up.   
 
The issue of his bad treatment that he is getting.  Then I 
would say:  Well, that is something you must deal with.  That 
is something... and if there are legal issues involved, pursue 
the legal routes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I see we are at two minutes past 
one.  I propose, if everyone agrees, that we continue 
because I suspect that we should be able to be done by two 
o’clock. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We should be Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we adjourn for the day. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that suit everybody? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair besides Mr Frolick.  He had 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 108 of 148 
 
made a special request that we will try and finish him early. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He needs to go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And... no, that suits me very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Van Zyl also indicates, he is happy 
with that.  Okay let us continue then. 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, with respect.  Is it possible just 
to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, to have a ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR FROLICK:   ...to answer a call from nature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  [laughing]  Okay let us take, what ten 
minutes’ break? 
MR FROLICK:   Even shorter, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR FROLICK:   It is up to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us say ten minutes. 
MR FROLICK:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Frolick, so you 
confirm that the meeting at Cape Town with Mr Smith was 
done with his consent, he agreed to meet these people. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 109 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   Mr Smith agreed, he said when they are 
there he should – he will be able to join them. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I will tell you why I am asking that is 
because in his – when he gave an affidavit to this 
Commission he says he was sort of – he met them, they 
were unannounced and he did not appreciate that. 
MR FROLICK:   Well... 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He says they came to see him 
unannounced and he did not appropriate that visit. 
MR FROLICK:   Well, Chairperson, I can recall that after 
10 
mentioning it to Mr Smith he said no, it is fine, he will meet 
with them and he never came back to me to say that he felt 
ambushed or unannounced or whatever in terms of the 
engagement that took place there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was in the discussion that you had 
with him, when he agreed, was a date also agreed or was it 
just agreed in principle to meet them but without agreeing 
to particular date as yet? 
MR FROLICK:   Well, what I indicated to him, Chairperson, 
was that they would be in Cape Town as they have said 
20 
and it was Mr Watson, would be in Cape Town during the 
course of that weekend.  He said no, it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR FROLICK:   I will meet whether – so it was not a 
specific thing that was set down. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 110 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   As going to meet, they were in Cape Town, 
they said – because Mr Watson was not there, Mr Agrizzi 
and Mr Njenje came.  So I was also surprised when the two 
of them came and no the one that actually asked for the 
meeting.  So they said they would be in Cape Town and 
then I said, after having spoken to Mr Smith he said no, it 
is fine, he will meet them.  So there was no – not a specific 
agenda or date set down for this to take place.  They said 
during the course of the week they will be there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless maybe he was expecting Mr 
Gavin Watson whom he has said he knew quite well and 
then maybe he was surprised when he saw other people, 
that maybe that might also be …[intervenes] 
MR FROLICK:   It is possible, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …that caused him to be upset. 
MR FROLICK:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know, I know that he said that 
he – he had known Mr Watson from I think either late ‘80’s 
or early ‘90’s he knew Mr Gavin Watson quite well, so – Mr 
20 
Notshe, you might have a better recollection of exactly…  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, no, he did say he had known Mr 
Watson for some time before the incident.  Now after the 
visit, after they told you that the meeting was not 
successful, did you ask Mr Smith what happened? 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 111 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, I did not engage with Mr 
Smith again on the matter because I did not want to come 
across to put him in a situation where he was not 
comfortable or upset with that meeting that took place, 
however short it may be, so I did not discuss the matter 
again with him, I just left it there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And I am sure as a parliamentarian, 
seasoned parliamentarian, you know that the Portfolio 
Committees have this oversight role over the executive, I 
am sure you realise that you do not want to be seen to be 
10 
favouring any individual against the executive or to be 
seen as part of an individual or a company, am I right? 
MR FROLICK:   Yes, I have said earlier, Chairperson, that 
the 
Portfolio 
Committees 
 
- 
that 
is 
one 
of 
their 
responsibilities, Advocate, in terms of overseeing the 
executive but given the broad powers that the rules of 
parliament give then they can basically do whatever they 
decide. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But members of the Portfolio 
Committee would not be seen to be – did not want to be 
20 
seen batting for one company or one individual. 
MR FROLICK:   No, of course, it is not helpful to do that 
and that is why in terms also of the rules that are there it 
is very, very clear in terms of what their roles and 
functions are.  We generally – generally, when the 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 112 of 148 
 
committees engage with any entity whether it is the 
governments or entities or individual persons you would 
expect them that they must always be cognisant of that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And now when you were phoned by Mr 
Watson 
about 
this 
litigation 
they 
intended 
against 
Department of Correctional Services, why did you not say 
to him you cannot entertain this because it is not one of 
your roles? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, I responded to Mr Watson as 
a friend who needed advice because he has always been 
10 
complaining about this thing, he is losing business, they 
are taking things from – they are dropping standards, he 
will complain about a lot of different things so I simply said 
that listen here, if you guys feel you have a case, proceed 
but it is your decision that you should take.  It is your 
decision that you should take and you must decide what 
you must do, I cannot tell you whether to go this way or 
that way. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Why did you not just say to him look, it 
is not my business to advise you onto whether you should 
20 
litigate or not? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, as I said in my affidavit, I 
responded to say that it is your decision, I cannot – and I 
did not give them any instruction to drop litigation in terms 
of anything that they were busy with because I did not 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 113 of 148 
 
even know what the extent of the matter is because I was 
not privy to that type of information and I responded to him 
as a friend and said that you want to do business, look at 
what your strategy is in dealing with the matter, consider 
the options that are there but ultimately it is your decision, 
you can take that decision, sorry.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Did you say to them it would be unwise 
to litigate against government, government department? 
MR FROLICK:   What I said was that since the operations, 
as Mr Watson always referred to, they do work for social 
10 
development, they do this, they do that and what informed 
me to say that to them is I know in litigating government 
departments take very, very long and it usually has an 
impact in terms of your relations with the 
different 
government departments that are there and that is why I 
said it is your decision but just be aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be correct to say you did give 
them advice but ultimately you said it is their decision. 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And the advice was against 
20 
litigating but saying ultimately you must decide. 
MR FROLICK:   You must decide. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now did you ask Mr Watson why did he 
call you instead of calling his lawyers regarding litigation? 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 114 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, Mr Watson on previous 
occasions when he would call and he raised different 
things and say that he is going to take them to the 
cleaners and this and that, so he mentioned it a few times 
to me.  Mentioned it a few times to me and I did not ask 
him why he is calling me.  My understanding was that he 
called me because of the collegiality, friendship that is 
there between us and the fact that you could see that he 
was very, very frustrated with what was happening around 
him and I did not pose that question to him why are you 
10 
calling me? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now tell me, did you and Gavin 
Watson call each other now and again? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, there is four of those 
brothers and the one who would call me, apart from Cheeky 
and Valance, would regularly contact me about different 
things what is there.  Just as an example, Chairperson, as 
I have indicated earlier, Mr Watson was very concerned in 
2016 as we were heading towards the local government 
elections and I want to contextualise this. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I understand. 
MR FROLICK:   Is that at that stage the operational centre 
from 
where 
the 
ANC 
Local 
Government 
elections 
campaigns was running from, was in fact based at the 
BOSASA campus or whatever they call it, right?  And then 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 115 of 148 
 
he would call me because we use a system, the cloud 
system, where from across the country the different 
branches and election structures can upload information in 
terms of what they were doing for the day or for the week. 
 
So he would stand there and he would call me and 
he would say that I do not see anything happening in Port 
Elizabeth, especially in – there is a certain area in Port 
Elizabeth we call the Northern areas that is vital in terms 
of the swing as to which party is going to get the majority 
and he would say that but there is no information coming 
10 
through and I would tell him, no, no, we are sending the 
information through, it is coming through.  He says but I 
am standing here, there is no information here, there is 
absolutely nothing here.   
Or, as we went – he had keen interest in what was 
happening in our movement and structures as we went to 
the 2017 conference of the ANC at NASREC.  He would 
always call to find out what is happening with – you guys, 
you do not even have proper branches, when are you going 
to do this, what are the balance of forces, which way do 
20 
you think it is going to go?  So we would engage on those 
things. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   By the slates. 
MR FROLICK:   Excuse me? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And the slates. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 116 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   Not the slates, we did not discuss the slate 
but he had keen interest as to – Chairperson, I will ignore 
that comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   So we would call – excuse me. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, no, do not worry. 
MR FROLICK:   So he would call me and he would raise 
these issues continuously and say that but, you know what, 
I have heard in terms of the balance of power and the ANC, 
it is shifting this way, or it is shifting that way.   And even 
10 
when, as the conference was unfolding, he would call and 
say what is happening now?  Is it true what they are 
reading on social media and things that is taking place?  
So he had keen interest as far as that is concerned. 
 
Also, as went to the general election after the 2017 
conference – and remember, we had the change in the 
head of state as well in February that year, so he would 
call, we would discuss those type of things, what is 
happening and – he also had very firm views around 
certain issues when I can recall there was a committee that 
20 
was looking into the issue of land expropriation without 
compensation and he had a certain view as to what it can 
or cannot do to the economy of the country and he would 
call and he would give his view like this and you cannot do 
this or why do you not try this and that and that?  So he 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 117 of 148 
 
really had interest in those type of things even as we 
moved towards the 2019 general election that was taking 
place. 
 
So he would call – sometimes he would get me, 
other times he would not get me or I would return the call 
to him and that was the nature or our relationship.  If he, 
for instance, with the – there is one incident I can also 
remember with the Soccer World Cup that was taking place 
and he had a particular view about South Africa trying to 
put in a bid again and I said no, but it does not work like 
10 
that, it is a little bit more complicated like that because he 
believed that the infrastructure that was there is not being 
utilised optimally in terms of the economy. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And is it correct that you would also 
call him? 
MR FROLICK:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But is it correct that you were not part 
of BOSASA, he never drew you into his business, you were 
not part of his business. 
MR FROLICK:   I was never part of BOSASA, Chairperson, 
20 
we would engage each other at that level and even if he 
then attempted to raise issues about the company I would 
say that no, wait, just hang on with that a bit, that is a 
particular issue that you guys must deal with internally so 
that you can look into the matter as to what is the best 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 118 of 148 
 
possible outcomes that you can achieve. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look, if you – can you just turn to 
page 68?  Are you there? 
MR FROLICK:   68? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  
MR FROLICK:   Trying to get there but – yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   This is EXHIBIT T17.5.  The record of 
a number of calls recorded between you and Mr Watson.  I 
am sure you saw a number of them from him to you and 
some from you to him, am I right? 
10 
MR FROLICK:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now what I have also noticed was also 
during that time in 2017 on the 6 t h – on page 70. 
MR FROLICK:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You were called by Mrs Nomvula 
Mokonyane on the 6 t h.  Do you see that? 
MR FROLICK:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The 6 March 2017. 
MR FROLICK:   The print is a bit small. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   If you – to help you …[intervenes] 
20 
MR FROLICK:   Yes, yes, I have seen it.  Yes, I have seen 
it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then do you remember that call? 
MR FROLICK:   The 6/03? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Of March, ja. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 119 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   2017.  Yes.  No, I do not remember having 
a discussion with Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  There was a 
particular matter I know when she subsequently – she 
referred it to me when she was in parliament that she was 
experiencing with the committee on Water and Sanitation 
that she was the head of department and you know 
sometimes part of my work also include facilitating, 
Chairperson, discussions between the Chairperson of a 
committee and a Minister if there are differences of opinion 
on how to proceed with the matter but I can also say that 
10 
you have referred to a number of calls to and fro, we did 
not have sufficient time last night to go through this.  
However, a number of them says no, there is call duration 
zero, zero, so …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Mr Chairperson, may I interrupt the 
witness, I am sorry but the cell records, they have a 
problem with their own, you will see in the second column 
record type and we do not know what all these things mean 
but if you go to the very last column on these two calls 
where Ms Mokonyane is indicated, the duration is nought 
20 
so it seems not to have been a call at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Sorry, I interrupted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine.  Continue, Mr 
Notshe. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 120 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you say you cannot recall these 
calls? 
MR FROLICK:   I cannot recall getting a call from Ms 
Mokonyane.  As I have said, I recall a discussion more or 
less at that stage in 2017 around the committee matter that 
she was not happy with. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Because the following day, the 7 t h, you 
called her. 
MR FROLICK:   Yes, I returned a call and she was on 
voicemail. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And then I see down the line on 
the 7 t h she called you and I am not certain – can you 
remember whether you spoke to her then?  Do you recall? 
MR FROLICK:   On the 7 t h? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As you go down – the easiest way is to 
track it through the calling number. 
MR FROLICK:   Ja, ja, I am trying to do that but it would 
have been easy if I had a ruler here to... 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Let me give you the – I you do not 
mind, I will help you with a piece of paper. 
20 
MR FROLICK:   Thank you.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Do you see that number? 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, I see there is a number 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 121 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   083 and then it goes on and it ends with 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On page 70? 
MR FROLICK:   On 70, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   Towards the right, towards the end where 
it is written Nomvula Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR FROLICK:   And there is a cell number that is in there, 
26 and it ends with 44.  Can you see that Advocate? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, yes, sir. 
MR FROLICK:   And it is reflected as my number.  It is my 
number but it is a telephone that is used by one of my 
children who is very active in the ANC in the Western 
Cape. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay. 
MR FROLICK:   Where Comrade Nomvula is one of the 
deployees, he is part of the – or was part of the University 
…[intervenes] . 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Oh, okay. 
20 
MR FROLICK:   ...thing and it – I am just saying that it 
could be discussion related to that [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I understand.  No, I understand, 
ja. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 122 of 148 
 
MR FROLICK:   I cannot dwell further into that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I understand.  Now just go to page 
72.  It seems as if you received a call from Jonas Joe 
Gumede on the 11 December 2017. 
MR FROLICK:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You know who Gumede is? 
MR FROLICK:   Jonas Joe Gumede is an old comrade who 
is working with or for or used to work at BOSASA.  Now let 
me contextualise that for you.  That was at the time as we 
were going towards the conference of the African National 
10 
Congress in NASREC and there were certain services that 
were provided and Mr Gumede was also at that conference 
or he was coordinating some work towards that conference 
there but even there you can see that there was no 
discussion that could take place because a call duration in 
terms of the second is 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9.  So I remember 
seeing him, not as a delegate at the conference but he was 
one of the service providers who were there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay, so he must have called you 
about that. 
20 
MR FROLICK:   Well, I do not know why, I subsequently, 
even though I saw him, he just greeted and things and that 
was it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now also if you go – can you go to 
page 74? 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 123 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Page 74. 
CHAIRPERSON:   74? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  In the middle of the page I see 
there is call – okay, from Papa Leshabane.  Do you see 
that? 
MR FROLICK:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Do you know who he is? 
MR FROLICK:   Yes, Papa is a person that also works or 
used to work in one of the subsidiary companies at 
10 
BOSASA. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   BOSASA, yes. 
MR FROLICK:   Yes and similarly, Papa Leshabane used to 
– I used to see him sometimes when he comes to 
parliament in Cape Town or on whatever business he is 
coming to do there and we would greet but that is – I 
cannot say it is a friend, it is more an acquaintance but in 
terms of the content of the discussions that was taking 
place there.  I cannot really recall what it was about. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But he is also linked to BOSASA. 
20 
MR FROLICK:   Yes, no, he used to work there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And so was Mphaphuti(?)Dlamini. 
MR FROLICK:   Who is that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look on the …[intervenes] 
MR FROLICK:   I do not know Mphaphuti Dlamini. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 124 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mphaphuti Dlamini. 
MR FROLICK:   I know Papa for a long time because – and 
the first time I actually met Papa Leshabane was when he 
attended a funeral service of the Watson family in Port 
Elizabeth when the mother passed away. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Because there is a record that you 
received a call from Papa Leshabane and then there is a 
slash and Mphaphuti Dlamini.  The call was about 356 
seconds.  You do not recall that?  
MR FROLICK:   Chair, but I – no, I really – no, I am not 
10 
saying that there was no call but the thing is I cannot 
really remember what the discussion was or the reason 
was for that call. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, I understand that. 
MR FROLICK:   I know Papa was also very passionate in 
attending these events and things that was happening, so I 
cannot recall that. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Mr Chairperson, if I may again 
interrupt here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   If you look at this specific call of 356 
minutes …[intervenes] 
MR FROLICK:   Seconds. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:    You will see that it differs from the 
others.  As the record typed it is indicated as a CF and 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 125 of 148 
 
then it shows call forwarding.  You see call forward in the 
third last column, that is where Mr Frolick’s name appears 
for the first time and then party number three, there is a 
267 number.  How all this hangs together we do not know, I 
need to point that out. 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   I also indicated that we received this 
information late yesterday afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
10 
MR FROLICK:   And initially we difficulties in terms of the 
spreadsheet and the way it was printed so we had to go to 
quite some length to get some idea as to what is 
everything in here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But what is clear – what, Mr Frolick, 
comes out clear is that these people that are reflected in 
this printout are people you know. 
MR FROLICK:   I know Mr Leshabane, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you know Joe Gumede. 
20 
MR FROLICK:   I know Joe Gumede. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you also know that these people 
used to work for BOSASA. 
MR FROLICK:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And if you go down there is also 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 126 of 148 
 
Sisinisio Opela(?).  Do you know him? 
MR FROLICK:   I have met Sisinisio once.  I have met once 
when he was – or possibly on more than one occasion, if 
my memory serves me correct, when he was in Port 
Elizabeth and the place where I met him was when I went 
to a discussion with Mr Valance Watson and he was 
apparently in Port Elizabeth and he came in there.  So that 
is from that time that I know him and [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   How did he get your number? 
10 
MR FROLICK:   Excuse me? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   How did he get your number, do you 
know? 
MR FROLICK:   No, I do not know.  You must keep in mind, 
Chairperson, that that number, that 0 – the 267, the 267 
number is displayed on the website of parliament, business 
cards, everywhere.  That number is everywhere, so I 
cannot say with certainty he got the number from this one 
or that one. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja.  Okay, I see here that Sisinisio 
20 
called you on one day on a number of occasions and he 
spent some time with you, like some seconds with you on 
the phone.  Do you know why he called you a number of 
times? 
MR FROLICK:   No, I cannot recall, sir.  As I said, we did 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 127 of 148 
 
no really have even time to go into the depth of the 
document that was sent out yesterday afternoon.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chairman, can you just bear with me 
one second?  I think that is all I wanted to clarify from the 
witness, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the impression I have, Mr Frolick, 
looking at these telephone records or cell phone records, 
is the impression I have that Mr Gavin Watson frequently 
wanted to talk to you, whether he succeeded sometimes or 
did not succeed most of the times, is that impression 
10 
correct? 
MR FROLICK:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   As I have said earlier, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   That he is the type of individual that 
basically was a person who – irrepressible, if you can call 
it that way, that you must continuously slow down and say 
no, no, no, wait.  Or it is something that really is not within 
my scope of doing it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR FROLICK:   But we had that type of relationship and 
that is how I know those brothers, that is how I know them.  
They are good friends of mine and that is the way they 
engage. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 128 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, actually I see that there used to be 
quite frequent – reasonably frequent calls also between 
yourself and Mr Smith. 
MR FROLICK:   May I respond, Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am just having a look and want to 
…[intervenes] 
MR FROLICK:   Yes, no, I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And check whether my impression is 
correct. 
MR FROLICK:   Absolutely correct, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   You must remember that Mr Smith was 
after the 24 t h in elections involved with the constitutional 
review committee and Mr Smith did two important tasks up 
to 2019.   
The one was the inquiry that he headed into the 
SABC and the second one was all these public hearings 
that took place across the country to get the views of 
South Africans on the – also the amendment of the 
constitution to make the expropriation of land without 
20 
compensation possible.   
So as with Mr Smith and other Chairpersons who 
are busy with important processes, they will call for 
procedural advice or they will call and they will say the 
logistics are not in place or the hotels that members are 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 129 of 148 
 
staying in is of an – not of a good quality that we expect or 
the transport, this has happened, or there is a problem 
with the staff allocation or the oversight visits or the 
venues were not booked on time.  So they would call 
continuously and they call any time of the day or night, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR FROLICK:   And the nature of my work is, is that I must 
entertain them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, so it seems to me that the 
10 
picture that emerges, and you can comment from your 
evidence and that of Mr Watson, no Mr Agrizzi, is you are 
not in a position to deny or dispute his evidence that at a 
certain time before – at a certain time before they got to 
know you, that is now Mr Agrizzi and – I don’t know 
whether Mr Gavin Watson also did not know you until this 
happened, whether you only knew his brothers.   
But it seems that you do not deny or dispute his 
version that  one as BOSASA they had certain challenges 
with regard to negative publicity in the media connected 
20 
with their relationship with the Department of Correctional 
Services mainly and the challenges being that they wanted 
the portfolio committee on correctional services to handle 
matters that could arise that relate to BOSASA and 
correctional services to handle them in a manner, in a 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 130 of 148 
 
certain manner because he says that they did not want to 
have a situation where the portfolio committee maybe could 
take a view which would result in them not being even in a 
contract anymore.   
I think that is why what he is saying so it looks like 
they wanted to make sure that when BOSASA issues arose 
in the portfolio committee they wanted to know that the 
portfolio committee would handle those matters in a 
manner that would not result in them losing business with 
the correctional services or not been granted any further 
10 
contracts and for that reason they wanted to talk to the 
Chairperson of that committee.  You do not know anything 
about that or at least you do not dispute it as I understand 
the position, is that correct? 
MR FROLICK:   No, Chairperson what I do know is and you 
stated it correctly is that they definitely said that they had 
a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They shared that with you.  
MR FROLICK:   They have a problem however if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
20 
MR FROLICK:   Portfolio committees have no powers to 
award and to withdraw contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR FROLICK:   That is between the relevant department 
and the entities that are involved or the companies that are 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 131 of 148 
 
involved.  Portfolio committees do not get involved in 
allocating of the contracts, withdrawing of the contracts 
they can report and then secondly any matter that is raised 
in front of a portfolio committee cannot simply be swept 
under the carpet also they have a role and responsibility to 
play with it.  And that is why the standing committee 
especially 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
financial 
matters 
are 
concerned on public accounts are of such importance.  It 
happens now and then Chairperson that certain issues fall 
off the radius screen or there is certain things because 
10 
portfolio committees they also in the law making business, 
they conduct all these different types of things that they do 
and in parliament we do not have that type of capacity 
where you can probe each and every contract that is 
awarded by the department for whatever reason, we do not 
have that capacity.  So committees rely a lot on what is 
presented to them right and to follow up then on the issues 
and then ably supported by the office of the Auditor 
General then.  The Auditor General will then flag and the 
committees will then zoom in specifically.  Also keep in 
20 
mind Chairperson that the Auditor General does not audit 
all the books it takes a sample of what is there in the 
different government departments but it is impossible to 
hide a matter that is in front of a portfolio committee 
because the portfolios committees are all multi-party 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 132 of 148 
 
committees and in the case of SCOPA it is a committee 
that is led by as per our tradition and practice in 
parliament by a member of the opposition and that is the 
task and responsibility that they do.   
And it does happen at times when there are issues 
that are arising that the two committees will work together 
they will confer on a specific matter and that is how they 
go about doing their work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the portfolio committees might not 
have power to grant contracts, award contracts, award jobs 
10 
that is the function of government departments but what 
they certainly can do would you not agree is to put 
pressure on a government department that seems to be 
doing something they regard as wrong to say stop it.  Now 
let me tell you what I am thinking a portfolio committee 
could do I mean one of the things I raised I think already 
last year in relation to the BOSASA issues was for many 
years I was reading in the media in the newspaper that all 
kinds of allegations of corruption against BOSASA and my 
question 
was 
how 
did 
it 
come 
about 
that 
BOSASA 
20 
continued to be awarded contracts after contracts by 
government entities when there were these stories all over 
you see.   
Now if a portfolio committee, if the correctional 
services portfolio committee was aware that there were all 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 133 of 148 
 
kinds of allegations of corruption against BOSASA and they 
got to know that the Department of Correctional Services 
kept on giving them contracts or extending them certainly 
the portfolio committee would be capable of taking a strong 
position on the issue and say to the DG or the Minister this 
must stop have you investigated this, where is the outcome 
of the investigation.  It looks like nothing is being done 
about 
this 
company 
when 
all 
these 
allegations 
are 
continuing.  So I think there is some pressure they could 
put which could result in the department saying look until 
10 
maybe these issues are properly investigated let us stop 
giving this company contracts.  Would you not agree? 
MR FROLICK:   No, I agree with that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR FROLICK:   It is suffice to say that and maybe at 
another time in the Commission again because we are busy 
with another – I do not want to go into details with it you 
should be aware of it and when we come back that is a 
matter that we will go into great deal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am very happy I was going to provoke 
20 
you into that one but if you say you will be coming, I am 
happy.  
MR FROLICK:   No, Chairperson I think it is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR FROLICK:   To get that view not from an organisational 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 134 of 148 
 
perspective but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, from parliament.  
MR FROLICK:   But from parliament institution and the 
different political parties that are part of these type of 
processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR FROLICK:   I always remind people and when students 
also visit the institution I said this place that you walking 
in is not an administrative building this is a vicious political 
terrain that you are moving in.  Now without pre-empting 
10 
Deputy Chief Justice committees report and they make 
very, very important recommendations.  In terms of the 
separation of powers between the legislature and the 
executive 
it 
then 
becomes 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
executive 
to 
follow 
up 
and 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
recommendations that was made by portfolio committees.   
In the submission that we are looking at and that we 
will explore again is that that is the question that we 
posing.  If a committee reports then on all these things why 
did it not change, why was there no change in behaviour or 
20 
if a certain company or entity has been accused of 
wrongdoing for years and whatever they continue doing 
business with the State or you find that you have what you 
call the – for a lack of a better word I do not want to call it 
recycling.  The movement of certain core personal where 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 135 of 148 
 
fingers are pointed at in a specific department and then 
they disappear for a while and then they just surface in 
another department again.  But that is the type of thing 
that we are looking at Deputy Chief Justice and we will 
make that submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am very happy that you are working on 
that because it seems to me that parliamentary oversight is 
extremely important and a lot of things that may have gone 
wrong in our country may well have been stopped in their 
tracks if parliamentary oversight had been performed the 
10 
way we would like.  I am saying the way we would like 
because at this stage of course I do not know whether 
whatever evidence will be brought forward will reveal that 
parliament did not perform its oversight properly for 
whatever reasons maybe part of the reasons being lack of 
capacity, lack of certain skills or whatever I do not know.  
But some of the things one says you know one keeps up to 
date with what is happening in parliament one has never 
seen parliament do A, B, C, D you know.   
But parliament might be able to say we tried all of 
20 
these things but they just – they were not effective maybe 
the mechanisms we have of oversight are not effective, are 
not adequate.  Or maybe they are adequate but somewhere 
somehow there is no will to push, push things through so I 
am looking forward to the time when I will there will be that 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 136 of 148 
 
kind of interaction.   
But to go back to this point that you have said yes 
they have told you that there is this problem then you – 
this is BOSASA with regard to having access to the 
Chairperson or to the committee and then they spoke to 
you when you had that visit with Mr Komphela you 
discussed and the result was that you talk to Mr Vincent 
Smith and ultimately they met.  And then the picture at 
least that emerges from Mr Agrizzi’s evidence now I cannot 
remember well when you compare it with Mr Smith’s 
10 
evidence.  The picture seem to indicate that indeed there 
was a change of attitude on the part of Mr Smith towards 
BOSASA.  So it seems to me that a substantial part of what 
Agrizzi says is something that you may not be disputing 
but you are simply saying whatever facilitation you may 
have done to ensure that there was a meeting between 
BOSASA and Mr Smith was not because you had been 
given any money whereas Mr Agrizzi says we gave him 
money 
that 
is 
why 
we 
got 
this 
results. 
 
Is 
my 
understanding…[intervene]                
20 
MR FROLICK:      That is correct Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is correct, yes.  
MR FROLICK:      That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Anything arising?  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No not from me Chair.  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The only thing but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Van Zyl would you like to re-examine 
or are you fine?   
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair before he re-examines then I 
think you are going to ask him about much as arising from 
your questions. Can I just hand – let this be part of the 
record the affidavit the one which we were put in after tea. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I just lead that evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do that.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Frolick can you go to page 81. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page?  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Page 81 and then that is an affidavit 
which ends on page 90.  Do you confirm that that is your 
affidavit with annexures? 
MR FROLICK:    That is correct.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And Chair can that affidavit be 
20 
admitted as Exhibit T176. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Exhibit T?  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   T176.  
CHAIRPERSON:   T17 point? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Point 6.  
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 138 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   6? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Frolick’s affidavit that starts at page 
81 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit T17.6.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I have no further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Van Zyl? 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Thank you Mr Chairperson.

ADV VAN ZYL SC:   If I may I am quite happy to do it from 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      A question about the youth centre.  
When you and Mr Komphela arrived at the BOSASA campus 
can we call it I am not sure that I understood correctly are 
you saying that there was no youth centre or that they 
were not ready with it to receive you or what is the 
20 
position?   
MR FROLICK:      No, there is a youth centre but the way 
they packaged the visit included a number of other things 
and Mr Komphela was not comfortable about that.  So the 
centre is there and as I stated earlier the intention was to 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 139 of 148 
 
go and to see the youth centre but the way that the 
program was organised included basically the entire place 
where they do their operations there.  
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      Well the question arises why did you 
not say well forget about all the other places we are just 
going to see the youth centre or was that not on the 
agenda at all.  
MR FROLICK:      No they said that there would be a – 
they would require some type of transport or something 
because it involves extensive walking around the place and 
10 
keeping in mind that Mr Komphela has a disability and he 
was very agitated actually, he was very, very agitated when 
he saw that no this thing is now a lot bigger that was 
agreed to and also he had to catch his flight back to 
Bloemfontein and the time allocation that was set aside for 
all of this to happen now was simply too much. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      Then you grew up in Port Elizabeth?    
MR FROLICK:      That is correct. 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      Are you familiar with all the 
suburbs? 
20 
MR FROLICK:     When I grew up Chairperson I did not 
grow up in all those suburbs, I grew up in the townships.  
ADV VAN ZYL SC:      But can you tell us whether there is 
a suburb like Waverley?   
MR FROLICK:    There is a suburb called Mill Park. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 140 of 148 
 
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   No, can you tell us whether there is a 
suburb called Waverley? 
MR FROLICK:    No, I do not know a suburb called 
Waverley.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do not know if there is or would 
it be situation where you are definite that there is no such 
suburb or you would limit yourself to saying I have never 
heard of it.   
MR FROLICK:   No, I have never heard of a place called a 
suburb called Waverley in Port Elizabeth. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   And then on Mr Agrizzi’s evidence as 
to the meeting you were asked extensive questions on 
whether you left that office in which you were.  But to place 
it in context Agrizzi said you left the office you were called 
out by Watson basically so that he could give you money 
and he gave you the money.  What do you say about that?  
MR FROLICK:   No, I did not receive money upon any visit 
of mine to – on that visit to BOSASA.   
ADV VAN ZYL SC:   Thank you Mr Chairperson, I have no 
20 
further questions.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually you Mr Van Zyl your re-
examination has reminded me of something that I wanted 
to ask.  There is a – you know some weeks ago Mr Frolick, 
Mr Vincent Smith was here giving evidence and one of the 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 141 of 148 
 
– part of the bundle of documents that were before me 
included of the bundle included messages, I think either 
SMS text messages or WhatsApp messages between – 
exchange between Mr Agrizzi and Mr Watson.   
And they were talking between themselves about 
certain 
matters 
relating 
to 
BOSASA 
and 
they 
were 
mentioning Mr Vincent Smith’s name but in the process 
your name was also mentioned.  Now I just want to see 
where that is because I wanted to ask you about it.  Mr 
Notshe do you know where that is because I know it is here 
10 
I saw it last night? I think I…[intervene]       
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair no I have been unable to find 
that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No I think I am going to find it I have 
already seen one.  I think I am going to find it; you just 
have to be patient with me Mr Frolick.  You see in those 
messages Mr Watson and Mr Agrizzi are talking about 
things that relate to the Department of Correctional 
Services and mentioning people who were employed by 
correctional 
services 
and 
they 
mentioned 
if 
I 
recall 
20 
correctly contracts as well and then your name gets 
mentioned in that context     
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair you can look at page I think it is 
359. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 142 of 148 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   359.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I have got it.  It is page 463 of 
BOSASA Bundle 02 and can you make it available to Mr 
Frolick if he has not got it.  
MR FROLICK:      Just give me the page again Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is written BOSASA Bundle 02.  
MR FROLICK:      And the page Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the page is 463.  The message is 
begin a little earlier they begin at 460.  So maybe we start 
at 460 and then we can, have you got 460, not yet?  
10 
MR FROLICK:      I have got it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see 460 I think that is Mr Gavin 
Watson sending to Mr Agrizzi if I am not mistaken 27 
August 2016.  He says: 
“No further payments we need to have a meeting 
with them before we get to involved and embroiled 
in the fight with the EFF this is going to be ugly.  
Nomvula is being sucked in as one of the funders it 
could backfire on us, Joe has also confirmed this, 
God bless.” 
20 
I may be mistaken about who is sending it to who but I 
think from last time Mr Notshe said it was exchanges 
between Mr Agrizzi and Mr Gavin Watson.  Then the 
following page 461 the message at the top says: 
“Vincent Smith just got hold of me he says let us 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 143 of 148 
 
wait until Tuesday because his having a meeting 
tomorrow with ZM and Smallberger, God bless.” 
Now I think there was, there is a Smallberger that was at 
the Department of Correctional Services I do not know 
whether that is the same person they are talking about but 
the message below that says: 
“I think I would have told him - from Mr Agrizzi - he 
called me as well what he said was to continue the 
prepped 
meetings 
drafting 
documents 
we 
will 
convene on Tuesday at 14h00 then review our 
10 
approach and adjust the three pronged approach 
but he did not say we should halt it.”   
Then there is: 
“I tried to call you on WhatsApp.” 
Then there this is: 
“I agree it is a three pronged approach.” 
Then page 462 it seems to be Mr Gavin Watson to Mr 
Agrizzi it is about Vincent Smith.  He says: 
“Vincent Smith just got hold of me he says let us 
wait until Tuesday because he is having a meeting 
20 
tomorrow with ZM and Smallberger, God bless.”   
Oh that is the same message, then at 463 that is where 
your name, well at least Cedric is mentioned that might not 
be you so but they just said Cedric it might be another 
Cedric.  It says: 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 144 of 148 
 
“I agree it is a three pronged approach Vincent’s 
approach and Cedric’s approach when I said wait it 
is for the meeting for Tuesday to give us more 
information how to approach this thing, this is why 
he is having a meeting with Smallberger to give us 
more information on what is taking place in DCS.” 
And then the other one says: 
“Okay understood but by 8:30 I need to confirm 
drafting papers otherwise we miss the deadline.  I 
will send you an explanatory.” 
10 
It does not say Cedric Frolick but I do not know whether 
you might have had any conversations with them which you 
might associate with what they are talking about here?              
MR FROLICK:   No Chairperson I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not.   
MR FROLICK:   And especially when it comes to officials of 
any different departments and things I do not get involved 
with that type of detail so I really do not know what they 
are referring to.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.  Thank you.     
20 
MR FROLICK:   Chairperson I see you want to close this 
session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
MR FROLICK:   If I may just make a remark please I think 
it is important for the work of this Commission. 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 145 of 148 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR FROLICK:      Because the Commission was initially 
faced with a number of challenges as far as the leaking of 
information is concerned of witnesses that was still going 
to appear.  I thank you for the opportunity to have come to 
give my version of what has transpired and so forth and I 
wish to indicate that on all the – not all the other dates 
there was a date in April if you can recall that I was 
supposed to come but then we went into lockdown.  Then 
there was a date in July again…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR FROLICK:      But then I was part of the Covid situation 
that was that was there but I did receive a message the 
first time that I was going to appear here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
MR FROLICK:      And I am not going to name any names 
Chairperson from a journalist and it was a text message 
that the journalist sent to me it is about the working of the 
Commission trying to imply and say you know what you are 
going to be charged for corruption who is your attorney 
20 
that is going to represent you.  Why are you going now to 
the Commission to cross-question certain witnesses and do 
all these type of things and you already - a warning 
statement was taken and all of that, and I referred it to my 
lawyer that is there but I think it is very important 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 146 of 148 
 
Chairperson for you as the Chairperson of this Commission 
to be aware of the attempts to drive the narrative from the 
outside which I really think is undermining the work of this 
Commission and it will make it very, very difficult for the 
Commission to proceed in terms of its mandate and what 
they and when they need to report.  I do not want to go 
into historical issues that are there but I just thought I 
wanted to put it on record that that is what has occurred. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No thank you for that Mr Frolick.  The 
leaks 
of 
information 
whether 
happening 
within 
the 
10 
Commission or information being leaked from other sources 
continues to be something that causes us great concern.  I 
had an occasion a few days ago to talk about it, it 
continues.  There was a time when we thought it had 
stopped you know.  I think a number of media houses are 
abiding by the law but there are some that seem to have 
taken the view that they will look for and publish whatever 
they like irrespective of what the regulations say.  But to 
the extent of course that whoever it is that sent you a 
message 
or 
called 
you 
may 
have 
implied 
that 
the 
20 
Commission had made any findings about you or against 
you arising from whatever evidence it has had obviously 
that is just not true.   
It is not true but also to the extent that they may 
have 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 147 of 148 
 
wanted to deter you or discourage you from coming to give 
your evidence and making yourself available that was 
totally unacceptable.  I think that you have done the right 
thing by coming to the Commission and saying I am here I 
will tell my side of the story and I am available to be 
questioned on my side of the story.  It is important for the 
Commission it raised two important matters, I am a public 
representative I will support the Commission and I think it 
is important that people should come and give evidence.   
So I think that those of you who have come forward 
10 
and there are many who have come forward without being 
forced to come forward I think they are doing the right 
thing and the Commission will be enriched by their 
participation by the evidence they give irrespective of what 
the outcome may be, the process is very important.  So 
thank you very much for coming and for sharing what you 
have shared with the Commission.  Thank you very much 
and thank you to your counsel for the cooperation that he 
has given to the Commission and your whole legal team, 
thank you Mr Van Zyl.   
20 
Alright we are going to adjourn – next week the 
Commission this is just for the public we will hear evidence 
relating to Eskom it will continue to hear evidence relating 
to the suspension of executives at Eskom.  We might have 
a hearing on Monday we might not have it, we might 
02 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 275 
 
Page 148 of 148 
 
resume on Tuesday I am not sure but that is what the 
Commission will be hearing next week but for today we 
adjourn for the day. We adjourn.                       
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
