PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 23 JULY 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Butheleze, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are you ready? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair before I proceed today there are just 
a few things that I need to clarify from yesterday’s evidence with Mr 
Venter.  Mr Venter the first issue that I wish to clarify is that in your 
10 
evidence yesterday you said there were about 600 people at Premier’s 
office in the Free State.  I want to understand what do these people 
do? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson they are employees 
which are occupying posts in the structure which consists of the four 
programmes that I alluded to yesterday.  As I have indicated that there 
is a significant number of community development workers in the 
department which are – who are attached to programme 4 and those 
community development workers are distributed in municipalities, the 
ideal position is one per ward but we do not have sufficient funds to fill 
20 
all the vacant posts but that is basically a link between the community 
and the department through programme 4 and the intervention unit in 
programme 4 to which I also referred yesterday. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  And is this historical or it only came 
– it only became a case when programme 4 was introduced? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 3 of 129 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chair it is difficult for me to 
remember.  The community development workers were previously 
housed in the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional 
Affairs and the intervention unit was in the office of the Premier based 
– in programme 3 which consisted of both policy and planning and 
monitoring and evaluation.  Those two functions were separated at a 
certain point in time specifically because the one programme cannot 
monitor and evaluate the same programme so the idea was to create a 
separate programme who can independently also monitor the other 
three programmes in the office of the Premier. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  And the other issue that I wanted to 
clarify with you is the issue of the Department giving the office of the 
Premier or using the office of the Premier when they need to draft 
contracts.  I want to understand do different departments in the 
province have their own legal advisors or legal departments? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson.  Only the 
Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation does not have in-
house or their own legal advisors.  All the other departments do have 
their own legal advisors. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what sort of or type of contracts 
20 
then get to be drafted by your office and which contracts do they draft 
themselves? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson there was a 
directive in 2010 that all contracts should be submitted to the office of 
the state law advisors in the office of the Premier for the reasons that I 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 4 of 129 
 
alluded to yesterday which I think prompted at least part of that 
decision.  But for instance if it is a repetitive contract for – if I can 
perhaps refer to a lease agreement which is a standard agreement and 
it is basically just a small set of information in that agreement that 
differs from lease to lease.  It is not necessary to be referred to us 
unless significant changes are required. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay and yesterday when we parted you 
were dealing with the opinion that you gave to the municipal manager – 
Phumalele Municipality Mr Moremi.  In the case of municipalities do 
they also have their own legal advisors?  What sort of matters get 
10 
referred to your office by the municipalities? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson some of the bigger 
municipalities do have legal advisors but I am also aware that the small 
municipalities in the province do not have their own legal advisors and 
there was an invitation to these municipalities from the Executive 
Council and the Premier that if they have legal problems that it could 
be referred to the State Law Advisors and we will assist them where we 
can and we are doing it up to today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to matters that relate to departments 
within the provincial government where – which have their own legal 
20 
advisors did the need – was the need for those departments to send 
contracts to the Legal Advisors in the office of the Premier based on 
insufficient experience or capacity or expertise or was the position that 
the legal advisors in those departments were in themselves – were 
themselves experienced people with the required expertise but there 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 5 of 129 
 
was some other reason why they were nevertheless required to submit 
contracts to the legal advisors in the office of the Premier? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson at the point in time 
when the directive was issued it was my sense that there was a 
turnover of officials in other departments who occupied posts of legal 
advisors or legal administration offices and the capacity – there were 
certainly capacity issues.  I indicated yesterday that I personally noted 
signed contracts which does not protect the interest of government or 
where there are clauses such as the indemnity clause which were 
contrary to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act and I 
10 
raised those concerns and I cannot say that my concerns that I raised 
prompted that decision.  I was not part of the decision making process 
before that directive was issued.  But there were definitely capacity 
problems.  It is better at this point in time but there are also in some 
departments where there are definitely capacity problems and as I have 
indicated one department does not have legal advisors at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who issued the directive? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the directive was 
issued by the previous Premier Mr Magashule.  I was not present in the 
meeting but it was a meeting of heads of departments, accounting 
20 
officers, chief financial officers and heads of supply chain management 
and it was later on confirmed in a meeting of the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say although you were not party to the 
decision to issue that directive but you say on your own you are able to 
say that there were certain capacity challenges at least in regard to 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 6 of 129 
 
some departments and from that point of view you would have seen the 
directive as maybe a way of trying to assist with capacity? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct Chairperson.  
That is how I perceived it at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  And I may just mention 
Chairperson it was not an isolated incident.  We have an electronic 
case management system through which we manage all the legal work 
that comes into our unit and I checked yesterday morning and since 
2010 we handled a 1,423 contracts.  So it is a continuous … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Obligation that we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. Let us proceed.  On 
paragraph 2.4 you talk about a further opinion or clarification that you 
gave to Mr Moremi regarding… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that paragraph 2.4 of his affidavit? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Of his – of your affidavit yes sorry 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in Exhibit HH2? 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes on page 2 of that – of Exhibit HH2 and 
you attach that clarification as an annexure – Annexure D.  Would you 
please just tell us what – what were you saying in that clarification? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I assume that the 
legal advice that Advocate Ditira provided to Mr Moremi the Municipal 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 7 of 129 
 
Manager on the 23 July 2012 and I refer to Annexure C to my affidavit 
that that was communicated to the Head of Department and the MEC or 
either one of the two and they sought an appointment with me to 
discuss it and I met with both of them.  The issue which they raised 
with me was the fact that they required to have access to the farm to 
initiate the project as soon as possible.  At that point in time the 
largest portion of the farm as I understood it were let to farmers.  And 
those lease agreements had not expired at that time.  Advocate Ditira 
in her opinion paragraph 9 referred to it.  That is the Annexure C on 
AJV29 Chairperson.   
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  And she referred to an email of 
16 July 2012.  And if I remember correctly that email alerted the 
Department not to engage the farmers with a view to cancel those 
agreements.  We were concerned that it may be regarded as a 
repudiation.  That the repudiation would be accepted and there would 
be a claim for damages against the municipality which we wanted to 
avoid at all cost.  The further options that she referred to in the last 
paragraph of her opinion was not clarified and when I met with the MEC 
and the Head of the Department we discussed other options.  As I have 
20 
indicated in paragraph 4 of my letter and those options were firstly that 
there should be a lease agreement instead of the company leasing the 
land from the municipality the Department could enter into a lease 
agreement with the Municipality.  Once the lease agreements with the 
farmers expired which was not acceptable to the Department because 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 8 of 129 
 
of their need to as quickly as possible get down to the land or then in 
order to protect the municipality I proposed that the Department then 
enter into an agreement with the municipality in terms of which they or 
which the rights and obligations of the municipality in terms of the 
lease agreements are assigned and ceded to the Department so that 
the Department could engage with the farmers without any risk to the 
municipality.  In that meeting the Head of the Department was adamant 
that he would be able to convince the farmers to an early mutual 
termination of those agreements and I was not sure exactly he would do 
it but he was convinced.  And I was then requested to amplify the 
10 
previous advice which Advocate Ditira gave to the municipality and I 
did that in this letter that I wrote to the Municipal Manager. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and do you know if the – your opinion 
was followed? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson we – we prepared 
that Session And Assignment Agreement subsequent to this and it was 
provided to the Department and the municipality if I remember 
correctly.  I said there was a draft prepared. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  You talk about the draft Lease Agreement 
between the Free State Department and Phumalele local municipality 
20 
on paragraph 2.5 of your statement. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Paragraph sorry? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Paragraph 2.5 of your affidavit it is on page 
2. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 9 of 129 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Is this the agreement that was 
prepared in your office? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May I take you back to page 29 that is the letter from 
Advocate Ditira.  I see that she I think you said it is a she or am I 
wrong? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes she. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that she writes below her name DDG Legal 
Services.  Now you said that your position is DDG Corporate 
Administration and something else. 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you mention the components of your – of 
your job and they include legal services. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I want to find out whether DDG Legal Services was 
that she was also occupying the position of DDG but her focus was just 
legal services or whether that was just meant to refer to relate to the 
office which you held because as I understand it she reported to you? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes.  Chairperson I may perhaps 
just explain.  I can understand the confusion for a short period she 
20 
occupied the post of Chief Operating Officer in the Department of 
Economic Development and Environmental Affairs.  And at that post 
was traded at Deputy Director General in that Department.  There was 
then a decision to abolish that post and she was transferred back to 
our legal services component but she retained her rank.  Although she 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 10 of 129 
 
occupies up to today the post of Chief Director which is one post level 
below my own.  But her rank is that of a Deputy Director General and 
she is remunerated at that rank still. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is confusing.  On the one hand she is paid at the 
level DDG but the position she occupies and the functions of which she 
performs are at Chief Director Level. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is like you – it is like you perform the functions 
– let me make just an example of a clerk but you are paid at director’s 
level something like that? 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson yes.  The Section 
14 of the Public Service Act which provides for a transfer also provides 
that if an official is transferred to a post which is lower than the official 
occupies at the stage of transfer the official will retain their benefits.  
That is the – how the Act determines it should happen and that is why 
she occupies that rank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – does the Act not provide for a transfer to a 
higher position or a lower position depending on circumstances? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson to a lower position 
in terms when you are transferred to a higher post that must be through 
20 
a selection process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is to a higher position? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  If it is to a higher position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no but I am talking about to an equal… 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 11 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Position – of equal level that is fine. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what I am asking is whether the does Act does 
not actually also allow transfer to a lower position and of course I think 
that has to be with your consent I take it?  But the other transfer maybe 
also has to be with consent but I know that in public service at least 
with regard to certain departments but maybe the whole public service 
you can be transferred even without your consent if it is considered to 
be in the public interest or something like that. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so therefore it cannot – it cannot be that it is as 
if – if it is a transfer you can only be transferred to an equal position.  
You can be transferred to a lower position as well.   
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is indeed correct 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  With the retention of your 
benefits of the post which you occupied immediately before the 
transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I guess it a side issue.  It is a very strange 
20 
thing to me. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That your services are required at a lower position 
the functions that you perform the responsibilities are at a lower level 
not at a higher level. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 12 of 129 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are paid at a higher level.  Now you are not 
paid for the functions you perform you are paid for functions that you 
do not perform. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja that is the effect of that 
provision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is the effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  This agreement between 
10 
the Phumalele Municipality and the Free State Government who are 
supposed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Butheleze I just want to complete what 
we were talking about.  But if the position that she then occupies in 
your unit is that of Chief Director is that not the designation that should 
appear in the letters that she writes? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I totally agree with you 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I mean I raised it with her. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja it is correct that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not DGG. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that is not – she does not occupy such a 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 13 of 129 
 
position in your unit. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no such position in your unit? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  If we may proceed then?  
We still on point 2.5 of your affidavit.  If it is an agreement between 
this – the Provincial Government and the local Municipality who should 
be the signatories of that particular agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The lease agreement on behalf 
10 
of the Free State Provincial Government was supposed to be signed in 
terms of the Free State Land Administration Act by the Premier.  After a 
decision was taken in consultation with the MEC for Public Works being 
delegated by the Executive Council and on behalf of the municipality by 
the municipal manager authorised by the council I presume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am completing out discussion as I think about it – 
what we were talking about just now about the position for Ms Ditira.  It 
seems that actually legally it is quite risky for her to use a position that 
does not exist in the unit because if as Chief Director she has powers 
to make certain decisions and she is required to make those decisions 
20 
as Chief Director and she makes those decisions and writes DDG Legal 
Services a position that does not exist somebody who is adversely 
affected by that decision could challenge it on the basis that she 
exercised powers that she does not have because as – there is no 
position of DDG Legal Services.  She could only exercise powers that 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 14 of 129 
 
are attached to Chief Director. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Although in terms of the job 
description of the job that she occupies there are no specific decision 
making powers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  And allocated to herself.  But I 
understand completely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The argument which you make 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But if she gives legal advice also that legal 
advice is only supposed to be given in her position as Chief Director. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not in any other position because there is no position 
called DDG Legal Services. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Now I just want to add on 
20 
your questions now.  Mr Venter do you know how long did she stay with 
the Department of Economic Development? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I do not have a 
vivid memory of the time period but it was not long.  It was not long. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Then let us go back to 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 15 of 129 
 
your affidavit.  You were saying if it is between the local municipality – 
Phumalele Municipality and the Free State Department or Free State 
Provincial Government it was supposed to be signed by a municipal 
manager and the Premier.  In this instance what happened? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I do not thing 
agreement was ever signed.  We did the draft but it was not signed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So the drafts that you did was for the 
Premier and the – for the Premier to sign and the Municipal manager to 
sign? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  On paragraph 2.6. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  You deal with the delegation of authority 
that happened. Could you please just take us through those events? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson in my meeting with 
the 
Head 
of 
Department 
and 
MEC 
for Agriculture 
and 
Rural 
Development I indicated to them that in my view if the Free State 
Provincial Government will receive the responsibilities and the 
obligations in terms of the agreement which the municipality had with 
the farmers on the land that could fall within the definition of acquire in 
20 
the Free State Land Administration Act.  And if I am correct it means 
that the Premier must then take the decision to enter into that 
agreement in consultation with the MEC for Public Works as delegated.  
And subsequent to our meeting in a meeting of the Executive Council 
when there was a break in the meeting I was requested by the MEC and 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 16 of 129 
 
the Head of Department to meet briefly with the Premier and to explain 
that to the Premier.  Which I did and I also explained to the Premier 
that in terms of Section 5 of The Land Administration Act he is entitled 
to delegate that authority to a member of the Executive and that the 
member of the Executive is also authorised in terms of the same 
section of the act to delegate it to an official of government.  The 
Premier then indicated his willingness to delegate and he requested me 
to prepare the delegation for him but also to include in the delegation 
that it is done on the advice of the State Law Advisors which I included 
in that delegation.  I also then prepared a delegation from the MEC for 
10 
Agriculture and Rural Development to the Head of the Department of 
Agriculture and Rural Development to enter into the agreement to 
assign the responsibilities from the municipality to the Free State 
Provincial Government.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  If I may – if I may ask why did you suggest 
that the Premier should delegate. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  No I did not suggest I advised.  
I got a sense that he does not want to be involved and that is why I 
advised that it is possible that he can delegate. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and with the MEC? 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The MEC also indicated that he 
will want to – he wants to delegate that to the Head of the Department 
who must deal – run with the process. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you – I think there is a certain distinction you 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 17 of 129 
 
want to make between what you did and suggesting that he delegate.  
Now if you say I advised him to delegate that is very close to I 
suggested that he should delegate.  But I think what you seek to do is 
that what you want to say is that you gave advice that it is possible – 
that it was possible for him.  It was open to him to delegate if he 
wanted to.   
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is indeed correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you want to say? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair for the clarity and with 
regards to MEC how did it come about that he delegated to the HOD? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chair if I remember correctly I 
indicated to him that he can also delegate.  It is authorised in terms of 
the Act and the indicated that he – that he so wished to do. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Venter there is a principle that is widely 
known that a delegate cannot delegate further.  What then empowered 
the MEC to delegate further – to delegate further? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you stated the principle correctly Ms Buthelezi?  
You must be careful. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  It is – it is the principle of delegatus 
non potest delegare. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but it does not say what you say – what you say it 
says. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  That is my – my sort of summary or my 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 18 of 129 
 
understanding of what it says.  That a delegate cannot … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it – does it not mean that – well you – you have 
got to reflect very carefully if you are going to put it to – to a witness. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certainly if the original power provides for delegation 
it can be done.  Okay.  So the option is whether there is provision in 
the legislation that if you are given this particular power you delegate 
because if there is such a provision obvious a delegation can happen.  
The other situation is where there is no – no express provision in the 
legislation whether you can delegate if you are given power or not and 
10 
that is when some principle can come in and – and maybe it is not even 
a principle. 
It is – it might just be a presumption rather than a principle.  
So – but all I am simply saying is just be careful how you put it. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if it is necessary to - to go there … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do not know if he is giving evidence as an 
expert. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I understand Chair but may – may … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but you might have – might have to make up your 
mind whether you want to ask.  It just depends what you want to 
achieve. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Was there law or legislation 
that was empowering the MEC now to delegate further to someone who 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 19 of 129 
 
is in a lower rank than he was? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson, yes.  Section 1 of 
the Free State Land Administration Act provides that the Premier may 
subject to conditions and so on delegate to any member of the 
Executive Council the responsibility of the Premier in terms of this Act 
and then in terms of Section 5.2 of this Act it provides that the member 
of the Executive Council may then delegate to any official in the service 
of the Provincial Government.  So it is authorised expressly in the Act. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Let us move on to paragraph 
2.7 of your statement.  This is the second advice that you gave to 
10 
Moremi relative to Section 16 of the Deeds Registry Act.  Could you 
please take us through this opinion that you gave to Mr Moremi? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Where did you say we should go? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  To – it is – it is paragraph 2.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the – the said opinion you attach to 
your affidavit as Annexure E.  Annexure E appears from page 33 
Mr Venter. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER: 
 
Chairperson 
in 
- 
in 
December 2012 I received a request for advice from Mr Moremi who 
20 
submitted documents to me to advise him on.  When I read through the 
documents the documents that was perhaps in my affidavit wrongly - 
and I apologise for that - referred to a lease agreement.  It was not a 
lease agreement. 
It was a Cession and Assignment Agreement and that Cession 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 20 of 129 
 
and Assignment Agreement ceded and made over all the rights of the 
municipality in respect of the farm to the Free State Provincial 
Government and I – when I read through it I immediately sensed that it 
was inconsistent with my previous advice in the letter that I gave on the 
structure that I proposed of the assignment of the agreement so that 
there could be an engagement with the farmers and the lease 
agreement could then be entered into between the municipality and the 
Free State Provincial Government. 
That initial advice was premised also on the fact that the 
municipality received an annual income from the lease agreements to 
10 
more or less a million Rand and given the fact that it was a small 
municipality they simply could not forfeit that in – income over any 
period of time but the documents that I was presented or provided with 
by Mr Moremi indicated that the cession and assignment was not for a 
limited period and that there was no compensation to the municipality 
in those documents and I advised him accordingly in my letter which is 
attached that it is inconsistent. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Do you have any knowledge 
then what happened to this agreement after you – your advice? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson at a very late stage 
20 
and that was about more than a year after this letter I became aware 
that there was in fact a transfer of the property to the Free State 
Provincial Government and a 99 Year Lease concluded with Estina.  I 
was for a long period totally unaware of that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  More information with 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 21 of 129 
 
regards to that issue will be taken up with other witnesses.  Thank you 
Mr Venter.  Can we then move to paragraph 2.8 of your statement 
where you deal with the Beneficiary Agreement or agreements that were 
brought to you at some stage?  Do you remember when these 
agreements were brought to your attention? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I cannot recall the 
exact date but it was towards the end of 2013.  When I say towards the 
end October to December.  I – I am not – I do not have the exact date 
anywhere in my records. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who brought this agreement to you – to 
10 
your office? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it was Dr Masiteng 
– (coughing) my apologies.  He is an employee of the Department of 
Agriculture and Rural Development and if I remember correctly he 
occupied the post of Chief Director District Services and there were 
people with him and I cannot recall who it was. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and who drafted these agreements? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I do not know.  
When they submitted it to me it was already drafted and signed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  I understand that at that stage your 
20 
opinion was sought.  What was – if I may rephrase.  What was the 
reason for bringing this agreements to your attention? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I – my recollection 
is that my opinion was – was sought on those beneficiary agreements 
which I was presented with.  I was also presented with a list of names 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 22 of 129 
 
of other beneficiaries except the names that or the name that appear – 
appeared in the contract.  I very briefly looked at that contract and if I 
think back I am a bit embarrassed how he reacted. 
I was quite annoyed what I read and I expressed that in – in 
no uncertain terms to Dr Masiteng.  I noticed that on – he signed on 
behalf of the department and I asked him whether he was delegated.  
He indicated not and I say you can thank heavens that you are not 
delegated because this agreement is not valid because you were not 
properly delegated. 
The problems that I just picked up from a very cursory glance 
10 
at the agreement was that it was not clear what was transferred to the 
beneficiary.  It just referred that the project is transferred and how the 
other beneficiaries will fit in.  At that stage they were not in a 
cooperative or a company.  It was just individuals but it also contained 
clauses that the beneficiary may dispose of the assets of – of the 
project. 
So I said to them if these beneficiaries now decide to sell 
these profits or the project assets which you spent a lot of money on 
tomorrow in terms of this agreement they can do it.  So I said to them 
that that agreement is totally, totally inappropriate for the purpose I 
20 
think that they wanted to use it for and they left my office.  We had no 
further discussion then on the Beneficiary Agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  That agreement appears 
on reference bundle – reference Bundle C page 1333.  It is towards the 
end of that bundle page 1333.  Yes.  Could you please just take us to 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 23 of 129 
 
the – those clauses that you were referring to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me get the bundle first Ms Buthelezi. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Oh so – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reference bundle what? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Reference Bundle C.  Reference Bundle C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  1333.  It is towards the end of the bundle.  I 
am advised it is the last document in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going to adjourn.  Will somebody sort out this 
file please?  We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
HEARING ADJOURNS 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us proceed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I wish to apologise 
for the – the mess that has … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Was in – in your file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEI:  We have noticed that your file is too full 
20 
because it has dividers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ours do not have.  We will separate this file 
during lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 24 of 129 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you so much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Venter you were to refer to the Chair to 
the clauses in that beneficiary agreement that is appearing on page 
1333 of reference Bundle A that where you were not comfortable with. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the – the first part 
of the agreement completely did not fit into the project as it was 
constructed at that time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even the description of the parties on the first page.  
It is just not on. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean a project cannot be a party … 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To an agreement.  Who drafts this – this kind of 
agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I have no idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  But what really concerned me 
20 
was paragraphs 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 on page 1-3-4 of the reference bundle 
– 1-3-4-0. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-3-4-0. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes 1340. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 1340? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 25 of 129 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  40 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  8.2 starts with the beneficiary 
shell and then 8.2.2 provides for sell dispensary placing encumber seat 
signed transfer and so on, project assets and then 8.2.3 use consume 
alienate sell.  Although there was a rider that it must be approved by 
the department I thought that it was extremely risky to include such 
clauses in this agreement given the situation on the ground where a 
beneficiary is now authorised to deal with the project assets in a 
certain way. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also the beneficiary was not a party to the 
agreement.  The beneficiary was a beneficiary … 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was said to represent a project you know or the 
project and then obligations are placed and rights are given to the 
beneficiary but ja. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the – the bottom 
line is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It was totally … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was … 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Inappropriate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  For the purpose it was crafted 
for. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 26 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and - and you said it was signed by 
someone who was a Chief Director at the time and not by the HOD? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct.  At least when 
you dispose of assets in a department it had to be done by the 
accounting officer and I specifically requested Dr Masiteng whether he 
was delegated and he indicated no. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he explain to you why if he was not – did not 
have the delegation why he signed an agreement that said he was duly 
10 
authorised because that is what it says on the first page? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chair to my embarrassment I did 
not.  I was fairly upset as I indicated and it was wrong from me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  to – to be upset and did not do 
my work properly because I was really annoyed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe this was – maybe this was a clear 
example that contracts in Government departments should not be 
finalised before they were sent to the legal advisors in the Office of the 
Premier. 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If this is what was being done. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Indeed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Then let us – let us move 
on then to – to the oral agreement that you gave to the HOD in 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 27 of 129 
 
paragraph 2 – 2.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oral advice. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry, oral advice.  I am sorry.  I apologise 
sir.  Oral advice that you gave to the Head of Department Mr Thabethe.  
You deal with that in paragraph 2.9 of your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must we put away this – this file now? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the Head of the 
10 
Department Mr Thabethe sent to my office a draft memorandum which 
he intended to submit to the Executive Council in which it was 
requested that the Executive Council approve the cancellation of the 
agreement between the department and Estina.  If I remember correctly 
it was the day before the Executive Council sat or the morning before it 
sat and I just very briefly looked at it and I realised that it only referred 
to one agreement. 
At that time I was already aware of the 99 Year Lease and I 
proposed to him that the amendment should be made that the 
memorandum 
should 
reflect 
that 
all 
agreements 
between 
the 
20 
department and Estina be cancelled specifically which I had in my mind 
was the 99 Year Lease which was encumbering the land. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By that time the 99 Year Lease had already been 
signed? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Indeed Chairperson it had. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 28 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It had been signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was on the – and it was – oh that was the one 
in terms of which the municipality was getting - what did you say - 
about a million Rand? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  No Chairperson that 99 Year 
Lease … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Did not make provision for any 
compensation … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  For the lease period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and – and that lease was between the 
Free State Government and Estina.  Is that correct? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The municipality was no longer involved at 
that stage? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  No.  At that point in time the 
municipality transferred ownership of the land to the Free State 
20 
Provincial Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and then which year was this 
when you – when you gave Mr Thabethe this oral advice? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER: 
 
Chairperson 
it 
was 
in 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 29 of 129 
 
March 2014.  If I remember correctly. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall for how long the 99 Year Lease 
Agreement would have been running by that time – by March 2014 more 
or less?  Two year or anything like that? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It was about a year Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About a year. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  If I remember correctly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That 99 - the transfer and the 99 
10 
Year Lease were registered against the title deed of the property early 
in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  You then in paragraph 
2.10 you refer – you talk about the – the cancellation of an agreement.  
This is the Estina and the Department of Agriculture Agreement that 
was concluded in 2012.  Can you just tell us about your involvement 
and the cancellation agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson – (clearing throat) 
apologies.  As far as the cancellation letter was concerned the 
20 
memorandum to the Executive Council indicated that the department 
lost the grant from the National Department of Agriculture and that as a 
result of that especially over the – the period for which the contract 
with Estina was supposed to – to last they are unable to – to fund their 
obligations in terms of that agreement and they requested permission 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 30 of 129 
 
from the Executive Council or approval from the Executive Council to 
cancel the - the agreement. 
The Executive Council approved that and I was approached 
by the head of the department to assist to do the necessary paperwork 
to cancel the agreement.  I prepared the cancellation letter specifically 
using the paragraph which was referred to yesterday.  15.3 of the 
agreement – the July agreement between Estina and the department 
but I crafted the letter in such a way that I kept doors open for a 
possible review application for the initial contract as well as a review 
application for the 99 Year Lease. 
10 
We had a brief discussion amongst us as legal advisors and 
we thought that at that point in time that the review application in order 
to get out of the agreement with Estina was a bit risky.  The appropriate 
functionary in terms of the Act approved the deviation and he was 
adamant that he had sufficient grounds and we did not think that we 
would get cooperation for him to be an applicant in a review 
application. 
He would probably be a respondent and it would have created 
problems.  I – we have also protracted legal process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the head of the department? 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Indeed, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  So we opted to invoke the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 31 of 129 
 
positions of Clause 15.3 as the cancellation method to – to cancel this 
agreement and I crafted the letter, forwarded it to the head of the 
department and he must have sent it off to Estina because in April a 
letter was sent to my office by the head of the department in which 
Estina accepted the cancellation. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then following the – the letter from 
the head of the department for cancellation who then instructed you to 
draft the cancellation agreement that is attached to your affidavit as 
Annexure F? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson – Chairperson I 
10 
may perhaps just add to give some context to what happened was that 
in the acceptance of the cancellation by Estina they indicated that 
there was a certain amount due and owing to them based on invoices 
already submitted to the department.  I engaged with - with the head of 
the department and he said - sent a set of invoices to me that he has 
received from Estina. 
It was basically a composite statement referring to invoices 
which were submitted to the department earlier more or less on a 
monthly basis and I realised that it – that if you look at the amount due 
that we will have to have an agreement to formalise that part of Clause 
20 
15.3 about compensation for the work done up to the point of 
cancellation of suspension of the agreement and I then with the 
information provided by the department prepared that agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  This agreement was prepared by yourself? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER: 
 
Indeed 
Chairperson. 
 The 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 32 of 129 
 
resolution of the Executive Council also provided that the Free State 
Development Corporation should take over the management of the farm 
and due to the urgency which I thought it required I did the one 
agreement and my colleague Advocate Swanepoel did the FDC 
Agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and what was the total value of 
the outstanding invoice?  That will be on – on Annexure A of the 
agreement on page 40 of 8-8-2. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the information is 
contained on page AJV36 in paragraph 1.2 of that agreement.  It was 
10 
R106 252 652. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  The – the – you said the 
agreement between that involves FDC was drafted by your colleague.  
Is that correct? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Who instructed you to draft that agreement 
– the FDC Agreement now? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I cannot recall that 
we had specific instructions.  It was just to give effect to the – to the 
resolution of the Executive Council and to make sure that there is 
20 
continuity in the management of the farm when the agreement with 
Estina was cancelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I heard evidence yesterday that in terms of the 
agreement that had been concluded with Estina – Estina was obliged to 
have made – to have – to have made a certain financial contribution to 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 33 of 129 
 
the project but that it never made any payment.  So if that is factually 
correct I am wondering whether the department should have made the – 
the payments or acknowledge any obligation to make any payments to 
Estina. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson yes it – it – I think 
you are correct.  At that point in time I was not aware whether any 
payments were made.  As I have indicated I received a set of invoices 
and I requested the department to just compile it into one document 
that could be attached to the cancellation agreement instead of 
separate invoices but my understanding was that these invoices related 
10 
to work that was already done. 
So for value which the department has received at that point 
in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course the department would not have to pay 
Estina for even services that it may have received from Estina if Estina 
owed the department an equal amount or even more.  Is it not? 
My – my recollection from yesterday’s evidence was that 
Estina was meant to make a contribution of about R200-and something 
million into the project and the department was meant to make a 
contribution of R300-and something million into the project but that the 
20 
department made its contribution and Estina did not make any 
contribution and from what appears at page 36 what the department 
was saying the department was acknowledging that it owed Estina 
106 252 000.  Obviously an amount that is less than the amount that 
Estina is supposed to have paid into the project. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 34 of 129 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes.  Chairperson Estina – the 
contribution of Estina if I understood it was towards the completion of 
the project and its entirety.  The R106 million was for what was actually 
constructed on the ground for which the department – of which the 
department will now receive the benefit upon consolation.  Estina was 
not supposed to receive any benefits subsequent to – to the 
cancellation in respect of project assets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe I do not understand.  You and I go decide 
to do a project and we agree that for this project we will put in 
respective amounts.  I put my amount.  You do not put any amount.  
10 
Whatever services you are doing are meant to be in terms of this 
agreement as I understand.  You must tell me if my understanding is 
correct. 
How can you – how can you be entitled to me paying you 
anything in terms of this agreement when you have not performed in 
terms of this agreement in terms of the money that you must put in and 
I am the only one who has been funding this? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I will try and 
explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  My understanding was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to just understand. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That both parties had to make a 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 35 of 129 
 
contribution and once both parties had made that contribution there 
would be a project that would benefit both.  The Department of 
Agriculture through the beneficiaries would receive the benefit and then 
Estina would receive some – some dividends from the proceeds which 
the processing plant may render after the milk has been processed. 
That is how I understood the relationship.  Now the project at 
that point in time did not progress to its logical conclusion.  It was 
terminated before its logical conclusion.  So what was put onto the 
ground was what – is – is what the department received as assets due 
to the cancellation of the agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Estina’s obligation to make – to make – to pay 
its contribution?  Was that obligation supposed to be performed or 
carried out at the end of the project? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson my understanding 
from the outset was that Estina would construct the processing plant.  
That is that contribution and that is why the advice was also that that 
processing plant had to be constructed on land not belonging to the 
municipality or the Provincial Government in order to make sure that it 
does not fall within the definition of a public/private partnership. 
20 
So that was my understanding that that processing plant 
would be – Estina’s contribution would be to construct the processing 
plant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your understanding that this R106 million was 
actually paid to Estina? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 36 of 129 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Eventually yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Eventually? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, well if – if - the legal team may or may 
not have looked into the issue but if it has not it should look into the 
issue whether in these circumstances Estina should have been paid 
that amount.  It may be that … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that it should have been paid.  It may be 
that it should not have been paid but I think we have an obligation to 
10 
take a position on whether the department had any obligation to – to 
pay that amount in these circumstances. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We are looking at this issue Chair and issue 
will be led in that regard, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Then let us move to the involvement of 
FDC.  Who – if I may ask we said it was the Exco that made a 
resolution that FDC should take over.  Is that correct? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what was the resolution saying.  
20 
What was FDC supposed to do there?  To do what Estina had been 
doing? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I cannot remember 
the exact wording of that resolution but my sense is that the Free State 
Development Corporation should take over the management of the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 37 of 129 
 
project. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and in your understanding what 
is the mandate of the Free State Development Corporation?  What does 
it do in the province? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it is basically to 
support small, micro and medium – small, medium, micro organisations 
SMMEs and also to stimulate economic development.  I heard the 
argument yesterday about whether FDC was the appropriate vehicle 
and I looked at the objectives of FDC as it is contained in the Act – the 
Free State Development Corporation Act – and with all due respect I 
10 
think if you look at those objectives it may include the management of 
this project as an effort to stimulate the economy of the province in that 
area. 
I may just indicate that and I may be right or wrong but my 
initial perception was that this project was supposed to be the start of a 
dairy hub in the North Eastern part of the Free State.  It would not have 
been limited to what was on the ground during this period that the 
project lasted but it would be extended to other farms – could be 
acquired for beneficiaries with the same type of project where initially a 
piece of land and a number of cows is given to a beneficiary but the 
20 
beneficiary is then – there is also a milking dairy – a milking parlour 
constructed on that other farm in which beneficiaries receive training 
and eventually have a commercial dairy business on a farm which will 
then provide milk to this processing plant on the municipal land the 
initial plant that has been constructed. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 38 of 129 
 
So the picture that I had in my mind from the presentation 
initially was that it was entered creating an economic injection into the 
Northern Eastern Free State.  So as I say with all due respect and once 
I have heard that if two lawyers agree one is not a lawyer but I see a 
bit differently than – than my colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I had the occasion some time back to look at – 
in the context of evidence in the Commission to look at what I was told 
was the legislation that gives the FDC powers to do certain things or its 
- which contains its mandate.  So I do not know if you were looking at 
the same but what I do recall about that legislation is that what is 
10 
supposed to be stated as the functions is stated as objectives and what 
is stated as – as objectives are supposed to be stated as functions.  Is 
that the same legislation you looked at? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  What would be your – 
your view on Mr Jankielsohn’s evidence that you heard yesterday that 
as a result of Exco appointing or recommending that FDC be the – 
should manage the – this dairy – dairy project.  It was – the Free State 
Government was paying an extra million a month because FDC had to 
20 
employ another implementing agent to operate on the farm. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I am not really able 
to comment on that.  I was not involved in the conclusion of any 
agreement between the FDC and any service provider to manage the 
farm.  So I am not sure what motivated certain amounts and on what it

was premised at that point in time.  It is very difficult for me to say. 
It could be that it was more expensive but I am not sure what 
premised that additional amount when the contract was concluded. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and your reference to Exco in 
this regard you meant the Premier and all the MECs at the time.  Is that 
correct? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct.  Are you 
referring to the decision to terminate the – the agreement with Estina? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then on paragraph 13 you speak 
about what happened to the originals of the documents that you 
referred us to.  Could you please take us …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 2.13? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  2.13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes.  Chairperson on 26 January 
last year the Hawks executed a search and seizure warrant on the 
Office of the Premier.  It means the whole department and they 
obtained records of the minutes and resolutions of the Executive 
20 
Council and we indicated to them that we have information that fits into 
what is contained in the warrant both in my office as well as the offices 
of Advocates Swanepoel and Ditira and we offered to provide them with 
that and we asked them whether we can make – just make copies for 
our own records. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 40 of 129 
 
So what I currently have is copies of the original documents 
which were seized by the Hawks in terms of the warrant and I qualify to 
say that although I cannot be absolutely 100 percent sure that all 
documents which were in the original file has been copied.  From my 
recollection it looks like it is quite a composite record of what existed 
prior in the original files. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Mr Venter is there anything that 
you would like to share with the Commission with regards to this project 
as a whole as to how it was introduced, handled and where it is at this 
stage? 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson as I have indicated 
yesterday when I initially heard about the project I thought it was a 
very good idea.  I must honestly say I was quite excited and I had this 
picture in my mind of what will be the outcome of this.  It sounded 
extremely good and I still think that if it was properly managed to its 
logical conclusion it could still ascertain what was initially envisaged. 
What in the meantime happened and I am not an economist of 
any kind but it was supported in the papers that the price of milk which 
the farmers are being paid has plummeted significantly.  I am aware 
that – that in some instances and it was reported in newspaper articles 
20 
and that is where I picked it up that farmers were unable to sell their 
milk to processing plants and it is fairly big dairy operations that could 
not sell the milk. 
Farmers took their tankers into townships and they just 
distributed the milk to – to people whoever they wanted it because they 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 41 of 129 
 
could not sell it.  So if you look at this project and my colleagues in the 
department may be able to give more information it need – it needs now 
some intervention and in terms of the court order when the farm was 
forfeited to the state and handed back to the Free State Provincial 
Government there needs to be a plan that looks at the diversification of 
farming operations on that farm to benefit the community. 
It could include the dairy.  It could include - and the court 
order also provided that a mentor with the necessary skills should be 
appointed to develop that diversification plan specifically to benefit the 
community and the processes currently underway to – to try and make 
10 
the farm viable as a – as a farming operation which benefits 
specifically the community in that area. 
Chairperson if I just may add something and it was discussed 
yesterday and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I thought about it last night and 
that is clause – it is 3.15 – the cancellation clause in the (intervenes). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is 15.3. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  15.3.  Chairperson that is the 
standard clause that we include in most of the agreements where it is 
20 
appropriate and I thought I should just explain where it comes from.  
The 
Free 
State 
Provincial 
Government 
like 
other 
Provincial 
Governments has a sealed envelope of money which basically consists 
of an equitable share that is received from National Government 
determined in accordance with a specific formula, the grants that we 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 42 of 129 
 
have heard about and then which are additional grounds for specific 
purposes and then own revenue and following some discussions that we 
had with Treasury and some budget - Legotla meetings that I attended I 
discussed it with my colleagues and we thought that we should 
introduce a mechanism in our contracts that can provide for a 
reprioritisation of policies which will call a reprioritisation of funds. 
If I make an extreme example.  If for instance there is a 
disaster in which a number of homes of people are destroyed there is 
not a contingency reserved in Government in the Free State Provincial 
Government that we can use.  It simply has to come from a 
10 
reprioritisation of funds and one of the things that we thought that we 
could do is to build in a mechanism in our contracts that if it is 
necessary and if it is possible to terminate a contract at a certain or a 
project at a certain point in time to make additional funds available to 
deal with any contingency that may arise we should include that in 
contracts.  So I just thought I should explain that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is – that is where it comes from? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where it comes from? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is where it comes from. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think the – the problem is that there is - 
probably there should be a reference to the kind of situation you are 
talking about because when one reads it the way it stands it seems to 
be wide enough for a situation where maybe there was not proper 
planning … 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 43 of 129 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  First impression that you know you embarked upon a 
project without checking whether you have got funds … 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But one can understand the kind of situation you are 
talking about.  It may be that you know your team could think about 
whether it is formulated in the best way or not but that is really your – 
your own decision. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Thank you Chairperson.  It 
sounds definitely following the experience here.  It is something that 
10 
we will looking into more carefully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you.  Are you done? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  I have no further 
questions for Mr Venter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you very much Mr Venter.  You are 
excused.  Thank you for coming to give evidence to the Commission 
and to share with the Commission the experiences you have had and 
the role you played in regard to the advises that you gave and your unit 
gave in regard to this matter. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Thank you Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I am glad that I will requested to 
come and explain.  It was – it was a good experience for me as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I take it that the legal team of the Commission 
has had a chance to have a look at all the documents that you say you 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 44 of 129 
 
are keeping or at least copies of documents that were taken by the 
Hawks to see whether there are no documents there that are relevant 
for us.  Do you know whether that has happened? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson no but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  They are more and welcome at 
any stage … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  To (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  If the legal team could check all of those 
10 
documents to see whether there is not something that is important for 
our purposes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Venter you are 
excused.  We will take the tea adjournment now.  It is 26 past 11.  We 
will resume at quarter to 12.  We adjourn.

ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Morning again Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Morning. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman we are today dealing with 
Exhibit HH4 which is the affidavit and Annexures of Mr Ephraim 
Makhosini Dhlamini.  HH4, Exhibit HH4. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 45 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, the file containing the affidavit of Mr Ephraim 
Makhosini Dhlamini will be marked as Exhibit HH4. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Chairman with your 
leave Mr Dhlamini is ready to be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we going to use an interpreter today? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have an interpreter sitting with Mr 
Dhlamini. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Miss Interpreter are you the same interpreter 
that was sworn in last week? 
INTERPRETER:  Yes Chair I am. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so you are duly sworn? 
INTERPRETER:  Yes I was sworn in Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you.  We are going to administer the 
oath or affirmation and the interpreter will interpret the oath.  Please 
stand interpreter. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:  Ephraim Makhosini Dhlamini 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:  I have no objections. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you confirm the oath to be binding on your 
20 
conscience? 
WITNESS:  I swear. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 46 of 129 
 
WITNESS:  So help me God. 
INTERPRETER:  Sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  (duly 
sworn, states) 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chair just as a preface Mr Dhlamini is one 
of the beneficiaries of the Vrede Dairy Project.  Mr Dhlamini good 
morning. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Good 
morning. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please turn to page 1 of the witness 
bundle marked HH4 that you have. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I am on 
page 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if Mr Dhlamini needs an interpreter him looking 
at that statement is not going to help, it would have to be the 
interpreter who looks at the statement and then helps him in terms of 
interpreting, isn’t it? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is so Chairman, I have gone through 
the motions of identifying, at least his names, and the fact that he 
20 
signed the document, he knows that, that is his signature and he 
remembers the date, he knows the date on which he signed it.  I 
thought if we go through it, jus those formalities, the rest we’ll then ask 
the – he’s really going to speak to the document Chairman, this is just 
for the formality. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 47 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you just want to confirm that – his signature? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman that he is Ephraim 
Dhlamini and that’s his signature and the date on which he signed the 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I take it that because he signed a statement that 
is in English that his position is that he does understand English and 
does understand what the statement says but for purposes of his 
evidence, he prefers to use another language? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is so Chairman, particularly because 
it was then read back to him but then in isiZulu the statement written in 
10 
English was then read back to him in isiZulu.  So he doesn’t really read 
English, he doesn’t read it as well he’s not as fluent, he does prefer to 
give his evidence in isiZulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well then there is something wrong with the 
statement, because the statement doesn’t say it was read to him, it’s 
him speaking English in this statement. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It does not say that Chairman, that I 
concede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so if he doesn’t understand English then it means 
what should have been done is that there should have been, either a 
20 
statement in isiZulu that he made and then somebody else translated 
that statement into English or there should have been an interpreter 
certificate that says, I interpreted this statement from that to that from 
that paragraph to that paragraph to him into isiZulu and this is what he 
confirmed, but if it is in English and he signs it then it’s not correct. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 48 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman, with your leave, could we just 
confirm with Mr Dhlamini what the position is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I’ll adjourn for a short while then you’ll let me 
know once you are ready, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNED 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to proceed? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes thank you Chairman.  Chairman the 
10 
legal team has had discussions with both beneficiaries, Mr Dhlamini 
and Mr Ncongwane, they both confirm that they can read and 
understand English, they have read their statements and understood 
them and they then signed the statements after having read them and 
understood them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman so I would suggest that the way 
we proceed is that because Mr Dhlamini in this instance is more 
comfortable in speaking his mother tongue, isiZulu, I ask the question 
in English, the interpreter interprets it for him for convenience sake, he 
20 
responds in the language he is comfortable with, she will then interpret 
that back into English and we proceed along those lines. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let’s do it that way. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 49 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Mr Dhlamini can I just ask 
again, can you please confirm on page 1 that this is your name and on 
page 9 that, that is your signature. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):    Indeed 
your Worship the names that are appearing on page 1 are my names 
and the signature your Worship attached thereto on page 9 is my 
signature, I confirm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And we call the DCJ, the Chairman in this 
forum. 
INTERPRETER:  I’m used to Court so every now and then you will hear 
10 
Your Worship, so please pardon me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand okay, alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you and you confirm that you are 
familiar with the contents of this statement? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
written by me so I will never forget, indeed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you very much.  Are there any 
changes that you would want to make to this statement at this point  in 
time? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Have you had any interviews with any 
investigative agencies with regards to the Vrede Dairy Farm matter? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who were these? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 50 of 129 
 
correct Your Worship we did call some people to intervene or to talk to 
regarding this matter, it was mostly Government officials, Mr Madiba, 
Ms Gcabashe and Ms Sogwane. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I ask you to do this for the Chairman, 
I really just want formal agencies such as the Hawks, or the Public 
Protector as opposed to Government officials whom you may have 
interacted with. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct 
we did, we did speak to the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, we 
met her twice in her office and she also came down to Vrede to take 
10 
down our statements. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you, you’ll give the detail of that 
evidence later, which other agency of Government have you spoken 
with? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay we 
also spoke to the Hawks Your Worship, I also have a message, a SMS 
or a text message Your Worship that I received from them and we also  
met up with them Your Worship on a Saturday and a Sunday, they took 
down our statements as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe I hope I didn’t miss this, you might wish 
20 
to  just take care of evidence like where he lives, because the 
beneficiaries are supposed to be people who live in a certain area, 
where he lives and his connection with the project before we going into 
contact with the Hawks and so on, you might wish to consider doing 
that. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 51 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman I was just trying to deal 
with the 65 transcription rule that we have just so that we know who 
else may have a record in terms of our rule 65 of what this witness 
might have said to one of our agencies, I start with that straight after 
that, it was really just a matter of clearing the 65 rule Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I always look for the connection with the witness 
first so – because then after that one knows, who is this one, how does 
he come into this, yes proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman, can I do that, my 
next question is, where do you live? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I stay at 
Thembalihle Township in Vrede, the address Your Worship of my 
residential house is 2387 Kanya Street. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How long have you been living there? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay I 
was born in the farms Your Worship in Vrede then I moved to 
Johannesburg Your Worship with work but I came back here 2000 Your 
Worship to build – to rebuild my family’s property Your Worship and I 
stayed there at Modisa until now. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are you employed? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I’m self 
employed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What business are you employed in? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I’m a 
farmer, I have 52 cattle in the homage of the Municipality, I am, Your 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 52 of 129 
 
Worship benefitting or have made proceeds from these cattle and I also 
have another business of a record bar. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Please describe the 
environment of Vrede for the Chairman, the environment you live in, 
which would include Thembalihle Township. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay 
Thembalihle Township of Vrede Your Worship it’s a very small area 
township, there is a high unemployment rate there and mostly people 
are working in the farms and they are earing far less or less money. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes continue. 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Like I 
placed it on record Chairperson there is a high unemployment rate in 
the area so you need to be very creative in terms of trying to make 
money and most people, Chairperson, just to place it on record, they 
are working outside Vrede to earn money for a living. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In paragraph 2 of your statement, you 
mention that you are the chairman of the African Farmers Association 
and that Mr Ncongwane is a member as well. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What is Mr Ncongwane’s position in this 
organisation? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  He’s my 
deputy. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What does the African Farmers 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 53 of 129 
 
Association do, what’s your core business as an association? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay we 
are representing small farmers in the area and whenever there are any 
activities coming from the Department of Agriculture we go between the 
farmers and the Agriculture Department and whenever there is drought 
we seek assistance from the Agriculture Department and maybe for 
food and stuff we request help from them, so we’re basically 
representing the small farmers in the area 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are there a number of such small farmers 
in your area? 
10 
INTERPRETER:  Is there – sorry can you please repeat? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are there a number of such small farmers 
in your area? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):    There 
are a number of farmers, in fact most people live on farming Your 
Worship in the area, most of the people who are residing in the area, 
like I said are living on farming, they have cattle that they come with 
from the farms and remember we consist of people coming from 
(indistinct) and Warden so mostly they are farmers who live on cattle or 
farming to survive.  Like I stated Your Worship whenever there’s 
20 
drought the cattle won’t have something to eat, so I would write a letter 
representing the small farmers in the area to seek help Your Worship in 
terms of getting food for the cattle in the area.  So I basically assist 
with that by writing or communicating with the Department of 
Agriculture. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 54 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less, how many member does the African 
Farmers Association have or the Vrede chapter of the African Farmers 
Association have? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):   Okay a 
year before last Your Worship farmers from Vrede who are belonging to 
the association Your Worship were 82, and now Your Worship the 
number is sitting at 120 farmers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now you state that you have personal 
knowledge of the meetings that led to the selection of beneficiaries for 
10 
the Vrede Dairy Farm Project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  When it 
was initiated I was there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain to the Chairman in short 
bits when these meetings took place, where these meetings took place, 
who attended these meetings?  Can I just assist you with structure, so 
if you could start with the first meeting and complete that before you go 
to the second meeting. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):    First

since he is interested in the politics Your Worship, whenever he is not 
there, they will be there to listen to what people are saying, basically 
10 
his eyes and ears, when there’s meetings and he’s not there.  There 
was also Dube Gobene a municipal employee, then the meeting 
resumed or started…(intervention). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Can I just ask you, if I might interrupt 
you, from the community are you able to identify some of the people 
you know who were at that first meeting?

Nxuwane, most of them they were there present at the meeting that I 
can also identify Mishack Nxuwane, William Kanye, …(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let me say there may have been a 
20 
hundred people there we don’t want you to mention all of them so just 
those that you think, in terms of the roles they played are important 
then you can indicate that they were – so there were others and you 
can give an indication of the number if you are able to say, well from 
the community maybe there must have been about 30 or 40 or whatever

Sebenzi Zwane was addressing the meeting, Mr Motaung is the one 
who officially opened the meeting.

Vrede? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  He is the

MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was in

Page 57 of 129 
 
successful project.  He said if it is going to be a dairy project there 
should be activities there like milking and then processing the said milk 
into yoghurt, cheese and everything.  Like I’ve placed in on record 
Chair, that I have cattle so I was on the group of red meat and then on 
dairy it was Mr Nxonwane was part of the dairy group and there were 
about five or six members.  After we have grouped ourselves Your 
Worship – Chair we then wrote down the names so that we would be 
able to identify who is on which group and how many members are 
there in each group.  He had a – or he has a sense of humour and he 
was there cracking jokes and saying that he knows us personally and 
10 
where we grew up and where we are coming from and that he wants to 
do good things for all of us.  After that the meeting was 
dissolved…(intervention). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Before you go to the end of the meeting, 
how did you receive what Mr Zwane was telling you did it sound like 
something that could happen that he could bring to Vrede? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Indeed 
Your Worship – Chair it sounded like a very good project, we were 
happy with it and we thought it would yield good results but others were 
suspicious because of the fact that Mr Motaung was part of the meeting 
20 
to a point that Mr Sebenzi Zwane did enquire as to how many who don’t 
approve of Mr Motaung.  I know a few people did raise their hands 
those that did not approve of Mr Motaung as the mayor, I know that Mr 
Nxuwane is one of the people who raised a hand of disapproving Mr 
Motaung and he then – and he requested, Sebenzi Zwane requested the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 58 of 129 
 
reasons why they did not like or disapprove of him.  They then gave the 
reasons as to why they were disapproving of him and one of the 
reasons Your Worship, was, when we were requesting to get the land 
he was not responding on the letters or correspondences to him, 
specifically requesting that we have the land, he never responded, so 
one of the reasons was that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Before you deal with the issue of land 
that had been requested, go back to what the outcome of the meeting 
was for you, you were about to tell us about that and I had interrupted 
you.  
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I was not 
interested in the dairy farm, reason being that I specialise or I have 
cattle for red meat and I have seen most of the white farmers are not 
succeeding when they are running a dairy project so that is why I had 
no interest, my interest was on the red meat since I had cattle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When was the – when was this meeting if you are 
able to remember? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Though I 
don’t remember exactly the date of the meeting because the meetings 
were done by the municipal workers or Government officials they 
20 
wouldn’t be given the copies of the meetings so I don’t have reference 
to the dates, but when this dairy project was initiated Your Worship, it 
was the year 2012. Thought I don’t remember the dates precisely, 
because these events were happening quicker and faster. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 59 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There are some media articles that we 
have collected from open source media and there is one that is written 
on the 28 t h of April 2018, Chairman for your reference there is a media 
bundle that you have at your disposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And this particular article is on page 8.  
You may want to read it later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am just going to summarise the salient 
points. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What I would like you to do is tell the 
Chairman if this is your recollection of what happened on that day in 
2012?   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I quote: 
“Vrede South Africa with loud speakers blaring city 
officials drove across the black townships dirt roads 
in a pickup truck summoning residents to the town 
hall.” 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
“The main guest was a local figure who had soared 
up the ranks of the governing African National 
Congress and come back with an enticing offer.” 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 60 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
“Over the next few hours the visiting political boss 
Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane sold them on his latest 
deal.” 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
“A government backed dairy farm that they as 
landless black farmers would control.” 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
“They would get an ownership stake in the business.” 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
“Just by signing up.” 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
“They would go to India for training all expenses 
paid.” 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
“To hear him tell it the dairy would bring jobs to the 
impoverished, help build a clinic and fix the roads.” 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There is more Mr Dhlamini in that article.  
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 61 of 129 
 
What I wanted to confirm is what you heard at that first meeting is what 
I have just read to you. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes we did hear about that but 
in the second meeting where – which was addressed by Mr Mosebenzi 
Zwane. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain what you then heard in the 
second meeting that is different to what you heard in the first meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  What we heard in the second 
meeting now Chair is that they were going to establish or start up a 
dairy farm in Vrede with 100 beneficiaries and that as beneficiaries we 
10 
will have a 52% stake into the farm or the project.  It is also correct 
that 20% was said to be going to go towards the constructions of road 
of a hospital as well as bursaries for the children or our children in the 
area.  And then 28% will go to the government according to them.  It 
was good news to us and we were happy with that.  I was not interested 
in the dairy farming like I said but when I heard about us being taken to 
India for training that – for training of whatever is going to happen in 
the dairy or the farming – okay when you – you will have a choice of 
what you want to be trained on – which one are you interested in.  We 
were excited about it.   
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now who of government officials attended 
the second meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Mr Thabethe was always 
present where there is Mr Mosebenzi Zwane.  The mayor as well was – 
would be present and Dume.   Dume was a municipality employee or 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 62 of 129 
 
official.  Mr Mphahlele from Agriculture too [indistinct] Mr Sebeko they 
would also be present in the meeting.  That is where we would see 
them in person Your Worship we know them personally anyway. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are you saying Mr Zwane was there as 
well? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes he was.  On that day yes 
he was present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we go further into the second meeting can I 
take you back to the first meeting?  You told me that Mr Zwane spoke 
but you did not tell me whether there was anybody from the Farmer’s 
10 
Association who also spoke at the meeting.  So I would like to know 
whether there was anybody who spoke on behalf the Farmer’s 
Association and any other person who spoke on anything that you 
consider to have been important. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  The main speaker on the day 
in question Your Worship or the prominent speaker on the day in 
question it was Mr Mosebenzi Zwane Your Worship – I mean Chair and 
then the mayor Mr Motaung uttered the words that he is also happy that 
someone who also grew up in the very same area in Vrede Your 
Worship is bringing good news to the community.  Those were the main 
20 
speakers on the day in question and those are the people who 
summoned or called the meeting.  No-one else addressed or spoke in 
the meeting except when we were now socialising Your Worship then 
joking there – ja that is all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 63 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Can I just also tidy up one 
last aspect of meeting 1?  What – Was Mr Zwane’s wife Ms Roseline 
Zwane who is known as Topsy also at that first meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I do believe I trusted she was 
present on the day in question because there were a lot of people who 
were present when Mr Zwane was there or when he came there.  The 
councillor by the name of Koko was also there.  Those are the names 
Your Worship which do not appear in the statements because we only 
mentioned the names of the people who were there to address us, the 
main speakers of the meeting. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just for context that name I again get 
from a media article we got from the open network which is in the 
media bundle on page 12.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Does he have? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No he does not have to go.  I just want it 
on record. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  The name – which name? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of Ms – Mrs Rosaline Zwane. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I know her physically or in 
person and I know that in most of the meetings that will be held in the 
20 
area Your Worship and the municipal meetings she would be present.  
So I know and I do believe that she was present on the day in question 
though there were a lot of people who attended the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know if it is going to be important but 
you have said two things.  You said you believe or trust that he was 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 64 of 129 
 
there and you have said you know that she was there.  It cannot be 
both.  It has got to be one.  Did you see her at the meeting therefore if 
you saw her you know that she was there.  If you did not see her you 
may believe that she was there because there were many people who 
were there but you do not know.  So which of the two is it? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  The reason my response is I 
trust or I believe that she was present Your Worship it is because I did 
not see her physically that she was present in the meeting.  I am just 
believing or trusting that she was part of the meeting without having 
seen her sitting in the meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  At – was – were – 
were representatives for the beneficiaries selected at any point in 
time? 
INTERPRETER:  Where are we now the first or second? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No it is a general question.  No, no were 
they chosen at any point in time? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  On that day this was explained 
as to – they explained the shares and how are you going to benefit from 
the whole thing regarding the shares and that the government will 
20 
purchase cattle per person so that one can have them contributed into 
the dairy product – I mean project.  We were then also advised that 
those who are having cattle for red meat should sell their cattle so that 
they can have more shares – money to buy or purchase shares into the 
diary project. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 65 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no before you proceed I think Ms Gcabashe 
would like to repeat her question.  You might have misunderstood the 
question. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini can I ask you to do this.  I 
will come back to the evidence you have just given.  Because it is 
important.  At this point in time I simply want to know if the community 
of Vrede Thembalihle township selected certain persons to represent 
beneficiaries to this dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I do not want you to focus on the second 
10 
meeting.  I simply asked the question as a general question.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes after a while yes we did 
elect the representatives. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Would you be able to recall roughly when 
that committee was selected? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  The committee was selected 
after Alta Meyer took our ID’s and sent them – or took them to Pretoria 
and I assume it was now the fourth meeting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When I look at paragraph 16 of your 
statement you mention Ms Meyer asking for your Identity documents so 
20 
it is page 5 paragraph 16.  
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Indeed it was Ms Meyer and 
the day was Saturday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it is the convenient time. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 66 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it look like we might go up to five o’clock today? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It does Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If we want to complete both witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But we have made arrangements for them 
to continue tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If for any reason we cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Conclude today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  We will take the lunch adjournment and 
we will resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes were are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini there are a couple of things I 
20 
just wanted to explore with you.  The first one – can I just tidy up the 
issue of the beneficiary representatives so that is the first one I will go 
to just to conclude that evidence.  After that I will actually just take you 
back to evidence you had given earlier on about the cows that you were 
going to get from the project.  So if you – if you allow me to that is 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 67 of 129 
 
what I would like to do. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  So my question had been 
whether you had elected or selected people to represent the 
beneficiaries in all things to do with the Vrede Dairy Farm? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes we 
did. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do you recall the names of those people 
and how many people you selected? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Three 
10 
representatives.  Lindiwe Masiteng, June Mahlaba, Titus Nusen. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes and did you at any point have sight of 
a Beneficiary Agreement that the department would have prepared and 
presented to the beneficiaries? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No.  
The first time I had sight of that document it was at the time when 
Busisiwe Mkhwebane came. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So if Mr June Mahlaba were to come to 
the Commission and say that he signed a Beneficiary Agreement in the 
presence of other beneficiaries - and I hope I am correct in – in what I 
20 
have heard him saying - including yourself.  You would say that that is 
incorrect? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am – I am sorry – I am sorry.  Before he – he 
responds.  I think the interpreter did not understand the question 
correctly.  You might wish to just repeat. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 68 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you, thank you. 
INTERPRETER:  Thanks your worship. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  So if I say to you 
that Mr June Mahlaba will come to this Commission if he gets the 
opportunity to tell the Commission that he signed a Beneficiary 
Agreement in the presence of other beneficiaries and if I am not 
mistaken in your presence as well. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
not true. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What position did Mr June Mahlaba 
10 
occupy in that group that you selected to represent you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  He was 
the Chairperson and if I remember well your worship I am the one who 
selected or elected him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I also ask this question?  Were any of 
the other beneficiaries - to your knowledge - asked to sign a 
Beneficiary Agreement? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was Mr Mahlaba Chairperson of? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  He was 
20 
the Chairperson of the dairy project.  They wanted to nominate or elect 
us to be part of this as well your worship but we had a problem because 
we had other positions that we were already handling.  So we felt it was 
too much for us.  So rather him to be the – I mean the Chairperson of 
the dairy project. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 69 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mentioned three people a few minutes ago which 
included I think is it Mr Mahlaba or (coughing)? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is Mr June Mahlaba – B-A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was he among the three people that you 
mentioned a few minutes ago when you said you elected three people? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he the Chairperson of the committee that was 
made of those three people? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct 
your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you call that committee? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  We 
elected this committee your worship at the time when elder was there.  
We were required to select or nominate people who were going to 
represent us your worship in this dairy project.  Whenever there is 
some activities in this dairy project these are the people who will 
20 
represent us and come back and report to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they might not have had a specific formal name as 
a committee but they represented your interest in the dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  There 
was no formal name your worship of this committee.  It was just a 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 70 of 129 
 
committee representing our interests whatever activities which were 
taking place in the dairy project they would go and be our 
representatives and come back and report to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But the department accepted that this was 
the committee that you had accepted – that you had selected? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I agree. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You have explained the role of the 
beneficiary committee. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
10 
correct your worship.  Their role was to attend the meetings on our 
behalf but they are not going there to take decisions on our behalf.  
They need to come back and consult us before a decision is taken. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did you ever get any report from that 
beneficiary committee? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did you get an explanation from the 
Chairman or any member of the committee as to why they had not 
reported on anything to the membership that they represented? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No we 
20 
have never received any explanation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I then – thank you Mr Dhlamini- can I 
then just go back a step to evidence you were giving slightly earlier?  
You spoke of 10 head of dairy cows being given to beneficiaries? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 71 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did I also hear you say that it would – 
those would have been exchanged for red meat cattle that the 
beneficiary had owned originally? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No.  No 
what the Government said was each beneficiary will get 10 cattle or 
cows.  They will be taken to the dairy project where the milking process 
will happen.  Us who owned the red meat or the cattle we are to sell 
those and buy other cattle that we will then take to the dairy project for 
our shares to increase but that did not happen. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But it was not a condition of being a 
10 
beneficiary that you sell your red meat cattle? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No it 
was not. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You could elect – you could decide to sell 
your cattle if you felt you wanted to take a greater shareholding in the 
dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay.  
That is what they actually suggested that you were to sell the red meat 
cows in order for you to get cows so that you can get greater shares 
but my fear was you do not count them before they hatch.  So that was 
20 
my problem. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You do not count your chickens before 
they hatch? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Before 
they hatch yes. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 72 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I like the Zulu expression.  It is better 
than the English Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the … 
INTERPRETER:  The literal meaning is you do not name the child 
before the birth of the child. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes. 
 
Just 
so 
that 
there 
– 
there 
is 
no 
misunderstanding.  Do you confirm that those who owned red meat 
cattle if they sold their cattle or any of their cattle they would only get 
more shares in the dairy project if they bought cattle for the dairy 
10 
project?  In other words – in other words they would not just sell their 
cattle and then get more – more shareholding. 
They would have to add – they would have to buy dairy cattle 
and add them to the dairy project. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct your worship.  What happened is the Government promised 
each beneficiary 10 cattle and then those who own cattle with red meat 
they were then told - suggested that they sell the cows/cattle that 
produce red meat and then buy the cows that produce dairy and take 
them into the project – the dairy project then your shares will be 
20 
increased or greater shares from 52 percent to more depending on what 
you have invested after buying the dairy cows. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Interpreter … 
INTERPRETER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think your interpretation is very good but there - 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 73 of 129 
 
there is a part which I think you might not have got correct.  It is not 
my understanding that he is saying it was suggested to them that they 
should sell their cattle.  My understanding is that he is saying it was an 
option which they could … 
INTERPRETER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Use if they want to or not use. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
not an option your worship.  It was not an option.  It was something 
that they were imposing on us that we should sell the red meat cows in 
order for us to get the dairy cows - the cows that produce dairy. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I must have complete misunderstood.  I do not 
know about Ms Gcabashe but … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I – I have the benefit of having 
consulted twice … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  With this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so just so that I understand.  In terms of 
what they told you that is now as I understand Mr Mosebenzi Zwane in 
20 
terms of what he told you was it possible for somebody who had red 
meat cattle to become a beneficiary in the dairy project without selling 
his or her cattle? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes 
your worship.  We do have shares even the – we do have shares your 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 74 of 129 
 
worship.  Those who own cattle who produce red meat yes we still have 
shares into the dairy project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So in the end those who had red meat cattle 
were not compelled to sell their red meat cattle in order to have shares 
in the dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Let me 
explain it like this.  What Mr Motaung said he had allocated the land 
which is our land the farmers land which is about 4 000 hectares.  He 
said he is actually giving that to the dairy project meaning that there is 
no space anymore available for us who are owning the cattle that 
10 
produces red meat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is that what Mr Motaung said at the first 
meeting or is it your interpretation of what was said that you are telling 
me? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Those 
are the words he uttered your worship in the second meeting.  Those 
are the words which were uttered by Mr Motaung that he has given 
away the land for the dairy project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Dhlamini but it 
20 
is correct that you and other small farmers had not been using the land 
that was allocated to the dairy farm for your red meat cattle.  You took 
your cattle to different land that you owned for them to find their feed 
etcetera. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Just to 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 75 of 129 
 
tell you like right now in that land there is no space for our cows.  I 
have about 15 cattle and a bull which was purchased for me by 
(indistinct) at 120 000.  There is no place there but there are cattle 
pens and even now it – it was injured on – on the leg.  It could not walk 
properly. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you had hoped that Government would 
give you land for your cattle? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct.  We did try.  We made efforts to the point that we even went to 
Land Reform and through the database and I was really shocked to 
10 
discover that the people from Vrede they are not buying land for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Dhlamini please listen very carefully to the 
questions and try and answer just that question that is being asked. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
I 
understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Dhlamini I really 
only want clarity on this one point.  4 400 hectares was purchased for 
the dairy farm? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 
20 
land was already available.  It was a wide farmer’s lease which was 
already in existence or it was existing already. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You are correct and with a couple of 
transactions that is the land that was identified for the Vrede Dairy 
Farm. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 76 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  While that was going on even before while 
those commercial farmers were using that land the people of 
Thembalihle who had cattle had to look after their cattle and find 
grazing for them wherever they could?  Can you just stop there? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  We 
were given the land.  Per farm I was given a portion of land.   A farmer 
would share a portion of – not per farmer but about seven farmers.  For 
instance in a portion you will have about seven farmers who their cows 
10 
are grazing in that land to a point that they did not even look at the fact 
that per cow how many graze – it is grazing per year.  So as a result we 
would find ourselves – there is no food enough for the cows or fodder 
enough for the cows to feed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini I really just want to ask you 
to help me separate issues. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is important because I have read your 
statement.  I understand your statement. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I am just going to go slowly again.  I 
really just want to clarify the issue of the commercial farmers who 
occupied the 4 400 hectares of land that ended up being part of the 
Vrede Dairy Farm Project. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay.  
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 77 of 129 
 
What happened is Mr Motaung informed us that there was a 99 lease 
project for the commercial farmers or wide farmers which I do not know 
when it actually took place or happened but Mr Motaung told us about it 
and he further informed us that he was taking that land for the project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  I have no difficulty with that.  I 
understand that evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want to say again Mr Dhlamini I know it is in 
the afternoon.  Just listen carefully to the question as interpreted to 
you by the interpreter and try and just answer that question.  If 
Ms Gcabashe wants to ask you about something else she will ask you 
10 
but just answer that question.  If you keep on not answering the 
question and giving evidence about other things we will take much 
longer to finish. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
I 
understand. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have also understood your evidence that 
the municipality gave you specific land where you and others could 
keep your cattle. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have also understood you to say that, 
20 
that land that the Municipality allocated to you was not appropriate for 
the cattle farming you and your colleagues were involved in? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The only thing I was trying to clarify was 
that, when those commercial farmers occupied that 4 400 hectares you 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 78 of 129 
 
occupied a complete different piece of land that was allocated to you by 
the Municipality. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes, that 
is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I have also understood your evidence in 
that you have said you have been agitating with Government, you have 
been asking Government for better grazing land for your cattle? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I’m satisfied with that.  Can I then come 
10 
back to the last point that mixes these two strains of evidence a little 
bit and the question is, did anybody that you know, sell their cattle in 
the expectation that they would be allocated dairy cows by the Vrede 
Dairy Project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes there 
are. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you give us, just one or two names 
and the reason I ask you is this, again, Mr June Mahlaba, in his 
affidavit has stated that to his knowledge nobody sold their cattle in the 
expectation that they were going to be allocated dairy cows by the 
20 
Vrede Dairy Project. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Piet 
Mokwena he sold his cattle. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How many did he sell, if you know the 
number? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 79 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I don’t 
know the number but I know for the fact that when – on the day when 
Mrs Mkwabena was there, there were a few people who said they sold 
their cattle.  That is where they were then requested to look or make 
reference to the documents as to where this cattle were sold and how 
much, she will return to collect those documents and she never 
returned. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes but at least that clarifies that point, 
the only point was, did anybody sell their cattle in the expectation in 
receiving others, you answered that. 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can I ask you this question as well, for 
those people – and this is – what was told to you, I’d like to know what 
either Mr Zwane or Mr Motaung told you in 2012/2013, did they indicate 
where the dairy cows that the beneficiaries would buy would be kept? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes we 
were told that they would be kept at the dairy, where there will be a 
dairy project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can you just help me understand, how 
that was going to work, if they explained it at all.  So if I was a 
20 
beneficiary and I had ten cattle, I would take them across to the dairy 
and I would have to go there everyday to milk them or the dairy would 
milk them, did they explain these details to you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay 
what happened is, according to what the Government was going to do is 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 80 of 129 
 
to buy these ten cows per beneficiary and then the ten cows will go 
straight to the dairy product and then we would then have to undergo 
training in India, then it is up to an individual as to whether, in the 
training you choose milking or feeding the cattle. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, you are making it clear.  So my 
understanding of your evidence is, as a beneficiary therefore, you 
would find an employment opportunity at the farm, have I got this right? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct 
we were supposed to – immediately when the dairy project started we 
were supposed to all started working there, so yes it was employment 
10 
in the dairy project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of course you did not get employment at 
the dairy farm? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):    No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But there are those members of the 
community who did get employment at the dairy farm? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct, the members of the community did, some did get employment 
but not the farmers. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When you distinguish between the farmers 
20 
and the members of the community are you saying that the farmers are 
the ones who had cattle and the members of the community who got 
employment were people with different skills? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct, I do differentiate between the farmers as well as the members 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 81 of 129 
 
of the community because of the skills.  We have the skills as farmers, 
we have undergone workshops, so we were supposed to work in the 
dairy project and if there was a lot of work and we needed more 
labourers we were going to hire or bring in people that will assist in the 
farm because we are trained and they are not trained. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do you know what happened to the 
promise that you would be trained in India? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes I do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain to the Chairman. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  What 
10 
happened is Your Worship, Mr Sebenzi Zwane, instead of taking the 
farmers to India, for training, he took his choir, Msingi Zane choir to 
India for training and what happened is, they did not even stay for long 
there because they ate chilli sauces or whatever there and then they 
got sick, they had running tummies. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes there are media reports and we have 
reference documents that we will present you in due course, Chairman,  
just to confirm some of the evidence he is giving on who went across to 
India but can we…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I can just ask and maybe it is the same 
20 
question you are going to ask, did Mr Sabenzi Zwane have a music 
choir before this dairy project was started? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct because his father was a preacher so there as a church at his 
parental home, so yes. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 82 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think his father was pastor. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct, 
he was a pastor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So before this dairy project started Mr Sabenzi Zwane 
had a music choir that he had and are you saying that, that is the choir 
that he took to India instead of taking the farmers to India for training? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you want to take it from there? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No Chairman, I think that – we’ll just give 
you the documentary evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I assume that he didn’t take the choir to India for 
– to have them trained as farmers? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They told 
us Your Worship, like I’ve said our township it’s a very small township 
ad we know each other, so those kids did inform us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but my question is, were they taken to India for 
the same purpose for which the farmers would have been taken there, 
namely training as farmer? 
MR 
EPHRAIM 
MAKHOSINI 
DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter):  
According to those kids, Your Worship, they were taken there to be 
20 
trained on the dairy project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I’d like to just move on a little bit to your 
paragraph 17 Mr Dhlamini where you speak about refusing to give out 
(indistinct) ID, your ID copies, you know you were talking about that at 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 83 of 129 
 
the meeting.  Please just explain that scene to the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m sorry to interrupt I know that at some 
stage earlier he was moving into tell me about the second meeting after 
having spoken about the first meeting and I see that the part that you 
are talking about relates to, according to his statement the third 
meeting.  I wonder whether it wold not be convenient to make sure we 
are done with the second meeting but if, in terms of themes that part 
belongs to a theme that fits more with what we have dealt with that’s 
fine but it would help me more if we finish with the first meeting, we go 
to the second meeting and then third meeting. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I believe we are done with the 
second meeting, if you very quickly look at the paragraph 12 where it 
starts, it’s about the attendance, 13 relates to what they were told 
about the cows, where the cows would stay etcetera, the 4 000 
hectares, 14 deals with the shareholding 52%, 28%, 20%, that split, 
hospitals, roads…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we have dealt with it? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have dealt with it Chairman and then 
their expectations for better future, we’ve dealt with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe I can just ask a few questions, maybe I 
20 
might have missed something.  Do you recall more or less when it was 
that you had the second meeting where, I believe Mr Zwane addressed 
you again? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I don’t 
remember very well because it was like – everything was happening in 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 84 of 129 
 
a hurry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first meeting was in 2012, I take it that the 
second meeting was also in 2012? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):    Ja it 
was very close, it was not long after the first meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and was it held at the same venue as the first 
meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it essentially the same people who attended 
even if it’s not really everybody? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Thank you Chairman.  Can I then just 
confirm that the third meeting would also have taken place in 2012? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Though I 
don’t remember very well, but the third meeting it was a meeting where 
they request of taking our ID’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was not long after the second meeting that you 
had the third meeting, is that correct? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
after a few months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I had asked you just to explain to the 
Chairman what your view was on that day with respect to the physical 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 85 of 129 
 
ID copies that were being requested from you. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  What 
happened is, it was a Friday, we were requested to bring our ID’s and 
then on a Saturday there was a meeting at the town hall, before the 
meeting started, I met with the farmers we had a caucus meeting 
requesting them not to give the ID’s…(intervention). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You were requesting them not to hand up 
their ID? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct, 
the reason why I requested them not to hand over their ID’s it is 
10 
because I’ve already heard that the farms were released and Pretoria is 
requesting the identity document of the beneficiaries. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are you talking about Government funds 
here? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me just check, what you had heard was it 
that the Government in Pretoria wanted the list – wanted a list of 
beneficiaries or is what you heard that the Government in Pretoria 
wanted the ID’s of the beneficiaries? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I was in 
a meeting in Bethlehem, neighbour meeting, I heard that there was 
some infighting about the dairy project and who are the beneficiaries 
there because the Government funds had been released or out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, is what you had heard therefore, that the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 86 of 129 
 
Government in Pretoria wanted a list of the names of the beneficiaries 
or is what you had heard that the Government in Pretoria wanted the 
ID’s – ID books of the beneficiaries, or both? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):    What 
I’d like to explain is that the beneficiaries were elected after – or they 
were taken after the money or the funds had been released, that’s what 
I want to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Mr Dhlamini, I’m asking you again, please just 
listen to the question and answer that question and other issues that 
you might wish to tell me which you have included in your statement 
10 
that Ms Gcabashe knows about, she will ask you about those issues in 
due course.  Okay, earlier on you said you had a caucus meeting with 
your members is that correct? 
MR 
EPHRAIM 
MAKHOSINI 
DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter):    
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said that you told them that they should not 
hand up their ID books, is that correct? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said that you had heard something and I 
thought that you said that you heard that the Government in Pretoria 
20 
wanted a list of the beneficiaries but the interpreter seems to have 
said, you said you heard that the Government in Pretoria wanted the ID 
books, so that is why I was asking you to clarify what you heard. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The list- 
the names of the beneficiaries, the list of the names of the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 87 of 129 
 
beneficiaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that’s what you had heard, namely the 
Government in Pretoria wanted the names of the beneficiaries? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  If you had told me that, what five 
minutes ago, we would have covered a lot more ground now.  
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini I know the time is important 
10 
but we’ll actually go through all of your evidence, I think that the 
Chairman will allow us to do that.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the purpose for – can I rephrase that, 
so can you explain to the Chairman what you then decided to do, did 
you present your ID number so that your name could be put on the list, 
did the other members of the community do the same or what 
happened? 
INTERPRETER:  So do you mean, did they provide the ID numbers. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that those ID numbers and names 
20 
could be entered on the list that was going to go to Pretoria or did he 
continue to say, don’t do it? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  What 
happened is, after the caucus Your Worship, I noticed that they did not 
take my advice or whatever I was saying to them so when we went back 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 88 of 129 
 
then they were giving out their – they gave up the – ja they’ve given 
them their ID copies, so they were making copies of the ID’s now.  So 
yes, we then handed over the ID’s. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you joined the group that was 
permitting officials to make copies of their ID documents? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did your members reject the idea of not giving their 
ID books or – at the caucus meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Nobody 
10 
responded exactly it was just something else, nobody responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, but when you went to the meeting then they 
gave their ID books for – to be copied? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you did the same? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I then 
followed suite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the official who was coordinating this 
20 
was Ms Alta Meyer? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ms it is a female.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Ms – Ms Alta Meyer. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ms Meyer also asked you to sign certain 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 89 of 129 
 
forms, is this correct? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No not on that day they only 
took the ID’s only. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When did she ask you to sign forms and at 
the same time tell you about the rules of the project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Second meeting Ms Alta Meyer 
was there.  It was on that meeting where we also elected the 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us just get this clear.  You see it is important 
to give me a clear picture as to what happened in a particular meeting 
10 
and we close that off and move onto something else.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me ask a few questions. 
1.  Who called the third meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Kholiza, Thuto, they are the 
ones who notified us about this meeting.  Alta Meyer was coming to that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So please just repeat the two names of the people 
who called the meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Thutoganye, Kholiza Sibeko. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who were they in the whole scheme of things? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  They were hired by Mr 
Mosebenzi Zwane when he came in as a MEC.  He said he is employing 
them to be his eyes and ears exactly their job description Your Worship 
I would not be able – I mean Chairperson I would not be able to tell you 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 90 of 129 
 
but he said they were there to be his eyes and ears in the meeting in 
his absence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they were government officials from the 
Department? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I heard that they were 
contracted or they had a contract in the government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you told us with regard to the first meeting that 
what was written in the article that Ms Gcabashe read was true namely 
that the way the first meeting was called was by way of people who 
went around with I think loud-halers saying there would be a meeting.  
10 
Is that how the third meeting was also called? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  For the third meeting Your 
Worship there was a loud-haler and some of us were called. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And at the meeting, the third meeting was it Ms 
Meyer – was it only Ms Meyer who was the speaker? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  If I remember well it was Dume 
Kobene.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you now saying Ms Meyer was one of the 
speakers but there was another speaker Ms Kobene is that what you 
are saying? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this third meeting was it called as a follow-up 
meeting in relation to the dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I am confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  This meeting was called as a meeting relating 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 91 of 129 
 
to the dairy project? 
INTERPRETER:  The third meeting? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The third meeting. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It was – it was a meeting.  
There was nothing to be discussed there but to take the ID’s so that 
they will be taken to – or hand over their ID’s so that they can be taken 
to Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  I am going to take 
you back to your paragraph 17 and the second sentence of that 
paragraph reads as follows: 
“The farmers did not heed to my advice and we went 
ahead to provide our details including copies of our 
Identity documents to Ms Meyer who asked us to sign 
certain forms and who told us about the rules of the 
project.” 
My question is, I understand that this happened a number of years 
back.  Just for the Chairman to have an idea as to when these 
20 
documents or these forms were signed and when you were told about 
the rules of the project in the statement you locate that in the third 
meeting but please Mr Dhlamini you are at liberty to say Chairman you 
will excuse me I actually think this is when this thing happened.  So 
please just explain to the Chairman if this is correct record or if you 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 92 of 129 
 
think this record here in paragraph 17 is incorrect? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It was Alta Meyer who was just 
taking the ID copies and then only gave us just a few rules of what 
should happen in the dairy project.  Nothing hectic like do not take out 
the assets that belongs into the dairy project like garden spade nor 
[indistinct] should be taken out of the dairy project or the cows taken 
out.  So basically those were the rules – small rules that she was 
giving us, just minor.  Not taking out a fodder or grazing food.  It was 
just about the ID’s only. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That explains what you may have referred 
10 
to here as the rules of the project.  Is that correct? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  The rules of the project came 
up in the fourth meeting.  If I understand very well here it was only 
about the taking or handing over of the ID’s only.  After that third 
meeting then she came to the fourth meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you tell us about the fourth meeting.  What Ms 
Gcabashe was trying to establish from you with regard to the last 
sentence of paragraph 17 is this.  What Ms Gcabashe was trying to 
establish from you in regard to the last sentence of paragraph 17 is the 
following:  Did she tell you that is Ms Meyer about the rules of the 
20 
project at the third meeting or is the position that she did not tell you 
about the rules of the project at that meeting.  She told you about the 
rules of the project at another meeting or is the position that you 
cannot remember at which meeting she told you about the rules of the 
project? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 93 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I do not remember well Your 
Worship as to whether she informed us about the rules of the project in 
the third meeting, the meeting where the ID’s were taken or were 
handed over or when exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you Mr Dhlamini.  
Then the last thing to clear up is just the matter of those certain forms 
that we – you talk about in the same sentence.  Can you just assist with 
that?  Did you or did you not sign certain forms at the time that you 
were handing up your ID documents? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  If I remember well I think the 
word documents that we signed there are forms that we signed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Would this have been at the time that you 
were handing in your ID’s for copies to be made? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It is a long time ago.  I – it is 
– it happened long time ago I do not remember. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is fine because you have Mr 
Ncongwane who might remember some of the details.  So I do not think 
you should worry too much about it Mr Dhlamini, you are doing your 
best. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe just to put you at ease it may be that in 
the end it does not matter whether it was in the second meeting or first 
meeting what is important is were there forms that you signed and what 
those forms were?  So do not worry much about that.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 94 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I actually move on to the Imbizo that 
took place at Frankfort.  Please just tell the Chairman what that was 
about? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  There was an Imbizo at 
Frankfort Mr Zokwana was there and Lesedi FM was there as well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Would you remember roughly when that 
would have been? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I do not remember the day 
exactly but I remember that I wanted to raise this issue of dairy Vrede 
one of the people who wanted to raise the issue of the dairy – I mean 
10 
dairy project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who called the Imbizo? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We were told that there is a 
government Imbizo Agricultural department Imbizo.  The people that I 
saw there was Mr Zokwana and Thebethe and other people were in the 
other – association with us from Qwaqwa. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Continue what happened at that meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We raised some issues or 
complaints.  I raised my hand.  I did get the opportunity to speak out 
about the dairy project Vrede dairy project.   
20 
INTERPRETER:  Your Worship [indistinct] clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I raised an issue about the 
dairy project which is at Vrede and that they are now Indians people 
there, the Gupta’s who – I could hear that they were talking but the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 95 of 129 
 
language I could not get it clearly as to what language was this 
because I could pick it up that they are not conversant in English or 
their English was not – I could not understand it.  As well as they could 
not even speak Sesotho.  I had a problem with the language of the 
Gupta’s what exactly they were saying.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I just get clarity on this?  Because I 
am reading the statement as you are talking.  In the statement you 
refer to Ma Gupta but are you talking about knowing that these people 
were members of the Gupta family or are you simply referring to them 
as a class of people who would be Indian and that is – I just want 
10 
clarity – and that is why you used the term Ma Gupta? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We would see them there.  We 
were already informed that they are a – the Gupta family who are 
working in the dairy project.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who had informed you that you had 
members of the Gupta family working at the dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We – there are people who are 
working in the dairy project who are living with us in the same township 
and some we are related to.  They are the ones who informed us that 
there is a Gupta family that is working in the dairy project. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes continue.  What did you then say at 
the Imbizo? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I raised the issue that our 
identity documents were used to get the dairy project running and we 
have not received any proceeds.  It is functioning fully but we have not 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 96 of 129 
 
received any proceeds therefore I was requesting Mr Zokwana to help 
us, Zokwana to help us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Zokwana was Minister of Agriculture Forestry 
and Fisheries.  Is that the one you are referring to? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What was Minister Zokwana’s response to 
you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  He said I used wrong names or 
I referred to these people with – like with wrong names then Mr 
Thabethe then said he will intervene and sort this thing out. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did Mr Thabethe in fact resolve the 
difficulty you were placing before the Minister at that Imbizo? 
INTERPRETER:  The surname is? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thabethe. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – I am sorry.  What was your understanding of 
what Mr Zokwana was referring to that he seems to have found 
objectionable in the words that you had used? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  He did not want me to refer to 
20 
these people as Gupta’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that what Mr Thabethe said he would sort out or 
did MR Thabethe say he was going to resolve the difficulties that you 
had raised with Mr Zokwana? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Mr Thabethe was saying he 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 97 of 129 
 
was going to resolve the issue of the dairy Vrede project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just again I know you said it about two minutes ago.  
What exactly was the problem that you told Mr Zokwana about 
regarding the Vrede dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I was telling him about the 
dairy project, Vrede dairy project.  Our names were taken.  Funds were 
released from the government.  The dairy project is functional and we 
are not getting any money from it.  The promises that were made that 
we will be taken to India for training it did not happen.  This means that 
there is some  
10 
INTERPRETER:  Your Worship I am not sure if the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Criminal activity. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Criminal activity yes criminal 
activity is going on and yet our ID copies were used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and so is – is that what Mr Thabethe said he was 
going to resolve then? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I know that you said you cannot remember 
around about when the Imbizo was held but if you think back at the time 
when the third meeting was held and you look at the time when Imbizo 
20 
was held about how much time would you say lapsed between Imbizo 
between the time that the third meeting had happened before the 
Imbizo was held? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  A long time – a long time 
indeed. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 98 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  More than a year? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I assume it was more than a 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini at this Imbizo you heard 
Minister Senzeni Zokwana? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Were there any other members of 
Parliament or members of the Provincial Legislature in attendance? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  From Parliament I saw Mr 
10 
Senzeni Zokwana.  And then Mr Thebethe I saw him from Bloemfontein.  
There were others though I did not know their names.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – Mr Thebethe that attended that meeting 
that you talking about is it the one who was the Head of the Provincial 
Department of Agriculture in the Free State? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Senzeni Zokwana did not attend the Imbizo? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you are not able to identify the other 
20 
VIP’s or the other officials who were at the Imbizo? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I would not be able to identify 
them but there was also Lesedi FM but the others I would not be able to 
– be in a position to identify them. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Let us move onto the fourth meeting which 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 99 of 129 
 
was convened you say in or about 2014.  Who was in attendance at that 
meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  The fifth meeting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The fourth meeting. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Alta Meyer, Municipal officials 
or employees, councillors, that is where we even nominated or elected 
the committee.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes what – what else happened at that 
meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
10 
where Ms Alta Meyer want to take questions or did not want to respond 
to the questions because people want to ask her questions.  It is where 
we elected the committee but she did not want to accept questions 
when people wanted to ask her questions. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who did she say had asked her to come 
and see you in Vrede? 
INTERPRETER:  Can I get the question again? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Whom did she say requested her to visit 
Vrede? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter):  
20 
According to her she said it was Mr Ace Magashule. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And why was she in Vrede? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  What I 
noted was the election of the committee.  She further informed us about 
the changes that were to take place in the dairy project.  That the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 100 of 129 
 
Agriculture Department as well as the Municipality had been now 
removed from the dairy project.  FDC is going to take over. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So your understanding had all along been 
that the operations or what was happening at the Vrede Dairy Farm 
involved the Department of Agriculture and the Municipality? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 And 
the Free 
State 
Development 
Corporation was a completely separate entity? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
10 
correct.  They were a separate entity.  The first time we heard about 
them it was on that day and we had people talking about it during the 
week. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now the Free State Development 
Corporation took over the running of Estina sometime around 
August 2014.  That means that this meeting would have taken place 
just a little before that. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
It 
happened so fast.  I do not remember exactly as to whether it was a 
week after that meeting that they have taken over – the FDC have 
20 
taken over the project but it was shortly – it happened shortly a week 
or a week after. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh so you actually got to – to find out or 
to know that the FDC had taken over the Vrede Dairy Project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 101 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who told …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I think the interpreter might 
not have understood your question.  I think Ms Gcabashe wanted to 
establish from you whether you are saying at the time of this meeting 
what you learnt was that the FDC had already taken over not that it was 
going to take over ultimately.  Okay.  I will put the question. 
At this meeting was your understanding that the FDC had 
already taken over as opposed to it will still – it will take over 
ultimately. 
INTERPRETER:  The fourth meeting now your worship. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever meeting they were talking about. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
about to.  It is not like they have already taken over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Ja.  Her question was about I think 
whether before it had – before the meeting it had already done so.  
That was my understanding at least of the meeting – of the question but 
at least you are clarifying that it was still to take over. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct your worship still to take over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The tense can make a big difference in meaning. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But soon thereafter and I was suggesting 
to you that in or about August the FDC did take over the farm.  So my 
question to you was did you find out that in fact the FDC had now taken 
over the farm? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  What 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 102 of 129 
 
happened is after this meeting then indeed these people were 
presented to us.  We saw them.  We were told that these are the people 
who are now running the project.  That is when I said to them you are 
not going to nominate other beneficiaries.  We are there already as 
beneficiaries that are already existing for this project.  So we met those 
people.  We saw those people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Gcabashe I think I may have thought that 
the interpreter misunderstood the question but she – she might have 
heard the question correctly.  Are you asking what knowledge he had at 
the time he was attending the meeting or are you asking what 
10 
knowledge he gained after the meeting as to the role of the FDC? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I was satisfied that he said that 
at the time he attended the meeting they were informed that the FDC 
was about to take over.  My subsequent question was then when did 
you find out that in fact the FDC had taken over.  So there were two 
separate questions Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Now I understand it.  It is all about – it is 
all about tense.  Now I understand.  Okay but you do not remember the 
date when you found out that the FDC had taken over but are you able 
to indicate how soon after the fourth meeting it was that you learnt that 
20 
the FDC had taken over? 
INTERPRETER:  The last part of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me – you say you or I understand that you 
might not recall the date when exactly you might have heard that the 
FDC had taken over.  Do you want to interpret that part; but are you 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 103 of 129 
 
able to say how long after the fourth meeting you learnt that the FDC 
had by then taken over? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
the day when Alta Meyer came to tell us that the FDC is taking over the 
running of the dairy project.  I think it was more like this week and then 
the following week they took over the running of the project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now can you please explain what you set 
out in paragraph 20 where - and I will just paraphrase - you discuss the 
question whether or not you were recognised as beneficiaries.  When 
did that discussion take place? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Well 
what happened is your worship/Chairperson is that in the week that the 
FDC took over the running of the project it was that day when we saw 
them and we met up with them and then we told them that they are not 
going to be nominating other people as beneficiaries because we are 
there already as existing beneficiaries and we therefore requested them 
to bring documentation to that effect that shows that we are 
beneficiaries. 
Documents like for instance there is a bank account open that 
really shows that we are beneficiaries. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where did that meeting take place? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  At the 
town hall. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And who attended that meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Though 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 104 of 129 
 
I do not remember well but FDC was there.  Already we were told by 
Tuto and the municipal officials that they intend nominating other 
beneficiaries.  So we were in that meeting with the FDC and then I 
raised this issue of them not nominating other beneficiaries because we 
were existing beneficiaries. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please just clarify before you go further.  
Who intended nominating new beneficiaries? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  FDC. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do you have any names of the officials 
from FDC who attended the meeting you are relating? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
for the first time seeing them your worship.  I am not sure if they were 
picked up from the streets but it was for the first time to see them on 
the day in question. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now what exactly did Tuto and Koliza – in 
fact you said it was Tuto and … 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Koliza. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Koliza? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What did they say to you? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
were advising us based on the fact that the Agricultural Department as 
well as the municipality were already now removed from the dairy 
project.  That FDC is now taking over.  We should not agree to – we 
should not agree to them nominating or selecting other new 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 105 of 129 
 
beneficiaries.  Even in the news article - Bloemfontein newspaper - 
they did mention the fact that they will be nominating new 
beneficiaries.  That there was an article in a Bloemfontein newspaper 
that they will be nominating new beneficiaries.  We heard that from 
Tuto and Koliza. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What was the position you then took at 
the meeting with the FDC?  What was the outcome of that meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 
meeting just ended your worship after I have – Chair after I had 
requested them to go and get documentary proof or documents that 
10 
show that we are the beneficiaries of this project.  Until they produce 
such then the meeting was then dissolved just like that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How many members of the community 
attended that meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  A lot of 
beneficiaries – a lot of us. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And how had they been contacted and told 
about that FDC meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 
meeting that we had with Ms Alta Meyer she did inform us of the date – 
20 
the day that they were coming to see us. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you then just tell us about the fifth – 
what you call the fifth meeting in your paragraph 21? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just before you say that can you – you deal with 
that.  Can you just tell me again whether Ms Meyer was employed at 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 106 of 129 
 
the Office of the Premier or whether she worked for the Department of 
Agriculture or where she worked? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  From 
Mr Ace Magashule’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where – that is where she worked in the Office 
of the Premier? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  She 
said she was sent by the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  When you say she was from the Premier’s 
Office is that because of what she told or whether you also know as a 
10 
fact that she worked in the Premier’s Office? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  She told 
us that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Then you can deal with the fifth meeting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Could you then just 
tell the Chairman briefly what happened during the fifth meeting?  So 
who attended it and what happened at that meeting? 
INTERPRETER:  And when? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What – who attended, what happened, 
when it happened – when the meeting took place? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The fifth 
meeting it was called by the Premier Mr Ace Magashule. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you just stop there for one minute?  
Did the Premier personally call the meeting or did people he delegated 
to do so call the meeting? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 107 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  He 
delegated Tuto and Koliza. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes continue. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That all 
beneficiaries are called upon to attend a meeting.  Mr Magashule the 
Premier wants to meet with us. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where was this meeting intended to take 
place? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  At the 
town hall. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes continue.  What then happened on 
that day? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 
meeting did not take place.  Instead there was transport made available 
by buses that took – there were – there was transport by bus made 
available.  They then took us and the other people who were there from 
the Women’s League they took us to the dairy project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Continue. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Some of 
the farmers could not get into the transport because the bus was now 
20 
full with the ANC Women’s League.  I then got a lift from Mr Mahlaba 
with his car.  Then we went to the dairy project.  Mr Zwane was there at 
the dairy project.  Mr Ace Magashule.  There were others though.  I do 
not remember them well but I remember that Mr Madiba was there.  I 
spoke to him on that day. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 108 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was Tuto there?  Was Koliza there? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
would not be left out in any event. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So that means yes they were there? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes they 
were there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did you meet with the Premier and with 
Mr Zwane? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  We saw 
them.  They were present there but they were observing the whole 
10 
structure of the dairy project and the building but they were there.  
They did not speak to us.  There was no meeting that they called or 
conducted and from there we heard that they were serving refreshments 
of food and then we left. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the – the upshot of that meeting was 
that you did not get the opportunity to speak to the Premier? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I want to then just deal with some of the 
other meetings but can I just clear one matter Chairman?  My colleague 
has been checking on the employment of Alta Meyer … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And there is a – a document in the 
Reference Bundle A at page 2-3-4.  You may just want to make a note.  
It is a document to General Managers.  It is from the Agriculture and 
Rural Development Department and it is a document that says: 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 109 of 129 
 
“Inquiries 
are 
to 
be 
made 
to 
Ms Meyer 
– 
A C Meyer.” 
And that the – on the second page there is a note that says: 
“Ms Meyer is an acting director.” 
So from this document Chairman and if we look at the ENS 
Report which we will be dealing with on Friday her name there as well 
is on as a Coordinator of the Vrede Dairy Project but in the employment 
as I understand it from the documentation Chairman of the Department 
of Agriculture and Rural Development not the Premier’s Office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Briefly tell the Chairman about the 
meeting that ME … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before he does so I normally take a short 
break at four if we are going to go beyond four.  So maybe we should 
take that.  Just 10 minutes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That would be convenient.

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Dhlamini we are 
at page 6, and that’s paragraph 22, and I really just want you to give 
the Chairman a quick summary of what happened when MEC Qabathe 
(spelt) attended a meeting with you.  I know you have summarised in 
one sentence what happened but I know that you in the narrative you 
just may want to add one or two more details. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct, 
we did have a meeting with her, she called us into a meeting, she 
wanted to hear ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC: Mic.  
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Indeed 
she called us into a meeting, she wanted to find out about the 
documents issue, but she did not tell us much or said much that is of 
good news to us.  She wanted to find out about the documents.  Oh 
correction, she wanted to find out about us going to media.  She 
wanted to find out about us going to the media, that was the reason 
why she called a meeting.  Correction when I used documents, and then 
she, like I said there were no good news that she said to us except to 
find out about us going to the media and then she called frogs, when 
20 
you want to go and fetch water and the frog is making sounds Your 
Worship you just ignore it and go to fetch water, as you have intended, 
just ignore it.  She further told us about how she got the position and 
that they have been there for too long kind of thing or campaigning.  
That is all she said which was not good news for us.  She just insulted 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 111 of 129 
 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of who she was 
referring to as making noise like a frog that had to be ignored? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  My 
understanding was she was referring that to us, myself and Mr 
Mungani, because we are the ones who approached the media.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, what had you been told was the purpose of that 
meeting with her? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
not clear the purpose of the meeting Chairperson, it was just about the 
10 
issue of us having gone to the media regarding this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  There 
was a mayor and councillors in that meeting and they were laughing, 
nothing much was said in that meeting, they were just laughing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And Chief Director Mr Modiba was with 
you as well at that meeting. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What contribution did he make to the 
discussions? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I did not 
hear his contribution or what he said. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What did you then do?  You the individual. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  We 
remained there until the meeting was dissolved. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 112 of 129 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you clarify for the Chairman are we 
talking about one meeting where MEC Qabathe and Chief Director 
Modiba were present or are we talking about two separate meetings, 
one where MEC Qabathe and Mr Modiba were present and a different 
one where Mr Modiba was on his own, just for clarity. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  This 
meeting it’s the one where there was MEC Qabathe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini when you explain ulo and 
point the record does not know what you are pointing at. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It’s a 
10 
...[indistinct] meeting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, the first one was MEC Qabathe. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  With officials. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And one of those officials happened to be 
Chief Director Modiba. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then a separate meeting took place at a 
later stage. 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC: I am just looking at your paragraph 22, 
where you say no progress was made on our complaint it should be 
about the dairy so I left that meeting.  Tell us about that meeting with 
Mr Modiba and why you left that meeting.  
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 113 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  We wrote 
to Mr Modiba myself and Mr Nqongwane, that’s the meeting where I 
decided to walk away.  It was in that meeting where the councillors 
wanted to take over the meeting from us, like asking, questioning us 
individually and basically assessing us as to who is smarter than the 
other one.  We wrote to Mr Modiba requesting him to come to the 
meeting, we, myself and Mr Nqongwane had questions to ask him, not 
them asking us questions so they took over the meeting.  We wrote to 
him because we are the ones who had questions, not them taking over 
the meeting.  It was at that stage when I then walked away from the 
10 
meeting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So this meeting obviously took place after 
the Premier had come to the dairy and after MEC Qabathe had been to 
Vrede? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In terms of timeframes Mr Dhlamini if the 
FDC took over running the firm in mid-August, around the 14 t h of 
August 2014 are you able to give the Chairman a rough idea as to when 
these meetings, the Qabathe meeting and the subsequent Modiba 
20 
meeting would have taken place?  Would it have been in 2014, after 
August 2014 or would it have been early in 2015 just so the Chairman 
has a timeframe. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Okay 
what happened is FDC has already taken over, Mr Zwane was then our, 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 114 of 129 
 
stepped down was removed and then there was now Ms Qabathe and 
then Mr Modiba. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The MEC, she is female. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  MEC, 
okay MEC Qabathe.  And then Qabathe as well stepped down, was 
removed, then Mr Modiba or Chief Director Modiba took over, that is at 
that stage when we wrote to him to invite him to a meeting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I was trying to find out if the meeting 
with Modiba took place in 2014 or 2015, I’m just trying to locate that 
meeting. 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It is 
recently if I remember well, it can happen that it was in 2015. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is important because the next person 
you had a meeting with was Dr Masiteng, Dankise Masiteng. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Roughly when did that meeting take 
place? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Although 
I do not remember the date but the following day Mr Maimani was 
coming over at the dairy project in Vrede. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you mean your meeting with Dr Masiteng 
happened the day before your meeting with Mr Maimane? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Tell us about that meeting 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 115 of 129 
 
with Dr Masiteng. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  In that 
meeting there was also Mr Modiba, there were three.  Though I do not 
remember the other one, who it was, the meeting was supposed to be 
held at the Agriculture Department only to discover that there was no, 
the space was small or there was not enough space.  I know that I did 
not mention that in my statement but I am mentioning it now.  Tudo 
calls me he said there is Mr Masiteng and Mr Modiba they are calling 
you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Dr Masiteng and who, Mr Modiba? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Mr 
Modiba and the other one, they were standing outside so I went 
outside. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Were you alone or were you accompanied 
by somebody? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I was 
alone. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry, I thought earlier on you said Mr 
Tudo said to you Dr Masiteng and Mr Modiba were calling you, did I 
20 
hear you correctly? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes, they 
were three thought I don’t remember the other one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it’s the third one that you don’t remember? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 116 of 129 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Continue, so you went outside? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 
other farmers were in a house in the Agriculture Department, I went to 
them ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who, when you say them who are you 
talking about? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Dr 
Masiteng, and Mr Modiba and this guy who I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you were called, when Mr Tudo said Dr 
10 
Masiteng and Mr Modiba were calling you were you inside the premises 
of the Department of Agriculture? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes I was inside the house. 
CHAIR:  Were you where the meeting was going to take place together 
with other farmers? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the two who you were told were calling you were 
they outside of the room where you were and other farmers were? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
were outside the room where we were at with the other farmers but 
20 
inside the yard Your Worship of the Department of Agriculture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had they been in the same room where you and the 
other farmers were but they left the room before you were called? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Your 
Worship may I get clarity of that.  We were inside the house where the 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 117 of 129 
 
meeting was to be held then Tudo called me and said Dr Masiteng and 
Mr Modiba they are calling me outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Mr Tudo told you that were the two men, Dr 
Masiteng and Mr Modiba inside the room where the meeting was to be 
held or were they already outside? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
were outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, so you went outside? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where was Kulisa, where was Tudo when 
you went outside? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Kulisa 
was not there, Tudo was present, Kulisa was not there, Tudo myself we 
went out together and he said no you can speak to Mr Dhlamini he is 
not a bad person after all. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who was he saying this to? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  He was 
referring that to Dr Masiteng, Mr Modiba and this other third man that I 
don’t know his name 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes continue. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I did not 
hear exactly what they were saying to me or the conversation between 
myself and them to a point that I ended up telling them that you are 
now calling me by names and my vote is my secret.  It was at that 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 118 of 129 
 
stage Your Worship when I asked them or I told them what is a baby 
snake and they said it is a snake and then I said I will always remain 
the ANC member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is something that must have been 
discussed between you on the one hand and them on the other before 
you reached that point, because they are the ones who had called you 
isn’t it? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Well 
what I know what happened was Tudo said you can speak to Mr 
Dhlamini he is not a bad person, so according to them they assumed 
10 
that Tudo has already told me whatever they wanted to tell me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you must have asked them why did you call me, 
and I assume they would have told you, did you not ask them why did 
you call me and if you did what did they say to you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No they 
didn’t say and the next thing it was like it is just a small space here, we 
need to move to the Municipality Hall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they therefore not calling you as the leader of 
the farmers association in Vrede to discuss with you the suggestion 
that the meeting should move to a bigger place? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I am still 
coming there because I learnt that after when I was with them at the 
time that was never conveyed to me or said to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  At that point did 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 119 of 129 
 
you then go back into the facility where everybody else was? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And did the meeting proceed? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No we 
then changed the venue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Having changed the venue did the meeting 
proceed? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes 
indeed it did proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before we get into that meeting let’s go back to 
10 
the time when you were with the three men outside the room where the 
meeting was going to be held initially. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Outside 
now Chair?  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want you to be sure that this is not a case 
where maybe you can’t recall what they said because it doesn’t seem to 
make sense that they called you and you did not ask why did you call 
me but you talked about them calling you names and then you went 
back into the room.  Are you sure you remember exactly that they did 
not say anything to you about why they had called you? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Honestly 
I did not ask them as to why were they calling me and they did not say 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did the four of you just look at one another outside 
there and said nothing and then you went back? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 120 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I shaked 
their hands, that is where I was waiting for them to say something, they 
said nothing, that’s when I uttered those words, a baby snake, because 
they were now referring to me as a DA member.  That is at that stage 
where I told them as to what is the baby snake.  They laughed, then 
they said we must change the venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I missed something, I think you said they 
were calling you something, I didn’t hear, what were they calling you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
were calling me by name saying I am DA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  DA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DA, they were saying you are a DA member? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):   A DA 
member, a DA political party member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Oh okay. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I was 
saying that not them Your Worship, that people were making ja that I 
am DA member, not them specifically.  I wanted them to come out Your 
Worship with the reason why they called me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, is that the reason why you were telling them 
that you would remain a member of the ANC? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  But you earlier on you said you only heard 
later or maybe I misunderstood, did they say when you were them 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 121 of 129 
 
outside that venue, that the meeting should shift to another place, a 
bigger venue, did they say that there or did they not say that? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No Tudo 
is the one who came and said we must shift from this venue to a bigger 
venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You then moved to the bigger venue? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the meeting proceeded? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes the 
10 
meeting proceeded. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who was in attendance at the time? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Dr 
Masiteng, Mr Madiba and this other gentleman that I don’t know.  This 
is how the meeting resumed, on our arrival at the municipal premises 
they had a separate caucus to the point that we started asking 
ourselves as to what were they doing there because it was time for a 
meeting to be held.  On their arrival then the meeting proceeded.  I was 
the one who was asking questions.  I was basically challenging them as 
to how this thing was supposed to have happened. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What are you describing as this thing? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That the 
dairy project the people who have only 48% shares take the decisions 
on our behalf.  Chair I take the decisions on our behalf.  That we are 
the ones who were supposed to be making decisions.   
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 122 of 129 
 
INTERPRETER:  Your Worship I need help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Oh meaning they forgot in the 
process that they were supposed to proceed with the project Your 
Worship which was already initiated at [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It sounds like sleeping on the wheel.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Or on the job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or on the job.  Ja.  Was your understanding that when 
they said that they were admitting that they had not done things the 
right way with regard to the project? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct Your Worship 
they did admit they were supposed to follow the procedures that I 
mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And how – how was that meeting 
concluded? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  They agreed with me how the 
meeting was concluded is that they agreed with me that they did not do 
as they were required – as per the agreement as to how this project is 
going to be run.  Like sleeping on duty.  But now they agree with me 
20 
and they should have done things the way I am advising them to and 
then that is how the meeting was then dissolved. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You also mention in your last sentence of 
paragraph 23 that as you were asking questions there were municipal 
officials who tried to deflect those questions.   
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 123 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct and the person 
who was interfering a lot during that – me asking questions Your 
Worship it was a counsellor by the name of Dume Kobede who was 
working for the municipality, Kobede. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  Oh I thought Dume Kobede worked for the 
ANC that is what is what is noted at your paragraph 8.   
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh he was ANC counsellor but he was 
also a member of the ANC? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  He was a counsellor I am not 
10 
sure of his position currently but then he was a counsellor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now after they had admitted that they had slept on 
the job and that they should have done exactly what you were 
suggesting should have been done what was the way forward that was 
agreed upon at the meeting if there was any way forward that was 
agreed upon? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Nothing was said after that.  
There was no response after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you sure about that because I would have thought 
that if there is a project that is going on and there is dissatisfaction 
20 
and everyone acknowledges that certain things have not been done 
right I would have thought that there would also be a focus on how do 
we correct the mistakes that we have made. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It did not happen that way and 
according to my observation it was a way of preventing us from meeting 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 124 of 129 
 
with Mr Maimane the following day because he was coming the 
following day to see us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Talk to the Chairman about that meeting 
with Mr Maimane? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  And then the day came to meet 
with Mr Maimane at the dairy project farm.  There were community 
members from Warden and Memel.  They refused us to get into the 
dairy project premises. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can – can I interrupt you?  Your 
10 
paragraph 24 you say Warden beneficiaries were with you but not the 
ones from Memel.  So let us just get the record right. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes correct.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So what is the correct version? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  There were people or 
community members from Warden not Mamel if I remember well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then the second question I have you then 
talk about they refused you entry or they stopped you from entering, 
who are they? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  There were security guards 
20 
who are manning the gate. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At this point in time were you with Mr 
Maimane? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was he given entry? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 125 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes he was allowed to get into 
the – inside the premises. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And how large was the group that 
remained outside the premises? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It was a lot of people who 
were outside but Mr Maimane was supposed to choose people or a 
delegation that was supposed to come inside with him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay so tell us what then happened? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  After he chose his delegation 
the people that he wanted with him inside.  The next thing we realised 
10 
that the other group was also now inside the premises and apparently 
they were now allowed to get inside.  I do not know who they called to 
give them permission to be inside the premises as well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was this the first time you were visiting 
the dairy? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It was now for the second 
time, my second visit.  I went even the time when Mr Ace Magashule 
was there as well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes continue.  So you entered the 
premises with Mr Maimane? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  There were other things that – 
or issues that we were talking about to a point that I asked them about 
the tractor which was given to us by the Agriculture Department.  I was 
actually seeing it there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Could you identify that specific tractor? 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138 
 
Page 126 of 129 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How were you able to identify it? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We once – or we – we used 
this tractor it was an agreement between ourselves [indistinct] that we 
will use this tractor for an example we will give it to a person to use it 
for a certain days maybe two days and bring it back.  It was an 
agreement that was there between ourselves and Tutu. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was this the only item you recognised as 
one that government had given to – or the Department of Agriculture 
had given to the community of Vrede?  
10 
INTERPRETER:  Your Worship I am not sure if the names – I am not 
familiar with the equipment that he is making. So I am not sure if the 
names are correct.  I know that it is a tractor and he mentioned tractor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay take your time to ask him to explain any 
equipment that you do not know. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It was the tractor itself and the 
equipment Your Worship that you use with the tractor. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Continue. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Another thing that we saw Your 
Worship it is a poison that is used to kill cows. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is a plant. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It is a plant. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That – and if cattle eats it they die? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did you see quite a large field of that 
23 JULY 2019 – DAY 138
