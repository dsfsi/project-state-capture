PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 09 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Kennedy, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes we are thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair we propose to call three 
witnesses today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The first is Mr Pieter Knoetze; the 
second will be Mr Mkwanazi and the third will be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  I think the – the air 
conditioner noise makes it difficult to hear you properly.  
They will – they will slow it down a bit.  Okay alright 
continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  The second will be Mr 
Mkwanazi and the third will be Mr Mhlontlo.  Chair Mr 
Knoetze is currently in George and has – and has some 
difficulties in coming up to Johannesburg which have been 
20 
conveyed to you Chair by the legal team and you have 
directed that he should be given leave to give evidence by 
way of video link.  So he is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have approved that ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 4 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So Mr Knoetze is available and he is 
visible on the screens before you and before us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that is fine.  You might just 
for the benefit of the public spend a minutes just to say 
what the evidence – how the evidence that will be led this 
week connects with maybe last week but the week’s 
evidence of – just give a summary so that they can follow 
much better as each witness give evidence.  Or what 
transactions will be covered and so on. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. So – thank you Chair if I may do 
that?  We will be picking up the threads of the evidence 
that was led the week before last before you Chair for the 
whole week and we will be dealing with particularly the 
issue of the contracts that were awarded to VR Laser by 
Denel and its various entities.   
The extent to which individual officials may or may 
not have been involved in that whether or not there was 
compliance with procurement requirements and the like and 
who took the – who took the leading role in each of those 
20 
transactions.   
We will also deal this week apart from the three 
particular three contracts that were awarded to VR Laser 
for South African operations we will deal also with an 
attempt to develop business in Asia in which VR – there 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 5 of 213 
 
was also a connection with VR Laser.   
And we will also deal briefly Chair with the award of 
a contract to the entity known as LMT which ultimately we 
– was – became part of the Denel stable of operations 
when a majority shareholding in it was purchased by Denel.  
The evidence will relate to the business subjective to try 
and bring in-house capacity.   
There were financial difficulties the evidence will 
show in relation to LMT and they were then given a 
financial assistance which was dealt with as if it were an 
10 
advanced payment on a contract.  We will have evidence 
dealing with possible irregularities in relation to that – that 
funding.   
So that will be essentially the main focus of the 
evidence this week.  In addition we will take further the 
issue of how three senior executives at the board level of 
Denel were firstly suspended and later left the service or 
were dealt with in a manner which involved the termination 
of their employment one way or the other.   
Mr Saloojee is scheduled to give a bit of evidence 
20 
later this week. He have evidence on the previous occasion 
that 
is 
the 
former 
Group 
Chief 
Executive 
and 
was 
suspended and ultimately resigned in terms of a settlement 
after a lengthy process was attempted to discipline him. 
You will also hear the evidence of Mr Mhlontlo inter alia 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 6 of 213 
 
dealing with the circumstances in which he came to be 
suspended by the board.   
What we have also arranged Chair is for the 
chairperson of the board of Denel Mr Mantsha to give 
evidence at the end of this week to deal with a number of 
allegations that have been made in relation to how he 
handled the – his role as chairperson and particularly in 
relation to the way in which executives were suspended 
and also in relation to specific contracts that were awarded 
to VR Laser.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I read I think Mr Mhlontlo’s affidavit last 
night. I think it was him ja and I noted that when it came to 
the offer that Denel made to him which he ultimately 
accepted which he said was substantially better than I 
think another one that may have been made before.  I do 
not know if it was three months that it had been made 
before. 
1. I did not – I did not see any settlement agreement 
20 
that may have been signed being attached to his 
affidavit. 
2. He did not disclose how much the offer was that made 
him agree to leave.  If we do not have the settlement 
agreement I would like to have it.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 7 of 213 
 
But I would also like to have the settlement agreements 
signed with the – with Mr Saloojee because I do not 
remember that – when Saloojee gave his evidence he also 
covered that.   
But also I think he too might not have disclosed to 
the commission how much he was given.  I have not seen 
is Ms Africa or Mr Africa?  The other executive who was 
suspended together with Mr Saloojee and Mr Mhlontlo.  Is 
it Ms or Mr Africa, do you know?  Ja I seem to think it was 
Ms but I may be mistaken.   
10 
I do not know if we have an affidavit from him or her 
because if he or she also left under similar circumstances I 
would like us to – I would like to see what settlement 
agreement was signed with them – with him or her and how 
much was offered.  Ja – and I have no doubt that the 
current chairperson of the board who testified here can 
facilitate that quickly as well as whoever the CEO is 
because they would have – they should have records of… 
 
Now that is important because the – it may well be 
that how things were done in relation to these executives 
20 
have got similar features with how executives at Eskom 
were dealt with those who were suspended and then 
offered money to go. 
 
Now in regard to Eskom the board members who 
have testified may have struggled to explain or justify why 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 8 of 213 
 
Eskom offered them money to go.   
 
Of course the context there at Eskom is that the 
board – the board members who have testified say that 
they did not have any problems with those executives and 
actually wanted them back or would have been happy for 
them to be back – at least some of the board members.  So 
there is the question of, why did you offer them money if 
they wanted to leave why did you not let them leave like 
everybody resigns from a company? 
 
So there is that part.  Now here at Denel it would 
10 
seem that over a long period the board had the opportunity 
to – to come with evidence of misconduct or the charges 
and substantiate charges against these executives.  And 
then instead of subjecting them to a disciplinary hearing 
and let the outcome thereof determine whether they would 
continue at Denel or not it seems that they then subjected 
them to long suspensions and at a certain stage offered 
them money. 
 
So I would like to know how much were they offered 
because I will want to know what the justification for that 
20 
is.  Why they did not allow the disciplinary process to take 
its course? 
 
But one would like to know to have the settlement 
agreements and to have the amounts that were offered as 
well. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 9 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair we will attend to 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair unless there is 
anything else may we then with your leave call by way of 
the virtual hearing Mr Pieter Knoetze?  May I ask that he 
be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Please administer the 
oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like he cannot hear you.  Mr 
Knoetze can you hear us? 
MR KNOETZE:  Is he – Chair I can hear you.  There is a 
little bit of slow interruptions but otherwise I can hear you 
yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You can continue. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR KNOETZE:  Pieter Karel Johannes Knoetze. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:  Not at all no. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 10 of 213 
 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God? 
MR KNOETZE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Yes you may 
start. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Good morning Mr 
Knoetze.   
MR KNOETZE:  Morning Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is it correct that you have assisted 
10 
the commission with its investigators and its legal team 
and that affidavits have been produced by you following 
that intervention? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes it is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now I understand you have – you are 
sitting in George I believe, is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:  No I am at my house in Pretoria. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Oh is it in Pretoria I beg your pardon.  
Mr Knoetze is correct that you have a copy of your main 
affidavit? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes I have it electronically and a hard copy 
next to me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  If you could please 
as you were directed by one of our colleagues at the 
commission earlier if we could refer to page numbers on 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 11 of 213 
 
the top left hand side you will see there is a Denel-08-04.  
Do you have that? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes I am going to it – I am just going 
through it quickly Chair.  Yes Chair I am at 04. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And this appears to be an affidavit 
bearing your name, is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it runs in its text to page 32. 
MR KNOETZE:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And is followed by a number of 
10 
annexures.  On page 32 is that your signature? 
MR KNOETZE:  I am just going through to make sure Chair 
just let me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the signature on the page there 
because there are two or three signatures. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  I will direct if I may Chair?  Do 
you have page 32 Mr Knoetze? 
MR KNOETZE:  Close to I am just going to make sure to 
confirm.  Yes Chair it is my handwriting and my signature 
and the affidavit with it – yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that the signature at the top? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And below it appears that you signed 
in front of a Commissioner of Oaths and you took the oath? 
MR KNOETZE:  Correct Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 12 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Have you been through this 
affidavit and are you able to confirm that the contents are 
true and correct? 
MR KNOETZE:  I have gone through it and I can confirm it 
is correct and true. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair there is a supplementary 
affidavit may I just ask formerly for this affidavit first to be 
admitted. Chair it forms part of Denel Bundle 08 and 
Exhibit W21 and we would ask your leave to have it 
admitted as an Exhibit before this commission? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say W21? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Pieter Knoetze 
starting at page 4 of Bundle – of Denel Bundle 08 is 
admitted as Exhibit W21. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Knoetze it 
appeared during the consultations between members of the 
legal team and yourself that certain annexures were 
missing from the – what was attached to your original 
affidavit that we have just looked at and you have filed – 
20 
you have signed a separate supplementary affidavit to 
correct that, is that so? 
MR KNOETZE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I take you please in the same 
bundle to page 298?   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 13 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:  Okay let me just go through it here quickly 
– through the drawings.  Just a moment Chair I am just 
going to it.  It takes a little bit of time Chair going through 
the pages.  Let me get it just now.  Okay Chair just the 
numbering again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  298. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  298. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 298 the black numbers on the left 
hand corner. 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes.  I am on it Chair thank you. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that your supplementary affidavit? 
MR KNOETZE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And if I can take you to the second 
page that is page 299.  Is the first signature in the middle 
of the page your own? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And again you had this – this affidavit 
sworn and attested before a Commissioner of Oaths, is that 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And have you been through this 
affidavit 
and 
satisfied 
yourself 
as 
to 
its 
truth 
and 
correctness? 
MR KNOETZE:  I am thank you Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And is it correct that you have 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 14 of 213 
 
attached to that affidavit the relevant annexures that were 
missing from the attachments to your main affidavit? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes after my request it was given lastly to 
me by – by the team and it was attached as such.  Thank 
you Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  As I understand it Mr 
Knoetze you did not have those documents originally when 
you prepared the main affidavit that is why you did not 
attach them to your affidavit but the commission was able 
to 
source 
copies 
of 
those 
documents 
which 
your 
10 
supplementary affidavit confirms are in fact the documents 
that are referred to in your main affidavit, is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:  It is correct Chair.  It is correct Chair and 
you will also see in those paragraphs I refer specifically to 
– to those documents because I was – I left already Denel 
at that point so I referred to those specific annexures as I 
– as far as I can recall this was the following attachments 
and – and specifically referenced to those attachments.  
But I did receive them last week and it was now included.  
Yes thank you Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Chair may we then 
ask leave formerly to have the supplementary affidavit with 
its annexures admitted.  It is still in bundle, Denel Bundle 
08 and it appears from page 298 and I assume that Chair 
you would have that admitted as Exhibit 21.1. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 15 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I – 21.1 or 21. – I mean W22 
depending on what seems to be fine in terms of the 
arrangements of the bundle – arrangement of the bundle. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes W22 has already been allocated. 
CHAIRPERSON: Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To a different exhibit I am afraid 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but does – does Exhibit W22 appear 
before the supplementary affidavit or after? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No after. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so we will make it 21.1. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The supplementary affidavit of Mr Pieter 
Knoetze starting at page 298 is admitted as Exhibit W21.1. 
Before – before Mr Kennedy begins with his questions Mr 
Knoetze I see that there seems to be a vast difference 
between your signature at page 296 on the supplementary 
affidavit and your signature at page 29 of your main 
affidavit.  What can you say about that? 
MR KNOETZE:  If I followed the question Mr Chair it is a 
20 
difference between the signature of two different pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the signature that you say is yours on 
the supplementary affidavit is very different from the 
signature that you have said is yours on the main affidavit. 
MR KNOETZE:  I must say Chair I found it difficult – the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 16 of 213 
 
electronic copy does not have the signatures on.  The one 
that I have opened does not have the signatures on my 
side.  I do have all the signatures of the primary affidavit 
so I cannot see unfortunately on the electronic one it did 
not have the signed – the signature on the supplementary 
ones.  It is difficult to respond there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe a way can be found to let 
you see exactly what I see and then you can deal with it 
later.  Mr Kennedy do you know how that can be done in 
terms of technology?   Or does he have a hard copy – hard 
10 
copies with him? 
MR KNOETZE:  I believe the witness indicated he had a 
hard copy available to him.  Mr Knoetze do you have a 
hard copy available there? 
MR KNOETZE:  Mr Chair unfortunately at the – [00:22:49] 
picked up last night very late the supplementary one and it 
was the only one.  I did not make copies for me after the 
signature so he has taken the only one that had the 
original in with him to be handed in.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KNOETZE:  But we can definitely as Chairperson 
through you is asked we can do the comparison at any 
time.  I am more than willing it is accepted we can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – well I need to know when you 
might be able to have with you hard copies so that we- you 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 17 of 213 
 
can deal with it.  What logistical arrangements need to be 
made to achieve that?  Mr Kennedy do you know? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair I think that we may be able to 
find a technological solution to this perhaps a photograph 
can be taken on a camera phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Of the two signatures and sent to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So that he can then look at it on the 
phone. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I will not ask him for his phone 
number in public here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I am sure we have the phone 
numbers and perhaps one of my colleagues – may I just 
have a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you very much.  I understand 
that – that my colleague will send him a photograph of 
20 
each of the two signatures so that he can compare. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Perhaps we can stand down once we 
have dealt with the rest of his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 18 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then it will be complete with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I do not imagine it – we should 
require a standing down of more than a few minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Unless – unless 
you would prefer me to deal with that upfront now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am happy for us to continue in the 
meantime if you are happy to do that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the basis that he has said both are 
his signatures. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just see a vast difference and – so 
he can… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  They are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He can come in later but if maybe it 
might be better to get this cleared before we start and if it 
is going to take a few minutes I am happy to stand down 
for that purpose.  Which one do you prefer? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well perhaps let us stand down now 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Let us get this out of the way before 
we begin with the rest. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 19 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I will – I will stand down probably 
five minutes will be more than enough? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I believe so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – oh you will let me know – you 
will let me know once it has been sorted out but certainly it 
should not go to ten minutes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay we adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
MR KNOETZE:   Jerry, if you can still hear me.  I am ready 
whenever you are ready on that side. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  If you could just wait for 
the Chairperson, Mr Knoetze.  
MR KNOETZE:   I am ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  We are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Has Mr Knoetze been able to look at 
20 
both signatures? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you for the opportunity.  We 
apologise.  The legal team did not pick up the discrepancy.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 20 of 213 
 
So he has clarified to us.  What he has been sent Chair by 
members of the team are photographs both of the signature 
page of the main affidavit at page 32 and the signature page 
of the supplementary affidavit at page 299.  So may I just 
ask him a few questions? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other...  Now, the first signature is on 
page 29, hey?  Oh, no, no.  Page 32 in terms of the black 
numbers. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thirty-two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I forgot we use the black numbers.  
10 
Yes.  So he has seen both now? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He has seen both.  If I may just ask 
him a few question on the record Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So he confirms it for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Knoetze, is it correct what I have 
just said to the Learned Chair that you have been sent a 
photograph of the signature page at page 32 which relates to 
the main affidavit.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   That is a hundred percent Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And also the signature page of the 
other affidavit, the supplementary at page 299.  Did you 
receive that/ 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 21 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you have looked at what appears 
there, hey? 
MR KNOETZE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just ask you?  On page 31...  
Just let us look at page 31, please. 
MR KNOETZE:   I am quickly going to 31.  Just give me a 
moment Chair.  It is the wrong version.  I am quickly going 
through.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Will it be quickly if Mr Knoetze uses hard 
10 
copies maybe if he uses his computer? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Knoetze, do you have a hard copy 
of the main affidavit in front of you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we may ...[intervenes]  
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, I do.  I also have...  But that one does 
not have the...  Mr Chair, that one does not have numbers.  
So I am going through the electronic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so. 
MR KNOETZE:   I am at number 32 there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am just scared...  There is quite 
20 
some delay before you get to a page ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am afraid there is ...[intervenes]  
MR KNOETZE:   ...and after an hour or two hours, we might 
have lost quite some time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I think this will be the only instance.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 22 of 213 
 
The witness referred me to his initials on the previous 
pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Knoetze, did you...  have you 
looked at the initials that appear on the earlier pages of the 
main affidavit at the bottom right hand ...[indistinct]  
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, I have Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And whose initials ...[intervenes]  
MR KNOETZE:   [Indistinct] [transmission not clear – 
speaker unclear]  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry Chair.  Whose initials appear at 
the bottom right hand of each of the pages before we get to 
32? 
MR KNOETZE:   Each of them, are myself.  My signature on 
the right hand side.  The left-hand side is the commission of 
oaths’ one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   When you say your signature, do you 
mean signature or initials? 
MR KNOETZE:   My initials. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Initials.  Now on page 32, the 
20 
Chairperson has referred you to the fact that above the 
word, the typed word deponent is the name P C J Knoetze.  
Who wrote that in?  Did you write that in? 
MR KNOETZE:   It is my handwriting.  It is exactly correct.  
Yes, Chair.

Page 23 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Is this your normal... is this a 
signature or is this merely the handwriting of your name? 
MR 
KNOETZE: 
 
 
It 
was 
my 
handwriting. 
 
As 
my 
understanding was, this was necessary to put my handwriting 
in there.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then, you have looked at 
the other photograph sent to you by phone which is on page 
299.  It is in the supplementary affidavit.   
MR KNOETZE:   299, is that correct? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Do you have that? 
10 
MR KNOETZE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you have been sent a photograph 
of this, this as the signature page.  There is typed half-way 
down the name Pieter Knoetze.  That is your name, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   I am close to that.  I am just going to go to 
299 quickly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR KNOETZE:   I am close to 299 Chair.  Just a moment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Knoetze, in fact, my question was 
directed at the photograph that you have sent just a few 
20 
moments ago. 
MR KNOETZE:   Ja, the photograph ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Perhaps ...[intervenes]

Page 24 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, please do not talk over me when 
I am asking questions.  We must each give each other a 
chance to finish.  The photograph that was sent to you of 
this page, the signature page for the supplementary affidavit.  
Is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if you can look at that.  Is that 
your signature that appears above the typed name Pieter 
Knoetze? 
MR KNOETZE:   It is my handwriting of my...  It is my 
10 
handwriting P C J Knoetze in my handwriting.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, but is it handwriting where you 
are simple writing out your name or signing it? 
MR KNOETZE:   It is just writing out my name Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On page 299? 
MR KNOETZE:   On 299, it is just my handwriting and my 
name 
...[indistinct] 
[transmission 
not

– 
speaker 
unclear] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just take some guidance? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Knoetze, I am sorry.  We need to 
try and get through this quickly.  We have seen already that 
at the earlier page 32, what you did there was, you did not 
sign it.  You wrote out your name in your handwriting which 
is not your normal signature.  Is that correct? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 25 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair.  I did not the 
signature but it was as deponent my initials and my surname. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, but at page 299, what we have 
and we have sent you a photograph of it, is where we see 
somebody has apparently signed above the typed name 
Pieter Knoetze.  What I see above that, is what appears to 
be somebody has signed it rather than writing out his or her 
name.  If you could please look at the photographs that you 
have been sent by your phone. 
MR KNOETZE:   I am look at this 32 that has been sent on 
10 
the Whatsapp.  There is no – and my ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [Indistinct]  
MR KNOETZE:   ...Whatsapp I received ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry to interrupt you.  We are 
finished with page 32.  I am looking at page 299 now. 
MR KNOETZE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Please look at the Whatsapp 
photograph that you have been sent of page 299. 
MR KNOETZE:   Okay I got that one.  Is it the first one 
Chair? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, just before the looked at the first 
one.  Can you just confirm?  At the foot of the page, you will 
see the commission of oaths has signed and his – her or she 
has inserted the date the 8t h of November 2020.  Are we 
looking at the same document? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 26 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   I am looking at the same one Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Now above where 
the commission of oaths has signed, half-way down that 
page, the very first signature that appears on this page, 
above the typed name Pieter Knoetze.  Do you see that? 
MR KNOETZE:   I see that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that a signature or is that your 
name? 
MR KNOETZE:   This is my signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Your signature? 
10 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So we have in the main 
affidavit it – although it has your initials throughout, you did 
not put your signature, you wrote your name.  But in this 
affidavit we have this page which shows your signature.  Is 
that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Hundred percent correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Is there any reason – I am not 
trying to catch you out or criticise you but there is any 
reason why you signed – you used your signature on the 
20 
supplementary affidavit, on this page we are looking at, but 
instead of putting your signature to the main affidavit, you 
put your name in handwriting. 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, if I must be honest.  I think it was 
done late last night.  I had to rush through this.  And I had it 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 27 of 213 
 
done at the specific commission of oath’s house to quickly 
get this done and I could have probably also have signed 
that page where I did my P J C Knoetze in.  And then we had 
to quickly rush it to get through advocate ...[indistinct] to the 
part(?), ja.  [transmission not clear – speaker unclear] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you, Mr Knoetze.  But do 
you confirm again that each of these two affidavits, the main 
one in which you simple initialled and wrote your name and 
the supplementary one which you initialled and signed, both 
of those, in fact, are your affidavits and you confirm under 
10 
oath, that you have taken this morning, that their contents 
are true and correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Hundred percent Chair.  I confirm that is the 
case. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Alright. 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
Now 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  But you see, this 
first one was signed in – was deposed to in September, not 
yesterday.  September 2003.  Was it just your understanding 
that all you were required to do is just put your initials and 
20 
surname or did somebody say that is what you needed to 
do?   
 
Because you see the commission  the certificate of the 
commissioner of oaths underneath your name there, says:  
Thus signed and sworn to before me.  So it is supposed to 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 28 of 213 
 
be signed.   
 
But obviously, some people sign in such a way that it is 
just initials and surname.  So the commissioner of oaths will 
not know whether that is your signature or not.   
 
Was it your understanding that you should just put in the 
initials and the surname or what was the position?  Because 
that one is not the one.   
 
It is the supplementary affidavit that you did yesterday 
where you may have rushed but this was September 2003.   
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair that was my understanding and... 
10 
but I can again Chair.  I can confirm these are part of my 
statements and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KNOETZE:   ...signed by me myself Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Let us continue  You may 
continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If you would like it, we could, of 
course, ask the witness to resign the original affidavit with a 
20 
proper signature but I do not know if you require it after the 
evidence has been given? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no.  I think it is fine because he is 
confirming under oath that the contents are true and correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 29 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that when I picked it up, it 
seemed very strange.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, it is quite a striking difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Mr Knoetze, thank you.  We 
have got that issue out of the way now.  If we can now deal 
10 
with some of the things that you say in your affidavit.  You 
previously worked for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second Mr Kennedy.  It is very 
dark where Mr Kennedy is.  I do not know whether something 
must be done with that light.  You may continue Mr Kennedy.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that...  That is much better. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I think last – the previous weeks, the 
curtains were open so that we got a bit more natural light 
which seemed to ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Well, let ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But the light that has just been 
adjusted seems to help me but thank you for looking out on 
my behalf. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might help but if the curtains can be 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 30 of 213 
 
attended too as well, that would be helpful. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Knoetze, you were previously 
employed at Denel Land Systems.  Is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We are going to call it DLS for short in 
these proceedings as you have in your affidavit.  When did 
you start in the Denel Group as an employee? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, I started in 1989 Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And when did you leave? 
MR KNOETZE:   I left Denel two years ago, 2018 in May 
2018 Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As on what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But that sounds like you had one employer 
throughout [laughing] all those years.  Is that correct?  From 
1989. 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, just – I heard one part 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like you had one employer from 
1989 to when you left two years ago.  That is quite a long 
20 
time. 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  Previously, I was with Transnet 
before that but since 1989 until I left Denel I was with Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 31 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just...  Ja, h’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you mention in your affidavit that 
you hold a Bcom degree.  I understand in consultation with 
my learned colleagues, you indicated you have an additional 
degree as well.  What is that? 
MR KNOETZE:   I also...  Through Mr Chair, I hold an MBA at 
the University of Pretoria Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Now when you left 
in 2018 Mr Knoetze, what position did you hold at DLS? 
MR KNOETZE:   I was the Executive of the Business 
10 
[transmission not clear – speaker unclear] Excellence Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And your affidavit refers to you as 
being the Chief Financial Officer.  Is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   I was the Chief Financial Officer until March 
2015 and then I was through a mentoring programme 
appointee a young, new, innocent Xhosa person into the role 
of CFO and I was then given a position as Business 
Excellence within DLS in March 2015. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you have dealt in your 
affidavit with your responsibilities.  Can I take you to page 6, 
20 
please?  Double o six.  May I just call it six? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you refer to your responsibilities 
as CFO being financial planning, financial reporting, general 
ledgers, bank transactions and petty-cash.  Did you still 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 32 of 213 
 
have responsibilities for those issues when you became 
Executive for Business Excellence? 
MR KNOETZE:   No, Chair.  No.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On the previous page zero, five.  It 
indicates 
that 
you 
were 
reporting 
to 
various 
people.  
Mr Dircke(?), 
 
Mr 
Ellers, 
Mr 
Welroete(?), 
Mr 
Burger, 
Mr Mhlonthlo and Mr Sadik(?).  Was that at different times of 
your employment.   
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct sir, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you say: 
10 
“I reported to the last two managers.  That is 
Mr Mhlonthlo on a dotted line to Denel Corporate 
Office.” 
 
Just explain what you mean by that. 
MR KNOETZE:   At the time of this process that we were – 
that the investigators were going through, I was reporting on 
a guided line within the division where the CEO was 
Mr Burger, directly to him, but my dotted line as a functional 
also responsibility on finance, I reported to Mr Fikile 
Mhlonthlo. 
20 
 
And also to on a dotted line to Mr Sadik as the CEO and 
it could be that he was still the acting CEO at that point.  
And that was my alternative responsibilities and to make 
sure that there is proper peer processes in place on 
functional issues Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 33 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Once you were made Executive 
for Business Excellence, did you still report to anybody? 
MR KNOETZE:   Also to Mr Burger still.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see.  Now while you were CFO, were 
you familiar with the requirements of the Supply Chain 
Management Policy of Denel? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  I was not personally 
responsible for it but I was in the al. the management 
meetings where we had discussions with regards to the 
Supply Chain Process and where they were applicable, 
10 
interactions between Finance and Supply Chain where it 
needed to be followed.  All that interactions, I was part of in 
the Management Team, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was that what was called the DLS 
Exco? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you formed of that? 
MR KNOETZE:   I was part of the Management Team, Chair.  
Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Were you part of that 
20 
Management Team throughout your period as CFO? 
MR KNOETZE:   If I recall correctly.  I think so Chair.  It is a 
long time ago but I think probably most of the time I would 
have been part of the Management Team.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you were still part of that 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 34 of 213 
 
Management Team when you seized to be CFO and you 
became Executive for Business Excellence.  Correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you carry on sitting on the Exco 
once you changed your role from CFO to Executive for 
Business Excellence? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so, were you still on the Exco 
throughout that period that you were the Executive for 
Business Excellence until you left the employ of Denel in 
10 
mid-2018? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  I have to actually qualify that, 
as the last year of my service before – and as I started to 
get specifically more ill with my chronic condition, I was 
nominated as part of, I think it was a group of four or five 
people, to assist DCO in Corporate Affairs to help with the 
end-stake of Denel at that point, where I did some work for 
almost a year or close to six months and later or longer to 
actually help and see where we can take Denel on strategic 
matters and going forward on the end-stake Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now in your affidavit, you have 
indicated that you would provide an advisory support role to 
the CEO and the SCM Unit, Supply Chain Management Unit, 
at the DLS.  Can you explain to the Chair please, briefly, 
what that entailed?  Why did you play such a role and what 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 35 of 213 
 
sort of role did you in fact play? 
MR KNOETZE:   Ja, I think Chair if we can just with the 
financial one.  It was always my responsibility to make sure 
that all financial matters should be reported and be directed 
to the CEO to update him in terms of every – the latest 
developments and also big decisions to be made with regard 
to the Delegation of Authority.   
 
But also then on Supply Chain, through my interactions 
with the Management Team and as an Executor, we also had 
a Project Financial Office where we had interaction with 
10 
Supply Chain from a financial point of view just to make sure 
that the support to Supply Chain was price – possible price 
negotiations or on track conditions if needed in certain cases 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now in your main affidavit, you 
deal with LMT, the entity known as LMT, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And ultimately, LMT had a majority 
shareholding in that company purchases by Denel.  Is that 
right? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now what was your involvement in 
relation to the period to when it was being acquired, when 
the shares were being sold to Denel, the majority shares?  
Were you involved in the background that led up to the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 36 of 213 
 
contract being signed that sold those shares to Denel? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, it is a short question with a long 
answer.  I can – to make it a bit brief.  I can state that during 
the 2008/2009 period, the courts(?) for the contract, for the 
Triennium Contract, we will talk about maybe later, was 
going through with regards to the Hoefyster Contract to 
production order that was anticipated to be placed on DLS to 
the value of approximately R 10 billion.   
 
And my involvement was on management level, to make 
sure that when we get the order, we will be ready for 
10 
production.   
 
And that going forward, we need to have the governance 
in place and with the different board meetings on DLS and 
Denel side, we need to adhere to the delegations as well as 
the good governance to be able to make sure there is either 
or, as will become later visible, securities and whatever is 
needed in the option agreements when we acquired LMT 
later on.   
 
But at first, during 2008/2009/2010, my involvement was 
mainly to get involved through the request by the CEO and 
20 
Denel and board members, to get involved in the financials 
of LMT and to make sure that they had a sound financial 
situation going forward.   
 
And specifically if we want to acquire the majority 51% 
shares, we should make sure that there is a sustainable 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 37 of 213 
 
financial business.   
 
Later on, when the share option, which was a different 
process started, it was mainly driven by Mr Morris who 
previously worked for DPE and he was the person who really 
instigating the execution of the share option.   
 
Although I was very much involved in all of the different 
discussion on the option agreement and support to wherever 
I had to, whether it was management or to Mr Morris with an 
application to DPE.   
 
And 
Mr 
Morris 
was 
actually 
the 
single 
point 
10 
accountability person to do the full share option execution by 
that time Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay so Mr Knoetze, before the shares 
were actually bought by Denel in LMT.  Was LMT’s financial 
strength considered by you?  Did you look at the financial 
position of LMT? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, I was requested to make sure that, due 
to, at that time, they were a critical capability, strategic 
capability that we needed to have security of supply.  And I 
was requested to intervene and see what the financial 
20 
position are and whether they will be able to sustain the 
business going forward for the Hoefyster Contract, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, LMT before its majority shares 
were sold to Denel, was already a long existing supply to 
Denel.  Is that right? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 38 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   Just repeat Chair.  I missed the first part. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   LMT.  Before a majority share in LMT 
was sold to Denel.  LMT, for some years, had already been a 
supplier of items of equipment to Denel.  Correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   I understand so Chair.  I was not so 
involved previous years with LMT.  I know they were a 
supplier for some time.  I really became involved in their 
financial affairs really when I was asked to do sin 2008/2009.  
That is so, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what did you understand the 
10 
purpose be to buy the shares, for Denel to buy the shares I 
LMT?   
MR KNOETZE:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What was the business objective? 
MR KNOETZE:   Sorry, Chair.  The business objective, all 
the way, was that DLS had a strategic objective to combine 
capabilities for the industry to have a total integrated system 
level approach to our clients.   
 
What that means Chair is that, we wanted to do a one-
stop, a single source supplier to any client local or overseas.  
20 
And for that Chair, we really wanted to have all capabilities 
of a Level 5 business from start to end into one business.   
 
And for that reason, we have always presented to the 
DLS and Denel Boards and also specifically on our budget 
presentations, the position that we wanted to have, the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 39 of 213 
 
integrated capability that includes also the capabilities at 
LMT Chair and that was our objective.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now that you say you have 
acted on the request of your management, you did look into 
the financial past(?) of LMT before the shares were sold to 
Denel.  What, overall, was your conclusion?  What was the 
outcome of your findings? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, I think the two main issues that came 
out was.  The one was that there was not a big or good 
oversight over the financials in LMT as they had not have a 
10 
specific financial person looking after the financials as it was 
a business that was done by a few individuals or run by a 
few individuals with not much financial knowledge.   
 
And the other one sir, Chair would be to have made sure 
and to have seen the risk of being then sustainable going 
forward and having had the financial backing to executing 
the Hoefyster Contract for the parables, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you have dealt in your affidavit 
with monies that were paid over to LMT as advance 
payments.  Are you aware of any advance payments being 
20 
made by DLS to LMT during the period you were CFO? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now how much was paid and 
when? 
MR KNOETZE:   It was R 12.7 million on a work-on-risk 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 40 of 213 
 
procurement, work-on-risk order which was placed the 
29t h of April 2010.  And the monies that was paid, the 
R 12.7 million was a 25% pre-payment on ...[indistinct] 
[transmission not clear – speaker unclear]  R 52 million rand 
work-on-risk order to LMT.  And the monies were paid from 
up the 29t h of April 2010 and a few weeks later, the full 
complement update. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now some witnesses have given 
evidence to the Commission that the advance payments 
made to LMT were something out of the ordinary, that they 
10 
were not truly advance payments, they were actually really 
just disguised as advance payments.  To try and channel 
money to LMT because it was in financial difficulty.  What 
is your own view of it? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, my view is that after the interaction 
with Denel, DLS and Denel members of the board, various 
reports were given of the situation at LMT with regards to 
security of supply and possible penalties on the Hoefyster 
contract as well as the IP that was vested in LMT and they 
were seen as a very critical strategic asset and supply and 
20 
for 
that 
reason 
we 
have 
various 
presentations 
and 
discussions which is attached as some of the annexures 
and discussion whereby we presented the care where a 
work on risk situation order which does not out of the 
norm, it happened in other cases for long leave items as 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 41 of 213 
 
well, if it was needed to place that order to start making 
prepayments so that there is stability in the financials and 
that it is a sustainable business when the Hoefyster does 
start with the production of 10 billion that we have security 
of supply and that should be able to protect Denel in the 
case of possible late deliveries, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was it – is it not correct, though, that 
LMT was at that stage facing serious financial difficulties? 
MR KNOETZE:   They were facing financial difficulties, 
Chair, yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   To what extent - was there just a 
shortfall in cash flow or was it a matter far worse than that, 
that its own survival was at stake? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, I think if recall correctly, I think I 
had still a good order book.  I think there was good 
business.  It was mainly I think that the past where they 
had a very growth in business and actually I think, if I 
recall correctly, they were going too fast to be able to fund 
specifically all the working capital requirements for the 
growth in business and for that reason they ran out of 
20 
specifically capital to be able to turn their working capital 
into cash to be able to pay their creditors for the short 
term and then the longer term sustainable, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if I can take you in your affidavit 
to page 13, just bear in mind the guidance given to you 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 42 of 213 
 
earlier, the top left hand page number, page 13. 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, sir, Chair.  Correct, I am there, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you refer in paragraph 7.1 to 
approval being given for an at risk production order and 
you realised that a payment of R1.1 million would need to 
be paid before the end of April 2010.  That was 1.1, 
payable before the end of April, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you go in 7.2 to say this: 
“During this process of discussion with regards to 
10 
the first payment to be made to LMT to pay off 
Busisa Investments/Bowden and Company.” 
Who were they? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, I missed the last part, who were 
they?  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
who 
was 
Busisa 
Investments/Bowden and Company? 
MR KNOETZE:   It was, as far as I can recall, a company 
that had given money and loaned money to LMT and were 
requesting pay back or alternatively they had clauses 
20 
where they can actually get their fingers within LMT and 
take some specific actions against LMT and also demand 
some specific probably share going, if I recall correctly. 
They had a hold on LMT, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So LMT owed them money, correct? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 43 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, just speak clearly please, say 
it again? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    And what was that money for? 
MR KNOETZE:   I cannot recall, Chair, probably also cash 
for working capital to pay creditors or the normal run of the 
business, cash requirements. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  So Busisa Investments and 
Bowden and Company had made funds available to LMT 
10 
which now owed it back.  That was a separate transaction, 
was it not, from the work that LMT was doing for Denel. 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct.  So I can understand a R1.1 
million being payable as for at risk production in terms of 
the normal arrangements by the end of April 2010 but why 
was Denel looking at LMT and its obligation to Busisa 
Investments/Bowden 
and 
Company? 
 
Why 
was 
there 
consideration being given to Denel money being made 
available to LMT which would then pass it on to Busisa and 
20 
Bowden? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, the decision was always made and 
we did the presentations and discussions is that there were 
not just this 1.1 but there were a few critical payments that 
had to be made by LMT to be able to on the short to 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 44 of 213 
 
medium term to be on the right track in terms of the cash 
flow from working capital perspective.  As far as I can 
remember there were also SARS payments that they were 
in default, so there was specific amounts that were 
discussed 
on 
our 
board 
meetings 
and 
management 
meetings where there were monies to be paid to take them 
through the difficult to get to the point where they can start 
unlocking some of the working capital in stock and debtors 
to be able to go forward again and execute the rest of their 
business sustainably, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you would have had a contract – 
DLS would have had a contract with LMT for the production 
of the particular items concerned, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that would have involved 
agreement on the price, what amount had to be paid, 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Right, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And at what stage different portions 
of the price would have to be paid.  So much would be paid 
20 
on x date, so much would be paid on y date, etcetera.  
Correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is the norm to have in a contract, 
yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed.  Now why did you not simply 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 45 of 213 
 
make funds available to LMT taking account of what Denel 
had to pay LMT in terms of that order or contract?  Why 
was there even discussion about LMT’s problems in 
relation 
to 
its 
creditors 
and 
its 
suppliers 
and 
Busisa/Bowden and its take liability, etcetera, why was that 
being taken into account by Denel in deciding on an 
advance payment? 
MR KNOETZE:   The only possible solution in such a case 
with security of supply, supplier that were in difficulty, was 
on this exact method of placing a work on risk and then 
10 
later then the approval, which is the security, which is the 
placement of the production order of R10 billion from 
Armscor and for that reason we used the process to do the 
work on risk as discussed through all the executives and 
peers within the environment to do it on a proper way in 
which it can be accounted for later and not just sending 
money from left to right but to have a proper discussion in 
terms of which is the best way to channel payments in a 
proper way and then if the Hoefyster production order does 
arrive it could be handled appropriately and properly, 
20 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So am I right in this understanding of 
the 
approach 
that 
was 
adopted, 
because 
LMT 
was 
financially in some difficulty and there was a danger that 
continued 
supply 
from 
LMT 
for 
your 
very 
important 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 46 of 213 
 
Hoefyster project could be in danger due to their financial 
difficulties you and your colleagues agreed to structure the 
payments to them in a way which would go beyond what 
the contractual terms for payment were, it was really to 
assist them to get payment earlier than they might 
otherwise have got so that they did not collapse financially 
and then the supply to Denel would be in danger.  Is my 
understanding correct, Mr Knoetze? 
MR KNOETZE:   It is correct, Chair, with also – just a little 
bit to add to that is, and during this discussions having the 
10 
process of work on this approval and the upfront security 
of supply, the idea was also then when later when we get 
the – or parallel to getting the production order for 
Hoefyster of 10 billion, we need to secure an option to 
purchase then to also safeguard and put the security in 
place to actually execute the option agreement later on as 
specific purchasing whereby our money would be safe with 
the necessary securities to be put in place by that time 
also, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So is my understanding correct, 
20 
there were two ways that Denel identified as securing the 
supply to try and minimise the danger of financial collapse 
of LMT, the one was to restructure the arrangements so 
that it would get some money upfront, in advance, on the 
basis that we have already dealt with, at risk production 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 47 of 213 
 
order. 
 And 
the 
other 
was 
to 
purchase 
a 
majority 
shareholding in LMT itself, is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  Now if you look 
still at page 13, your paragraph 7.2, you deal with the 
discussions that took place in relation to the first payment 
had been to LMT to pay off Busisa and Bowden, which we 
have discussed already, it says that yourself and Mr 
Teubes had discussions with Mr Burger to explore the 
option of a first payment to be made before the end of April 
10 
2010.  Now is it correct that you and Mr Teubes together 
with Mr Burger played in a leading role in relation to this 
arrangement for early payment of LMT to try and help it out 
of its financial difficulties? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair, but as I also stated 
somewhere in my affidavit that we always kept the 
management team part of this discussions and it was really 
deliberations at our management team but we also involved 
definitely the legal person in DLS at that point in time, as 
well as the legal and planning executives from the 
20 
corporate office continuously, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  In fact, I understand 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, Chair? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 48 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we have just gone by two minutes 
past the tea break.  Shall we take the tea break now? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea break and resume at 
twenty five to twelve. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Knoetze, are 
you able to hear us? 
MR KNOETZE:   I can, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Can I take you to page – 
Mr Knoetze, I understand that there was one annexure that 
was not fixed up through your supplementary affidavit but 
has now being fixed up.  If I can take you to what Mr 
Kunene has sent you, I understand.  It is the board 
meeting extract from the 15 April 2010 that is referred to in 
your affidavit and I understand, Chair, that it has been sent 
20 
to the witness and now appears at page 52.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KNOETZE:   Sorry, Chair, is that the board meeting of 
– Chair, board meeting of when? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   15 April 2010. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 49 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   15 April 2010. 
MR KNOETZE:   As yet, until today, I have not seen that, I 
have requested it from Denel previously, Chair, but I have 
not seen - the recollection I had in my affidavit is what I 
could remember or recall from those meetings but I have 
not seen it until today.  I have requested for it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Have you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Have 
you 
received 
it 
from 
the 
Commission now? 
MR KNOETZE:   I have not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have not received it? 
MR KNOETZE:   No, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, I have been told it has been 
sent to the witness, perhaps it has not come through the 
email yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But perhaps, Mr Knoetze, will you 
please after the hearing – may I suggest this Chair, subject 
to your guidance? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I suggest to you, Mr Knoetze, 
that after the hearing you go through what has just been 
recently to you by email and just confirm that what has 
been sent to you is in fact the minutes of that board 
meeting of the 15 April 2010 and if it is correct then you do 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 50 of 213 
 
not need to come back to – well, perhaps you should email 
the legal team and say yes, I confirm that what Mr Kunene 
has sent me is in fact the correct document.  If it is not, if 
you can tell us, please, and then we will have it corrected.  
Chair, I hope that that will be in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be in order but I see that it is 
really what, three pages? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I think it is four or five pages, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it seems that the substantive page is 
10 
only actually one – can I say substantively a full page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may be that depending on where we 
will be by lunchtime, it may be that it might be convenient 
if during the lunch break he has a look at it, when we come 
back he confirms or whatever. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or if we finish with him much earlier 
maybe if we take five minutes, seven minutes, he can look 
at it and we come back and he can confirm and then he is 
20 
done. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair, that should 
work well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 51 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, Mr Knoetze, when you are 
finished with your evidence if you can just look at what has 
been sent just to confirm and we will be in touch with you 
as well during that period.  You may have to come back 
online today just for a minute or so to tell the Chairperson 
that this is the document that you were referring to in your 
affidavit.  Is that okay? 
MR KNOETZE:   It is correct with me, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Fine, thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you.  Now I would like 
to go back, if I may, to the discussion we were having 
about the prepayments to LMT and the reason why these 
were made.  Was it appropriate and was it regular – was it 
in accordance with the law and with the processes at 
Denel, as you understood them, to make an early payment 
to LMT earlier than what it was entitled to in terms of the 
contract or order so that you could assist it in its financial 
difficulties? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, if in this case on the delegation of 
authority it was quite clear after having discussions with 
the board members and Mr Fukile Mhlontlo and Mr Tully, it 
was quite clear that in the case of a work and risk approval 
for a situation like this that is order in advance of receiving 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 52 of 213 
 
a sales order for a contract like Hoefyster, the requirement 
or the condition would be that they needed to be then 
specifically securities in place to cover the company or to 
protect the company if the supplier or, in this case, LMT 
would go down and it was accepted and it was a delegation 
of authority that was within the DLS board mandate on 
operational matters to go through this way of prepayment 
but with proper securities like we have done for the 
different payments to LMT, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you discuss the risks that were 
10 
attached to the early payment that was made?  Did you 
discuss that with your colleagues on Exco, the financial 
risks that there may have been? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair, in actual fact we had various 
discussions on the different risks as is also – can be seen 
from the 7 May 2010 minutes of the DLS board meeting but 
we also had discussions - when the due diligence was done 
by KPMG, it was presentations made by KPMG to diverse 
team from DLS and from corporate office and DCO meaning 
the legal people were presented and/or present and also 
20 
the financial people from DCO to understand that situation 
around LMT and the risk involved so that we take an 
informed decision with management in that regard, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I take you in the papers to page 
89?   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 53 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   89, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now am I correct in understanding 
that what follows from page 89 is a report from KPMG. 
MR KNOETZE:   Just to make sure, are we on 39 or 89? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   89, sorry, 89. 
MR KNOETZE:   I am just going to go to 89.  It is correct,  
Chair, it is the KPMG – one of the reports from KPMG that 
was given to Denel on our integrated meetings on the 
finances, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, on your integrated what? 
10 
MR KNOETZE:   When we discussed and requested KPMG 
to do the financial due diligence, they have to make 
presentations to a multi-functional team of DLS and DCO 
and this was the report that was presented to all of the 
people 
that 
was 
present 
in 
the 
meetings 
when 
we 
discussed the different points from KPMG, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was this a due diligence report 
prepared by KPMG at the request of Denel to check the 
due diligence of LMT to see whether it was suitable to have 
its majority shareholding purchased by Denel? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  And do you agree that the 
KPMG report in fact identified a number of factors, a 
number of issues that were of some concern in relation to 
the financial strength of LMT. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 54 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   For example, they identified concern 
that there had been a distortion of gross profitability and 
as a result one could not rely on the reported profitability.  
Are you aware of that? 
MR KNOETZE:   That was mentioned, Chair, and that was 
where we had various discussions on how we could get 
involved to understand the financials better to make sure 
we take an informed decision, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and then they referred to a 
10 
prepayment from Denel of 14.5 million and another 1.2 
million from Patria.  They dealt with that.  Was there in fact 
14.5 million made as a prepayment by Denel? 
MR KNOETZE:   None, Chair.  I assume that could be VAT 
included maybe on the 12.7, it could be the VAT portion, 
Chair.  I am not sure, it could be the VAT portion included. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see, yes.  And they identified 
concern that this was included in LMT’s books as being 
deferred income.  You are aware of that? 
MR KNOETZE:   I cannot recall that, Chair, I am sorry, no, 
20 
I cannot recall. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And they also identified a 
concern that LMT would require a capital injection of at 
least R43.4 million. 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct, Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 55 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  I am sorry, Chair, may I just 
have a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  So, Mr Knoetze, these 
concerns that you acknowledge were put in the due 
diligence report by KPMG, surely they raised some alarm 
bells on your part as Chief Financial Officer at that time of 
DLS, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And, nonetheless, you approved and 
10 
motivated – sorry, you recommended, rather, for approval 
the purchase by Denel of a majority shareholding in LMT. 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, just a correction on that.  I was 
mostly involved directly in the prepayment and the work on 
risk specific order which was investigated by or requested 
by 
the 
team 
but 
specifically 
on 
the 
51% 
option 
shareholding I was part of – only one person as part of a 
much bigger team than actually made the decision to 
acquire the option and to execute the option later on that 
had to follow a total different process which had to go to 
20 
Denel board and to the minister for approval, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I certainly accept, Mr Knoetze, 
that you were not the only person and in fact you did not 
have the power at your level to make any final decision on 
the purchase of those shares in LMT, correct? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 56 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   It is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you did play a role in looking into 
the financial strength of LMT, not so? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was for purposes of 
considering whether it was a good idea from a business 
and financial risk point of view for Denel to purchase the 
majority shareholding, is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you in fact, I understand, in fact 
10 
signed the letter of engagement with KPMG for them to do 
the due diligence report, is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:   It is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I understand that Investec were also 
involved 
as 
transaction 
advisers 
for 
purpose 
of 
the 
transaction for the purchase of the LMT shareholding, is 
that right? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And were you involvement in the 
appointment of Investec then for that role? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   As far as I can recall, Chair, the Investec 
had gone through a supply chain process at DLS and within 
that process we had present the legal team from DCO, the 
finance and also the different representatives from DLS 
and they were subsequently appointed as the advisers, 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 57 of 213 
 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now, I understand – you have 
told the Chairperson about why you felt at the time that the 
advance payments of about R12 million were LMT was 
justified and the risks were properly addressed but later – 
have you now, as you sit now, giving evidence before the 
Learned Chairperson of the Commission, you now feel that 
in retrospect, with hindsight, it was actually a good 
acquisition 
for 
Denel 
to 
have 
purchased 
a 
majority 
shareholding in LMT from a financial point of view?  
10 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, if I was in the same position today 
as I was at that time with all the evidence in front of me, 
with all the advice I had from Investec, my peers, my 
supervisors, the DCO specialist in terms of the strategy of 
Denel and DLS going forward, the execution of a R10 
billion contract with subsequent penalties for – and starting 
off with the late delivery which would be ten times or more 
worse than having invested some money in a critical 
strategic supplier I will probably do the same and make the 
same decision today, Chair.   
20 
 
And then, secondly, I think if Denel had thereafter, 
after acquiring the option or acquiring the 51%, Chair, have 
done what we needed to do in terms of proper integration 
and management of the integrated facilities and what 
needed to be done, like we envisaged, I think it would have 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 58 of 213 
 
been a big success story forever thereafter.  That is my 
current statement on that, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But that in fact did not happen, did 
it?  LMT has actually continued to struggle, not so? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, difficult to say.  I got less involved 
after the PFMA approval, they were still a business, they 
were operating, they were doing – they were actually 
keeping their orders in the years 2012/’13 but I got much 
less involved and when the integration took place and the 
option was then acquired or executed, the integration took 
10 
place at DCO and it was subsequently managed from 
thereon further.  So my involvement was very, very less 
thereafter after the acquisition, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I take you in your affidavit to 
page 25?   
MR KNOETZE:   I am just quickly going to 25, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have that?  Do you have that, 
Mr Knoetze?  
MR KNOETZE:   I am almost there, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You say in 12.1 under the heading: 
“How was the prepayment used by LMT?  The R12.7 
million prepayment was a decision by the DLS 
board as an at risk production order placed on LMT 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 59 of 213 
 
to ensure security of supply on the Hoefyster 
contract.” 
Now the DLS board is different from the Exco, is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you sitting on the DLS board at 
this time? 
MR KNOETZE:   I was, Chair., 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In your capacity as Chief Financial 
Officer you sat on the board, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I understand that at the level of Exco 
you – sorry, Mr Burger your CEO and yourself as CFO and 
Mr Teubes as your co-executive, you were really the main 
players, as it were, on Exco, is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct, Chair, and probably 
because of our interaction as this was the three of us who 
were representing the management team at the board level 
of board meetings as invitees. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So am I correct in 
understanding you played a leading role along with the two 
20 
other men that I have just mentioned in taking the decision 
to recommend to the board that this advance payment be 
approved? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct?  And then you sat on the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 60 of 213 
 
board itself that then did approve the transaction, is that 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Teubes, was he also sitting 
on the board at the time? 
MR KNOETZE:   As an invitee, as far as I can remember, 
correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Burger was too, not so? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then at page 26 your 
10 
affidavit refers in paragraph 12.3 to the cash injection how 
it was used by LMT.  It was used to pay their creditors and 
to fund current operations for maximum production, is that 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is how LMT used the payments.  
Would you agree that if LMT had not been facing serious 
financial difficulties you would have not arranged the R12 
million advance payments.  The only reason why you were 
making available the 12 million upfront as an advance 
20 
payment, the so-called advance payment was because they 
were in financial difficulties.  If they had not been in 
financial difficulties there would have been no need to pay 
them the 12 million, is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair, the main objective was that we 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 61 of 213 
 
needed to have a sustainable business in them to be able 
to protect the IP that was vested in them and to have the 
security of supply and for that reason I was requested by 
not just the management team and the CEO of DLS but 
also 
by 
DCO 
and 
the 
board 
members 
after 
careful 
discussions and considerations to get involved and to 
determine the risk associated with this and the payment 
was merely a method of getting to the ultimate objective 
that we needed to get for security of supply.  That was the 
main objective all the way along, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   if I understand your correctly and 
please correct me if I am wrong, because I understand it, 
when it became apparent that LMT was in financial 
difficulties there was a concern on the part of head office 
and DLS management that if LMT fails financially because 
of its wider financial problems, then we are at risk, 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And one of those risks would be an 
IP risk, correct, and intellectual property risk, correct? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And other risks too.  There would be 
a continuity of supply.  There would be an interruption in 
supply problem, not so?  Is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 62 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But if they had been financially 
strong and at no risk of financial collapse, these concerns 
about interrupting supply and intellectual property would 
not have arisen, not so? 
MR KNOETZE:   Most probably, Chair, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  Chair, may I just 
have a moment to confer with my team? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you, Chair.  Just a few 
questions, if I may, just to conclude your evidence, Mr 
10 
Knoetze.  Can I take you in your affidavit – just find the 
page – yes, it is at page 10, zero one zero. 
MR KNOETZE:   Going, Chair, to page 10.  Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I would like to just read into the 
record a paragraph or two of your affidavit so we get the 
context.  You are here dealing with the advance payment to 
LMT.  In 6.15 you say: 
“The whole process of placing an order on LMT was 
discussed with Mr Morris.” 
It is the same Mr Morris you mentioned earlier, is that 
20 
right? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Mhlontlo, he was then Chief 
Financial Officer of the group at head office level, is that 
right? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 63 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
As 
is 
evident 
through 
communications – and you refer to annexures. 
“Mr 
Morris 
was 
comfortable 
with 
the 
process 
followed.” 
Mr Morris was the strategy PFMA compliance and equity 
transaction specialist.  That was also at head office, 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then it says: 
10 
“He worked with DPE.” 
That is the Department of Public Enterprises, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   As far as I can recall, that he was his – he 
was at DPE previously. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So he had been there for many 
years, your affidavit says.   
MR KNOETZE:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And he made it clear and here I am 
reading in 6.16: 
“Mr Morris made it clear that the LMT prepayment 
20 
was to be secured with LMT assets and not only the 
share option.  He also separated the two matters or 
the order placements and the exercise of the share 
option.  He made it clear in his email that there is 
no PFMA process that needs to be followed for the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 64 of 213 
 
placement of the R51 million at risk order on LMT 
and its subsequent prepayment and that it is a 
matter that can be dealt with by the DLS board.  
The exercise of the share option was a different 
matter and further due diligence needed to be done 
according to him and that Denel board approval and 
PFMA approval was needed in this regard.” 
That is the share option part.  But the prepayment, the at 
risk order placement you say he said you did not need to – 
you had no difficulties in relation to the PFMA, is that 
10 
right? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There is no PFMA process.  Now 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second?  Where you say in 
that paragraph, namely 6.16, at the end thereof, you said: 
“The exercise of the share option was a different 
matter and further due diligence needed to be done 
according to him and that Denel board approval and 
PFMA approval was needed in this regard.” 
20 
Is that approval meant to be process because if it is meant 
to be approval, I would like to know whose approval would 
it have been. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Mr Knoetze, 
at the end of paragraph 6.17 you refer to approvals being 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 65 of 213 
 
required for the share option part.  Do you see that, right 
at the end of 6.16? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you said that according to him, 
that is Denel – sorry, Morris, according to him: 
“..that Denel board approval and PFMA approval 
was needed in this regard” 
Now Denel board approval we understand but who would 
have to give approval under the PFMA? 
MR 
KNOETZE:   Chair, as stipulated previously or 
10 
discussed, the work on risk approval was separate process 
that had to be dealt with at DLS board and with interaction 
with all the different representatives from the group but 
specifically on – stating in 6.17, the option and specifically 
the exercising of the option was a PFMA approval that had 
to go to the Denel – not DLS but Denel board with proper 
presentation and then an application thereafter to DPE or 
the minister for a formal ministerial approval before the 
option can be executed to acquire the 51% shareholding, 
Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So that – sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that the reference to 
approval in that last line of paragraph 6.17 was intended 
by you, as you understood what Mr Morris said, was 
intended to refer to approval, not process?  Can you see 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 66 of 213 
 
the last line of paragraph 6.16? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair, that was revealed to us by Mr 
Morris specifically since he has been aware – he was 
aware of the process that had to be followed on Denel 
board, after approvals, on delegations as well as the PFMA 
approval that was in his opinion the way to go ahead in the 
formal approval of that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And- that PFMA well the first thing that 
attracted my attention to that last part of paragraph 6, 
point 16 is that earlier in the paragraph you said Mr Morris 
10 
said there was no PFMA process that needed to be 
followed for the placement of the R51million at risk order 
on LMT and its subsequent pre-payment.   Is that, is what 
you are talking about in that last line as PFMA approval, 
does it not relate to the same transaction, because if it 
does it would seem to create some inconsistency between 
what you understood Mr Morris to say because if there was 
no PFMA process needed there could not be any PFMA 
approval required I would imagine. 
 
Did you understand what I say, you understand? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair the paragraph should be read in two 
parts of two different processes as the first part which I 
referred to as the R51million risk and order with the 
appropriate or the subsequent pre-payment of R12.7million 
was on the delegation of authority no Denel Board 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 67 of 213 
 
approval, no PFMA process and could be decided and 
approved by the DLS Board with interaction from all the 
different stakeholders on DCO.   
That was not linked and actually two total separate 
processes although they could rank parallel it was a total 
separate process that could be approved on DLS Board 
level to put the risk on order and also to make the pre-
payments.  The second portion which is the last part, the 
latter part of 6.16 refers specifically to the options 
specifically 
the 
51% 
shareholding 
option 
which 
was 
10 
altogether a total different process because what needs to 
happen there is there needs to be a proper motivation to 
the Denel Board and recommended to the Denel Board to 
be approved by the Denel Board to go to the Minister that 
needs to give a formal approval but specifically under 
share option agreement to be executed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see I understand all of that but only 
if you go up to Denel approval before and PFMA approval 
was needed in this regard actually of course I am not an 
expert of PFMA but it sounds odd to me that for in regard 
20 
to exercising a share option you would need PFMA 
processes but I maybe misunderstanding something.  I do 
not know Mr Kennedy is there something I am missing 
here?       
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There may be some requirement on 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 68 of 213 
 
the PFMA that Chair I do not propose to deal with that in 
cross examination with Mr…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there may be some requirement.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay 
Mr 
Knoetze 
so 
your 
understanding for – is that what Mr Morris said because it 
is what he said that you are relaying here is that what he 
said was that for the exercise of the share option one of 
the things that would be required is that what he referred 
to as PFMA approval, is that right? 
10 
MR KNOETZE:   That seems to be correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you yourself do you know what that 
is and under what provision it applies or is that something 
you do not know is not your understanding of what he 
said? 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair I was aware of the fact that buying 
of any shares, buying or selling of any shares within any 
transaction within Denel at that stage was definitely for 
sure a PFMA approval and that would be approved by the 
government and Department of Public Enterprise, Chair.     
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was your understanding that, what is 
referred to as PFMA approval related to approval by the 
relevant Minister?  
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, first of course it had to go through 
the Denel Board in my opinion for sure Denel Board had to 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 69 of 213 
 
approve or recommend them to the Minister for approval 
from the BEE side definitely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay now I think I may have come 
across some provision in relation to maybe Denel maybe in 
the application that was brought by the Denel Board 
against the then Minister of Finance Mr Gordhan I do not 
know if it was for Section 54 application.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I may have come across 
something that might indicate what you are saying.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no at least now I have an idea of 
what the PFMA approval the reference to PFMA approval 
may have been a reference to, thank you Mr Knoetze, 
thank you Mr Kennedy.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair Mr Knoetze for 
clarification you refer in your affidavit to an annexure 
which is an email from Mr Morris.  Can I ask you please to 
turn to page 38.  
MR KNOETZE:   Going to page 38, Chair.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  If I can take you on page 
38 the email in the middle of the page it comes from Mr 
John Morris dated 22 n d of April 2010 and it is addressed to 
you with copies to various other officials including Mr 
Teubes, Mr Mhlontlo, Mr Sadick and Mr Van Wyk and Mr 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 70 of 213 
 
Stefan Burger, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I just would like to read into the 
record the brief email if I may: 
“Thank you for the draft Board paper we have 
decided not to subject this to the Denel Board 
meeting on 4 May 2010 in line with your discussion 
with Fikile.” 
Now that is with Mr Mhlontlo, is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct Chair.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “The advanced payments to LMT  
needs to be secured by adequate LMT assets which 
are currently unsecured.  This is something we 
would want to see at the DLS Board meeting next 
week and your paper will be useful for that meeting. 
I believe that this mechanism identified by Fikile 
will enable DLS to achieve its objectives.” 
So he was saying it would need to go to the DLS Board but 
only subject to assets of LMT being becoming secured in 
order to secure assets to minimise the risk of advanced 
20 
payments, is that right?       
MR KNOETZE:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then he continues: 
“Regarding the share option this will only be 
exercised subject to an in-depth due diligence on 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 71 of 213 
 
LMT.” 
Now that is what was done by KPMG, correct?    
MR KNOETZE:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct, and they indicated the 
consequences…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you confirm Mr Knoetze, did you 
confirm? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay you will just need to speak up 
a bit so that we can hear and also the recoding can 
10 
capture what you say.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just bear that in mind when you 
speak I could see your nodding very clearly but your voice 
was very soft then just please just bear in mind the Chairs 
guidance.  And then to continue: 
“We would obtain Board and PFMA approval in this 
regard.” 
This regard being the share option.  So he is referring 
there to the Board of what, of DLS or to the main Board of 
Denel? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   That was the Denel Board, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The Denel Board at head office, 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And also PFMA approval, is that 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 72 of 213 
 
right? 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But only in relation to the share 
option portion not the advanced payment issue because 
that was in terms of the delegation you referred to subject 
to DLS Board approval not head office Board approval and 
not PFMA approval, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I just have a moment to confer 
with my colleague.  I just want to take you now to what you 
10 
say in your affidavit it is page 11.   
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Paragraph 6.17 you say: 
“At some point Mr Mhlontlo also said that this at 
risk procurement order with the pre-payment of 
R12.7million should be dealt with at the DLS Board 
level because it is an operational matter.  The 
option to acquire shares was meant to serve as 
security for this at risk procurement order.” 
 Is that what he told you?     
20 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And in fact you then referred to 
Annexure PK05 and if I can take you to that document you 
will find it at page 49, four nine.    
MR KNOETZE:   I am going to page 49 Chair, go ahead 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 73 of 213 
 
Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Is that an email from Mr Mhlontlo on 
which you rely for the advice that you just referred to in 
your affidavit? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now if you can turn to page 
13 again in your affidavit.   
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You referred to a special meeting of 
the DLS Board held on the 7 t h of May 2010 where you say 
10 
Mr Taliep Sadick the Denel Group CEO was present 
amongst others present was Mr Fikile Mhlontlo, Group CFO 
and Mr John Morris the strategic PFMA compliance and 
equity specialist and then you referred to an annexure and 
if I can ask you to look down now to Annexure PK07, I will 
get you the page number in a moment, so it I 53, 54 is that 
correct?     
MR KNOETZE:   52, 53.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, 53 in fact 54 is when the actual 
body of the minutes is reproduced, correct? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it shows the individuals present 
to 
include 
yourself, 
is 
that 
right? 
Management 
representatives together with Mr Burger, Mr Naidoo and Mr 
Teubes, correct?  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 74 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then at page 55 that deals in 
paragraph 4.1 with the option on strategic sourcing of a 
vehicle capability that is referring to LMT, is that right?  
MR KNOETZE:   It is correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, and it appears that initially 
what was discussed was that Denel would acquire 70% 
ultimately what was decided upon was a 51% purchase, is 
that right? 
MR KNOETZE:   That is correct Chair.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And there was also reference made 
to the R12.7million as a pre-payment, correct?   
MR KNOETZE:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the intention there was to give 
some short term alleviation of the financial challenges that 
LMT was experiencing so this was to try and assist it in its 
time of financial need, correct?   
MR KNOETZE:   Correct Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you refer – it appears from your 
affidavit that Mr Mhlontlo asked you about the financial 
20 
status of LMT and you explained creditors and debtor ’s 
balances 
were 
R17million 
for 
the 
creditors 
and 
for 
R14million for the debtors and LMT would be using the DLS 
and debtor ’s payments to get projects going and to pay its 
creditors.   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 75 of 213 
 
You also said that the LMT overdraft was going to 
improve.  It does seem that although you felt that things 
could be saved at LMT you and your colleagues were going 
into the decision to purchase the 51% shareholding in LMT 
with your eyes wide open you were aware that LMT was 
financially under huge strain, correct?     
MR KNOETZE:   Chair at that point when they had various 
discussions at the different Board levels and interactions 
with management and DCO it was felt that for this amount 
of money to flow to LMT to take them out of the short term 
10 
crisis, short to medium term we should have at least an 
option to purchase as security together with the different 
securities for the different payments that you also had to 
obtain.  So in my opinion that was more from a request for 
sure that we have securities in case something goes wrong 
with LMT that was one of the biggest intentions of the 
options and it was requested specifically by management 
to have that in place Chair.     
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and if we can look again at the 
minutes at page 55.  
20 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That reflects the discussion which 
includes some of the points that I have already summarised 
about the creditors and debtors and so forth.  If I can ask 
you, please go to page 56.    
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 76 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The second line: 
 “Mr Knoetze reported that the overdraft facility of 
LMT 
has 
been 
reduced 
from 
R12.8million 
to 
R10million currently and it is anticipated to be 
R9million soon the cash requirement will keep 
LMT’s overdraft at this level and improving towards 
July and August 2010.” 
The cash requirement was that the upfront payments the 
R12.7million earlier?      
10 
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, that was the cash R12.7million Chair 
as well as different opportunities that they had to improve 
there also from their own side the overdraft facility, Chair.      
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and then it continues: 
“Mr Teubes also explained the reason why the stock 
that was written off was bought as this was the 
assignable cause for the cash strain in LMT.” 
 Then the minutes of your meeting say as follows: 
“The 
meeting 
discussed 
the 
mitigations 
on 
paragraph 2.3.1 of the proposal.” 
20 
And the proposals in fact attach to the minute:  
“Mr Burger explained that this is not a risk free 
decision that management will endeavour to put 
controls in place to improve the business situation 
specifically with respect to their financial affairs.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 77 of 213 
 
The 
meeting 
decided 
that 
even 
more 
stricter 
controls should be put in place to get the company 
out of the current dilemma.” 
The current dilemma is LMT’s current financial dilemma, 
not so?        
MR KNOETZE:   Correct, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:    
“The legal share option agreement should have tight 
control over the company with respect to process 
improvements technical and financial control and 
10 
management control.”  
MR KNOETZE:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then there is the next paragraph 
I will skip that is dealing with certain visits that were to 
take place and the following two the foot of the page: 
“The approval process from DPE of acquiring the 
70% shares from LMT could take long and therefore 
this option agreement will be valid for three years 
the process is to running comparisons with the 
equity selling process.” 
20 
Then we have various other discussions about the risk and 
drawback clause of 5 to 10% etcetera and then the second 
last paragraph on page 57, are you there?      
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The second last paragraph says: 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 78 of 213 
 
“Mr Knoetze gave his full support to the commitment 
of the Board to make this agreement work.”     
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now the previous paragraph I should 
have started there: 
“Mr Palatsi went around the table to get everyone’s 
final input to the proposal.  Every member supports 
this proposal with the conditions relevant to this to 
protect Denel.  Mr 
Mhlontlo reported that he 
supported this as long as the risks as indicated are 
10 
mitigated as discussed.” 
Now do you believe that those risks were in fact mitigated 
as they were discussed?    
MR KNOETZE:   Yes, Chair I believe so through all the 
different security assets and stock that we had to secure to 
make sure we were – it was not risk free we did exactly 
that Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now may I just ask you a few 
questions in conclusion and I will then ask the Chair for an 
opportunity just to caucus with my team just to see if there 
20 
is anything further and we still have the issue of the 
annexure to sort out over the lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes maybe when you caucus with your 
team he could take this opportunity to have a look at that 
annexure and maybe when you are finished he might be 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 79 of 213 
 
finished and then you cover that as well.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If that is possible, yes thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is short it should be possible.   
MR KNOETZE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Knoetze were you still in a 
position a senior position at Denel when contracts were 
awarded to VR Laser?   
MR KNOETZE:   Chair I was not much involved in VR Laser 
discussions or contracts of any sorts.  We did from time to 
10 
time at the management meeting of course had discussions 
with regards to contracts and follow up contracts and 
possible future business but I was personally not very 
much involved in the VR Laser process and contracting of 
that at all Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I understand that and in fact you 
indicated as much in your affidavit to.  Did you have any 
understanding when LMT was being acquired or the 
majority shareholding was being acquired by Denel.  Did 
you have any discussions with your colleagues at EXCO or 
20 
Board level as to whether LMT now that it would be subject 
to the majority shareholding held by Denel would now be 
given preferential treatment in the award of any further 
business for which it was qualified because it would be as 
it is an in-house group entity?    
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 80 of 213 
 
MR KNOETZE:   Chair not specifically but in my opinion it 
would have been proper consideration to have, it was to be 
in-house and if there is an option agreement it would have 
had to receive preferential treatment as a specific supplier 
if the option agreement was not acquired yet, Chair.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it would have been given special 
treatment if it was in-house? 
MR KNOETZE:   I would believe so and I think the policy 
also is stipulated as far as I can recall Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and the policy that you refer to 
10 
though says: 
“There can be a deviation from that if there is a 
good reason from a business point of view for going 
outside the group rather than keep it in-house and it 
would have to be sent to the group executive for 
supply chain management.” 
Who at that stage was Mr Mlambo.  Are you aware of that 
as part of the rule?  
MR KNOETZE:   Not that I was that part of the process but 
I think that was the norm if I recall correctly, Chair yes.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you but you were not 
involved directly in the process in which Mr Mlambo was 
asked for his approval or were you? 
MR KNOETZE:   No Chair not at all.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just have a brief moment to 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 81 of 213 
 
talk to my team.  
CHAIRPERSON:   For purposes of allowing him to have a 
look at the annexure shall I adjourn for five minutes?  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If you could thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let me give you that chance.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Knoetze I am going to adjourn for 
about five minutes or seven minutes to enable you to look 
at the annexure that you have not received earlier on when 
we talked about it and to enable Mr Kennedy to consult 
10 
with his team.  So when we come back I am sure you will 
be in a position to indicate whether you confirm the 
contents of that annexure.  So five or seven minutes or 
there about you will just let me know once you are ready.       
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair for that opportunity.  
20 
We managed to speak to Mr Knoetze and he has given clarity 
which I would like to place on record if we may? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In relation to this annexure and then we 
just have one or two final questions. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 82 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Knoetze thank you for assisting us 
earlier in the clarification.  Your affidavit – your main 
affidavit referred – wanted to refer to minutes as being 
attached as an annexure and that is the minutes of the board 
meeting of the 15 April 2010.  Is that correct? 
MR KNOETZE:  Correct Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you were hoping to get those 
minutes from Denel and if they had been obtained they 
would 
have 
been 
attached 
as 
annexures 
to 
your 
10 
supplementary affidavit, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you have indicated to me that you 
have asked for those minutes and not been provided with 
them.  If I can just place on record the advice that the legal 
team gave you recently which is that we have still not been 
given the minutes of that meeting from Denel.  They have 
indicated that they have problems in relation to some of their 
records so we still do not have those minutes to be able to 
give you Mr Knoetze or with respect to the Chair either – to 
20 
the commission. 
 
Now I am told Mr Knoetze and I want you to confirm 
this or correct it if it is wrong.  I am told that my colleagues 
in the legal team made available to the only documents that 
they were given in relation to this aspect and the board 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 83 of 213 
 
meeting on this date.  Can I take you in the bundle the latest 
version of electronic bundle that you have in front of you to 
page 52.1? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now can you identify the document that 
starts at page 52.1? 
MR KNOETZE:  It was the heading of a board meeting 
number 15; 15 April 2010 and if I read it correctly Chair I 
think this is the one that I – exactly the one that I referred to 
as a possible annexure to have been added which I could get 
10 
not hold of – the minutes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Now what is clear from page 52.1 
to 52.5 is that the minutes themselves are not included, 
correct? 
MR KNOETZE:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But what is the document?  Was this 
the presentation part of a slide – a slide presentation at the 
board meeting? 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Yes 
Chair 
it 
was 
one 
of 
the 
presentations that was made to the board Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And this dealt specifically with the 
issue concerned being the cooperation between DLS and 
LMT, is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:  It was one of the presentations yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And then at page 52.3 we see a 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 84 of 213 
 
status report on that topic with a signature and title of Mr 
Burger as Chief Executive Officer, correct? 
MR KNOETZE:  I do not see a signature – oh sorry Mr Chair 
I do see the signature on the page 52.3 of Mr Burger yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  And paragraph 1 
says: 
“The purpose of this submission is to seek 
approval 
regarding 
the 
recommendations 
tabled 
on 
the 
possible 
cooperation 
agreement between DLSA and LMT.” 
10 
And then paragraph 2 refers to the report as being attached 
and 3 seeks the board approval and the report – was that Mr 
Burger’s report from page 52.4 to 52.5? 
MR KNOETZE:  It was a management report.  It was a 
combination of inputs from management and in – as the 
tradition was in DLS and the Denel the CEO if there were 
anything that were presented to the board in this case the 
DLS board Mr Burger would have signed and it was under his 
signature yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  So did you give your input for 
20 
example at page 52.4 under the heading Financial Analysis? 
MR KNOETZE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then near the end of that 
paragraph under the heading Financial Analysis three lines 
from the bottom it says: 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 85 of 213 
 
“A cash flow analysis however indicates that this is a short 
term problem.  To solve this problem LMT has to acquire 
additional cash in April.  It appears that a cash injection of 
R10 million will solve their short term problem.” 
Is that the basis on which the recommendation was made to 
go 
ahead 
with 
approval 
of 
the 
12.7 
million 
advance 
payment? 
MR KNOETZE:  That is correct Chair.  Just to add to that it 
was seen as a very more short to maybe medium term but 
short term solution.  There were also talks of additional 
10 
capital investment and IDC funding to be acquired which 
they were busy regularly to acquire IDC support and also 
then possible other equity partners or option agreements 
with other shareholding as well in future Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  If I might just have a moment 
Chair?  Yes.  Now in relation to the acquisition of the 
majority shares in LMT when you were discussing with your 
colleagues at the level of EXCO or the DLS board did you 
have a discussion as to what role DLS would be expected to 
play in the future management of LMT?  In other words you 
20 
were now going to – your company – your group was going 
to buy the majority shareholding in LMT who was going to 
control the management? 
MR KNOETZE:  Chair the opinion of management as an 
integrated approach was that the capabilities of DLS and 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 86 of 213 
 
specifically the strategic capabilities of LMT should be 
incorporated into under one roof and integrated within one 
organisation.  Which meant that over time our idea was to 
make sure that where there were synergies between the two 
companies that it gets properly integrated and in all 
probability then integrated under the management in future 
of DLS that was the objection or the thinking at that point in 
time Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And was that discussed to your 
knowledge with LMT’s then owners as to how it would – how 
10 
it would be managed after the acquisition? 
MR KNOETZE:  I think some of the – Chair sorry to you – I 
think some of these discussions did take place between Mr 
Burger specifically and Mr – Dr Stephan Nell who was the 
CEO of LMT and in my opinion I – if I can recall or I can 
relate I think there were some discussions with that – with 
regards to that yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Were you aware of any change in 
thinking at any stage that initially it was intended that DLS 
would run the management of LMT but later it transpired that 
20 
in fact DLS would not take an active role in that? 
MR KNOETZE:  Chair I was not at that time – up to – close 
to up to the point where the PFMA approval was sought and 
also [00:08:52] approval was given I was still under the 
impression and from – on the view from the view that that 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 87 of 213 
 
would have been the way going forward until and up to the 
process where the integration took place at DCO and then it 
was a different reporting specifically then from the LMT as a 
supplier directly into DCO and obviously that was maybe the 
thinking of the leaders at that point in time but ja that was as 
far as I can remember Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now I would like to move to page 49. 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  49 appears to be an email from Mr 
Mhlontlo to yourself with various others copied in, correct 
10 
and that was date the 22 April 2010?  And Mr Mhlontlo says 
this – I am just going to read a few lines if I may Chair from 
the relevant portions.  He says: 
“Dear All yesterday I was taken through the 
DLS management proposal. Some key points 
based on DLS management are: 
DLS intends placing an order of R52 million 
and pay R12 million upfront to LMT for turret 
hulls needed in Hoefyster production phase.  
The upfront payment could be scaled down 
20 
but 
not 
less 
than 
R4 
million 
initially 
etcetera.” 
And then he refers to various other concerns about the 
Hoefyster production phase not being confirmed and then the 
issue of security etcetera.  And then he says – after all the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 88 of 213 
 
bullet points he says: 
“Response 
the 
proposal 
cannot 
be 
implemented 
as 
proposed 
by 
DLS 
management particularly considering the DLS 
dealing 
with 
public 
funds 
and 
other 
considerations becomes relevant.  Relevant 
aspects are production at risk in a division 
decision up to a set limited referenced down 
to delegation of authority document.  The 
division 
or 
division 
board 
will 
have 
to 
10 
consider all pertinent aspects including but 
not limited to the fact Hoefyster has not been 
secured to date.  Pre-payments are divisional 
considerations and are not specifically dealt 
with in the delegation of authority.  Payment 
risk 
identified 
needs 
to 
be 
mitigated 
adequately as the current proposal security 
is weak.  Sorry the current proposed security 
is weak and cannot be acceptable.  DLS 
would need to have a valid guarantee or 
20 
securities or attach LMT assets IP and other 
key systems rand for rand etcetera.” 
And he continues to set out various other concerns that he 
has.  So the bottom line of Mr Mhlontlo’s email seems to be 
that he cannot accept the – the proposal that was being put 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 89 of 213 
 
forward because it would have meant too much risk to DLS 
and to the Denel group partly having bearing in mind that 
DLS is using – is dealing with public funds as a state owned 
entity.   
Now you received this email did you? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And how did you deal with it? 
MR KNOETZE:  Chair if I – I can take you to the annexures 
just before we go to the other annexures that I added.  After 
this specific mail from Mr Fikile Mhlontlo to everyone 
10 
involved in – you can see basically the biggest portion of 
Denel management I after the previous board meeting also 
after 15 April – 15 April 2010 where it was decided to go 
ahead and it was a DLS board meeting I arranged a meeting 
with Mr Fikile Mhlontlo and we discussed all these different 
conditions before we could go ahead.  And as you quite 
rightly said Mr Fikile Mhlontlo was very correct in having 
certain specific securities and conditions to be in place 
which I had a discussion with him with all the related other 
parties previous – and in fact the previous mails that I have 
20 
attached between Investec, myself and Mr Morris and Mr 
Mhlontlo whereby we agreed the different conditions that had 
to be adhered to by Mr Mhlontlo and that was all put in place 
all the conditions relating to the paragraphs that you had 
mentioned.  The paragraphs relating to mitigated adequately 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 90 of 213 
 
in terms of all the other to be current for both securities 
which is LMT assets and IT and other key systems and after 
that discussion with Mr Mhlontlo we were then given the go 
ahead if all those conditions were in place and the mail of 
that is in the annexure that I can refer you to where it was 
said if all those are like the minutes of 7 May 2010 the same 
words from Mr Mhlontlo that he was happy if those 
conditions are met we can go ahead and it “stays”  in his 
words it stayed a DLS board risk decision and they have to 
apply their minds but he is happy if all securities have been 
10 
adhered to Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right may I just have a moment?  If we 
look at again at page 50 I took you to the …[speaking over 
one another].  Page 50. 
MR KNOETZE:  50 yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I took you through some of the earlier 
points but you see the last three solid bullet points you see 
starting taking the Group Financial position into account.  Do 
you see that? 
MR KNOETZE:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right let me read those three bullet 
points into the record if I may? 
“Taking the Group Financial position into account a lower 
amount and the gross amount proposed of R12 million will 
have to be considered.  Additional measures to protect 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 91 of 213 
 
company assets will need to be considered like DLS 
management accessing monthly accounts etcetera.  If limits 
are exceeded as delegated and or options – and or option is 
considered to be exercised the matter will need to be 
referred to the Denel board.  DLS board and its management 
take full responsibility for any issues that may arise positive 
or negative regarding this proposal.” 
Would you agree that those are quite serious concerns that 
you raised? 
MR KNOETZE:  It was Chair and for that specific reason I 
10 
had several discussions and interactions with respective 
board members and specifically with Mr Burger and I had 
with Investec detailed discussions which is referred to in the 
above annexures where Mr Mhlontlo eventually agreed to all 
the securities and on the minutes of 7 May 2010 I refer to 
again to minutes attached 7 May of 2010 which he agreed to 
that after all those securities have been put in place he will – 
he will be happy from his side with proceedings Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  Mr – Chair may we 
just deal with two final aspects?  I want to correct something 
20 
that I misunderstood earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In relation to why Mr Knoetze is – was 
not able to attend in person.  I thought he was a gentleman 
stuck in George.  In fact I am mixing him up with somebody 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 92 of 213 
 
else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry about that misunderstanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that one is a lawyer is it not? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one in George is a lawyer. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is quite correct.  Mr Knoetze just 
for the record you put in an application to be heard on a – in 
10 
a virtual platform on the computer line today.  I just want to 
correct and I am sorry that I made a mistake earlier.  I was 
confused.  You actually speaking to us from Pretoria East not 
so? 
MR KNOETZE:  I am in Centurion Pretoria. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Centurion right.  And I understand that 
there was a medical reason which you provided proof of to 
the legal team which has been forwarded to the Chairperson 
to indicate that there was a risk if you had to travel to 
Johannesburg today, is that correct? 
20 
MR KNOETZE:  Ja it is all medical related for Covid-19. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR KNOETZE:  Chronic risk. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR KNOETZE:  Chair yes. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 93 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay thank you for clarifying that.  And 
then the final issue of clarification I just want to confirm I 
think you indicated this earlier.  You have an MBA in 
Marketing.  As I understand it the B.Com is also – you also 
majored in Marketing is that right? 
MR KNOETZE:  It was a B.Com Marketing with related 
financial accounting subjects but the MBA is the general 
Masters in Business Administration correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you very much Mr Knoetze.  
Chair we have no further questions of this witness. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Knoetze for 
availing yourself to give evidence before the commission.  
We appreciate it.  Should we need you to come back we will 
ask you but for now you are excused.  Thank you very much. 
MR KNOETZE:  Thank you Chair much appreciated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  It is one o’clock so we will 
take the lunch adjournment. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And resume at two. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  As you please Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to talk about starting times for 
the rest of the week.  Does – how does it look like?  Does it 
look like we might need to start at nine – half past nine or 
earlier than normal and when would you like that to be?  I 
just want to see what mornings are available that I can give 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 94 of 213 
 
to – time for meetings with different sections of the 
commission who always want to see me about different 
things. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the priority is to make sure that we 
finish the Denel evidence this week. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but we would also from my side I am 
available to sit later than four o’clock on each day if 
necessary.  There might be a slight problem for Wednesday 
10 
this week because I may have promised Mr Seleka that we 
could in the evening session – we could have an evening 
session and do one short witness relating to Eskom.  But I 
am told by him that we might need only about thirty minutes 
certainly not more than an hour. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so if that were to happen that would 
simply deprive you of thirty minutes or one hour but 
otherwise we would use all the other time for an evening 
session if we need to use it. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for the other days there is no problem.  
Of course Friday is an exception. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday we 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 95 of 213 
 
can start – we can sit till late. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can start early if need be.  I know there 
is a section of the – of the commission that I have said they 
can see me tomorrow at half past eight.  I might have to 
change that if we start – if we decide to start at nine.  Or 
what is your situation? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair I would like to just confirm this 
with my colleagues but my understanding is that tomorrow is 
not – is not too problematic because we have had to shift 
10 
witnesses around and so forth and it looks like tomorrow will 
not take longer than the normal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will not need to start early? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So – no I think that if we start at ten 
tomorrow that should be fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I would like to check with my 
colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Wednesday I think in light of the 
20 
possible need to accommodate my learned friend Mr Seleka 
that might be an idea to start at nine because we have quite 
a – quite a number of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Witnesses to deal with then. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 96 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And I think Friday in order to – not to 
overrun. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We can start early on Friday at … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I just have a quick moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Yes thank you for that 
Chair.  My colleagues confirm that tomorrow should not be 
10 
an issue so we are happy to start at ten rather than nine.  
And you will then be able to see the other people at eight 
thirty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What they have suggested is we can 
ask your indulgence to start early at nine o’clock on 
Wednesday and Thursday and Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If that is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  And in terms of 
20 
evenings what is your – what is your assessment?  How 
much time or would it depend on each day how much time do 
you think we might use after four?  An hour – two hours? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I would think an hour.  We should – we 
should be able to finish by five o’clock latest. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 97 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  On those days if we starting at nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But it always depends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  A witness may take longer than we 
expect as has already happened today. 
MR KNOETZE:  No, no that is helpful enough.  So then 
tomorrow we will start at ten and go up to five but if we need 
to go beyond five we will go beyond five. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thursday we will start at nine go up to five 
if necessary – go beyond – beyond five.  And Friday we can 
start at nine as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  Let us adjourn for lunch 
and then we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   Do you then swear that the evidence you are 
about to give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth?  If so, please raise up you right hand and 
say, so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
SIPHO MKWANAZI:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see Mr Kennedy that this affidavit does 
seem to be an affidavit because there is a commissioner of 
oaths at the end. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, Chair.  I cannot hear you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  I am saying, I see that this does 
seem to be an affidavit because there is a commissioner of 
oaths at the end but it does not start the way an affidavit 
normally starts. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 99 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely:  I hereby state under oath. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but it is so okay.  I think he will 
confirm it under oath today. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, if may?  Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is just that these things - sometimes 
you never know if they will have any legal impact. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I will seek to 
10 
address that point.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, so just for the record.  May I 
just indicate that Mr Mkwanazi’s affidavit appears in Denel’s 
Bundle 07. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As Exhibit W19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair...  Sorry, may I just have a 
moment? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, the affidavit originally provided 
by Mr Mkwanazi had all the annexures referred to in his 
affidavit, including some extremely voluminous annexures 
which appeared to – my colleagues within the legal team, to 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 100 of 213 
 
be sometimes necessary, sometimes relevant but sometimes 
not.   
 
So in order to try and reduce the volume of documents 
but to still keep what was relevant, some documents, as the 
Index page indicates, have not been attached in the copy 
that serve before you Chair but they are available should 
they be required.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But does that mean there are some 
annexures that are being referred to in the affidavit of – in 
the affidavit but which are not attached to it? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, not attached in this copy.  Yes, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Some of it had been attached but 
simply in a form of extracts, although, originally, he gave us 
the entire document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So we – my learned colleague trimmed 
it down to just the relevant extract.  But in some cases, 
some documents, as will appear from the context, really do 
20 
not 
appear to 
be 
relevant for your 
purposes of the 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So my learned friend took the liberty of 
excluding those but they are available should they be 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 101 of 213 
 
required Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  What I am trying to 
establish is whether, when one reads the affidavit, one might 
think that an annexure is here but it actually is not here. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There is an index.  If I can take you to 
page 2 which – in which my learned colleague has – 
Anfred(?) has reflected in a note in the index what is 
attached and what is not or whether it is an extract.  So for 
example, if you see at page 2, Annexure A really comprises 
extracts, Annexure B.  It has not been attached.  And what 
10 
you will find then, is simply a page to that in the relevant 
order.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what will be necessary in addition 
to us mentioning in the index that a particular annexure is 
not attached, if it has not already been done, is that where 
the annexure is supposed to have been attached, where it is 
supposed to have appeared in the – among the annexures, 
there should be a note that is saying this annexure has been 
– has not been attached because if – it seems irrelevant.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I agree. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words, when somebody reads 
the affidavit, I want to know that if they come across an 
annexure and they think they want to see the annexures, 
when they go to the annexures, there must be something 
that tells them if it is not there. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 102 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Here is the reason why it is not there.  But 
obviously, any annexure that has not been included, which is 
not referred to in the affidavit, that is fine.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am only concerned about situations 
where the affidavit does refer to an annexure and maybe 
saying the annexure is attached but if you go to where you 
would expect it to be, you do not find it.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I am afraid that has not appeared 
10 
so far in this bundle but my learned friend will attend to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they can do that so that there is a 
page ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...which says this annexure has not been 
attached for reason A, B, C, D. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Alright.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So even with the exercise my learned 
friend has rather laboriously been able to do, to her credit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But the annexures that have to be 
before you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...are still fairly voluminous but there 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 103 of 213 
 
were many thousands of pages already and we wanted to 
spare you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Spare you that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  May I then put the 
formal questions to the witness to then lead up to my asking 
for leave to have it admitted? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
EXAMINATION BY ADVOCATE KENNEDY SC:   Good 
10 
afternoon, Mr Mkwanazi 
MR MKWANAZI:   Good afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have done the oath, right? 
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you for joining the Commission 
and assisting us as the legal team previously.  Is it correct 
that you have assisted the Commission previously by 
providing an affidavit? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, it is correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I can take you in this bundle, 
Denel 07 at page 003.  If you look at the page numbers on 
the top left, not the top right but the top left.  You go to... left 
three.  Do you have that?   
MR MKWANAZI:   [No audible reply]  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 104 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that the first page of your affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look at the black number, not the red 
numbers.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I...  And so you confirm this is 
your affidavit? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I can take you to page 24. 
MR MKWANAZI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have that? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I have got page 24. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  About half-way down there is a 
signature above the typed word deponent.  Is that your 
signature? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you sign this in front of a 
commissioner of oaths? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now, the Commissioner has 
signed and put in a rubberstamp below a notation that says:   
20 
“Thus sworn and signed before me at Pretoria the 
23rd of October 2020.   
The deponent has acknowledged that he knows and 
understands the contents of this affidavit.   
He has no objection to taking the prescribed oath 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 105 of 213 
 
which he considers binding on his conscience.” 
 
Did you, in fact, take the oath on that occasion? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the Learned Chair has already 
pointed out that the affidavit does not start with the normal 
few words that an affidavit introduces the affidavit.  But can I 
just ask you to confirm.   
 
I just remind you, you are under oath again now, having 
had the oath administered to you this afternoon by the 
Learned Chairperson’s registrar.  Do you confirm under oath 
10 
now that you are familiar with what is contained in this 
affidavit? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you confirm that you are satisfied 
that the content are true and correct as far as your 
knowledge goes? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  Chair, we would 
then ask formally for leave to introduce the affidavit of 
Mr Mkwanazi that appears in Denel Bundle 07 from page 3 
20 
with its annexures and that should be admitted as Exhibit 
W 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Mr Sipho Mkwanazi 
starting at page 3 is admitted as Exhibit W19. 
AFFIDAVIT OF MR SIPHO MKWANANZI IS ADMITTED AND 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 106 of 213 
 
MARKED AS EXHIBIT W19 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now Mr Mkwanazi, I 
am going to be brief as I can so that we do not spend too 
much time on detail that is all in your affidavit.  We do not 
have necessarily have to go into fully in oral evidence 
because your oral evidence will be focused on particular 
areas of interest to us.  You are currently employed...  If I 
may lead the witness on what should be non-controversial 
items Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You are currently employed by 
Armscor, is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And your current title?  Do you still 
hold the current title of acting Group Executive Acquisition 
and Supply Chain Management? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And how long have you been acting  in 
20 
that position? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Since 2015. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As Acting Group Executive? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And ...[intervenes]  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 107 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, acting since 2015? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, around 2015/2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is a long time of acting.  I guess 
that is not your fault.  [laughing] 
MR MKWANAZI:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what is your normal current job 
title apart from Acting Group Executive?  In other words, if 
you leave out the acting position, what is your normal 
appointment title? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am responsible for the Acquisition 
Department and Supply Chain Management. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Which is composed of a number of 
divisions in Acquisition starting from the landlord system 
right up to the aeronautics as well as the novel system and 
the common systems.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second.  Where the witness is, it 
is a little darker.  If there is a way of making it a little light.  
The relevant people can try and do that.  Yes, okay let us 
20 
continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can I just ask you Mr Mkwanazi?  
When you speak, just speak up clearly. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And try and sit fairly close to the mic.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 108 of 213 
 
And may I ask you to do something which may be a bit 
difficult but will help the Chair a great deal and also the 
recording.   
 
And that is, although I am going to be asking you most 
of the questions, the Chair may want to ask you his own 
questions at times.   
 
But even when I am asking you questions, can you try to 
direct your face and your voice towards the Chair?   
 
So rather look at the Chair and try and speak into the 
microphone rather than looking sideways as you are at the 
10 
moment.  If you can try and remember that. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And another advice, when you agree, a 
nod is not good because the recording machine will not 
record that.  So you need to say yes when you agree.  Okay 
let us continue.  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Right. 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair.  
Mr Mkwanazi, now in your affidavit you have set out your 
own involvement related to matters that are of interest to the 
20 
Commission and you deal first with a background and history 
relating to the Hoefyster Contract.   
 
If I can take you to page 4.  I am sorry, to page 6.  And 
that is your background section, dealing with the Hoefyster 
Project.   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 109 of 213 
 
 
The Chair has already heard some evidence about this.  
So it will be familiar to him.  But I would like you to just 
confirm in relation to Armscor and SANDF, my understand – 
and please correct me if I am wrong – is that Armscor is 
state-owned.  Is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it is...  Just explain what it is?  
What role it plays in relation to the National Defence Force 
and the Republic as a nation? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Armscor is an acquisition agent for the 
10 
Department of Defence  We do acquisition as well as the 
procurement on behalf of the Department of Defence on all 
their military requirements.  We do not do acquisition for 
common, you know, items.  Only anything that is military 
what we call Category 1 Military Equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is the difference between 
Armscor and Denel?   Because as I understand it, Denel’s 
existence is largely connected with the South African 
Defence Force as well, the National Defence Force. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Armscor is an acquisition agent.  Meaning, 
20 
that we do the procurement as well as the acquisition  While 
Denel is a state-owned company that does manufacturing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Manufacturing? 
MR MKWANAZI:   The manufacturing, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 110 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   So the relationship between us and then 
and they are our supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  You work closely together? 
MR MKWANAZI:   We work closely together as far as them 
being our supplier or service provider. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So most of the times when Armscor seek 
to acquire military  equipment of the South African National 
Defence Force, most of the times, Denel would feature? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair.  Denel would feature in terms 
of our order book ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   ...Denel is composed of about 42$ of my 
order book.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Thank you, Mr  
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Now, Mr Mkwanazi.  You 
deal in paragraph 4 with pre-contracting processes and you 
deal with a general process that has to be followed.  Is that 
in terms of Armscor own way of procuring. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair, under paragraph 4.  The first – the 
20 
part of that which is the required operational capability.  It is 
done by the SANDF.  That is when they state their 
requirement.  Then 4.2 which is the soft target.  It is also the 
Department of Defence.   
 
The above requirement is the Department of Defence but 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 111 of 213 
 
then our involvement also starts in that particular one where 
we start receiving the requirements from the Department of 
Defence.  And then we start with our process of doing 
acquisition. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you have focused in what follows, 
particularly on page 9.  You have dealt with the process that 
was followed specifically between Armscor and Denel Land 
Systems relating to the Hoefyster Project.   
 
And you refer to the first phase, Phase 1.  And there was 
to be a Phase 2 as well.  Can you tell the Chair please what 
10 
your own role was in relation to this procurement process for 
the Hoefyster Project? 
MR MKWANAZI:   For the first phase in terms of time when 
the whole process took place, right up to the process of 
placing the order, I was not participating.  I was not in the 
Department of Acquisition.  I only came to Acquisition around 
2006.  That is when I joined Acquisition.  And then meaning 
that I then start in 2006 when the project already now was in 
the process of being contracted.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you then also deal with the 
20 
Tarot Contract.  Were you involved in the procurement of 
Tarot Equipment? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I was not.  That was before my time.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So if we can take you, for 
example, to page 11.  You deal in paragraph 5 with the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 112 of 213 
 
request for offer for the so-called RFO Process.  And what 
does that relate to specifically? 
MR MKWANAZI:   A Request for Offer is when a tender is 
being sent out where it effectively says the Request for 
Offer.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you said that you were not 
involved until a certain stage at Armscor.  When you deal in 
this Request for Offer Process and here, of course, we are 
dealing with Armscor procuring from a supplier.  And we 
know, ultimately, it procured or awarded a contract for the 
10 
supply to Denel.  You refer to various options being explored 
in 5.2.  Were you part of that process? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I was not part of that process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So when you deal with this section, are 
you just dealing with your knowledge that you acquired after 
you joined Armscor?  You were not personally involved but 
you picked that knowledge up from other sources. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, that was mainly from the documents 
within the organisation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now you deal in paragraph 5.3 
20 
with the RFO having gone out and then you had a bid – and 
then Armscor had a Bidders Conference.  Would this be the 
sort of meeting when potential bidders are invited to come 
and attend a session with the entity, in this case Armscor, 
that wants to put out the tender. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 113 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you mentioned that some of the 
potential bidders raised concerns.  What did that relate to? 
MR MKWANAZI:   According to the documents, some of the 
suppliers raised a concern Chair that they could not gain 
access to some of the documents that they are required to 
be able to submit a tender. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what in particular were they 
concerned that they were not having access to? 
MR MKWANAZI:   They complained that when they required 
10 
the information that is within Denel, Denel refused to supply 
the information to them.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now there is a reference in these 
pages to data packs.  Are you aware of any concerns relating 
to data packs? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair.  The data packs will be the 
kind of information that was produced during the time when 
Denel was doing the concept phase of the tarot.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so some of the potential bidders 
were expressing concern that they were not having access to 
20 
data packs.  Is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  Yes, correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you understand from your 
investigation or form what information you had available to 
you, who was granted access to the data packs and who was 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 114 of 213 
 
not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   What transpired was the fact that Denel 
was in an exclusive agreement with the EX company which is 
a foreign company.  So as a result of that, Denel was not in 
a position now to disclose that information to other potential 
bidders.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it was an intellectual property 
issue? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It was the information that they require to 
be in a position to submit a tender. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Such as the data packs and some of the 
technical information that is required. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now Denel, we know ultimately, 
go the contract but you mention in your affidavit that 
ultimately only one offer – if you look at 5.4, notwithstanding 
the open-bid process, only one offer was received from 
Denel. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now Denel had the information.  If we 
20 
can go back to paragraph 5.4.  This is what it says.  If I may 
read it briefly into the record. 
“During the Bidders Conference, various potential 
bidders raised a concern that they did not have 
access to the data packs and information of the 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 115 of 213 
 
tariffs that have been developed by Denel during the 
concept stages.” 
 
So Denel had developed the actual concept.  Is that 
right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Denel was now one of the 
potential bidders, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you say: 
“The IP (The Intellectual Property) is jointly owned 
10 
by Armscor and Denel.  The matter was reported to 
the Board of Directors of Armscor who instructed 
that a letter be written to Denel, requesting them to 
avail 
the 
documents 
to 
potential 
bidders.  
Indications at that stage were that Denel had 
entered into an exclusive agreement with European 
Astronautic Defence and Space Company, EADS and 
Patria which included the data packs.” 
 
And then you proceed to say: 
“Notwithstanding the Open Bid Process, only one 
20 
offer was received form Denel.” 
 
Now your affidavit does not indicate whether Denel 
carried out the request or instruction that it should, as you 
put it, avail the documents to the potential bidders.   
 
You simply say that there were indications that Denel 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 116 of 213 
 
had an exclusive agreement relating to the data packs.  
What did you understand the outcome of the Armscor 
requested Denel to release the information to be?   
 
Did they release the information to other potential 
bidders? 
MR MKWANAZI:   From the look of things, it was not 
released Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was not...? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It was not released. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was not released? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did you, in fact, have information 
to the effect that gave an explanation as to why they did not 
release it? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I could not find the information.  Although, 
according to the information there was a letter that was 
written From Armscor to Denel requesting that Denel 
releases the information but I couldn't find any letter 
information that responded to that specific letter.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In other words, the response from the 
20 
now back to Armscor?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So on what basis do you say there 
were indications at that stage that Denel had entered into an 
exclusive agreement with EADS and Patria which included 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 117 of 213 
 
the data packs?  where did you get that information from?  
MR MKWANAZI:   That Information was a submission that 
was prepared by the Acquisition Department to the board 
informing the board that it looks like there is going to be a 
single source in view of the fact that Denel is refusing to 
supply other potential bidders with the data packs and 
technical information.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   And the board took note of that.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did the board disagree with the 
10 
attitude of Denel as far as you are aware?  
MR MKWANAZI:   The board disagreed to an extent that the 
board instructed the CEO that he writes a letter that Request 
to Denel to release all the information that is required by 
other potential bidders. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, but it appears that that may not 
have happened and did the boat not follow up as far as you 
are able to say from your knowledge off the documents and 
the information? 
MR MKWANAZI:   From the documents it was reported that 
20 
the letter was seen but I couldn't find any information to the 
Effect of the fact of what was Denel’s response to the letter.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then you proceed at 5.4 to 
say that the Open Bid Process then went ahead At anyone 
offer what received and that is from Denel.   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 118 of 213 
 
 
Do you believe that there is a possibility is that in fact 
the reason why Denel was the only horse in this race, the 
only party that submitted an offer even though other 
potential bidders had shown an interest was because they 
had not been given information that they could meaningfully 
tender on? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair.  But I could find two reasons.  
the other reason was the fact that two local suppliers 
requested that the closing date be extended but that was 
submitted also to the Steering Committee.  and according to 
10 
the minutes of that Steering Committee, that request was 
refused by the client which is the SANDF(?) in view of the 
fact that requirement, it was felt that it is urgently required.   
 
They cannot afford to extend the closing date for 
another year.  So those two companies also they couldn't 
submit their tender plus the fact that that the others had 
complained 
as 
a 
result 
of 
not 
having 
the 
technical 
information.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Then you refer to the 
evaluation at paragraph 5.5 and you have attached various 
20 
documents or refer to various documents.  and then you 
refer specifically to the tarot specifications and the vehicle 
specifications and then specific specifications having been 
send out, at the foot of page 12.  Do you see that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 119 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you set out in paragraph 
5.7.1 to 9 these specific approved specifications that was set 
out.  Again, Were you involved personally in that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   No, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Again before your time? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you able to help the Commission 
with any comment as to whether you believe the process 
that  was followed was proper and fair as far as you were 
able to pick up? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  I think this was during the earlier stages 
of the tendering process when they were preparing in terms 
of the specification.  So as it was – the process was fair in 
terms of – the only company that was having that capability 
at the time, it developed a concept of the turret as well as 
the 
platform 
were 
those 
two 
companies 
that 
were 
contracted to do the work. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  But is there not a possible view 
to be formed in relation to this that it was unsatisfactory, 
the result that came out that there was effectively no 
20 
competition because Denel could only be the – could be 
the only bidder in light of the fact that it had the 
intellectual property with Armscor?  Armscor, initially, as 
we know, the board said that they should make their data 
packs and the information in that available to the other 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 120 of 213 
 
competitors. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think at the time when this was done, 
Chair, it was not, you know, envisaged that there is going 
to be a problem of Denel getting into an exclusive 
agreement with the company. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At the time it may not have been 
envisaged. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    And in fact you were not involved at 
the time yourself but you then took up a senior position 
10 
within Armscor 
and 
have 
picked 
up 
information 
and 
formulated a view.   You may not at the – you would not 
have at the time have envisaged there might be a problem 
but looking backwards, the benefit of hindsight and with 
the fact that we are asking you this question as an expert 
in the field of procurement management, do you have any 
view as to whether in fact there was any irregularity?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair, I would not say there was any 
irregularity because the reason being that when such has 
happened, normally then when we go out on a tender you 
20 
would make it a point that the information is available to 
potential bidders.  One way of doing that would be to put it 
as part of the request for offer that the information will be 
customer furnished information meaning that it will be 
supplied to whoever requests for it but that was not done. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 121 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But the question is, should – I beg 
your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The question is, 
should it not have been done? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I would say it should have been done to 
avoid this situation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, presumably are well-aware as 
an expert in the field of supply chain management  of 
Section 217 of the constitution and the PFMA, not so?    
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And they, of course, require that 
when there is procurement of any goods and services in 
the public sector that entity, in this case Armscor, should 
have in place a system which it then gives effect to which 
ensure the constitutional objectives that the process be 
lawful there, competitive, cost effective and equitable.  It 
just seems, Mr Mkwanazi, and I am just going to put to you 
a possible view that can be placed on an outside observer 
on the situation that the result of what was being done, 
20 
denying that information in the data packs action or 
omission on the part of those involved at Armscor before 
you were involved, seriously prevent or undermined the 
possibility of it ever being competitive, not so? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct, Chair. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 122 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Let alone transparent and cost-
effective, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Do 
you 
know 
based 
on 
the 
documentation that you have had access to whether Denel 
furnished Armscor with any grounds or reasons for them 
not availing the packs to the other potential bidders and if 
you are aware what the reasons were, are you able to say 
whether they were valid reasons for them refusing? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am not aware, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not aware what their reasons were? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this might just go back to the point 
that Mr Kennedy was making to you and I think you agreed 
with it but it is just that earlier on I understood you to have 
thought that – to have expressed a view that the process 
was fair.  If Armscor had taken the view that this was a 
case where if at all possible different potential bidders 
should have the opportunity to bid then if they ended up 
with one bidder, namely Denel because Denel refused to 
20 
act in accordance with the request or instruction or request 
from Armscor then definitely from the point of view of 
Armscor the process must have – should have been seen 
as unfair.  Would you agree with that or would you like me 
to repeat it? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 123 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Repeat it, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  If Armscor had taken the view that 
they wanted to make a decision on this tender with the 
benefit of different leaders having put in their bids and 
they had instructed or requested Denel to make the data 
packs available to other potential bidders so that Armscor 
could have the benefit of different bidders and Denel 
refused to make the data packs available to the other 
potential bidders then unless Armscor had been given good 
reasons by Denel then Armscor should have viewed the 
10 
process as unfair. 
MR 
MKWANAZI: 
 
 
Chair, 
relying 
on 
the 
document 
information that I was relying on, I was not in a position to 
get to that conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but there were no reasons that you 
found furnished by Denel, is it not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my proposition is, assuming that 
Armscor had not been furnished with any valid reasons by 
Denel for not making the data packs available to the other 
20 
bidders, potential bidders, then Denel should be expected 
to have regarded the process as unfair because no valid 
reasons had been provided.  Obviously if there were valid 
reasons that were provided by Denel, the picture might 
change but if Armscor has the same information that you 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 124 of 213 
 
have had access to then one would expect them to also 
have formed a view that this process was unfair. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would agree with that. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  You see, it just 
strikes one as an outsider not involved in the process just 
as you came into Armscor not having yourself been 
involved in the process, it just looks rather strange that 
10 
Armscor understands that there is a problem initially, it 
understands 
quite 
correctly 
that 
only 
Denel 
has 
the 
information and but it would like competitive bids from a 
whole lot of other suppliers.  They need the information 
and what seems to be to its credit, Armscor says well, 
Denel provide that information but then Denel does not 
seem to provide it, you are not aware of any reasons that 
were raised by Denel to justify that but most importantly, 
that no reasons seemed to have been raised with Armscor 
for it to say okay, we accept you are not going to supply 
20 
the information and what seems to be strange about the 
whole thing is that one bidder, Denel, that could stand to 
make millions of rands out of this contract is able to 
effectively stop anybody else even putting in a tender 
because they lack information that they have to get from 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 125 of 213 
 
Denel, Denel is told by Armscor provide the information 
and Denel do not and they never go back to Armscor and 
justify it.  And Armscor, in the process, seem to have 
allowed the situation to develop where one tenderer is able 
to eliminate the entire range of competition.  Do you have 
any comment on what I have just put to you, whether you 
think it is a fair comment or not?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I would say it is a fair comment, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell me, have you had access to the 
10 
minutes of the Armscor board?  I am assuming it would 
have been the Armscor board that was to make a decision 
on this.  Have you had access to the minutes of the 
meeting where they made the decision to grant this to 
Denel or access to the minutes of some of the meetings 
that happened after they would have expected Denel to 
have complied with their request or to have furnished 
reasons for not complying?  What I am looking for is 
whether you have had access to a meeting where the 
Armscor board would have discussed the issue to say what 
20 
happened to the request we said should be conveyed to 
Denel 
to 
share 
the 
information 
with 
other 
potential 
bidders?  What has Denel said - if they have not done so, 
what is the reason?  Have you had access to those 
minutes? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 126 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be somebody else who would 
have easy access to those minutes and not you or you 
could also have access if you wanted to? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair, I would then have to go back and 
check from the archives all the minutes that followed that 
particular one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And I am not sure whether I will find 
anything. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it would be good to look at the 
minutes of the meeting where the board, if it was the 
board, where they made the decision that Denel must be 
requested to avail this information to other potential 
bidders and to look at the minutes that followed up to 
whatever time made where the decision was taken to grant 
the tender to Denel and see whether at any stage this 
issue was revisited to say why did Denel not comply with 
our request because I would imagine that a bidder would 
want to comply with the request form a company where 
20 
they seek to get business from particularly if they do not 
have valid reasons.  So, in other words, it would be good 
to know whether was this issue ever followed up by 
Armscor, what did they do about it, what did they find in 
terms of information or is it something that was swept 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 127 of 213 
 
under the carpet because I would imagine that even at the 
time of them taking the decision whether to award Denel 
the tender I would expect that the board will say hang on, 
before we can award this tender, why did you not comply 
with our request?  Why did you not comply with our 
request?  And, I mean, I do not know but I can imagine that 
with some boards they might say well, you know, we are 
not going to award it to you because you are preventing 
other competitors and we want competition, we are not 
going to award it to you unless you give us valid reasons 
10 
why you did not comply and if you do not have valid 
reasons we are not going to give this award to you without 
competition.  You understand that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and you say you can follow up and 
check minutes? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja.  No, that would be helpful.  
Unless, Mr Kennedy, there is another witness who covers 
what I was talking about. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, thank you.  My attention is 
drawn to page 453.  If I can ask the witness to turn to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   453.  Do you have it? 
MR MKWANAZI:   453, yes. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 128 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now this appears to be a submission 
to the Armscor board. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And if you look at the following page 
454, paragraph 5, that referred to the current status of the 
procurement process at that stage.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The report is in fact headed: 
“Notification on project status” 
And near the bottom it says – sorry, in fact the second 
10 
unnumbered paragraph in paragraph 5 – or in fact the first, 
the first three. 
“RFA being issued 23 companies, not all have 
responded.  Various people such as Brazilian Army 
has shown interest.” 
Etcetera.  In the next paragraph: 
“At this stage the consortium consisting of Denel, 
EADS and LMT is the only consortium that has 
confirmed its intention to participate.” 
Are you familiar with this report? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair, that is the document I said I 
looked at. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And then on the next page, 
paragraph 7, it says at the foot of the page, heading: 
“Action taken by Armscor. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 129 of 213 
 
A letter was sent by the Chief Executive Officer of 
Denel requesting Denel to make the LIW turret 
available to potential offerors who want so submit 
offers based on vehicle systems equipped with the 
LIV (sic) turret.  See copy of letter attached.” 
We will look at that in a moment.  Does that relate to the 
information that would have been contained in the data 
packs? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the paragraph – at page 456.  It 
10 
says: 
“Conclusion. 
 
Armscor 
acquisition 
department 
wishes the Armscor board of directors to take note 
of the possible single offer situation that may arise 
on the grounds of the aforegoing report.” 
Was that somebody who was in the department before you 
joined it in acquisitions? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The general manager.  Do you know 
the name of that person? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you recognise his or her 
signature?  Who is that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Mr Gideon Smith was the general 
manager of …[intervenes] 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 130 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Smith? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Smith, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And then if I can take you to 
page 462?  Do you have that?   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now that appears to be a letter from 
Armscor as far back as July 2004. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
From 
its 
general 
manager  
acquisition, that is the very same Gideon Smith you 
10 
referred to, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it is addressed to the CEO of 
Denel. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that refers to the vehicle of 
relevance.  If I can just pick up on – on page 462.  Yes, the 
second paragraph: 
“A potential contender for this new vehicle product 
system has written an official letter to Armscor to 
20 
inform us that it has come to their attention that the 
LIW two man turret would, as a principle, be solely 
dedicated to EADS Patria acting as the Denel 
partner in the Hoefyster project.” 
It appears to be a quote from the potential bidder who has 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 131 of 213 
 
raised this query and then the – then Mr Smith continues, 
the third paragraph: 
“The potential contender therefore requested us, 
Armscor, to provide them with the initial 2 man 30 
mm turret developed with defence funding, i.e. the 
turret which was exhibited at the September 2002 
Aero Africa Defence Show in order for them to 
verify whether this turret could fit into their vehicle 
platforms and could be developed to comply with 
the project Hoefyster requisitions.  Armscor is, 
10 
however, strongly opposed to the idea that any 
locally developed intellectual property which could 
give 
our 
local 
industry 
and/or 
South 
African 
National 
Defence 
Force 
a 
winning 
edge 
is 
transferred to a foreign entity without full protection 
of rights.” 
And then it queries whether the potential contender ’s 
statement is correct, asks for clarity and then at the foot of 
the page, the last paragraph: 
“Should any single offer situation arise from our 
20 
current request for offer and it is not considered to 
be the optimum solution, Armscor may well consider 
entering into another round of tender invitations in 
order to select the most cost effective system.  I 
must also mention…” 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 132 of 213 
 
This is the top of page 463: 
“…that Armscor has placed orders for millions of 
rands in creating and maintaining the capabilities at 
LIW and recently placed orders with Denel (Pty) Ltd 
trading as LIW to the value of R28 765 000 for 
project Hoefyster turret concept development and 
turrets demonstrators as well as orders to the value 
of 
8.6 
million 
for 
medium 
turret 
technology.   
Intellectual 
property 
that 
was 
created 
in 
LIW 
through these investments is extensively used in a 
10 
prototype turret currently being prepared by LIW for 
physical 
evaluation 
purposed 
in 
terms 
of 
our 
request 
for 
offer. 
 
Armscor 
also 
provided 
authorisation to LIW for the borrowing of certain 
hardware from Armscor in order to assist LIW in the 
preparation of this prototype turret.  In view of the 
above, Armscor kindly requests that Denel make the 
LIW 
prototype 
turret 
available 
to 
potential 
contenders who wish to include this turret in an 
offer for the new generation industry combat vehicle 
20 
product system to Armscor.” 
It says: 
“Please note the request is directed to you without 
prejudice to any of Armscor ’s rights.” 
So is it based on this that you have said in your affidavit 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 133 of 213 
 
that you are aware that a letter was sent before you time 
by Armscor to the Denel CEO specifically asking him to 
make available this information? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the purpose of that information 
to be supplied would be to enable other potential bidders 
to see can we manufacture this?  Now we know that it 
involves, can we manufacture it and put in a tender? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that would have then have 
10 
ensured a competitive process. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But the upshot of whatever happened 
or did not happen here is that it seems the marketplace 
were not given information that would have enabled them 
to take part in this competition and that Denel alone then 
submitted an offer. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that was after Denel, it appears, 
decided not to accede to the request made by Armscor 
20 
itself that it should make that information available. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It just seems to possibly suggest an 
interpretation and that is that was this not a predetermine 
process?  Was this not just a sham or a façade aimed at 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 134 of 213 
 
ensuring that Denel would get the business at least from 
Denel’s side in not making available the information and 
then perhaps assisted by Armscor in not following up to 
see whether they had made available the information? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I would not say that, Chair, in view of 
the fact that I could not find information to the effect that 
they did not respond to this particular letter. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there is something I find strange 
here.  I do not know whether you also find it strange, 
10 
namely that the letter to Denel, to which Mr Kennedy has 
drawn our attention, from Armscor which requested Denel 
to make the information available to potential – other 
potential 
bidders, 
is 
dated 
20 
July 
2004 
and 
the 
submission to the board of Armscor which sought to alert 
the board that although the board wanted a multi-source of 
a process, it could end up with a single source offer which 
is – that is the submission at page 453 that Mr Kennedy 
referred us to earlier, 453.  Whoever prepared this 
submission, it is strange that after stating in paragraph at 
20 
page 455 the fact that Denel was asked to make available 
to – the information available to potential – other potential 
bidders, it does not tell the Armscor board what has 
happened, has Denel complied with that request?  If Denel 
has not complied, what explanation or reasons they have 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 135 of 213 
 
given, it just moves or he or she, I do not know, moves 
quickly after stating that very important fact to saying – to 
the conclusion and the conclusion is Armscor acquisition 
department wishes the Armscor board of directors to take 
not of the possible single offer situation that may arise on 
the grounds of the aforegoing which is – what he leaves 
out, what he omits seems to me to be something very 
important because the board – he should have expected 
that the board would want to know was the letter sent out 
to Denel, have they responded, what did they say?  And if 
10 
they do not comply with our request, what reasons have 
they given?  That is not done in this memo.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you find that also strange or not 
really? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I find it strange as well but, like I said, 
when I checked the information in terms of the response, I 
could not find any information, you know, that they 
responded to that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because the purpose of this 
submission, it says right at the top, at the beginning of the 
submission: 
“The aim of the submission to notify the Armscor 
board of directors of the possibility that the current 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 136 of 213 
 
multi-source offer process may materialise in a 
single source offer.” 
So the most important thing that they would want to know 
is we know that if Denel refused to make information 
available to other potential bidders we would end up in this 
situation, that is why we requested that Denel should make 
the information available.  If we are now going to – if there 
is a possibility we are going to end up with a single offer 
situation, a single source offer, the board surely would 
want to know why has the board – has Denel not complied 
10 
with our request?  If so, why?   
And whoever was writing the submission should 
have checked because that must be the most important 
information they would have wanted to know so that if they 
were not convinced of the soundness of Denel’s reasons 
for not making the information available, they could decide 
what action to take.  Indeed, in the letter that was sent to 
Denel which – to which Mr Kennedy has drawn our 
attention, they make it clear to Denel that if we have a 
single source offer we could rerun the tender.  That is how 
20 
important it was to the board that there be a multi-source 
process of a process.  You understand where I am coming 
from? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it just seems very strange to me 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 137 of 213 
 
that the person who is telling them about the possibility of 
them ending up with a single source offer does not say – 
does not deal with this very important aspect.  Okay, Mr 
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair, just to – if we can 
just pick up on that line of questioning.  If I can ask you 
please to turn to page 229?  229 is the start of a set of 
minutes that you have referred to in your affidavit.  Do you 
have 229? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   These are minutes, it seems, of a 
meeting 
of 
the 
project 
Hoefyster 
steering 
committee 
meeting, number 17, held on the 9 September 2004 and 
there are various generals and rear-admiral and colonels 
and so forth and various officials of Armscor.  If I can take 
you to page 231, paragraph 2.5. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 221? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   231, still in the same minutes, 
paragraph 2.5, do you have it?  Mr Mkwanazi? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Paragraph 2.5?  Yes I do Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It says notice to Armscor Board of 
Directors, I will read out if I may the relevant portions. 
“Armscor 
Acquisition 
Department 
made 
a 
submission to the Board regarding a possibility of a 
single source offer being submitted by the 24 t h of 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 138 of 213 
 
February 2005, the following were mentioned or 
discussed.  The CEO of Armscor, Mr H S Thomo, 
discussed the turret issue with Mr V Moche from 
Denel, Mr Moche confirmed the agreement with 
EADS as well as the involvement of local companies 
like Alphus OMC and LMT as part of the Denel offer.   
The value system does not provide for a single offer 
since price cannot be assessed in a comparative 
manner.  Cost could be a problem but can be 
addressed through comparison with historical data 
10 
as well as through negotiations with the contractor.   
Mr Goosen stressed that it was never indicated to 
any foreign contenders that LIW Turret would be 
supplied CFI.” 
And then Colonel Kotze referred to the influence of 
slippage in time scales etcetera, but what some people 
seem to have been alive to is a serious concern that if you 
only have, if it turns out to be only one supplier or 
potential supplier that puts in a tender it is obviously 
impossible to compare prices if there is no comparison, 
20 
there is nobody, only A submits a tender, B, C and D 
haven’t submitted a tender so you can’t compare A’s price 
with anything.  Would you agree with me Mr Mkwanazi that 
competitiveness, if in fact the market place is such that 
other people can make a particular item is very important. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 139 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then there’s the concern raised 
that foreign bidders were not invited.  Can I ask you, we 
are asking these questions because you are the current 
acting head at Armscor and we appreciate it is difficult for 
you because you have inherited a situation that has been 
created by others and we simply ask you to comment on 
what you have found since you got there, but on that score 
could I ask you what would you say would be the correct 
approach for Armscor procurement people such as yourself 
10 
in a position that you now occupy, if you had occupied it at 
the time and you had been advising senior officers within 
Armscor as to the correct process, what should have been 
done 
here 
do 
you 
believe 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
turret 
procurement? 
MR MKWANAZI:   In view of the fact that Denel was 
involved in terms of development the turret and the 
development was paid by Armscor, meaning that Denel and 
Armscor were sharing the IP.  What I would have done was 
to make it a point that as part of the RFO they include the 
20 
information that was required by the other suppliers, even 
if we don’t include it in the documents but we refer in that 
documents that it will be customer furnished information 
meaning that as and when requested we will supply it to 
them. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 140 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Could it be possible that Denel may 
have had a legitimate reason not to because it was the part 
owner of the IP?    
MR MKWANAZI:   That was the background IP that Denel 
had and then the foreground IP it is owned by Armscor in 
terms of having paid for it, so I would have strongly 
negotiated that with the part that we have paid for that 
information should be made available to other potential 
bidders. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, now I have just read out a 
10 
portion that is in fact referred, costs, costs could be a 
problem, would you understand a comment such as that to 
mean if we only have one bidder putting in its tender there 
will be no competition and they may of course charge quite 
a high price because they will know nobody else or 
potentially know that nobody is able to compete and this 
might exceed budgets. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You have referred in your affidavit, 
and I would like to take you back if I may, to paragraph 
20 
4.8.1 in your affidavit, I will give you the page in a 
moment, it is page 9.  You see in 4.8 your affidavit says 
development plan, the DP was approved by the AAC what 
does that stand ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry what page is that Mr Kennedy? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 141 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   009, it is number 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   79? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No 09. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh page 9. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Simply page 9 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must just for consistency not 
mention the zero otherwise sometimes who read the 
transcript will think they must look for a zero whereas if we 
say – we don’t say the zero. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Apologies Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Page 9 paragraph 4.8.   
“The development plan was approved the AAC ...” 
What does that stand for? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is Armaments Acquisition Council. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that of the Defence Force or of 
Armscor? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No that one is for the Department of 
Defence, it is a Council that is chaired by the Minister of 
Defence. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So they of course would be the client 
in this whole project, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   They would be the client for this 
project? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 142 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The development plan approved by 
the AAC on the 27 t h of October 2006 authorising the 
following, and then it gives funding, funding for the 
development of deliverables, would be within a ceiling 
amount of R1.2billion at 2006 Rand value, the development 
be 
completed 
by 
November 
2011 
and 
funding 
for 
industrialisation and production of the level 5 product 
system to a ceiling amount of R7.288billion, I rounded off 
the figure, and that would again be a 2006 Rand value.  So 
10 
would Armscor ’s officials, including the people who took – 
who held your position before you joined them would they 
have had to work within those maximum amounts that were 
budgeted for by the defence force, the department of 
defence? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair by taking it into account that 
is now at the time, meaning that it is excluding escalation 
and the rate of exchange. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, indeed.  Now I would like to turn 
if I may please to turret specifications   There were 
20 
specific technical specifications for the turret for the items 
of armoured vehicles to be supplied by Denel to Armscor 
which in turn would supply those to the defence force, 
correct.   Sorry Mr Mkwanazi? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Would you please repeat the question, is 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 143 of 213 
 
it not based on my affidavit? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We are going to look at your affidavit 
again in a moment, just bear with me. 
MR MKWANAZI:   May you please then repeat the 
question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am just giving you an introduction.  
There were certain technical specifications for the turrets 
that had to be put into the RFO, the Request for Offers not 
so?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Whoever was to put in a tender 
would have to know what the specifications were so that it 
could meaningfully [a] decide whether it could make it at 
all and [b] if it wanted to, if it was able to make it and 
wanted to tender it at what cost would it be able to do so, 
correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the data packs would they have 
enabled a prospective tenderer to know what the turret 
specifications were? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so that the problem that 
relates to the data packs we have dealt with I believe fully, 
what I would like to move onto now is were you involved at 
any stage in the actual signing off of turret specifications? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 144 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   No Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So again your comments in your 
affidavit, are they based on what you have picked up from 
your position as Head of Acquisition that you have 
mentioned 
to 
the 
learned 
Chair, 
and 
you 
are 
self-
acquainted with the relevant documents. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you have dealt with some very 
helpful detail in relation to the turret specifications and 
particularly phases and baselines and the Chair has 
10 
already heard evidence from some of your colleagues from 
Armscor which have expressed – who have expressed 
some different views it seems to yours in relation to 
baselines for purposes of the specifications.  Can you very 
briefly explain to the Chair what your view is in relation to 
whether or not the specifications that were approved for 
the particular contract that was ultimately awarded were 
correct regular or not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   They were correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   From a technical point of view. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   From the technical point of view in view 
of the fact that they come from the user requirement of the 
client. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, were you made – sorry was a 
copy made available to you of the affidavits of Mr Malepa 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 145 of 213 
 
and Mr Nkozi, your colleagues from Armscor?  
MR MKWANAZI:   No Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Were you alerted though to the fact 
that they had a certain view? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes how were you alerted for that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I was alerted when I looked at – firstly I 
was alerted when I was told that they have submitted their 
statement and then also when they were presenting in that 
before this Commission Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So you were able to hear their 
evidence, is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, I would like you please if you 
would Mr Mkwanazi just in very brief terms bearing in mind 
that we have all the detail in your affidavit, bearing in mind 
also that there is a lot of technicality here that you are 
going to need to explain but we would like to keep it at a 
very broad level.  What is the crucial point on which you 
disagree, if you disagree at all, with their evidence on the 
20 
specifications? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Where I differ is on the basis of the fact 
that the product baseline, which was split into two was not 
in accordance with the document which they are referring 
to as Mill Standard 3, because Mill Standard 3 indicates 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 146 of 213 
 
that 
the 
different 
baseline 
can 
be 
tailored 
to 
the 
programme, depending on how complex the programme is 
or how simple the programme is, and in this case what 
happened it looks like they have taken the product, the 
Eastline, which is a baseline just which indicate the 
completion of the development phase.  However they split 
it 
into 
two, 
to 
a 
baseline 
called 
PBLA 
and 
that 
...[intervenes]    
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Okay, my apologies for interrupting 
you, may I just ask you to stop for a moment, just so that 
10 
we get the complete picture in relation to what a baseline 
is.  Can I take you in your affidavit to page 18. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Will you please repeat, page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   18, one eight.  Do you have that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now in paragraph 7.6 this is 
what your affidavit says the product baseline and the 
manufacturing 
baseline 
or 
defining 
project 
Hoefyster 
contract 1161’s supporting annexures, these supporting 
annexures 
cover 
inter 
alia 
the 
deliverables, 
work 
20 
breakdown and statement of work and prices. 
“7.7 
The product baseline is a milestone where 
all requirements have been functionally verified.  T 
his baseline is used to define the start of the 
industrialisation phase.  Project Hoefyster product 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 147 of 213 
 
baseline is broken down into a produce baseline, a 
BPLA and a final product baseline 1, BPL1, for each 
variant.” 
Right, so let’s just stop there, so that is a helpful definition 
of what a product baseline is so that defines the standards 
that have to be met before one can move out of the design 
phase into the industrialisation phase, is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you have referred to two product 
baselines, it was broken down into these two, the one is 
10 
PBLA and a final product baseline PBL1, for each variant.  
Now you will recall herein the evidence presented to the 
Commission previously just over a week ago to the effect 
that PBL1 in fact corresponds with the standard baseline 
that the SANDF has adopted, would you agree with that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  But then there was 
disagreement as to what – as to whether it was appropriate 
to determine PBLA as a variation of PBL1 for purposes of 
this contract.   Now you have indicated you disagree with 
20 
the evidence, in what respect? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I disagree in the sense that if you look 
at PBLA and PBL1 they form PBL which is a product 
baseline, so what happened was they took the PBL and 
split it into two, meaning that you take all the activities 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 148 of 213 
 
that are supposed to be achieved by PBL, then what they 
did as shown on my affidavit on page 19 they took a PBLA 
and have those activities, amongst those activities, the 
activities that are stated there and then have PBL1 which 
are those activities that – some of the activities that are 
listed. 
 
Now if you take the ...[indistinct] it forms PBL it 
forms baseline achieved.  So what they then did was to 
split these two as according to the standard, because the 
standard indicates that it can be daylight to the complexity 
10 
of the project and if I look at the document here it 
indicates that the reason why they wanted to split it was to 
be in a position to have a triggering point of the 
industrialisation 
phase 
so 
that 
there 
is 
a 
seamless 
transition of a development phase to the manufacturing 
and to the industrialisation and manufacturing phase, so 
that you don’t have a gap because if you had to complete 
PBL completely then you will have to stop and then now 
you start an industrialisation. 
 
So they wanted to have a point at which the risk 
20 
have been reduced sufficiently to be in a position to start 
an industrialisation so they split it then into two, PBLA and 
then PBL1 and if I look at current documents you even see 
– it is even in the current document in terms of the 
improvement of the baseline management.  They refer to 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 149 of 213 
 
that PBLA as the initial PBL, they call it PBLi and then they 
call PBLA1 a verified PBL, so currently if you look at the 
standards now it is divided into two, so which they did it at 
that time for the similar purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the reason why they did a 
legitimate reason in your view? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair in my view I think it was 
legitimate, looking at the complexity of the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You disagree with their view that the 
10 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
baselines 
and 
the 
complications that this has brought about has resulted in 
part of the difficulties that the Hoefyster Project is facing? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair I would disagree that it has 
resulted because at the point in time when it was done it 
was a means of managing the risk.  The fact that we have 
realised some of the risk is not due to the fact that it was 
split it into two.  It is – for a number of reasons that Denel 
is experiencing. 
 
If you look at PBLA for instance I think they 
20 
achieved it around 2011, and if you look at what is now 
outstanding in terms of them to achieve PBL1 it is a 
number of things that are faint in terms of the system that 
has been designed, which they need to go back, correct, 
and retest again. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 150 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if I can ask you to look again at 
page 19, so 7.8 sets out particular deliverables, 7.8.1 to 
7.8.10 is that correct?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then 7.9 from 7.9.1 to 7.9.19 on 
the top of the following page gives a different list of 
deliverables and in fact that PBL1 list is not exhaustive, in 
other words it is only inter alia the following. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact under 7.8 it is also inter alia 
10 
those that are listed there, so there are some marked 
differences between the two lots of requirements, not so? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And in your 7.10 you say the 
industrialisation 
phase 
establishes 
the 
manufacturing 
process, it is fixed at the manufacturing baseline thereafter 
the manufacturing and production commences.   
 
So I understand from your affidavit you earlier 
distinguished between a design development phase, which 
is distinguished from the industrialisation phase, very 
20 
briefly and I hope I don’t over-simplify it, the design 
development phase is really a stage of preparation before 
you as a supplier can actually start manufacturing, you 
have to get the design perfectly correct, is that right?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 151 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And part of that means that you have 
to meet certain thresholds in this context one of those 
thresholds being the PBL, correct, the product baseline? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Whether it be PBLA or PBL1 you 
have to meet either or both of those, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Both of them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Both of those.  And before you can 
them move on to the industrialisation phase you must 
satisfy Armscor as a supplier that you have met all of the 
10 
requirements of both PBLA and then PBL1. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Together of course with a whole lot 
of other baselines and other requirements, is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, now if we can just return to 7.1 
on page 20, apparently the PBL1, or at least at the stage 
that you signed this affidavit the PBL1 and MBL are 
currently delayed. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that still the position today, it 
hasn’t improved or been solved since you signed the 
affidavit in – just a few weeks back? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can you tell the Chair please why 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 152 of 213 
 
these PBL1 and MBL levels are delayed. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I will focus on the PBL1 Chair because it 
is the one that needs to be completed before one gets to 
the PBL, sorry the MBL. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   PBL has been delayed for a number of – 
PBL1 has been delayed for a number of reasons.  It was 
the problems, the technical problems ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   How long was the delay, just start there, 
before we go to the reasons? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair the completion should have been 
around 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it is eight years delay? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Perhaps if I may Chair, may I take 
the witness to page 22 where there’s some useful details 
he gives in relation to dates.   Nine deals with the project 
status and you say in 9.1: 
“DLS is late on many of the deliverables on project 
Hoefyster.  This has had a snowballing effect. To 
20 
this 
end 
financial 
liquidity 
challenges 
are 
not 
allowing DLS to acquire critical components and 
pay suppliers and sub-contractors for supplies and 
services.” 
Is that because of DLS’s own financial problems or is it 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 153 of 213 
 
because Armscor is causing DLS financial problems? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is because of DLS own financial 
problems chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, may I just ask before I 
proceed, I should have asked you this before, is part of our 
role in your capacity as the Acting Head of Procurement at 
the 
moment, 
is 
part 
of 
our 
role 
to 
monitor 
the 
implementation 
of 
contracts 
that 
have 
already 
been 
awarded to suppliers like DLS? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, and then in 9.2 you say Phase 
1 development, 9.2.1 and I think this may give – confirm 
the answer that you have given to the learned Chair a 
moment ago, the original date for completion of Phase 1 
development of all variants was May 2012.  Variance being 
different models not so of the same armoured vehicle? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so Phase 1 would have been 
completed once the supplier satisfied what the PBLA and 
he PBL1, is that correct? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And when would MBL have to be 
satisfied, during the Phase 1 development or Phase 2 
industrialisation? 
MR MKWANAZI:   MBL is Phase 2. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 154 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Phase 2. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Post-industrialisation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that’s manufacturing baseline. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Manufacturing baseline yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so then you have under 9.3 
Phase 2 industrialisation, the delivery of the first section 
variant pre-production model is currently approximately 
sixty months behind schedule and continues to slip. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The contracted delivery date of the 
10 
first SVPPN was August 2015? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, so it is now 60 months, that is 
five years behind. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If South Africa was – God forbid – at 
war presumably this would have material impact on its 
capacity to defend the nation, the Defence Force, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   In the sense that they require this 
capability I would say correct, although they have got 
20 
...[indistinct]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But these kinds of delays reflects 
nothing else but simply a disaster isn’t it?  It is a disaster 
to have these kinds of delays, isn’t it? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 155 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct Chair, in the sense that the 
capability that is supposed to be delivered is not delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is completely unacceptable.   That 
is completely unacceptable.   How can something that was 
required in 2012 and it had been promised to be delivered 
in 2012 eight years later it has not been delivered.  And 
you may or may not  be the right person to tell me what 
has been done over the years, why – what has happened 
why is this situation allowed to continue.  Has anybody 
been fired for not doing their job, has anything happened, 
10 
it is just unthinkable. 
 
I mean you might not be able to say anything but it 
is just unbelievable how something like this can be allowed 
to continue for so long.  I mean I was saying, I don’t know 
if it was last week or the other week, it must be the other 
week when we were, when I was hearing evidence relating 
to Denel, when I was saying that – when I said there is 
another project relating to SABC and telecommunication, I 
think they call it digital migration, that has been delayed 
maybe worse than this, maybe more or less the same thing, 
20 
and quite frankly I think I keep myself reasonably informed, 
I have not heard of any heads that have rolled, everything 
just has moved on, it is like there is nobody who 
supervises that Ministers do their jobs, DG’s do their job, 
Heads of SOE’s do their job, people under CEO’s do their 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 156 of 213 
 
job, Boards of SOE’s do their job. 
 
How can this kind of situation be allowed to 
happen?  Well you might know  how – since you got 
involved in the position have you come across any 
information of any heads that have rolled. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair when the mechanism that we have 
on our side as an acquisition agent for such a supplier all 
we do is to levy penalties, we put pressure on them, but it 
is Denel itself you know that should improve the situation 
in terms of ensuring that the delays are not as bad as they 
10 
are right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but Denel is an SOE.   Denel is an 
SOE.   The executive must be able to do what they can if 
that thing is in an SOE that don’t seem to be working the 
Board should be able to do something if the Board cannot 
do its job something should be done about that Board and 
there must be a CEO.  I mean you just cannot have a 
situation where something that was supposed to happen so 
long ago has not happened and from what you say in your 
affidavit it looks like these deliveries that should have 
20 
happened in 20 – May 2012 not only have they not happened 
in 2020 there is no certainty as to when they will happen.   
Denel has suggested 2023 I do not know how long 
ago they made that suggestion and I do not know what the 
basis was for choosing 2023 as opposed to 2021 or 2022 or 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 157 of 213 
 
why is not 20 – will it ever happen?  And why is it allowed to 
just continue like that?   
The Chairperson of the board of Denel was here 
giving evidence that other week.  If I am not mistaken she 
said I am paraphrasing now.  This is one of their – I mean 
this Hoefyster Project is one of their nightmares you know.  
It is something that is really causing huge difficulties and 
problems. 
But maybe other witnesses who will come will tell me 
something that will give me comfort that there is a clear 
10 
direction as to how to solve the problem.   
Because leaders are put in leadership positions, 
managers are put in management positions so that they can 
make decisions.  They can lead. 
Ja okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What appears to be particularly 
troubling is that these problems can arise and get so serious 
that it is only when the judiciary in a judicial commission.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Deals with it that only then … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The public can and government seem to 
become aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just – it is like – it is like the story of 
the SOE’s.  So many of them appear to be in serious trouble 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 158 of 213 
 
and you ask yourself the question; did somebody not see 
from a long time ago that there was trouble coming and took 
steps to make sure that we did not – these SOE’s did not get 
to where they are now.   
 
Were there not – no people – were there no 
politicians who were responsible?  Were there no Ministers; 
was there no President?  Were there no Presidents who were 
supposed to make sure that their Ministers did the job that 
they were supposed to do?  Were there no Ministers who 
were supposed to see to it that the CEO’s or the boards did 
10 
their job?   
If they did not do their job they got fired and proper – 
and members of boards who knew what they were doing were 
brought in.  And boards of these SOE’s what did they do if 
the CEO’s the CFO’s seemed not to be doing their job?  
These things do not just happen overnight.   
There is a process – there is a time that happens and 
if you know what you are doing and you act in the best 
interest of the SOE’s you can see that there is going to be a 
problem in the future unless we arrest this situation.  And 
20 
you either know how to arrest it or if you do not know you 
should get out of the way.   
Let somebody else who knows how to do the job get 
and arrest the situation.  These SOE’s are – they are tax 
payers SOE’s.  So when you see a problem like this just 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 159 of 213 
 
going on and on and on for years you cannot understand why 
there is no leadership to say whether at political level or 
management level to say, this cannot be allowed to go on.  
Serious decisions must be taken one way or another and 
then those decisions are taken.  Or you do not know whether 
people are afraid to make wrong decisions.   
But if you are a leader or you a manager you must be 
able to take decisions whether you are wrong or not wrong 
you – you must take a decision.  You know.  The worst thing 
is for you not to make a decision because you are scared of 
10 
making a wrong decision.  You must make a decision.  I 
mean eight years and five years.  Just seems really 
intolerable.  Yes Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  I am not sure that the 
next bit of evidence is going to give you any comfort.  I need 
to complete the pictures to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Completion dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So well the one thing we should get 
is to get the true picture. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The facts.  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the situation ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I – if I may then take you Mr 
Mkwanazi to page 23?  We see that there is a table in which 
as I understand the DOS has – has given proposed dates for 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 160 of 213 
 
completion of certain milestones, is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  These are not dates proposed by 
Armscor, your company?  They are proposed by DLS the 
supplier. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes it is the supplier Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now we know from your earlier 
evidence 
that 
the 
development 
stage 
– 
the 
phase 
1 
development should have been completed by May 2012 that 
is eight years ago – more than eight years ago.  If we look at 
10 
this table we see the fourth item completion of development 
in – under the heading 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy I did not hear the 
page number? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry Chair it is page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We at the table Chair and the witness 
has indicated this sets out the – the proposed dates for 
completion.  Mr Mkwanazi before we look at the detail as I 
understand the description column just deals with the 
20 
various stages to be achieved – the milestones as it were, is 
that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So SVPBL1 turret – SVPBL1 platform 
and SVL5PBL1 those all relate to the production baseline 1 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 161 of 213 
 
for different variations, is that right?  Or the different 
elements so the turret on the one hand the platform on the 
other, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No Chair it is not production it is 
development. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  No not production development it is 
achievement of the PBL, correct. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes achievement of PBL1. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  PBL yes.  And that has still not been 
approved? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct?  And the second column 
2018 proposed dates.  Am I right in understanding that those 
were dates proposed in 2018 as to when it was expected in 
2018 it would still be completed? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So for example if we look at the first 
item the SVPBL1 turret in – we know that all of that should 
have been completed before May 2012 but when there was a 
delay already apparently in 2018 it had not been achieved.  
20 
In 2018 it was proposed and planned that it would be 
completed by May 2019, is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In other words seven years after the 
original intended completion date.  Now your last column 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 162 of 213 
 
Current Proposed Dates is to be determined.  Is that what 
DLS have indicated?  At the moment they do not have a 
proposed date that they can give with any measure of 
confidence. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And the same applies to the next items. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
And 
then 
the 
completion 
of 
development the fourth item can only take place after the 
first three items are completed, is that right? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In 2018 it was proposed that the 
completion – the development would be by June 2021 that is 
not far to go – that is just about six/seven months – eight 
months maybe to go.  Now what DLS is saying is that their 
current proposed dates – date for the completion of the 
development is December 2023. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Eleven years late after the intended 
completion date of May 2012 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But can we – can you at Armscor have 
any confidence in December 2023 as being the completion of 
the development where they still have to determine what 
they propose as a date for completion of the first three items 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 163 of 213 
 
which 
have 
to 
be 
completed 
before 
development 
is 
completed – development stage is completed? 
MR MKWANAZI:  It is very difficult to say that one has got a 
good level of confidence in view of the fact that when they 
submit such a revised completion dates it is all subject to 
Denel getting a bailout.  So if they do not get a bailout they 
are not in a position to – to buy critical parts; they are not in 
a position to pay suppliers so literally there is minimal that is 
taking place in Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if Denel does not get any bailout this – 
10 
these – this will remain where it is? 
MR MKWANAZI:  The probability of achieving it is minimal 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of financial loss to Armscor 
up to now if this was not to be achieved for whatever reason 
do you have an idea how much financial loss that would 
mean more or less in terms of whatever it may have spent 
already trying to get these if then we were to be in a 
situation where Denel is not bailed out and therefore it 
cannot continue with – it cannot actually do this? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  In terms of what has been spent Chair I 
think somewhere I touch on it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is it at page 21? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Page 21.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am not sure if this is what you 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 164 of 213 
 
referring to.  Just have a look at page 21 will that help you? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Table 1. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Page 21. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just explain to the Chair please what 
that – what that sets out? 
MR MKWANAZI:  What sets out there Chair is that what has 
already been paid it is for phase 1 we have paid R1.5 billion.  
And if you look at phase 2 what we have paid if about R5 
billion.  And then if you look at … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should you not be looking at the total at 
the bottom of the… 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja maybe let us look at the total Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  It is about 7.6.  But the reason why I 
wanted to just look at the breakdown is that some of the 
things that have been paid for it is things that have been 
delivered.  Like the radios. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And – and the ammunition has been 
20 
delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you can – have gone through… 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is why I just wanted to explain it. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 165 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can go through like that if that is a 
legitimate reason to do it that way. 
MR MKWANAZI:  For instance if you look at the radial 
significant amount of it has been achieved.  You can see that 
the total order is about R353 million we have paid about 
R348 million.   
If you look at the other order as well for radial that 
has also been R225 million has been paid.  You look at the 
Ingwe there is not much that was – that we have paid there 
is the Ingwe missile.   
10 
And then if you look at the development of Ingwe also 
we have paid about R7 billion.  So what I am trying to show 
Chair is that if you look at also the other part which is the 
parts closed order those are orders where – that we have 
achieved on them.   
So the area that is of – the area that is of risk Chair I 
would say it is the area of R1.5 billion which is the 
development.  In the event that is not completed then we 
would not be able to show any design.  We will not be able 
to show any data pack for it.  So I would say that is the area 
20 
that is at high risk.  And then if you look at… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the – that is R1 billion – that is 
R1. What billion? 
MR MKWANAZI:  R1.5 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right at the top? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 166 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  At the top phase 1.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is R1.5 billion. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes.  If you look at the composition of 
phase 2 Chair.  Under phase 2 Chair we have got about 
advanced payment that has been paid of about – I think it is 
about R2 million – R2 billion.  So if one deducts that we will 
be left with about – I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:  R12 billion or R2 billion? 
MR MKWANAZI:  R2 billion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to see where that is.  I can 
10 
see… 
MR MKWANAZI:  I am saying it is included in there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja I am just – I just want to sort of give a 
bit of an explanation there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And then – so what you would find Chair – 
what is at risk in terms of the phase 2 it will be the work in 
progress that we have paid for.  Those vehicles and the 
parts and the systems – sub-systems that have been bought.  
20 
But the other R2 billion that I referred to is covered by the – 
about R1.5 billion or so is covered by a bank guarantee 
meaning that we can call it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And receive it. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 167 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:  So hence I was saying that that will be the 
amount that will be [00:14:40]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About R1.5 billion. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja R1.5 billion and then part of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be at risk. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  And of course the – a question 
that would be bound to arise would be whether this situation 
could have been avoided or may well have been avoided if 
10 
there had been a competitive process because maybe Denel 
would not have been given the tender.  Because from what 
you have said it looks like it is Denel’s financial situation 
that is largely responsible for these delays. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes Chair the current situation. Although it 
– Denel had a problem – technical problem delays which is 
normal in a project of this nature which is very complex.  So 
even if you look at international standards in terms the 
delays one would find that they do have delays of about 
three to four years in terms of the complexity of the project. 
20 
But what has worsened the situation now is that having all 
those technical problems that Denel experienced now it was 
exacerbated by the problem of the cash flow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The financial situation. 
MR MKWANAZI:  The financial situation. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 168 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Which is even getting worse in the sense 
that because of the financial situation not being able to pay 
salaries they are even losing now their resources which will 
make it even more difficult to achieve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which could bring back the technical 
problems. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Thank you Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  On page 24 in your 
10 
concluding paragraph you say just above 981. 
“The following are significant issues for 
consideration.  
981  Financial liquidity challenges are not 
allowing it to acquire critical components and 
pay suppliers and sub-contractors.” 
You referring there to Denel, is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then you say: 
“The risk of not completing Project Hoefyster 
20 
is very high and cannot be mitigated without 
external financial assistance.” 
So are you telling the Chair that unless there is financial 
assistance by that you mean – do you mean a so called 
bailout from government? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 169 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  For Denel correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes for Denel.  Without that there is a 
very 
high 
risk 
that 
Project 
Hoefyster 
may 
completely 
collapse? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may not have an answer for this but if 
you do that would be helpful.  Do you have an idea about 
how big a bailout Denel needs in order to be able to continue 
with this project? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I would not be able to give the exact 
10 
figure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR MKWANAZI:  Except what I have heard from the 
employees in Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Where they are indicating that they owe 
about R700 million to R600 million to the suppliers in terms 
of the suppliers being able to supply them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Otherwise right now they are not prepared 
20 
to supply them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  While they are owed by Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Now if you look at that and also if you look 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 170 of 213 
 
at the situation in terms of where they are in terms of the 
normal cash flow to be able to pay salaries talking about – 
about R130 or so million per month in terms of the salaries.  
So I would say what I heard from the media and everywhere 
else it was R1.8 billion that they were looking at.  To get a 
bailout to be in a position to be you know out of the situation 
so that it unlocks all those problems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That they are having and then they will be 
in a position to start over. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Mkwanazi are you aware that Denel 
entered into contracts with VR Laser to procure various 
items – 217 platform hulls and then subsequently two lots of 
sole supplier contracts the one for DLS and the other for 
DVS.  Are you aware of that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No Chair we do not manage the sub-
contractors of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right. 
MR MKWANAZI:  The only information I have is based on the 
20 
list of sub-contractors that was given to us by Denel and 
also in terms of the latest list that we have.  Yes we saw a 
shift in terms of the amount of – of sub-contracting work in 
terms of the value.  When we contracted Denel the value was 
less and then as soon as they start manufacturing we saw 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 171 of 213 
 
the value increasing of VR Laser.  But as to how they were 
contracted and things like that we do not get involved at the 
lower level of sub-contracting and suppliers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess the delays that have happened 
would be pushing the prices up as well of whatever was 
supposed to have done in 2010/2011/2012 has not been 
done over the past eight years prices must be going up? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair there is a cost of escalation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  As well as the rate of exchange. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But of course as the customer 
Armscor would be seriously prejudiced by those escalations, 
is it not?  Or is the fact that the delays are caused on the – 
by Denel, Denel would have to bear the escalation costs, is 
that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course that just serves to make their 
financial situation worse. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So on top of the R700 and whatever million 
20 
that they may be owing suppliers they may be owing a lot of 
money that they need in order to take care of the escalation 
costs in regard to this project? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 172 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  Plus penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Plus penalties. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage do you have an idea about 
what the penalties – what…? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chair I will off the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What amounts we may be talking about? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I will give an off the cuff figure of about 
R200 million but it might not be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr 
10 
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  If I may just conclude 
with taking the witness back to page 9.  Mr Mkwanazi I drew 
your attention previously on page 9 to paragraph 4.8 of your 
affidavit and you will recall confirming in your evidence a 
little earlier this afternoon that the Defence Force’s AAC as 
far back as October 2006 authorised funding within a ceiling 
amount 
of 
R1.2 
billion 
and 
then 
funding 
for 
the 
industrialisation and – sorry that is for the development and 
then the funding for industrialisation would involve R7.2 odd 
20 
billion.  Now clearly that is not being kept to.   
Can you tell the Chair please what measures may 
have been put in place at Armscor not Denel – at Armscor 
what measures were put in place to ensure that these limits 
were not exceeded? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 173 of 213 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chair as I indicated earlier on that these 
figures are excluding VAT, excluding escalation, excluding 
rate of exchange so the measures we have as Armscor when 
we contract we have got a formula that we use for – to cater 
for escalation.  And then we also contracted that we will be 
paying the rate of exchange because it fluctuates and is not 
as a result of the fault of the supplier.  And then VAT 
obviously we paid in accordance to what is – what will be the 
VAT at that point in time.  If it is 14% - 14 or 15%.   
So if you look at in terms of that you would realise 
10 
that because of the escalation cost, rate of exchange it is 
higher than it is stated there which is understood by the 
client as well and this is how they plan.  And then also on 
phase 2 it is the same.   
But like I was indicating that when it comes to – 
meaning that the formula will apply up to that completion of 
the project.  Beyond that then the supplier then will have to 
pay the escalation because they are delayed as a result of 
their [00:24:26].  So in terms of during the project this is how 
we controlling Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair we have no further questions for 
this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you very much Mr 
Mkwanazi for making yourself available to testify.  If we need 
you again we will ask you to come back but we appreciate 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 174 of 213 
 
the fact that you – you made yourself available.  Thank you 
very much.  You are now excused.    We are at one minute 
past four. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can still continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes happy to continue thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the next witness. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your contemplation of how long 
would be – you will be with him? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I would think probably two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About two hours. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Something in that order yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we might go up to six o’clock or so. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  I am not sure that we will 
necessarily finish in two hours but that is my rough estimate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Well we – and tomorrow how 
many witnesses have you got? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We have only one currently and the 
reason for that is not necessarily that the witness will take 
20 
all day.  But in fact the next witness will be Mr Ntshepe who 
will take some time.  You will recall he was – he replaced Mr 
Saloojee as Group CEO. So he will take some time.  We had 
originally scheduled Mr Mantsha the Chairperson but he was 
not available or his legal team were not available tomorrow 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 175 of 213 
 
so they have had to be accommodated later in the week.  
And because other people have been – have been arranged 
for other dates it has not been possible at short notice to 
shift somebody in.  So I have explained to Mr Mhlontlo who 
is present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That we may – might not get to his 
evidence at all today or he might only be called at a fairly 
late stage as is now happening and that he must be – 
although he is obviously inconvenienced if he has to spill 
10 
over to until tomorrow.  We have indicated that that will be 
required if we cannot finish today if we start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well I just want to make an 
assessment about tomorrow.  With Mr Ntshepe you say you 
contemplate he might not take the whole day. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On his own. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your assessment of – if we start at 
ten tomorrow as we plan to what is your estimate of by when 
20 
he might be done or you might be done? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I would think probably three hours 
Chair.  Yes probably three hours we think,

Page 178 of 213 
 
provided the Commission's teams two statements/affidavits 
Chair.  They are both to be found in the same Denel bundle, 
Bundle 07 which we were using earlier with the last witness 
and they form part of Exhibit W20.  If I may take the witness 
to the 1st affidavit to identify it and then likewise the second, 
and then we will ask for them to be formally admitted.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
EXAMINATION BY ADVOCATE KENNEDY SC:   Good 
afternoon, Mr Mhlontlo. 
MR MHLONTLO:   Good afternoon Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mhlontlo, If I could ask you in the 
bundle in front of you, when I give page numbers I'm going 
to give you page numbers according to the top left, not the 
top right and it is black print and not the one in red, and I 
will miss out the first letters, the Denel 07 and just give you 
the last three digits, okay? 
MR MHLONTLO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So the first affidavit, the statement I 
would like to take you to is at page 6.  Sorry, 568.   
MR MHLONTLO:   Ja. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your first statement?  
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes, it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I can ask you please to go to 
page 575? 
MR MHLONTLO:   575. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 179 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your signature Above the date 
of 19 July 2019? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Indeed it is.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  This was not signed before a 
commissioner of oaths.  Is that right?  
MR MHLONTLO:   That one was ...[indistinct] [speaker not 
clear] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So this is not an affidavit.  We will call 
it by its correct name which is statement.  The next... 
CHAIRPERSON:   At least be closer to the microphone 
10 
Mr Mhlontlo. 
MR MHLONTLO:   Ja.  Thank you, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The next document is from page 576. 
MR MHLONTLO:   576...  Yes, Chair.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is this your second statement?  
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes, it is. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it runs to page 596 and 7, 
excluding the annexures.  At 596, is that your signature 
above the date 7 October 2020?  
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes it is my signature.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Just pick up please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Raise your voice Mr Mhlontlo 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes it is my signature.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry?  
MR MHLONTLO:   It is my signature.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 180 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is your signature.  And this time you 
did in fact signed it before commissioner of oaths Where you 
took the oath.  
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes I did.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As we see at page 597.  Now 
Mr Mhlontlo, you told me a moment earlier during the tea 
adjournment that you have picked up a couple of errors 
relating to date that has been mistyped whatever subject to 
those corrections that we are going to ask you to take us 
through in a moment.   
10 
 
The first statement which you didn't swear under oath to 
in front of a commissioner of oath before.  you have 
obviously just taken an oath now to tell the truth and nothing 
but the truth, et cetera.  Have you been through the first 
statement from page 569?  568, I am sorry, to 575.  Have 
you been through them?  
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Those pages? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes I have been. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   and subject to the errors that you are 
20 
going to draw to our attention, do you in terms of the oath 
that you have now taken before the Chairperson, Do you 
confirm that the contents of the statement in fact reflect the 
truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes I do.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 181 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  And then you 
confirmed again under oath the correctness of the contents 
off your affidavit from page 576 to 596. 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes, I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Chairperson, may we then 
before we proceed to deal with the typing errors.  Maybe ask 
your leave to formally admit the statement from page 568 
and the affidavit from page 576 and the annexures that 
follow and that they should be admitted as in Denel Bundle 
07 as Exhibit W20? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the first one must have its own 
exhibit number and then the second one, its own exhibit 
number as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shall we do it that way? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I have happy to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so the first one will be Exhibit W20.  Is 
that right?  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement of Mr Fikile Mhlontlo 
20 
starting at page 568 is admitted as Exhibit W20. 
STATEMENT OF MR FIKILE MHLONTLO STARTING AT 
PAGE 568 IS SUBMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT W20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then of course the next one, can I – 
would probably need to be made W20.1.  Have not had 20.1 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 182 of 213 
 
in another bundle? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I do not believe so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So you ask that this one to be 
admitted as Exhibit W20.1? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement of Fikile Mhlontlo starting 
10 
at page 576 is admitted as Exhibit W20.1.  Thank you. 
STATEMENT OF MR FIKILE MHLONTLO STARTING AT 
PAGE 576 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT W20.1 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As you please Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mhlontlo, The typing or other 
errors.  are there any errors in the first statement that starts 
at page 568, that is Exhibit W20? 
MR MHLONTLO:   There is one on page 571, paragraph 3.4. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So it is page 571, paragraph 3.4.  what 
20 
does the correction?  
MR MHLONTLO:   Where it refers to a meeting in April 2009.  
It should be April 2010. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is April 2010? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 183 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And nothing else in this 
statement?  
MR MHLONTLO:   And nothing else on this statement.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
MR MHLONTLO:   And then the ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So then the affidavit from page 576.  
Anything in that?  
MR MHLONTLO:   And then if you go to page 576...  I am 
going to get to page...  Page 587, paragraph 5.3.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is page 573?    
10 
MR MHLONTLO:   No ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry.  At 587 you said.  
CHAIRPERSON:   587, Paragraph 5.3. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so Mr Mhlontlo? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MHLONTLO:   The paragraph that says during the 
orientation and he refers to 24 July 2020.  It should be 
24 July 2015. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Any other changes in the 
affidavit?  
MR MHLONTLO:   Then at page 18... 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry what page?  
MR MHLONTLO:   No, no, no.  I am just ...[indistinct] 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 184 of 213 
 
[Speaker not clear]  page 588  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   588.  Yes? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Paragraph 5.6  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes? 
MR MHLONTLO:   the line just before the last line within that 
paragraph, it talks of 14 September 015.  It should be 
14 September 2015. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Anything else?  
MR MHLONTLO:   And then the two last ones.  It is 5.7 and 
5.8.  there's a line that refers to the 10th of September.  It 
10 
says 2020.  It should be saying 2015.  And within the same 
paragraph, there it is also referring to September 2020.  it 
should be 2015.  Those are the typos that I wanted to point 
you to.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Now Chair, did you get 
both of those last two paragraphs? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   They can just do a short supplementary 
affidavit later on and send it to... 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  That will be done.  
Right.  What I propose to do is.  Is to deal with your first 
statement as it comes first in the file.  That is a fairly short 
statement and it just deals with a few issues.  Before we get 
to the meat of that, may you just confirm.  You used to be 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 185 of 213 
 
employed by the Denel.  Is that correct?  
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you were the financial director.  if 
I may take the witness through the, what I believe is 
uncontroversial evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In leading him Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  You ready financial 
director at the time that you - from 2008, October until you 
10 
left in September 2015.  Is that correct?  
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
And 
then 
you 
were 
placed 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
I 
see 
from 
paragraph 
one 
Mr Kennedy.  I see an answer to a question I raised earlier 
on about Africa, that it is a lady.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, it is Ms Africa.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was the company secretary, is that 
20 
right Mr Mhlontlo? 
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   and you say that you within placed on 
paid special leave together with Mr Salugi, the then Group 
CEO.  Is that right?  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 186 of 213 
 
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Ms Africa who was then the 
company secretary.  There were allegations, you say, who 
were unsubstantiated levelled by a new board.  It was never 
put, ultimately, to a disciplinary process.  Is that correct?  
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you then received a financial 
settlement 11 months later and you then - that allowed you 2 
then resign with effect from August 2016.  Is that correct?  
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So from September 2015 when you 
were placed on special leave, that is similar to a suspension.  
Is that right?  
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You were not working during the next 
year.  Is that right?  Until you actually resigned.  
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   but you were being paid a full salary 
during that period.   
MR MHLONTLO:   It is indeed so. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You agree.   Now Chair, If you would 
like, perhaps what is not being dealt with in the affidavit is 
the issue off the settlement that was reached with the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 187 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just traverse that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Mhlontlo, You have reached a 
financial settlement which then resulted in a disciplinary 
process not being pursued but you then you resigned.  is 
that correct?  
MR MHLONTLO:   A financial settlement was always offered 
in the process that eventually culminated in after 11 months 
into a settlement that was, on my side felt it was reasonable. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, it was what? 
10 
MR MHLONTLO:   And I felt on my side it was worth 
exploring which eventually I accepted.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You accepted it? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Was there a written settlement 
agreement? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Indeed, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you able to provide a copy? 
Otherwise, we will get a copy from Denel. 
MR MHLONTLO:   I will provide. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry? 
MR MHLONTLO:   I will provide one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You will provide one.  Thank you very 
much.  Chair, if we may file that in due course? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 188 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, would you like me to traverse 
the bottom line of that settlement? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like to.  I...   There is a thought 
whether I should say do not mention the amount but it is 
taxpayers money and I am thinking why should it not be 
mentioned.  Do you have any discomfort? 
MR MHLONTLO:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I will tell you why.  I do not know if you 
were here when I spoke about it earlier today.  You see, I 
have heard evidence relating to Eskom to the suspension of 
10 
executives at Eskom.   
 
And millions of rands were offered to each member, each 
of the executives who were ultimately – who ultimately 
resigned.  They believe that they were pushed out of Eskom 
because otherwise they still wanted to continue at Eskom.   
 
So they believed that they were being pushed out.  Now 
they were given large amounts of money as settlements.  
And one of the questions that I asked those members of the 
Eskom Board, who were board members of it at the time is, 
why they offered money or those large amounts of money to 
20 
those executives.   
 
Because they said to me here giving evidence that they 
were not the ones who wanted these executives to leave 
Eskom.  They said it is these executives who wanted to 
leave.   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 189 of 213 
 
 
But those executives have come here and said:  Either, 
we did not want to leave.  We said we wanted to go back to 
our work after – during suspensions.  Or, one of them said:  I 
have been writing letters to the board and the CEO in regard 
to my suspensions and wanting to be allowed to play a role 
in terms of the inquiry that was happening  but I was being 
ignored and I felt unwanted.   
 
Therefore, I said let us talk about my exit but I still 
wanted to work.  The other two said they wanted to go back 
and – but that was not being entertained by the board.   
10 
 
And after they had left or even before they left, there 
was a secondment of Mr Brian Molefe from Transnet to 
Eskom to take the position of CEO which had been occupied 
by a CEO who had been suspended and later on he became 
– he was appointed permanently.   
 
And one of the executives who had been suspended was 
the financial director, just like you were the financial director 
at Denel.  She had been suspended and she wanted to come 
back, according to her evidence.   
 
But according to her, the board or those members of the 
20 
board who were given the task of talking to her, did not want 
her to come back.  They encouraged her to look at a 
financial settlement.   
 
Ultimately, she was offered quite a large amount to 
leave.  And then Mr Anoj Singh who was seconded from 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 190 of 213 
 
Transnet to Eskom.  This was in March/April 2015.  That is 
the same year when your own suspensions at Denel 
happened.  Your suspension.  The suspension of Mr Salugi 
and the suspension of Ms Africa.   
 
And when one listens to how you – all of you got 
suspended, it is quite – it raises a number of questions.  One 
would still hear more evidence from people who made those 
decisions.   
 
But you were suspended for quite a long time.  From 
what I have heard from Mr Salugi and I see from your own 
10 
affidavit.  You were keen if the company thought there were 
grounds to discipline you.  You were keen to take part in a 
disciplinary hearing and be charged and answer for yourself.   
 
But ultimately, it looks like you were either given – you 
were either offered and offer that you felt that you could not 
refuse [laughing] in terms of the financial settlement.   
 
Or the three of you, maybe because of how long the 
suspension had taken and the fact that nothing seemed to be 
happening in terms of the disciplinary process.  You might 
have – some of you might have reached the point of:  Look, 
20 
let me just take the money and leave.   
 
Now that may or may not have been a way of getting rid 
of certain executives in order to bring other people as 
executives.  As I say, I will hear evidence from other people 
and see whether that is actually what happened, whether 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 191 of 213 
 
that was the reason.   
 
But when one looks at the Eskom suspension of the 
executives, one remains with certain questions along those 
lines.  And it may well be that in regard to your own 
suspensions, it may well be that there are similar elements.   
 
I do know, based on Mr Salugi’s evidence that Mr Salim 
Essa seems to have been quite involved as the new board.  
Well, the board or staring, actually even before the new 
board was starting was quite – had some interest in Denel.   
 
And in regard to the suspensions at Eskom, he has been 
10 
mentioned by certain witnesses as somebody who seems to 
have known the names of executives who were going to be 
suspended even before some of the board members knew.  
You see?   
 
So it then becomes necessary to say:  Is the Denel 
situation with regard to suspensions and ultimately the 
departure of yourself and Mr Salugi and Ms Africa, does it 
fall into a category of removals of executives who might not 
have been prepared to get involved in wrongdoings so that 
others who may have been taught, would not mind getting 
20 
involved in wrongdoings or might not – who have been 
taught to be prepared to assist certain people outside of 
Denel to achieve certain objectives.   
 
So it makes it necessary to look at these suspensions 
and the ultimate departure of these executives to say:  Well, 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 192 of 213 
 
was this legitimate?  Was the paying of this money justified 
the taxpayers money to achieve their removal justified?   
 
Because one would get fact of that may be the board 
would take the view that:   Look, if there is proper evidence 
of wrongdoing or misconduct on the part of the executives, 
let them be subjected to a disciplinary hearing.  If they are 
found not guilty, let them continue.  If they are found guilty, 
then they can be dismissed if the wrongdoing justifies 
dismissal. 
 
Rather than say:  Well, maybe even if there is no 
10 
sufficient evidence to find them guilty, let us offer them 
money.   
 
So I do not know what the situation is and I am keen to 
establish what the facts are so that these questions that I 
may have on my mind arising out of Mr Salugi’s evidence 
and your own affidavit maybe will be answered.   
 
So I wanted you to get that background.  Have you – do 
you feel comfortable to share the information or not 
comfortable? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not feel comfortable – if it – 
obviously – well, I assume it is in the settlement agreement.  
We would have it in the settlement agreement.  But I cannot 
promise you that when we get it, we will not talk about it 
publicly. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 193 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, before the witness answers, 
may I just assist? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry, I was not able to assist earlier.  
My attention has been drawn ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...to one of the annexures right at the 
end of the affidavit where, in fact, the settlement agreement 
is attached and it provides the figure.  And perhaps I can just 
take the witness to it? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What page is it? 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
The 
settlement 
agreement.  
Mr Mhlontlo, it starts at page 724.  It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did you say I must 
go to the second affidavit? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that is attached to the second 
affidavit, not the first.  Right at the end of the file Chair.  I 
think it is the very last annexure and it is at page 724.  It 
was not attached to the first affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I see it.  Yes.  Ja, you may take the 
witness there.  Well, if it is here, it is already a public 
document. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 194 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I proceed Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may proceed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Is this the settlement 
agreement that we have been discussing Mr Mhlontlo? 
MR MHLONTLO:   I confirm, yes. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
It 
is 
called 
Determination 
of 
Employment Agreement.  It provides on page 727 for a 
determination date being the 31 s t of August 2016.  Is that 
correct? 
10 
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can take you to right to the end, 
page 741? 
MR MHLONTLO:   I am on 741. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It appears from that, that the 
agreement was signed on the 25t h of July 2016.  Is that your 
signature at the foot of the page? 
MR MHLONTLO:   It is indeed my signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And above that, on behalf of Denel 
Stock Limited it is signed by Mr Zulake(?) and Tshepe.   
20 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes, it is. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Who happens to be the next witness 
that we intend to call.  Now if I can take you back to page 
720.  Sorry, 731.   
MR MHLONTLO:   [No audible reply]  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 195 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   At Clause 7 reads: 
“The employer shall continue to pay the employee 
his normal remuneration until termination date.” 
 
So at the time that you were signing this agreement at 
the end of July 2015, you were still in employment...  Sorry, 
2016.   
 
You were still in employment and you were still receiving 
salary and you would continue to do so until the termination 
date which was one month later.  Is that right? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then in addition to that, you will 
received a settlement payment in Clause 6.  Oh, sorry 
Clause 8, of R6 625 844, sorry, 644 rand.  So it is 
R 6 625 644,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What clause is that? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Eight point one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eight point one.  Okay alright.  Yes.  Do 
you confirm that Mr Mhlontlo? 
MR MHLONTLO:   I confirm Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you confirm what is set out in the 
rest of that clause that that amount of R 6 625 644 was an 
amount equivalent to your remuneration for 24-months? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 196 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shu!  Well, it is much more in terms of 
months than what the Eskom executives got in terms of 
months.  But the amount and round figure is more or less the 
same as some – as one or more of those executives.   
 
But they were – I think theirs were about 12-months 
except for one of them whose amount was equivalent to 18-
months.  I think.  Is that so?   
 
Oh, you would not know that Mr Kennedy.  That is 
another evidence leader who would know that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Eskom ones. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Fortunately, I do not have to deal with 
everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  Unfortunately, I have to.  Well, 
it is quite interesting.  It is quite interesting that the 
company thought you had misconducted yourself.  And I 
think based on your affidavit, they thought that you had been 
dishonest.  Is it not?   
 
That was one of the allegations that subjecting you to a 
disciplinary hearing.  They give you an amount equal to 24-
20 
months salary.  That is very strange.  Ja.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And that would be 
24-months in addition to the more than the 12-months that 
you were paid during the period of – or special leave with 
your suspension? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 197 of 213 
 
MR MHLONTLO:   Correct Chair.  And I would like also to 
draw you to Clause 11. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLONTLO:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes?  Is that incentive bonus? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Part of the settlement were clause 8.1 
and 11. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is the amount – and incentive 
bonus 
for 
the 
year 
ending 
2015/2016 
amounting 
to 
R1 656 411.  Did you receive that bonus? 
10 
MR MHLONTLO:   I confirm, Chair, yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So all in all you – if you take that 
amount into account, short term incentive bonus and the ex 
gratia payment you are looking at about 8 million, 9 
million? 
MR MHLONTLO:   About 8.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About 8.2 million.  Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I ask, Mr Mhlontlo, was that an 
additional settlement amount or was that something you 
would have been entitled to as an incentive bonus if you 
20 
had been normally employed? 
MR MHLONTLO:   This is a – clause 11, Chair, is an 
amount I would have been entitled to for the end of the 
2015/2016 year.  Now 2015/2016 year closed while I was 
on suspension and as the employees were paid incentives, 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 198 of 213 
 
I also qualified for that, as an employee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the incentive bonus, in order to 
qualify to be paid an incentive bonus in the company, were 
you not required to have done your job quite well? 
MR MHLONTLO:   I confirm, Chair, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is a requirement.  So they had no 
complaints about your performance, they cannot say they 
had any complaint if they gave you this bonus.  It is 
contradictory – it would be contradictory? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Chair, the standard way of interpreting 
10 
anyone qualifying for a bonus is the recognition that you 
have done your job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you have done your job well, to say 
the least. 
MR MHLONTLO:   Done your job well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you have done it excellently or at 
least the employer cannot give you this kind of bonus and 
complaint now that you are guilty of poor performance in 
terms of your job. 
MR MHLONTLO:   Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not – ja.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In the second 
affidavit …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe, Mr Kennedy, before we 
proceed. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 199 of 213 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able, Mr Mhlontlo, to tell me 
what the previous offers had been?  You said that this one 
was substantially better than a previous one or previous 
ones.  Are you able to tell me what kind of range the 
previous ones had been? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Chair, when we were suspended, on the 
night we were suspended, we were offered three months 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Three months pay? 
10 
MR MHLONTLO:   Three months pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if you agreed to resign? 
MR MHLONTLO:   If we agreed to resign on the spot. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MHLONTLO:   Then we went into mediation in 2016, I 
think it is about 8 February.  In that process the settlement 
was on the table, it was not specific in terms of what 
months we were to be offered other than to say there is a 
settlement available and which we insisted at that point 
that we would want to have our jobs, we would want to 
20 
engage 
with 
the 
board 
and 
clarify 
and 
explain 
any 
questions that they may be sitting with.  Then the process 
then 
went 
on 
to 
correspondence 
that 
came 
to 
our 
attorneys, separately this time.  With regards to Mr 
Saloojee, obviously was dealing with his contract of 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 200 of 213 
 
employment.  With regards to myself, it was also dealing 
with my contract of employment and wanting to engage on 
it and to question and test the validity because the board 
holds a view that my contract might have expired in 2013.  
Then when my attorney then pointed out to the board to 
say the mandate or the expertise of valid contract does not 
sit with the Chair of a disciplinary hearing, rather it sits 
with courts of the country and then the board seemed to 
have changed its approach because then it called us onto 
a – called me, individually, into a disciplinary hearing on 
10 
the 22 April of 2016.   
If you count from September to that time, number of 
months, and then even that disciplinary, it was never a 
disciplinary, it was more procedural, it was more looking at 
the policy, looking at who should gather evidence in order 
to seek to get – to hold me to account to certain 
allegations that were levelled against me, but there was 
nothing on the table.   
 
And then in that bundle that they provided, there 
was a correspondence that suggested that there had been 
20 
some investigation on us and that investigation did not 
really find anything of substance and that correspondence 
got to our file I think by mistake and that got tabled, not 
necessarily on the 22 April, but in the follow-up supposedly 
disciplinary hearing which was the 18 July. 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 201 of 213 
 
 
In the 18 July then we produced this letter and said 
but in the bundle you handed to us there is this letter that 
suggests that the whole investigation could – it could 
appear it was being steered in a certain direction and what 
does this correspondence really mean?  And the Chair of 
the disciplinary hearing ruled that look, even if there is this 
correspondence, the charges do not seem to be drawn from 
whatever 
is 
behind 
the 
correspondence 
because 
the 
correspondence was between the Chair of the board and 
the internal legal adviser. 
10 
 
Shortly thereafter, after that, again was not a 
proper hearing, was more another preparatory because 
there was no bundle, there was no evidence that they are 
point to wrongdoing which is now ten months down the 
line.   
 
And then shortly after that, then an offer for – I was 
called in and I was – an offer was made to say look, in 
terms of your contract, you got about 30 months left, look, 
if we cut it at 24 are you comfortable? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but during the entire 11 month 
20 
period, if it was 11 months of suspension, were there ever 
any documents that reflected facts that were placed before 
you by the board which supported the allegations they 
were making against you? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Chair, I would like to place on record, I 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 202 of 213 
 
was never subjected to a disciplinary hearing at all. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
nothing 
substantiating 
the 
allegations was ever given to you? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Of course, Mr 
Kennedy, I did say that even with regard to Mr Saloojee 
and Ms Afrika, we should try and get the settlement 
agreements and if Ms Afrika has not given us an affidavit 
we should try and get her affidavit as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We will certainly attend to that, to 
the extent it is not already dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Mhlontlo, you seem like you 
want to say something?  Yes? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Chair, is unfortunate because a lot of 
information 
ended 
up 
in 
public 
that 
make 
damaging 
remarks about us.  Unfortunately, at our fairly youngish 
age it curtails our opportunities to practice our skills and 
profession 
on 
matters 
that 
were 
never 
subjected 
to 
20 
processes even though we availed ourselves so much to 
say whatever level, we are happy to stand before the board 
or before whatever disciplinary committee they could put 
into place and it is a pity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess that part of the importance 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 203 of 213 
 
of you appearing before the Commission, as well as Mr 
Saloojee and Ms Afrika in due course, in terms of Ms Afrika 
and telling your story how you were suspended and how 
you ended up leaving Denel and stating that you were 
never found guilty of anything and actually you wanted to 
go through a disciplinary hearing but it was the employer 
who 
was 
delaying 
with 
the 
disciplinary 
hearing 
and 
ultimately it was the employer who offered you money that 
you felt was reasonable for you to leave.  That is important 
so that the public and potential employers that you might 
10 
approach might get to know that the circumstances of your 
departure do not seem to reflect anything negative that you 
might have been accused of.  
 
But, of course, the Chairperson of the board, Mr 
Mantsha, will come here and will give evidence.  We will 
hear their side of the story, it is just that on the face of it, 
if they were prepared to pay you 24 months’ salary for you 
to go, it is difficult to reconcile that with any view on their 
part that they had a strong case against you in terms of a 
disciplinary 
process 
because 
then 
they 
should 
have 
20 
subjected you to a disciplinary hearing and they should 
have abided by the outcome but he will come and he will 
put his side of the story.  Yes, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Your second 
affidavit 
refers 
to 
the 
process 
of 
negotiation 
which 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 204 of 213 
 
ultimately led to the settlement agreement that was being 
concluded.  If I can take you to page 593, you have made 
reference a number of times in your affidavit to your desire 
to clear you name in a disciplinary hearing and your desire 
that it should continue or proceed to actually be heard but 
at one stage you refer to management saying that they 
insisted that if the matter is to be resolved it would have to 
be on the basis that you should leave the company and 
agree on a financial settlement.  In fact, may I take you 
back to page 591?  You refer to the mediation process and 
10 
your attorney Ms Hlohlela sending correspondence and 
there were mediation proceedings held on the 8 February 
2016 and then you say: 
“Our stance was that there was no basis for our 
suspension and that we should return to work in 
circumstances where Denel could not illustrate any 
impropriety.  Denel still insisted as a nonnegotiable 
that we depart from the company and agreement on 
a financial settlement.” 
Was that their attitude right till you finally agreed to sign 
20 
the settlement agreement? 
MR MHLONTLO:   It is correct, in fact it was the centre of 
what was their submission or their side of the – or 
submissions in the mediation process that  they believe 
what had happened up until that time had leads trust 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 205 of 213 
 
issues and they would then put forward that we should 
explore a financial settlement. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can take you to the following 
page, 593, you refer to a disciplinary hearing session held 
on the 18 July 2016 at CDH offices.  That is the firm of 
attorneys were representing the employer, is that right? 
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you referred to that: 
“Only discussing preliminary issues, the failure by 
Denel to produce documents and there were a few 
10 
documents 
that 
had 
been 
received 
not 
being 
satisfactory.  My legal representative also tabled 
the letter at page 74 and 75 of the Denel, requested 
the Chair of the hearing to read the letter and 
employer to explain what the letter in reality means 
further, challenging the position of the employer 
that the Dentons’ report is not a document they are 
relying on for this case.  The Chair ruled that he 
continued to consider the Dentons’ report as not 
key to the case, as argued by the employer.  Denel 
20 
was still not ready to prosecute me on the charges 
tabled and no file listing charges and placing 
documents providing guilt even ten months after we 
were suspended.  Disciplinary hearing was then 
postponed to the 3 August.” 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 206 of 213 
 
So you had been suspended, ten months later when there 
were various meetings in relation to a disciplinary process 
you still had not received even a charge sheet? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Chair, I had received a charge sheet but 
what I had not received is a bundle proving each point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLONTLO:   As to why the board holds a view that I 
am guilty of anything. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So there was no bundle of documents 
that the employer had produced to you for purposes of the 
10 
disciplinary enquiry that would substantiate if there was 
substantiation the charges that you had already been 
notified of, right?   And then you say in 7tion the charges 
that you had already been notified of, right?   And then you 
say in paragraph 533: 
“After ten months on paid leave only three formal 
meetings were held, March 16, failed mediation, 
April 26, preliminary administrative discussing that 
the 
employer 
present 
a 
file 
with 
appropriate 
evidence 
and 
July 
2016, 
another 
preliminary 
20 
administrative with similar emphasis.” 
If I might just stop there, in April 2016 there had been a 
discussion that the employer would produce a bundle of 
documents to pursue the charges at the next occasion.   
 
And then in July, some many months later, you were 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 207 of 213 
 
still discussing the need for them to provide you with such 
documents. 
MR MHLONTLO:   Chair, from April which was really a 
preliminary 
meeting 
drawing 
reference 
to 
policy, 
emphasising the party responsible to produce the evidence 
necessary to proof our guilt, it led to – from that time led 
to the meeting of the 18 July.  My expectation, because 
that session was against me myself only, was the bundle 
which charges with evidence that we would scrutinise with 
my attorney to plan our defence.   When it got to the 18 
10 
July there had been a ream and ream of documents that 
had been photocopied but they were not at all in a format 
that would be usable and prove guilt.  In fact, the 
discussion on the 18 t h was still emphasising that the 
employer needed to produce a proper file substantiating 
their issue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you continue in 5.34: 
“A few days later, whilst awaiting documents from 
Denel, I was surprised to receive a phone call from 
the Acting GCFO, Mr Odwa Mhlwana…” 
20 
That is the person who was acting in your stead, is that 
right? 
MR MHLONTLO:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   While you were on suspension. 
“He stated that he has a mandate…” 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 208 of 213 
 
Did he say who that was from? 
MR MHLONTLO:   If my recollection is correct it would be 
from the Chair of the board at the time. 
“...and that we should meet without the attorneys to 
consider a way forward.  My wife and I met Mr 
Mhlwana at the Baron Woodmead for lunch.  He 
tabled an amicable settlement with a financial 
package in exchange for my resignation whereas I 
continued to be keen through the process.” 
What do you mean by that? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To go through the process. 
MR MHLONTLO:   To go through the process, whereas I 
continued to be keen to go through the process, I 
considered that financial settlement was substantially 
better that the previous one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MHLONTLO:   And therefore it was clearing the way for 
me to accept. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I was asking you to explain through 
the process, meaning what?  The disciplinary process. 
20 
MR MHLONTLO:   The disciplinary process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so you were still keen to go 
through that process at that stage.  Why was that? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Very much so. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Why was that? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 209 of 213 
 
MR 
MHLONTLO: 
 
 
I 
am 
saying 
the 
offer 
came 
…[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, why were you still – I am sorry to 
interrupt, why were you still keen to go through the 
process if there was no settlement?  Were you still keen to 
clear your name? 
MR MHLONTLO:  Precisely.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Was that …[intervenes] 
MR MHLONTLO:   And one of the requests that I put 
forward to Mr Mhlwana was that there has got to be way in 
10 
which my name would be cleared.  If Denel is withdrawing 
the charges and giving me a financial settlement I would 
want my name cleared because my name was in the public 
domain, a CA who is purported to have done certain things 
and I was concerned about that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I might have a moment, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Mhlontlo, your statements 
do not seem to say anything, as far as I could recall, about 
your qualifications.  Did you say CA just now? 
MR MHLONTLO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are a CA? 
MR MHLONTLO:   I am a CA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, so you were concerned about 
the fact that you are a CA and your name in the public 
domain had been tainted because of what Denel had said.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 210 of 213 
 
Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so was the offer that was 
presented to you accompanied by your wife by Mr Odwa 
Mhlwana, was that the offer that was then agreed to as 
captured in the settlement agreement we have looked at? 
MR MHLONTLO:   On that date he gave a broad indication 
of, you know, in terms of my contract you are left with x 
number of months, if you are in agreement, I will speak to 
my principal of where we can potentially settle, but we 
acknowledge the overall number of months left in your 
10 
contract.  It was clear the direction in which it was going.  
We were then to meet a couple of days later, which we 
then met in Midrand where we then concluded the deal but 
the initial part of it was at the Baron in Woodmead. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, how much time was left?  Were 
you on a fixed term contract appointment? 
MR MHLONTLO:   I was initially appointed in October 2008 
as a permanent employee.  When Mr Saloojee joined the 
company in 2012, he said look, in an executive position as 
yours, it is not ideal to be on a permanent appointment or 
20 
permanent employment.  His mandate is that he must 
explore placing all of us on a temp contract, which was a 
five years from that time.  So when this unfolded, it was 
within the context that my original employment contract 
had an addendum already that specified as to when I would 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 211 of 213 
 
exit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was it 24 months that was left? 
MR MHLONTLO:   It was about 30 months that was left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About? 
MR MHLONTLO:   About 30 months that were left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MHLONTLO:   And the settlement was over 24 months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, may I now refer the witness, 
please, Mr Mhlontlo, to your paragraph 535 on page 593 
10 
where you refer to the fact that even after the settlement 
there were damaging media statements.  What are you 
referring to here? 
MR MHLONTLO:   There is a specific statement which was 
made that we, without following appropriate governance 
processes, we have changed the borrowing arrangements 
with a financial institution and whereas that  - in fact, how 
that happened, unfolded differently the way as put out 
there, as casting aspersion on us, saying we are bad, we 
are this and that and I was concerned about it, but we will 
20 
deal – I suppose we will cover it at some point.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you make reference at the 
foot of the page to your removal being seen largely in the 
same way as that of exited senior executives at Eskom in 
2014.  Seen by whom and in what way? 
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 212 of 213 
 
MR MHLONTLO:   There was a lot of media coverage that 
was attributing our exit to the same circumstances that 
were prevailing elsewhere.  I take a view that I am not 
necessarily going to join the speculation, but I am just 
pointing out factually what I was seeing covered in the 
press. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
think 
the 
suspensions 
of 
executives at Eskom was 2015 rather than 2014, if I am not 
mistaken.  But it is okay, it is not necessarily material.  
10 
Yes, okay, let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  We have dealt 
with the issue now of the package. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which came in the very introductory 
sections that I was just taking him through his employment 
history and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We will need to proceed to deal with 
the meat of his first affidavit and in the second and the 
20 
second will include consideration in some detail of the 
circumstances of his and his colleagues’ suspension.  May 
I suggest, unless you would like me to continue, that we 
can deal with that tomorrow? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, we can do that tomorrow.  
09 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 302 
 
Page 213 of 213 
 
Okay, let us adjourn and then we will resume tomorrow.  
So, Mr Mhlontlo, we will continue with your evidence 
tomorrow morning at ten.  Okay, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 10 NOVEMBER 2020
