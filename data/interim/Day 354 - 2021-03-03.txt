PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 03 MARCH 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Masuku had you completed your 
discussion with your client or did you wish to have some 
time? 
ADV MASUKU:  No we have completed.  We have 
completed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay alright.  Good morning Mr 
10 
Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Good morning Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like the technicians have done 
something to make sure nobody complains that they cannot 
hear me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
alright.  The 
oath 
you took 
yesterday Mr Molefe will continue to apply today. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just – just before resumption this 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 4 of 163 
 
morning Chairperson my learned friend for Mr Molefe had a 
discussion with me which we raised with – we brought to 
your attention in chambers.  It relates to the statement of 
Mr Ephron – Clinton Ephron which is in the Tegeta 
Reference Bundle – Eskom Bundle 18 on page 352.  The 
point being raised is that this statement is not under oath.  
I should however confirm that it is signed by Mr Ephron but 
it is not under oath.  My learned friend was concerned that 
whereas his client is testifying under oath and has given 
an affidavit he might be found to perjure himself if he does 
10 
not tell the truth whereas Mr Ephron who simply submits a 
statement not under oath a similar find or same finding can 
be made against him.  So we have given my learned friend 
an undertaking that we will ask Mr Ephron to re-submit the 
statement under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV MASUKU:  Sorry I think the extent of our – of my 
understanding is that it is not just a submission of the 
statement under oath but that he might come and testify in 
which case we would be – we would consider whether or 
20 
not to – to cross-examine him on what his statement under 
oath contains. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine based on you will 
exercise whatever options you might have. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 5 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Do you… 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chairperson yesterday as I was giving 
evidence I said that Mr Ramaphosa was I think Chairman of 
Optimum and my reference was a magazine article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just raise your voice a bit. 
MR MOLEFE:  My reference was a magazine article. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  In my footnotes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And Mr Seleka pointed out that Mr Ephron 
disputes this and says that Mr Ramaphosa was never 
Chairman of the – of Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But last night I was able to print a 00:03:51 
announcement 
from 
Optimum 
which 
is 
a 
JSC 
announcement when a listed company makes changes and 
20 
it lists Mr Ramaphosa as being appointed as a non-
executive 
director 
and 
chairman 
of 
the 
company 
– 
Optimum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  It is dated the 25 t h of March 2017.   
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 6 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  2017? 
MR MOLEFE:  The 26 t h of March 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 12. 
MR MOLEFE:  12 yes.  And the following day three other 
publications ran with the announcement over and above 
the one that I quoted yesterday which was independent on 
line, Engineering News and Mining MX.  So in my opinion I 
think that there is sufficient evidence to show that Mr 
Ramaphosa was indeed chairman.  It is just convenient 
that Mr Clinton Ephron did not say what he was saying 
10 
under oath.  In fact I note that even his first statement to 
the commission was not under oath which is very strange.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am… 
MR MOLEFE:  Sorry the statement was not under oath.  He 
did not make an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Ephron. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ephron yes – Optimum.  Optimum never 
made an affidavit to this commission they just gave their … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not aware.  Well Mr Seleka you did 
not lead Mr Ephron’s evidence but you… 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would have read his earlier 
statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have indeed read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well they – your junior could check. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 7 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it is – it is a statement I can 
confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I know he was called.  I do not 
know whether he testified in person or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did testify in person. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But his – the statement that he submitted 
was not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was not under oath. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Was not – was not an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay what – what your junior could 
check on you were continuing I would imagine that if he – 
if his statement was not under oath I would have imagined 
that when he started his evidence he would have been 
asked to confirm under oath that what was in his statement 
was true and correct so – so that if he said that that would 
take care of that statement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if he did not confirm it then it would – 
20 
it would be 00:06:23 that but your junior can check for us 
and in due course maybe I can be told what the position is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But certainly in regard to the one – the 
most recent one you have indicated that you will ask him 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 8 of 163 
 
to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He will be asked to re-submit it under 
oath. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chairperson., 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And I think that Mr Molefe the 
publications to which you have just referred those could be 
submitted to the legal team and ultimately – no, no they 
will come to you – Mr Seleka’s junior will come to you and 
– and take those.  So there will be evidence.    So at a 
10 
certain stage then they should be submitted as exhibits at 
some stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson similarly the 
opening statement of Mr Molefe which he read from the last 
time on his appearance should also be admitted as an 
exhibit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it was not done last time it must still be 
done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I do not think it was because he 
needed to make corrections on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 9 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja I was speaking to my learned friend 
so that we can get the corrected … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Version of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  The corrected versions was submitted the 
following day. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well my learned friend was saying they 
have not. 
MR MOLEFE:  No, no.  
10 
ADV MASUKU:  So my instructing attorney they will have 
sent it the commission.  I did not know that but.  The 
Malaba Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay can you just say – can Mr Molefe’s 
instructing attorneys just electronically send it to the legal 
team. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  What I am going to 
do during the course of the evidence I will make a copy of 
20 
the – well depending on when we get it because I want to 
go through Mr Molefe’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  During the course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is okay. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 10 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Yes Mr Molefe let us 
proceed when – when you – when we ended yesterday I 
went to listen to the recording you were talking about the 
President being the Chairperson of the War Room and that 
they required too much details in the War Room.   
 
There were two aspects.  There was the cooling off 
period, a lot of details required and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there not something you wanted to 
10 
also inform me about with regard to… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The President. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  That is in 
relation to Mr Molefe’s statement.  As the Chairperson had 
directed we provided the President with your statement Mr 
Molefe together with your affidavits.  The Chairperson – 
then you asked me yesterday whether Mr President has 
responded.  I did not know at that stage but I now I know 
that he actually has not.  I got a message from his office 
20 
that they have decided to wait until the – Mr Molefe has 
fully testified in order to file a written response or affidavit.  
So that is the position.  We have not received anything 
from the President yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 11 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  But Chairperson if it was a 3.3 were they 
not required to say even before I testify whether they will 
like to cross-examine of is it done after I have testified? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – the rules of the commission 
are to the effect that if you have been served with a Rule 
3.3 Notice to say somebody has submitted a statement or 
affidavit that implicates you or may implicate you you have 
certain rights which you must decide whether you exercise 
10 
them or not.  One of which is whether you are going to 
apply for leave to cross-examine that person.  You must do 
that within fourteen days after receiving the – the 3.3 
Notice but there is provision for condonation if you are late 
and you provide an explanation why you were late and the 
Chairperson can condone or not condone after hearing 
what the explanation is.  But it is not – you are not obliged 
by virtue of receiving a Rule 3.3 Notice.  What you are 
obliged – when – the time when you are obliged to file an 
affidavit is when you receive a Regulation 10.6 Directive 
20 
from the Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So under Rule 3.3 it is up to you if you 
want to respond.  But the commission may decide that even 
if you did not want to respond it wants an affidavit from 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 12 of 163 
 
you.  In that case it can ask you to provide an affidavit if 
you cooperate and respond and provide it then no 10.6 
Directive needs to be issued.  If you do not provide it then 
you can be compelled.  But at this stage it is a 3.3 Notice 
situation.   
MR MOLEFE:  So will it be correct to say that the – in 
terms of the Rule 3.3 I do not know what they call it 
00:13:13 the days which is fourteen days 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the fourteen days. 
MR MOLEFE:  Those have lapsed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Because it was the 15 t h January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  So they have to apply for condonation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you… 
MR MOLEFE:  If they decide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If they decide ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ja just to recap and 
20 
you will assist me Mr Molefe yesterday about the War 
Room and the President being the Chairperson of the War 
Room I think one of the aspects you raised was that you 
were and I am paraphrasing either surprised by the amount 
of detailed information that they required.  Is that – is that 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 13 of 163 
 
correct?  That they required a lot of detail. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you did not know why they required 
so much detail?  Did you or did you not? 
MR MOLEFE:  Did I what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know why they required that 
much detail? 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you seek to engage to find out why 
they required so much detail? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  No the amount of detail that was required 
was in fact not even my evidence here.  There are people 
who came here that talked about the War Room – that 
spoke about a lot of detailed things required all the time.  I 
think one of them may have been Ms [?] Mkholo and one or 
two other people from the board who were talking about 
the War Room and the fact that they were not being told 
what is happening at the War Room.  They are the people 
that talked about details.  So I – I did attend once and I 
made a presentation where the President was present 
20 
about our strategy to eliminate load shedding and that was 
a very detailed presentation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Okay.  Well that is important to 
know because you see yesterday when you testified it 
sounded like this is information that you knew firsthand 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 14 of 163 
 
about that they wanted so much details.  So we went away 
yesterday after the adjournment with the impression that 
this you knew yourself that that is what was being 
required.  But I think it is important now that you clarify in 
fact you are simply relying on what you heard other 
witnesses testimony.   
MR MOLEFE:  And I did go to a meeting where we made a 
presentation that was very detailed on our strategy to 
eliminate load shedding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but that is one thing because you 
10 
are not complaining about that. 
MR MOLEFE:   No that was a typical detail that was 
required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know whether we should 
bother … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About details until somebody says the 
amount of detail they required means XYZ. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or this is the conclusion to be drawn 
20 
from that.  So otherwise if Mr Molefe simply says I was 
surprised by the amount of detail they wanted and does not 
go beyond that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure that we need to spend more 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 15 of 163 
 
time on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But the point is this Chairperson 
whereas Mr Molefe appears to be complaining about the 
details required Minister Lynne Brown says in her affidavit 
that she met with President Zuma who was raising 
concerns with her that the executives were not supplying 
sufficient or accurate information to the War Room.  So it 
was according to Minister Lynne Brown a very specific 
complaint of President Zuma at the time.  So what the War 
Room then was doing in its request for information it would 
10 
have been in compliance with what the President had 
required as communicated by the Minister or at least to 
address that concern which the President had raised with 
her. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well to the extent that you are saying 
that the issue relates to whether there was – there were 
justifications for any complaints about the adequacy or 
otherwise of the information provided to the War Room 
maybe there might be something. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want us to make sure that we 
use the time with – that we have for important issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MR MOLEFE:  But Chairperson my understanding is that I 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 16 of 163 
 
am here to help the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And to assist the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  And the investigating team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOLEFE:  If there is an interest in the amount of detail 
that was required and the amount of detail that was 
submitted because there has been evidence here that 
meetings were held every Friday morning at seven o’clock 
10 
and in those meetings Eskom officials were required to 
submit reports.  Perhaps the investigating team can go to 
Eskom and ask for those reports and the requests for 
information and see exactly what was in there rather than 
to seek to ask of me to give evidence about those reports 
and what was in them and what was the amount of detail 
that was in them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  The information is at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see one of the things we have got 
20 
to 
as 
a 
commission 
guard 
against 
is 
following 
up 
everything. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When we have very limited time. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 17 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have got to use our time optimally. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We must not waste time following things 
that – whose relevance or importance is not clear you know 
when there may be things that are clear. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is why I am saying to Mr Seleka 
what is this about the amount of detail so I am – I am 
wanting to be satisfied that we are spending time on 
important issues.  If somebody demonstrates to me that to 
10 
– for the commission to look for those reports you know is 
important in terms of the Terms of Reference of the 
commission in terms of what we are looking for then by all 
means but I must just be satisfied that we use our time that 
is left optimally.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  That is correct Chair. 
MR MOLEFE:  On the other hand Chairperson  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  It might be interesting to find out if the 
issue of coal supply and Glencore did come up during 
20 
those meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
That 
might 
be 
interesting 
for 
the 
commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 18 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:  I am not saying that it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  I am just saying that this is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And if you really, really want to get to the 
truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  This is the route that you can take and it is 
up to you to decide whether it is important or relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  No that is fine. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  You know I do not make too much 
about the information itself that was required Mr Molefe all 
I am trying to show is that you see the War Room had a 
mandate. 
 
The 
War 
Room 
was 
phased 
with 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
Eskom 
and 
the 
President 
has 
– 
had 
established it, put the Deputy President there and the 
President had raised concerns according to the Minister 
that we must get information sufficient for the War Room.  
So when the War Room required information as it did it did 
it on the mandate of the President. So I am contrasting 
20 
that with your complaint that they required a lot of details.  
Because I do not know what you make of that request 
which is a request in compliance with the President at the 
time and that is all I wanted to show you nothing more – 
there is nothing more than that. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 19 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Seleka during the existence of the War 
Room all they wanted was information.  I cannot recall that 
they did anything meaningful to stop load shedding from 
the 
information 
that 
was 
submitted 
on 
those 
Friday 
mornings.  That is what frustrated me as an incoming Chief 
Executive that we had a 
challenge which 
was load 
shedding.  Load shedding required positive action and not 
just endless meetings where we just request information all 
the time.  My feeling and this was my evidence – my 
feeling was that the War Room was just requesting 
10 
information and it was not clear for what purpose and what 
it is that they were going to do with it and I could not see 
specific, positive, decisive interventions that were being 
made to stop load shedding which is why I went and just 
focussed on load shedding until we got it right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long did the – for how long was the 
War Room there – do you remember more or less? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not remember but it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A year; two years? 
MR MOLEFE:  I cannot remember it started before I got 
20 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And while I was there it was there for 
another two months.  Load shedding ended in August 2015 
it was long after the War Room had been closed down. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 20 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And just to finalise on this because you 
say in your opening statement you did say you – you then 
stopped attending the meetings of the War Room. 
MR MOLEFE:  To go and focus on the issue at hand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So the answer is yes.  What – 
what I am trying to say to you is this in – look at – look at 
the 
treatment 
you 
received 
visa 
vie 
the 
suspended 
executives.  Prior to their suspension Minister Lynne Brown 
goes to the meeting of the board and one of the issues is 
10 
exactly 
that 
the 
executives 
are 
not 
giving 
sufficient 
information.  It is an allegation.  Not giving sufficient 
information to the War Room or inaccurate information has 
been given.  And it is one of the issues she articulates as 
issues of her concern board members says she is not going 
to protect anybody anymore and identifies areas of – of 
functions where the four executives has to step down.  
They get suspended three never come back but you stop 
attending the board – the War Room meetings and you do 
so with complete impunity.  So what – what makes this 
20 
change of attitude towards you visa vie people like Mr 
Matona and the FD Ms Molefe, Mr Dan Marokane? 
MR MOLEFE:  Maybe. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But that is – that is what you know it is 
intriguing. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 21 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Maybe they should have stopped attending 
the War Room. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Maybe what? 
MR MOLEFE:  Maybe they should have stopped attending 
the War Room.  But … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But they were being compelled to go – 
compelled to give information. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson I do not think that I can 
comment on the suspension of the executives.  I was not 
there, I was not involved.  In fact some of them I have 
10 
never even met and I sought deliberately not to involve 
myself in the issue of the suspended executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But can I explain my question to you? 
MR MOLEFE:  I also do not – would not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let him finish. 
MR MOLEFE:  Would prefer not to compare my approach to 
their approach.  I deliberately when I got to Eskom said 
that I would like to view this problem with a fresh eye 
without the baggage of what had happened or had just 
happened.  So the issue of the suspended executives did 
20 
not feature at all in my strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  To try and eliminate load shedding.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  That was my priority number 1 to eliminate 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 22 of 163 
 
load shedding and that did not involve going back to what 
my predecessors did, the privileges they enjoyed or did not 
enjoy or what the fight between them and the board had 
been.  So I am afraid Chairperson I cannot comment on the 
issue of the suspension of the executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes but I was asking you to 
comment on a different aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were asking to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For him to comment on a different 
aspect.  I am saying the differences in the treatment that 
10 
you receive and they receive is what calls for comment.  
You stop attending the meetings with impunity nothing 
happens to you.  They are trying hard to assist the War 
Room to give information. There is a complaint that no you 
are not giving us correct information, you are not giving us 
adequate 
information 
you 
are 
giving 
us 
inaccurate 
information and it is one of the Minister ’s concern when he 
comes – when she comes to the meeting on the 11 t h. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ultimately leads to their suspension.  It 
20 
is not the suspension you need to comment on it is the 
differences in the treatment meted out to you and them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Treatment by whom? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chairperson? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 23 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Treatment by whom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Treatment meted out by the shareholder 
representative and the board. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because it is the board and the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – but are you comparing the same 
things?  Would you not have to say if you want to check 
whether the board and the Minister treated them the same 
10 
way they – they suspended executives and him would you 
not have to say if you are comparing the fact that 
according to the knowledge of the Minister well – or and 
the 
board 
they 
were 
accused 
of 
not 
giving 
correct 
information to the War Room or they were accused of 
giving sometimes giving conflicting information about for 
example the financial position of the company I think that 
was one of the things that was mentioned. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you not have to say – to say he 
20 
did the same and he got different treatment?  But I do not 
hear you saying he was accused of supplying incorrect 
information and so on.  Would you not need to be dealing 
with that situation in order to compare properly? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair – Chair we do not – well 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 24 of 163 
 
there is no – I hear what the Chairperson is saying there is 
no allegation in regard to – I mean an allegation made 
either by the Minister or the board to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But at the level of inadequate 
information the executives were alleged to have provided.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And this is an allegation because they 
have come here to deny those things too.  You see an 
effort, at least on their evidence on their part, to cooperate 
10 
with the War Room.  And it is at that level that I am 
pitching it.  But then you hear Mr Molefe said:  Well, I 
stopped going to the War Room.  So it is only at that level 
that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but  ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...I am pitching this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not the same.  They did not stop.  
He stopped. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there is no accusation that he 
20 
provided the War Room with incorrect information or 
conflicting information.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, correct.  Because is it not 
that there are two aspects Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 25 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As the Chair is saying, they did not 
stop but they were accused, amongst others, of not 
providing sufficient information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the case of Mr Molefe.  When he 
stopped to participate, that means he will not provide any 
information to the War Room.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you can provide information 
10 
without attending meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, he will have to answer that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I am not sure that it comes 
across the way you really want. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see the Chair has ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no...  They were accused of 
providing incorrect information or conflicting information or 
are not providing adequate information. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot remember ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...if that was all of the above. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 26 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no such an accusation, that we 
know, was levelled against him but he says he stopped 
attending the War Room. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And also, from the board’s side, 
remember that from the board’s side, as far as the 
suspension of the executives are concerned, they have all 
made 
the 
point, 
those 
who 
have 
testified, 
that 
the 
suspension was not based on any wrongdoing on the part 
of the executives but they wanted that the inquiry, once it 
10 
started its work, they should not be there because their 
presence could indeed – the inquiry.   
 
But what is true is that when the Minister spoke 
to the board room the morning of 11 t h of March 2015, she 
did, among other things, raised a complaint that the War 
Room was being provided with either inadequate or 
incorrect or conflicting information by the management. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Yes.  Okay.  So I was taking just 
one aspect of that Chair. 
MR MOLEFE:   But...but ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That deals with... 
MR MOLEFE:   [Indistinct]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...Mr Molefe... 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear.] 
MR MOLEFE:   If I may? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 27 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
The 
treatment 
by 
the 
Minister 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...by the Minister ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or the board? 
MR MOLEFE:   ...action ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or the board?   
MR MOLEFE:   ...action or inaction ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   ...by the Minister or the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I would not be in a position to speculate or 
to say why they acted or not acted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is fair. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is fair.  Because we are looking at 
that against the background Mr Molefe of what has been 
presented here as evidence before the Commission, that 
essentially, and the essence of the evidence that you were 
20 
earmarked to come – to be placed at Eskom, at the 
essence 
of 
it, 
even 
before 
the 
Minister ’s 
decision 
announced on the 17 t h of April 20215.  So I am putting that 
to you in the context of that information.  So but if you say 
you cannot remember, that is fair enough. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 28 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in a...   Mr Molefe, the question is.  
Do you know anything about you having been earmarked 
even prior to... Is it prior to the secondment Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Prior to the secondment been 
announced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, oh.  Ja.  Or maybe you want to 
indicate, more or less, from when the earmarking is said to 
have happened. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, if we take it from 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously before the announcement at 
some stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That decision had been taken that he 
was the right person. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know whether that is earmarking 
but he would have been identified. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  If we take it from by who?  If we 
take 
it 
from 
the 
evidence 
from 
Mr 
Henk 
Bester 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...who is told by Mr Salim Essa in 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 29 of 163 
 
2014. 
MR MOLEFE:   And then earmark by Mr Salim Essa? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am using the word to convey the 
message of the evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That we will show you how powerful we 
are.  We have decided who is the next board of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think you need to ask it directly 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think last time it was raised. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think Mr Molefe did not have any 
comments on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was raised that the evidence placed 
before the Commission by...  What is the name of the 
witness Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Henk Bester. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Henk Bester, is that he had the 
20 
meeting in – at some stage in 2014 with Mr Salim Essa. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In relation to some job that his company 
had obtained from Transnet and Mr Salim Essa wanted and 
Mr Henk ...[intervenes]  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 30 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so he wanted Mr Henk Bester 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, to agree that Mr Essa’s company 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...be involved in that job and he was 
resisting that approach and he said Mr Salim Essa said to 
him something to the effect that, we are – and it is 
10 
speculation who we was referring to – are very powerful.  I 
can tell you that we have already decided that the next 
boss of will be Mr Brian Molefe.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you may – you might say:  I know 
nothing about that.  You might say:  I know about it.  It is 
because they had talked to me and they said they think I 
will be the right person to take Eskom forward because 
20 
there are challenges at Eskom and I said I would have no 
problem or, you might say:  I know nothing about that.  
Mr Salim Essa never spoke to me about that.  Or...  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   I know nothing about it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thank you. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 31 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Furthermore, I do not know Mr Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   And I have never met him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not even know what he looks like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Molefe, let us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe to complete it. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know Mr Salim Essa.  Is 
there anybody, whether in government or outside of 
government, who had spoken to you about their wish or 
their desire for you to go and be the CEO at Eskom? 
MR MOLEFE:   As I said it was the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   And only the Minister ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...during a function at the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that 2014 or 2015? 
MR MOLEFE:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am talking about 2014? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 32 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   ...it was just before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry?  Just before ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Just before.  Maybe ten days or so before 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the announcement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Or even less than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that is 2014...  2015, April. 
MR MOLEFE:   2015, ja.  You see, this is what she said:  
10 
We have a very serious problem at Eskom.  They will not 
be even able to pay salaries.  I am concerned about what 
is going on there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Would you agree ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...if we seconded you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...to Eskom to just assist us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   ...out of this crisis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And I said:  Minister, if that is what yourself 
and the government would like to do, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 33 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you did testify about that the last 
time. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  And that is the only ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the only person. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it was not 2014, it was 2015? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, can we just carry on that? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because – but then you only stayed for 
a year then Mr Molefe at Eskom? 
MR MOLEFE:   I was? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You only stayed for a year at Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:   I stayed for a year.  Or it is over – it was 
over a year. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To December 2016? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it was one and a half years? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Why? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, the...  Firstly, the load-shedding was 
under control, number one.  And number two, while I was 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 34 of 163 
 
seconded to Eskom ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now why did you only stay until 
December 2016? 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Why 
did 
you 
only 
stay 
until 
December 2016? 
MR MOLEFE:   I am trying to explain.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, explain Mr Molefe.  
Come closer to the mic or put it closer to you. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   When I was appointed, it was on an 
understanding that it will be for permanent employment so 
which is no fixed term of my contract and we concluded the 
– we – that – so that was the agreement that we would like 
to employ you.   
 
You 
will 
be 
employed 
as 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Executive and here in Eskom the Group Chief Executive 
not on a fixed term contract.  My fixed term contract at 
Transnet had actually been renewed for another five years 
at the time.  And I agreed, we exchanged letters and I was 
20 
appointed. 
 
I believe that after I had been acting for six 
months, the board or the Minister could make a decision to 
confirm me into the position and that is what happened. 
 
Soon after I was appointed and received the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 35 of 163 
 
letter and the contract, we got the message from the 
Minister ’s office that says that the:  No, in fact, we wish to 
change your term to five years.   
 
And I said, but I have just signed a permanent 
employment contract... the terms of my employment.  And 
there was an exchange toing and froing between the 
chairman and the Minister ’s office about that situation. 
 
Because I was saying:  No, I do not think this is 
fair because I am permanently employed and now you 
converting my employment contract for five years.  Then 
10 
the board came with a solution that says that:  Well, when 
you leave we will regard you as having worked until the 
age of 63 or... 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are swallowing some of your words.  
I do not think they ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   No, they said:  When you leave, you will 
have been regarded as having completed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   As having worked up to age 60. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, at 60 retirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   And in fact, they took a resolution to that 
affect and then they prepared the five year contract which I 
signed.  And then in November 2016, Ms Madonsela 
released her State of Capture Report which I say I was not 
consulted...  I was... not asking... 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 36 of 163 
 
 
And which State of Capture Report I thought was 
very unfair and had a lot of things I thought I could explain 
but did not have the opportunity to explain but I was 
nevertheless tainted  
 
So I decided ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  You were, nevertheless...?  Oh, 
tainted? 
MR MOLEFE:   Tainted, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   I mean, the media was going on and on 
10 
about it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   Phone calls and so on and so forth.  And so 
I decided that perhaps it is best to leave.  Perhaps it is 
best to leave.  And then when I had to leave, I had to 
choose a vehicle by which I leave.  And then I activated 
that – an agreement that when I leave I will be regarded as 
having been leaving at 63.  So I applied for it.  And the 
board approved it and put me on pension.  So I left 
because I felt with these allegations it is not good to be at 
20 
Eskom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not good...? 
MR MOLEFE:   To be at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  So that is why I left. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 37 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that.  Why would it not be 
good to remain at Eskom in that situation? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, when you are the CEO and 
you are accused of corruption and all sorts of things, even 
when they have not proved, how do you face your 
employees every day because they will think that this guy 
is our CEO but there is a Public Protector Report. 
 
So in the Public Protector ’s report it said that:  
10 
Well, 
these 
allegations 
must 
be 
investigated. 
 
A 
commission of inquiry must be set up and you must report 
within 18-months.   
 
So even when I left I thought, okay, these 
allegations we will deal with them.  It will take about 18-
months to deal with that but those 18-months as CEO is 
anyway a greater part of my contract.  It will not be worth 
staying at Eskom for, for during that period. 
 
So I took early retirement as have been agreed 
with the board much earlier in February when there was a 
20 
dispute 
about 
converting 
my 
fixed 
– 
my 
permanent 
employment into five years and that was offered as a – I do 
not know...  to get me to sign the five year contract. 
 
So, ja, I did not consider it sustainable.  In 
anyway, as I said in my statement, it is good governance to 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 38 of 163 
 
step away when you are being accused of the things she 
was insinuating in her report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I, on a lighter note, I just want to 
say, you know, the English language is rich with words.  I 
just heard that you said – you said step away.  You did not 
say step aside.  And there is also step down.  Step down, 
step away, step aside.  [laughs] 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, ja.  I did not say it consciously with a 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  But taking retirement would mean that I 
do not return. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, just repeat that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Going on early retirement would mean that 
I will not return. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, that was early retirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to make sure that my understanding 
20 
is correct.  Is the position that the arrangement that had 
been reached between yourself and the board in terms of 
your 
employment 
after 
the 
Minister 
had 
said 
your 
appointment should be for five years.   
 
Is the position that the board – is the position 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 39 of 163 
 
that when you left or when you would be leaving at the end 
of the five years, you were going to be deemed who have 
worked with Eskom until age 60 and therefore obtain 
benefits, pension benefits that you would have obtained or 
would have been entitled to if you have worked up to that 
age?  Is that understanding correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, it says that when I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says when you leave. 
MR MOLEFE:   When I leave, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then – well, I do not know whether 
in mitigation there was any issue about whether when you 
leave meant when you leave at the – when you would leave 
at the end of five years ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or anytime. 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot remember how it was addressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...what was in the... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But the fact of the matter is that, when the 
time came – I wrote a letter that says:  I hereby apply for 
early retirement as per our earlier agreement and as per 
the rules of the pension. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 40 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   And that was – it is the sum total of my 
letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And then I got a letter back that says:  Your 
early retirement is approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   So, ja, the other technicalities...   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   So my early retirement was approved which 
10 
was why I was adamant that I had actually never resigned.  
I never put in a resignation letter.  I just said I would like 
to apply for early retirement.  I was under the impression 
that it was possible to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was what? 
MR MOLEFE:   Possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   To do so, to just apply for early retirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was a time of great confusion because it 
20 
was on the back of Thule Madonsela’s report.  And I – now 
I was feeling a lot of things Chairperson.  My permanent 
contract has been reduced to five years. 
 
And now here is a report from a Chapter 9 
institution which... and violated the rules of natural justice 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 41 of 163 
 
and the Constitution itself.  What do you do when a 
Chapter 9 institution violates your right to be heard?   
 
I felt very, very frustrated and angry at the whole 
thing and then I said, you know what, I am just going to 
early retirement.  They offered it to me anyway and I 
applied for it and it was approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MOLEFE:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And after you took the early retirement 
10 
Mr Molefe because you say your name was tainted, it was 
not good to stay at Eskom anymore.  Where did you go 
after that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I went home. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And was there another job after that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, then I was later on, I think maybe a 
couple of months later, approached by the North West 
ANC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   About how many months later? 
MR MOLEFE:   About two or three months later. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two or three months? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, around March I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  Asking if I would be prepared to be a 
member of the National Legislature of the North West. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 42 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I must ask you again to speak up 
mister ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, if I would be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice is going down more. 
MR MOLEFE:   If I would be prepared to be a member of 
the National Assembly.  They – well, they have asked if I 
would prepared to be a member of the National Assembly.  
And then I considered it and I said I would be.  It sounds 
like a good place to retire to, to just raise a point of order 
and so on.  So I agreed and they facilitated that I become 
10 
a member of the National Assembly for the North West 
Province. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you, by virtue of that, you became 
a member of Parliament? 
MR MOLEFE:   Then I became a member of Parliament. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Were you not similarly concerned 
about the report – I mean the taint of your reputation, 
assuming that role? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I came to Eskom and my role as the 
Chief Executive of Eskom.  So I saw it – and I thought that 
20 
we will deal with those issues at the right time in the 
Commission and so on which would be established within 
18-months. 
 
But it would not be right to be at Eskom... to 
Eskom.  So my problem was not taking up any other 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 43 of 163 
 
employment.  My problem was just at Eskom because the 
Public Protector ’s report was about Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So for how long were you in that 
position for the National Assembly? 
MR MOLEFE:   I think it was about two months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  And why two months? 
MR MOLEFE:   So while I was at the National Assembly, 
Ms Suzanne Daniels in fact came to see me in Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Came to see you in Parliament? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   And she said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just to get the timeframe correct.  As 
I understand the position.  You were sworn in as a member 
of Parliament in February 2017.  Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot remember if it was February or 
March but thereabout. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But thereabout? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  And she came to see me and said that 
the Minister is very concern but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is very? 
MR MOLEFE:   Concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Concerned, ja. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 44 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  About the board giving you early 
retirement when you have only worked for 18-months and 
the board ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   18-months you said? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, about 18-months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  And she would like to reverse that 
decision.  And I said to her, how is she going to reverse 
the decision because the egg is scrambled ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I think there is something. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, they are asking him to stay close 
to the microphone. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it possible to pull it closer or it is not 
moveable? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   I said:  How is she going to reverse that 
20 
decision because the egg is scrambled.  How do you 
unscramble 
a 
scrambled 
egg? 
 
I 
have 
taken 
early 
retirement, it has been approved, it has been approved at 
the Pension fund and now I am here.  So how do we 
reverse all of this?  And she said:  If it can be done, will 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 45 of 163 
 
you be amenable to doing it?   
CHAIRPERSON:   And the reversal that she was talking 
about, which she was saying the Minister was talking 
about, was going to entail what as you were speaking to 
her? 
MR MOLEFE:   That is what I was asking:  What does that 
mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   How do we unscramble this egg? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   And then she went there away and then 
came back again.  We had meetings, lot of meetings in 
Cape Town and in Pretoria to talk about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   And eventually, the proposal was, the legal 
opinion is that it was a mistake to approve my pension in 
the first place.  Early retirement can only be taken when 
you are 55.  I was 50.   
 
The board’s advise had been that it is possible 
to take a little time...   The reasons that mistake happened 
20 
is because it is in the rules of the pension fund that early 
retirement can only be taken at 55 with the approval of the 
board but the pension fund’s guidelines, which is a 
guideline for members, say 50. 
 
The person who were giving us advise or were 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 46 of 163 
 
giving the board advise, was – had the guideline and was 
referring to the guideline and had said to the board, at the 
time about the – because at the time it was... 
 
Well, if somebody goes before he is 55, would 
you be able to implement this resolution that you have and 
the answer was, yes, anytime above 50 or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  So she says that was a mistake.  It 
was a mistake to have approved your early retirement.  
And then I said:  Well, if it was a mistake to have approved 
10 
my early retirement, it means I was also mistaken to have 
applied for it because if I had known that the rules do not 
allow for it, I would not have applied for it in the first 
place. 
 
But in my head – my mistake, okay, my mistake 
would have seemingly fixed by official who knew that it 
could not be done, they should have not approved but they 
did but then I had applied for it. 
 
So we had laboured under a common mistake 
that I could apply for early retirement and that the board 
20 
could approve it.  And we had done that and it had been 
done. 
 
And then she said the legal advice was if a 
mistake is common to both parties, the legal solution is to 
revert to status quo...  which means revert to what the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 47 of 163 
 
situation was before the mistake happened which means 
...[intervenes]  
COUNSEL:   Chair, can I?  I am sorry to interrupt the 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
COUNSEL:   My instructing attorney informs me that the 
issue of the pension is before the – is still before the 
Court.  It is a matter pending before the court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
COUNSEL:   And Mr Molefe is referring to legal opinions 
10 
for which there is no waiver of confidentiality to the extent 
that the Commission may take note of that.  We would want 
to advise our client on the right he has to speak about a 
matter that is pending before a court and what the 
implications are for implicating that the legal opinions led 
him to the pension of which he is talking about.  Can we 
have five minutes or ten minutes to just speak to him so 
that we – we are holding on page(?) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
COUNSEL:   ..in relation to the evidence he seeks to give. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is...  I think that is fine.  
Mr Seleka, we could use this as a tea-break.  We are 
closing the tea-break. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay let us take this as a tea-break.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 48 of 163 
 
It is nine minutes past.  We will resume at twenty-five past. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue.  There is nothing 
to follow up, Mr Masuku, on – well …[intervenes] 
MR MASUKU:   Chair, I thought I would leave it to Mr 
Molefe to convey what our advice is to you rather than 
get... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is alright,  Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you, Chair.  Mr Molefe, do 
you want to go first? 
MR MASUKU:  Yes, Chair, my legal advice is that the 
matter is still pending before the court and that it is better 
to not deal with it here because it is still before the court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what I can say is that I think you – 
when the issue arose you were busy giving an explanation 
of why you state only four – I think you said two months in 
parliament. 
20 
MR MASUKU: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is what you were dealing 
with. 
MR MASUKU: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
There 
is 
some 
importance 
in 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 49 of 163 
 
understanding why.  If you are able for present purposes to 
give me that explanation without talking about a legal 
opinion if you have been advised not to be talk about it, 
that would be fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, as I have just said there was a desire to 
unscramble the egg and they thought we could return the 
situation to status quo ante but then that whole returning 
the situation to status quo ante became the subject of a 
legal dispute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  So Mr Molefe as the 
outcome of – the outcome of that exercise was that you 
returned to Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE: Yes, I did return. 
ADV SELEKA SC: You did.  So that is what, four months 
down the line? 
MR MOLEFE: Five.  Four, five, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC: Ja.  So the report of the Public Protector 
is still fresh at the time and I want to know from you were 
those concerns of the tainted reputation not good for you 
20 
to stay at Eskom, the problem was Eskom, how will you 
look at the employees in the eyes when the Public 
Protector has made these allegations against you?  Were 
you not there still? 
MR MOLEFE: Well, Chairperson, at the time – firstly time 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 50 of 163 
 
had passed and I have had time to come down and reflect 
on the issues and I was confident that there is nothing in 
the 
Public 
Protector 
that 
is 
sustainable. 
 
Secondly 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you were – just repeat that 
sentence about the Public Protector? 
MR MOLEFE: I was confident that there is nothing in the 
Public Protector ’s report that can be sustained as an 
allegation against me.  Secondly, the Public Protector had 
said within a short space of time a Commission of Inquiry 
10 
would be established and that in 18 months it would report 
back.  At that time a Commission of Inquiry was not in 
sight.  She had left the Commission, so she made ruling 
that somebody else must establish the Commission and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   She said the President should establish 
the Commission. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, somebody else, the President should 
establish the Commission.  So she said something that she 
herself was not going to do, said the President must 
20 
establish – and then there was controversy around the 
establishment of the – there was to’ing and fro’ing and it 
was just not happening.  I thought it looks like here we are 
going to wait for coming back of Nxele. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, for the coming back of? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 51 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE: Of Nxele. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nxele? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, the left handed one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE: He is the guy who escaped from Robben 
Island and said he would return and never returned. 
who escaped from Robben Island and said he would return. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe for the sake of the transcriber, it 
is N-x-e-l-e.  Ja, okay? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  So after six months of the Public 
10 
Protector ’s report nothing really was happening.  I think, 
ja, the Commission was being established.  I mean, they 
said 18 months, according to the Public Protector ’s report.  
It is now I think five years and so I had to decide what to 
do.  And then they also said that you could not have taken 
the – sorry, there is no action that happened because of 
the common mistake, so you should go back.  So after 
thinking about …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was saying that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, so now we are getting into the legal 
20 
opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   So now we are getting into the legal 
opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Ja, you see, you cannot just 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 52 of 163 
 
say to me “they” I want to who. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  So that was the situation, so after 
weighing the situation at that time I decided okay, maybe 
let us unscramble egg in the way that they are proposing 
that I go back.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ja, you said five 
years but it was five months I think you meant to say? 
MR MOLEFE:   Five months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Five months, ja. 
10 
MR MOLEFE: Five months. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think he was saying it is five years 
now. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is five years since the Public Protector ’s 
report which recommended – six years, say for six years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I have not done the calculation but 
it is a number of years, ja. 
MR MOLEFE: It will be six years in November, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am not going to attempt it, Chair.  So 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course there was a whole year that – 
2017 when there was litigation and – then that is why 
nothing was happening because there was litigation, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And so, Chair, the thing that needs to be 
appreciated is that during that period our names were 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 53 of 163 
 
being maligned, they had no opportunity explain in an 
appropriate forum what really happened and the advice 
that I got is that please try not to explain outside a forum 
that would be appropriate.  These things of – you cannot – 
what we were dealing with yesterday could never explained 
in a sound byte to the media, we needed to sit down like 
this and explain properly, so that was frustrating because I 
had this thing to explain and there was no proper forum.   
Of 
course 
there 
was 
a 
parliament 
forum 
but 
unfortunately that parliament forum, it was a political, 
10 
parliament is a political thing, so it was more about the 
politics of the thing rather than getting to the truth in a 
manner that I think you are trying to get to the truth. 
 
So my life had come to a standstill in a sense and 
has been on standstill for going on six years because of 
the Public Protector report which she wrote without having 
heard my side of the story. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let me put this to you and hear 
your comment and it is in the context of your explanation 
20 
that the early retirement arrangement, you had made it with 
the board already in February 2016.  There is an allegation 
that you were in fact not meant to stay long at Eskom, it 
was a passage for you to go to parliament, earmarked to 
become the Minister of Finance.  You comment on that? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 54 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Who made the allegation? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It has been publicly reported. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I cannot comment on that, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You cannot comment on it. 
MR MOLEFE:   I did not know anything about that, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  So on your coming back to 
Eskom, how long did you stay? 
MR MOLEFE:   Two weeks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two weeks? 
MR MOLEFE: Yes.  Ja, only two weeks. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what happened? 
MR MOLEFE:   The DA and Solidarity and I think the EFF 
launched a court application to have me removed from 
Eskom.  As soon as they launched the court application to 
have me removed from Eskom the Minister of Public 
Enterprises wrote a letter to the board to say that she is 
giving them an instruction to remove me.  So that I thought 
was unfair labour practice, there was no hearing, there was 
nothing that I had done, there was no process and she had 
been party to an agreement to unscramble the egg by 
20 
saying we are reverting to the status quo ante and now she 
was reneging on that agreement without any recourse.  So 
I went to the Labour Court.  Chairperson, something 
strange happened at the Labour Court, they refused to 
hear the matter in which I was the applicant until the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 55 of 163 
 
matter in which I was respondent in the Pretoria High Court 
had been heard.  I do not know, I am not a – maybe, 
Chairperson, they were correct but I thought that if you 
approach a court one of the rights that you have is a right 
to an outcome of the proceedings whether the court agrees 
with you or does not but not to say go to another forum.  In 
fact where you are not the applicant, another case.  So the 
Labour Court was never heard about my removal as CEO in 
a manner by the [indistinct – dropping voice].  That was 
never heard. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  I also felt let down by the judicial system as 
well at the time, rightly or wrongly.  Maybe I was wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Chairperson, quickly I want to 
hand up for the document to be admitted as an exhibit 
which is Mr Molefe’s opening speech which he gave on his 
first appearance.  I need to refer to certain paragraphs in 
it, that is the reason why I wish to have it handed up.  This 
is the corrected one, Mr Molefe.  It is a document titled: 
“Statement by Brian Molefe dated 14 January 2021.” 
20 
It has nine pages.  Mr Molefe, you go to the end of it, you 
will see there is a signature there above your name Brian 
Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dated 14 February 2021. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 56 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You confirm this to be …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, that is my signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair, I beg leave to have it 
admitted as EXHIBIT U38.2, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement by Mr Brian Molefe dated 
15 January 2021 on the last page it was signed on the 14 
January 2021, is admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT 
38.2. 
BRIAN MOLEFE’S STATEMENT DATED 14 JANUARY 2021 
10 
HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT U38.2  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Mr Molefe, just 
certain things to clarify from this.  Please turn to page 6 of 
EXHIBIT U38.2, the statement, paragraph 25.  It reads: 
“Mr Matshela Koko who I interrogated at length 
about this agreement told me that the board had not 
sanctioned it.  He also …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what paragraph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  25. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC: so the context to this – well, let me 
read: 
“Mr Matshela Koko I who interrogated at length 
about this agreement told me that the board had not 
sanctioned it.  He also told me that the official who 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 57 of 163 
 
had signed it had no authority to do so.  But this is 
hearsay evidence that I shall not burden you with.  I 
hope that Mr Koko will shed more light on this 
aspect when the Commission ends its fascination 
with the suspensions of the executives in the 
hearing of his evidence.” 
It is correct that you are referring here to the cooperation 
agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So because yesterday you were 
10 
questioning whether the person – well, I think you were 
making the allegation or questioning, I am not sure, that 
the person who signed it does not have – did not have the 
authority to sign that agreement. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I think this statement clarifies that 
you do not know that. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You do not know that the person did 
not have – did or did not have the authority to sign. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   As I say here, this is what I was told. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the answer suggests that you 
do not know. 
MR MOLEFE:   This is what I was told, yes.  It says 
…[intervenes] 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 58 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, what Mr Seleka seeks to 
establish …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I do not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, I think yesterday there was a time 
in your evidence where my understanding was that you 
were raising questions as to whether the person had 
authority without definitely saying he did not have but I do 
not know whether at any stage yesterday you might have 
gone beyond simply raising questions whether he did have 
10 
authority, he or she did have authority.  I am just saying I 
do recall that at a certain stage you were not saying he did 
not have or she did not have but you seem to be raising 
questions about whether the person had authority and I 
think you referred to the amounts involved as being 
amounts that should [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
board or something. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Is my recollection correct? 
MR MOLEFE: That is correct, Chair, from what I know and 
20 
have been told and from what I – it actually makes sense 
that it may well be so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so the position as it stands is you 
are not sure that he or she did not have authority but you 
have question marks whether he or she …[intervenes] 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 59 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes, I have question marks.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  The next paragraph, 
paragraph 26 in EXHIBIT U38.2 it says: 
“Dr 
Ben 
Ngubane 
and 
members 
of 
his 
board 
understood the situation perfectly well.  From them 
I received a blessing to do what was right and for 
that I am thankful.” 
The first line or sentence: 
“Dr 
Ben 
Ngubane 
and 
members 
of 
his 
board 
10 
understood the situation perfectly well.” 
Well, what do you mean by that? 
MR MOLEFE: Well, they understood that Glencore was 
trying to extort money from us, they did and they have 
given evidence to that effect.  Dr Ben Ngubane came here 
and he talked about people who come from overseas to try 
and keep us like little boys here.  Dr Naidoo also talked 
about the fact that Glencore could not have it that way.  
You know?  So they have already confirmed what I am 
saying here but they understood that this request for an 
20 
increase from 150 to 400 and something  - my recollection  
is 530.  The initial amount was 530.  It is just not 
sustainable and from them they said the CEO should deal 
with the matter and do what is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I – let us first deal with the issue 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 60 of 163 
 
of what you say is their evidence about extortion.  Dr 
Ngubane did testify to that effect, I do not think Dr Pat 
Naidoo testified to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Seleka.  Before the 
adjournment I think you were dealing with a certain line of 
inquiry relating to Mr Molefe, his departure from Eskom, 
him going to parliament and leaving parliament and you are 
now asking him about what is in his – I am getting the 
impression that it is a different line of inquiry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it because you are done with the other 
line because if you are not done should you not finish that 
and then this statement is not going to go away, it is here, 
you can always come back to it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  Let us see.  I thought I had 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you are close to finishing with 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] questions? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would prefer that we …[intervenes]

ADV SELEKA SC: We finish the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   We finish one line of inquiry unless what 
you are looking for is – what you have said, it is not 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is unrelated, it is unrelated. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 61 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC: It is unrelated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think let us try and finish the earlier 
line. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did Chair have any specific questions 
there?  Because I have exhausted, I could not go any 
further on the pension issue or into the pension issue, I 
could not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I mean, the pension issue has been 
decided by the courts, is it not? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC: I asked him my last question, Chair, and 
he said he cannot comment.  I think if Chair has follow-up 
questions, Chair might raise it with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Molefe, when you were 
in parliament and you were approached by you said Ms 
Daniels to say the minister wanted to …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Unscramble the egg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, unscramble the egg.  You were 
already a member of parliament. 
MR MOLEFE: I was a member. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you could continue as a member of 
parliament . 
MR MOLEFE:   I could have continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Was there any particular reason 
why you chose to go back to Eskom as opposed to saying 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 62 of 163 
 
look, I have now come to parliament, I have been asked to 
represent 
the 
people, 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
people’s 
representatives, I am going to focus on being a member of 
parliament, I do not want to go back to Eskom because that 
is a place which is connected with the [indistinct] that I got 
from the Public Protector ’s report and I had left because I 
did not want – I thought it was untenable to continue as 
Group CEO of Eskom given that situation and it is only a 
few months since I left Eskom.  Why did you not adopt that 
approach because it was not like you were going to be 
10 
unemployed, you had a job in parliament. 
MR MOLEFE:   I think, Chair, maybe the fault is in my 
upbringing that when people in authority say go to Eskom 
or we think you should go to Eskom, would you go to 
Eskom to help and I believe that I can help, I readily agree 
to do so.  When the North West came and said would you 
consider going to parliament I readily agreed and said 
okay, if you think that is a good thing to do, I will do it.  
Minister comes and says look, the situation is very bad and 
we need to revert to status quo ante, would you consider 
20 
going back?  I said yes.  Well, after thinking about a little 
bit I said yes.  So I have hardly ever in my life stand down 
an instruction from authority that I consider to be leading 
me, that I consider to be my leadership.  So when people 
that are leading us are saying we think you will be better 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 63 of 163 
 
used here, I hardly ever argue, I just go there and do my 
best.  Yes.  And that is the context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it correct to take that answer as 
meaning you yourself were not the one pushing to be 
allowed to go back to Eskom at that time, you responded to 
requests to say you should go back. 
MR MOLEFE: No, I did not initiate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not initiate your going back. 
MR MOLEFE:   I did not initiate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE: Ja, it came in as a request and the request 
came in and then look, we are in trouble and in any way, 
the risk – the risk is that the good work done to stop 
[indistinct] may be undone so maybe you need to go back 
and then I considered that, that that would be a shame and 
then I agreed to go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I think I may have said this last 
time when you were here. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if I did not say it, I must say it now 
20 
to give you a chance to deal with it. 
MR MOLEFE: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That the Commission heard I think from 
Mr Gordhan, if I am not mistaken, that he had been told – I 
do not know whether the day before he was dismissed as 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 64 of 163 
 
Minister of Finance in March 2017 or after, I cannot 
remember, by one of the leaders of the ANC.  I think he 
may have said it was Mr Mantashe, I may be mistaken, that 
when the then President Zuma spoke to the top six or 
spoke to the top five because he would be the sixth, about 
his intention to remove Minister Gordhan as Minister of 
Finance, one of the things he told them was that he either 
intended to make you Minister of Finance or he was 
proposing that you should be the next Minister of Finance.  
As a result of that evidence, if I recall correctly, the 
10 
Commission approached Mr Gwede Mantashe and Ms 
Jessie Duarte and Dr Zweli Mkhize, some of the people 
who would have been part of the top six at the time and 
asked them to give an account in an affidavit, in affidavits 
of any discussions that they may have had with President 
Zuma at the time concerning the removal of Mr Gordhan 
and they all filed affidavits in response, and one of the 
things that they said was that indeed – or was that Mr 
Zuma had said that he wanted to appoint you as the 
Minister of Finance to replace Mr Gordhan.  So that is the 
20 
affidavits that they filed and they all said the response 
from the Top Five was the fact no, no that was not – they 
objected to that. 
MR MOLEFE:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we do know of course that Mr 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 65 of 163 
 
Gordhan’s replacement was ultimately Mr Kekana.   Now 
the question is whether either Mr Zuma or anybody had 
ever spoken to you at any stage about whether you would 
be prepared to accept an appoint as Minister of Finance, 
whether it was President Zuma or anybody that might have 
spoken to you? 
MR MOLEFE:  No Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nobody ever spoke to you about that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Nobody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not think it would have been 
appropriate to speak to me before the Top Five but Top Six 
has approved and so the Top Six never approved, so there 
is nothing to talk about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, no, well, I do not know how 
the ANC operates but I was thinking that he may have that 
is President Zuma…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …or those who advise him might have 
thought it is futile to raise the name before the Top Six, if 
20 
the person is not interested at all in the first place and 
therefore, you might just want to find out whether if 
approached, he would be prepared, then you raise it.  So I 
do not know how it works but you say, as far as you know, 
it would not be raised with whoever is sought to be 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 66 of 163 
 
appointed before, it is raised with the Top Six. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, that is what I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, that is what I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say no one has ever spoken to 
you about it. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, and I am not surprised that it was not 
raised with me, because it was never approved as you 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now, part of what I think I 
10 
said last time, but I want to make sure that I say it so that 
you can deal with it because it would be unfair not to let 
you deal with it if you have not dealt with it.   
Is this, that there are a number of things that the 
Commission has heard, which in the eyes of some people 
may seem to give some credence to the suggestion that 
there was, there may have been a plan from to have you as 
Minister of Finance that may be was there for quite some 
time.  One, Mr Jonas's evidence before the Commission 
was that at the meeting that he had with one of the Gupta 
20 
brothers, which it seems, may have been Tony Gupta 
because he was not sure himself, but the evidence has 
established 
that 
the 
Gupta 
brother 
who 
was 
in 
the 
residence, the Gupta residence on the day when Mr Jonas 
was there, it was Tony Gupta.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 67 of 163 
 
He says the Gupta brother that he had a discussion 
with on the 23 r d of October 2015 said that the Minister of 
Finance, Mr Nene was going to be dismissed because as I 
recall the evidence, he was not working with them, which 
was understood to be with the Gupta’s and they wanted 
him to indicate whether he could accept an appointment as 
Minister of Finance, in which case, as I understand it, he 
would have to work with them.  
They offered him what he says they offered him in 
terms of money, but he says one of the things they said 
10 
was there are a number of people that they were working 
with and he says they have mentioned your name. They 
mentioned Minister Lynn Browns name, I cannot remember 
if there was another name and in regard to you, Mr Jonas 
says the Gupta brother said something along the lines that 
your career is well taken care of that is -  I am using my 
own words.  
So you have that and then now we have Mr Hank 
Bester…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, that is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   …who testified here that in 2014, at 
some stage in 2014, in that meeting with Mr Salim Essa, 
Salim Essa said they decided that you would be the next 
boss of Eskom and of course, there is that publication, the 
New Age, we talked about that thing last time, which in 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 68 of 163 
 
December 
2010, 
had 
an 
article 
which 
was 
maybe 
suggesting because maybe it was not definite, suggesting 
that you were going to be the next Group CEO of Transnet.  
And we do know that you did become the next 
Group CEO of Transnet.  We do know that you did become 
Group CEO of Eskom and unfortunately, Mr Zuma has so 
far not been able to come to the Commission, and deal with 
the question whether the evidence on affidavit given by Mr 
Mantashe, Ms Jessie Duarte and Dr Zweli Mkhize that he 
mentioned your name as the person that he wanted to 
10 
replace Mr Gordhan with, whether that is true, but that is 
what they have said.  
So you then think well, if Mr Jonas’s evidence of his 
meeting with the Gupta brother on the 23 r d of October 2015 
is correct.  It looks like the Gupta’s were looking for a 
Minister that would work with them and Minister Nene was 
dismissed on December 9 t h, Mr Van Rooyen was appointed. 
Now, Mr Jonas says that at that meeting one of the things 
that the Gupta brother told him was if - when you become 
Minister of Finance, if you need advisors, we will provide 
20 
you with advisors.  Now Mr Van Rooyen gets appointed as 
Minister of Finance and his alleged to have come to the 
National Treasury with advisors that he allegedly did not 
know, the issue of you know what he knew and how it came 
about is still being looked into by the Commission.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 69 of 163 
 
And then Minister Gordhan gets dismissed or then 
you are put in Parliament, you take your seat in Parliament 
and then Minister Gordhan gets dismissed, but if the 
evidence on affidavit by Dr Zweli Mkhize, Ms Duarte and 
Mantashe is true.  We then know that President Zuma 
wanted to replace Mr Gordhan with you as Minister of 
Finance, and then you then leave, I think you leave after 
Mr Gordhan has left and Mr Gigaba has been appointed to 
go back to Eskom.  
So I am just saying there are these things and it is 
10 
only fair that you should get a chance to say what you can 
say you might be able to say, look, I do not know anything 
about what people think or what they said or what they talk 
about in whatever corners.  I do not, I cannot comment or 
you might say no, I can comment and this is what I have to 
say…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I want to the first one.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The first one. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. [laughing], the first one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, the first one, which is you do not 
20 
want to…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not want to comment, all of the things 
that you mentioned, I do not feature anywhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I was not there, I never said anything, I 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 70 of 163 
 
was not present.  Some of the people I have not even met 
like Salim Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
MR MOLEFE:   So those things happened without my 
knowledge about it, and this great plan I was never aware 
of it and I had nothing to do with it, I cannot recall it. 
My career, Chair I can comment about my career.  
Chairperson, I have a Bachelor of Commerce from the 
University of South Africa, Masters of Business Leadership 
and 
Post 
Graduate 
Diploma 
in 
Economics 
from 
the 
10 
University 
of 
London. 
 
I 
have 
attended 
courses 
on 
executive management all over the world, like Harvard and 
several other universities.  
And I have worked at the National Treasury as a 
senior manager, as the Deputy Director General, was CEO 
of the PIC, where we grew the assets from R300billion to 
R950billion under my management, and I went to Transnet, 
I worked at Transnet we implemented the market demand 
strategy, we saw Transnet becoming a profitable company 
and actually turning around while I was there, I went to 
20 
Eskom and dealt with load shedding.   
I do not need anybody who meets Mr Jonas in a 
corridor somewhere who is dealing with my career.  I do 
not need; my career does not need exogenous factors.  I 
can quite well take care of myself and I think that with the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 71 of 163 
 
experience and with the training and education that I have, 
I can survive anyway, and I can be up to any task that I am 
given.  
So I do not agree that I require as Mr Jonas alleges 
somebody from the Gupta family to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he did not say you required, he says 
what he says he was told, ja.  He did not say you required 
that.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, so he does not have personal 
knowledge. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, he was just saying, what the 
conversation was, ja, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Molefe did you 
then have to resign at Parliament? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I resigned. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And you got a pension pay out? 
MR MOLEFE:   I actually did not even pursue it; I think I 
was entitled to it but I did not pursue it.  I did not pursue 
it, I…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean it could have too much. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   …for the two months that I was there I 
made contributions both technically speaking, I could have 
asked for it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay, that is alright.  Let us go back if 
Chair is finished on that. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 72 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair.  You can go back to 
that Exhibit U38.2 we were on page 7, paragraph 26, and 
you had said that Dr Ngubane and the Board knew that 
Glencoe was extorting money.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:     So Dr Ngubane did testify to that 
effect but then he was confronted with the pre-payment 
decision that the Board made on the 9 t h of December 2015, 
that pre-payment of R1.68billion.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Dr Ngubane was confronted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, with the evidence in regard to 
that because the Board members who came here and have 
filled affidavits, they say, they understood the submission 
for that pre-payment to motivate for a pre-payment to 
Glencoe/OCM and not to Tegeta.  
So I had to say how do you reconcile your view that 
Glencoe was extorting money when OCM proposed an 
increase of the coal and yet a couple of months later, you 
give them a – you make a decision, which you understood 
20 
to 
be 
a 
decision 
for 
a 
pre-payment 
to 
Glencoe 
of 
R1.6billion. 
MR MOLEFE:   And what did he say?  
ADV SELEKA SC:    I do not think he could give an answer 
to that because he kept on saying, well, that is how he 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 73 of 163 
 
understood the submission to be that it was a pre-payment 
to Glencoe. Dr Pat Naidoo even has a note written out to 
the Board supporting the pre-payment to Glencoe and says 
that Glencoe CEO, as well as the Eskom CEO must make a 
joint statement. 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment on that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Your comment, you cannot comment. 
MR MOLEFE:   I have no comment on that, ja it was in my 
absence, they were giving evidence…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Molefe. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I think it was in my absence, they were 
giving evidence here.  I think that if Mr Seleka requires any 
clarification, they should deal with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    But did you know about the Board 
decision? 
MR MOLEFE:   Actually, no, as I was explaining yesterday, 
on the 1 s t of December, I went for an operation to repair 
my throat[?], and I did not come back from the operation 
for 30 hours I was there, and I was in hospital two days 
thereafter. But then I was released to go home, but I 
20 
indisposed, I was at home for the whole of December and 
most of January.  So, and that decision was on the 5 t h of 
December, so on the 5 t h of December, I was actually very 
ill, I was not at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It was on the 9 t h of December.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 74 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, on the 9 t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, but on your return, did you not 
learn about the Board’s decision? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, on my return, I got to know about it 
there had been a coal crisis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, my point is, did you know that 
the Board's decision in the Board's own mind was about 
pre-payment to Glencoe? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I knew that there had been a pre-
payment 
and 
that 
the 
pre-payment 
was 
converted 
a 
10 
guarantee, there was a pre-payment decision, and the pre-
payment was converted to a guarantee.  
And the guarantee was never called, and so when I 
came to know about it, I was concerned that suddenly we 
have an exposure and fortunately, it was never called and 
so I thought oh, we survived and that was for me that was 
the end of the matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Do you know, that is the submission 
that ultimately served before the Board for that decision to 
be made, was preceded by an exchange of correspondence 
20 
between Mr Matshela Koko, and the DMR.  Did you know 
that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I knew about this after it happened and, ja I 
knew about this after it happened, long after it had 
happened, in fact ja long after it had happened. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 75 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:     But do you know Mr Matshela Koko’s 
affidavit.  He says, the approach to the DMR essentially, I 
am paraphrasing, it was the decision you and him made. 
MR MOLEFE:   The approach to the DMR? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no, there had been a coal crisis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    There had been? 
MR MOLEFE:   A coal crisis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   There is a committee at Eskom, which 
10 
deals with coal crisis, when there is a major energy crisis.  
In November there was a coal crises, even when I left to 
go to hospital I knew that there was a coal crisis.  Actually, 
I was worried as I was going to hospital about how it would 
be dealt with, but I remember thinking you know what, I 
have to go for an operation.  They will deal with it, there is 
an acting CEO it is not that Eskom cannot function without 
me. But no, the approach to DMR happened after the 1 s t of 
December as far as I know.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, no, I am just giving you his 
20 
version and I want to again it is no me. 
MR MOLEFE:   So this version, is it on affidavits? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Eskom bundle…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   I literally just got it now I have not read his 
affidavit. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 76 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Oh, should I go to it?  
MR MOLEFE:   No, no I take your bona fide. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, I want the Chairperson shall I 
read it to you Chair, I must read to the Chairperson.  This 
is Eskom bundle 15(a).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but while he is preparing this I 
would like us to take a short adjournment, that is five 
minutes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us adjourn. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You have referred to Bundle 15 – Eskom 
Bundle 15. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page – page 103. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Under the heading The DME.  Paragraph 
3. – I can start at 365. 
“At this time as referred to already Eskom 
had already communicated with the DME 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 77 of 163 
 
regarding DME suspension of OCM mining 
licences etcetera.  The DME was accordingly 
already largely in the loop.” 
366 – Mr Molefe that is the one I want to refer you to.  He 
says: 
“Mr Molefe and I decided we needed to keep the 
DME up to date on the developments that has 
occurred and to request its assistance by the 
means it had to facilitate 
a. A resolution of the impasse that quite clearly 
10 
still existed despite the potential sale to 
Oakbay/Tegeta.” 
From our perspective now I am not sure how does he know 
about the sale because this is barely in December he says: 
“From our perspective the matter had now to 
be brought to conclusion one way or the 
other i.e. either by sale of OCM or its 
business and OCH’s other assets on a viable 
basis or Glencore’s bringing the business 
rescue to an end and matters continuing on 
20 
the basis of the existing Hendrina CSA 
including its despite resolution mechanisms.” 
You turn the page paragraph 368 then he says: 
“We” and if you read it in context with the paragraphs before 
preceding that would be you and him. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 78 of 163 
 
“We requested 
Ms 
Daniels to 
draft the 
required letter.  I received the first draft at 
18:46 on Friday 4 December 2015.  After 
discussion its contents with her and the 
Deputy 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
DME 
a 
second draft followed on Sunday 6 December 
2015 at 18:55.  I dispatched the letter by 
email to the Director General of the DME the 
same evening.  Ms Daniels’ initial draft with 
the covering email she sent me is then 
10 
document MMK18.” 
3 – Paragraph 370 says: 
“Suggestions have been made that our letter 
to the Department of Mineral Resources was 
in some or other manner irregular.  I deny 
that it – I deny that it is the case.  We had 
previously intervened with the DME regarding 
the suspension of OCM’s mining licence and 
its operations.  The DME presented an 
avenue to try to exert influence to bring 
20 
matters to some form of finality one way or 
the other to ensure continued coal supplies 
to Hendrina.” 
And we stop there.  So according to him it was the idea of 
both you and him to have a letter addressed to the DMR.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 79 of 163 
 
Your comment? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson at different times during the 
business rescue we sat and worked out different scenarios.  
Of course the one scenario was liquidation, the other one 
was the sale of the business.   
What we did do is that happened.  Not to any party 
but the sale of the business.  What would that mean and we 
just sort of left out different scenarios in a fashion.  As I say 
during the month of November there was a bit of a coal crisis 
as well and on the 1s t of December 2015 I went in for an 
10 
operation.   
So what happened when I was away I think is that – 
ja and before I left I did say we need to keep Department of 
Minerals and Energy abreast about our situation here 
concerning judicial management possible stay, possible 
liquidation or maybe if they rescue and continue with R150 
we need to make them aware that they are having this kind 
of problem.   
And so I think after I left because if Ms Suzanne 
Daniels drafted a letter on the 4t h I do not know when she 
20 
got the instructions to draft the letter it must have been 
maybe the 2n d or the 3r d or maybe the 1s t but I was not there 
I was not part of that.   
I never saw that letter to DME because I was not at 
work 
and 
– 
and 
the 
snowball 
effect 
that 
happened 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 80 of 163 
 
afterwards.  But I do agree that there had been discussions 
with the primary energy people led by Mr Matshela Koko 
about 
the 
implications 
of 
this 
judicial 
management 
– 
business rescue.  Yes.  But never with – and in the 
discussions with this we need to keep DMR and DPE 
informed about our situation.   
But that was by not – the discussions were not 
conclusive of a – so it was not like what we – scenario came 
in what we would do if this happens, what do we do if this 
happens. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. No it is important for us to know 
exactly what happened because you see Mr Koko has put a 
version and he will be coming back.  He is expecting us to 
have put this to you so that we are able to deal with it in 
relation to him.  So I – we must be able to say to him okay 
we read out this to Mr Molefe.  Mr Molefe either said yes that 
is what happened or no that is not what happened. 
MR MOLEFE:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is why I need that clarification. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  We had numerous discussions about 
20 
informing DMR about the different scenarios that are likely to 
bare out with the judicial management and the coal crisis.  
There was a coal crisis and – and that was about my 
involvement.  And then after that I went to hospital and after 
I had gone to hospital this letter was drafted and it led to the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 81 of 163 
 
memo and the decision and the guarantee.  But when all of 
that happened I was not on the scene. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let us do this.  If you – if you look 
at paragraph 366. 
MR MOLEFE:  366? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  366 ja on page 103.  So he says  
“Mr Molefe and I decided that we needed to 
keep 
the 
DME 
up 
to 
date 
on 
the 
developments 
that 
had 
occurred 
and 
to 
request its assistance by the means it had to 
10 
facilitate a resolution of the impasse that 
quite clearly still existed.” 
So he puts it at the level of a decision and then if you read 
paragraph 368 that is where he says: 
“We requested 
Ms 
Daniels to 
draft the 
required letter”. 
MR MOLEFE:  No, no, no the request to draft a letter I was 
not there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay let us deal with 366 first. 
MR MOLEFE:  366 is generally saying that with all the 
20 
scenarios that are 00:09:00 you will need to involve the 
DME. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you confirm what he says? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Yes.  That we – because we were in 
business rescue and did not know what the outcome is going 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 82 of 163 
 
to be. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And so it had all sorts of implications.  We 
needed to keep the DME abreast of developments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but not only that. 
MR MOLEFE:  It was – sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC: Sorry not only to keep it abreast of the 
developments it is to request its assistance by the means it 
had to facilitate a resolution of the impasse. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja we said we never – we never said what 
10 
happened and we never discussed what kind of assistance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And actually you captured correctly when you 
say by any means they had but we said we must keep them 
informed and see how they can help us out of thing.  
Because we did not know what was going to happen.  We 
were in business rescue with Optimum. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So 366 you confirm it.  What Mr Koko is 
20 
saying that is confirmed.  You only have a problem with 368 
where he says; we requested. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja but also 366 I confirm it but … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  With some (talking over one another). 
MR MOLEFE:  But there was no specific assistance that we 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 83 of 163 
 
requested.  It was just a matter of in a discussion when we 
discussed the scenarios that we must inform DME and 
possibly get assistance from them.  But in terms of the 
specifics and even the letter – the letter happens just after I 
left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja you confirm it is you and him who 
requested Ms Suzanne Daniels to draft the letter. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not – I did not request Ms Suzanne 
Daniels with Mr Koko.  So ja.  I think the request to Ms 
Suzanne Daniels happened between the 1s t and the 4t h.  I do 
10 
not know when did Ms Suzanne Daniels say she got the 
request. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what sort of request did you 
assistance did Mr Koko and you have in mind? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not – we just broad terms they will – we – 
the mine is going into – is in business rescue, it might be 
sold or it might go into liquidation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it may what? 
MR MOLEFE:  Huh? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It might be sold or it might? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Go into liquidation.  That would be the two – 
or three possible outcomes of business rescue.  First one is 
the business rescue practitioner actually rescue.   
The second one is that they say they cannot rescue 
so they sell.   
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 84 of 163 
 
The third one is they cannot rescue with and they 
cannot sell or they will not sell so they go into liquidation.  
So the question is, if any of these three scenarios ends up 
what is our reaction as Eskom to it.  None of it should come 
as a surprise. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja 
MR MOLEFE:  But what is our reaction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  To any of these three scenarios. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Whatever the scenarios – scenario that works 
out is we must be – we must have informed DMR. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And if any assistance is required from them 
they should – we should be in a position to ask for 
assistance if we need. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  But just tell the Chairperson 
because it is – it was not a question of if any assistance is 
required from them.  Mr Matshela Koko says you decided to 
request its assistance. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  No this thing… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So if… 
MR MOLEFE:  This thing was drafted by Emopedi from Soup 
Mecca.  So what I am telling you is my understanding of 
even what he was trying to say maybe not captured properly 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 85 of 163 
 
here.  It was not asking for specific assistance but if any of 
the scenarios turns out what is going to happen?  I think you 
must have an understanding of the context in which it was 
done.  It was not to ask for they must therefore do this.  And 
in fact Mr Seleka if you look at the letter that Ms Daniels 
drafted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja we can get the letter. 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not think it has a request for any specific 
assistance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja and you struggle to see what the letter 
10 
actually. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is intended to achieve. 
MR MOLEFE:  The letter was just saying we having a 
problem and we just letting you know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But we have a crisis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me take it further because you see 
before the letter is drafted they are in an exchange between 
Mr Koko and Mr Duo Rapella 00:14:12. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Who? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Duo Rapella. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And they talking about this issue and the 
formulation of the draft. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 86 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:  What is the date of the emails? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is from the 4t h December so they 
exchange emails between the 4 t h until the 7t h of December – 
well … 
MR MOLEFE:  After the letter has been drafted. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes during that time the letter gets to be 
drafted during that time. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Mr Seleka I was not there I do not know 
what that was about and I cannot comment on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja no that is alright then.  So you – are 
10 
you saying to the Chairperson you did not have any specific 
request in mind? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we know then once you – Eskom got a 
response from the DMR that response had a pre-payment 
aspect mentioned in it.  The letter from the DMR and that 
letter was used in the submission as a basis upon which the 
DMR requested Eskom to make a pre-payment. 
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Mantsha of his own volition – Mr Mantsha I 
think of his own volition. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Attested the pre-payment.  I said somewhere 
that maybe that was the genesis of the problem. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Maybe? 
MR MOLEFE:  That was the genesis of the problem.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 87 of 163 
 
However I was not there I do not know but my – my reading 
of this document is that the idea of the pre-payment – the 
first time the pre-payment arises is when Mr Mantsha writes 
to Mr Koko and said I have read your letter, you say you had 
a problem just do whatever you can do and even consider 
pre-payment.  And that came from DMR. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then he does say the letter was not 
prepared by him he found the letter on his desk his… 
MR MOLEFE:  That is – that is even worse because it was 
not even at Eskom it was in his office now.  I was not even at 
10 
Eskom I was in hospital.  So I cannot comment on how he 
got to sign a letter that he denies to sign. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Insofar as the submission is 
concerned who did you understand was to be paid the pre-
payment – the R1.6 billion? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson I would rather not speculate on 
that 
submission. 
 
The 
decision 
that 
was 
taken 
the 
interpretation of the decision.  There are people who were 
directly involved and I think they can shed better light than I 
can because I was indisposed and in hospital.   
20 
My knowledge of this matter came to become to be in 
the end when I came back very peripheral.  I just knew that 
they have a guarantee and I was concerned that we have a 
guarantee and then suddenly the guarantee was not called 
and it was actually never really thoroughly interrogated 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 88 of 163 
 
because it never even became an object.  So I would rather 
not speculate on what was happening there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Insofar as you say there was a 
coal crisis. 
MR MOLEFE:  Insofar as? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You say there was a coal crisis. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where was this crisis?  Is that in respect 
of a specific power station? 
MR MOLEFE:  No.  There is a committee at Eskom.  Ja there 
10 
is a committee at Eskom that declares a coal crisis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  In terms of our operating procedures that 
meets regularly.  That committee is above everybody even 
above the board and they assess our coal requirements and 
then declare that we have a crisis or we do not have a crisis.  
So they assess the stock piles in the entire organisation and 
then they meet and then they decide that there is a crisis.  
And once they have decided nobody can overrule them.  It is 
like a – an independent made up of Eskom officials but not 
20 
even the CEO can overrule what they say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are experts in … 
MR MOLEFE:  They are experts yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  So I believe in November they had met and 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 89 of 163 
 
had said we have a coal crisis.  Once that has been declared 
it means – you know the meaning a coal crisis? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No but my question was where – which 
power station? 
MR MOLEFE:  No it was a Eskom coal crisis. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well let me... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Coal crisis meaning that there was the 
shortage of coal was too much. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes for the entire organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Okay yes because there is not 
such a declaration in November of a coal crisis. 
MR MOLEFE:  Is that – is that… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is 1 number 2. 
MR MOLEFE:  Is that your arrogance? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No we do not have that. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja but the fact that… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Number 2. 
MR MOLEFE:  But the fact that you do not have it does not 
mean that it did not happen.  I mean were you there Mr 
20 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I do not know if (talking over one 
another). 
MR MOLEFE:  But how can you emphatically say that there 
is not such a decision? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 90 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Molefe. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait for Mr Seleka to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Number 2 the context within which 
we are reading here it is about Hendrina and the submission 
related to the coal supply to Hendrina. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is why I want to – we need to know 
when you say a coal crisis is it about this submission 
because you and Mr Koko are talking about approaching the 
10 
DMR in respect of the Hendrina issue. 
MR MOLEFE:  No.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  This – the paragraphs I have read. 
MR MOLEFE:  But Mr Seleka I just put those paragraphs in 
context and I – you are ignoring what I am saying about – 
and you are insisting on going with your version.  Your 
understanding of your evidence as you want to present it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Molefe go back to clarifying how 
the issue of a coal crisis in respect of the whole of Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Comes in or came into the question of 
Hendrina. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  How did it happen – how does it come 
in? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 91 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Now let me explain.  There is a committee at 
Eskom which can declare a coal crisis.  That committee did 
declare a coal crisis in November before I got sick.  Now the 
meaning of a coal crisis is that in terms of the rules Eskom 
has to undertake extraordinary measures to deal with the 
coal crisis.  And in fact in their  
CHAIRPERSON:  Declaration. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja not – it is not a declaration in their 
operating manual or guidelines or there is another word that 
I am looking for but in the document that – that… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Policy. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja policy it specifically says during a coal 
crisis you may undertake extraordinary measures including 
the pre-purchase of coal – including the pre-purchase of 
coal.   
So all I am saying is that a coal crisis had been 
declared we were sitting with a business rescue at Hendrina.  
We were sitting with business rescue at Hendrina and there 
had been a coal crisis and we then mapped out different 
scenarios of how to deal with it.   
20 
Discuss them generally like brainstorming and said 
what happens when this happens?  What happens when this 
happens?  What happens when this happens?  And then in 
that brainstorming we also said we need to keep the 
government informed including DMR and the DPE informed 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 92 of 163 
 
about our situation before it becomes a crisis that we cannot 
handle.   
And then I went off to hospital and then after I had 
gone to hospital I think it is after I had left Mr Koko asked 
Ms Daniels to draft a letter to DMR and the letter was sent.  I 
was not there.  I saw the letter much later and DMR’s 
response.   
But when I looked at DMR’s response the people that 
talked about a pre-payment even before we did was DMR.  
But not only that it was not out of line because in fact in the 
10 
coal crisis context pre-payments are envisaged.   
So I think DMR knew that – that in terms of in line 
with policy remember that you may also do pre-payment and 
then – ja – that is as far as I can shed light from the policy 
point of view and what was happening. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I hear what you are saying.  The – 
the clarification I seek to have  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is insofar as what you are saying is at 
variance with what Mr Koko is saying.   
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because Mr Koko was power station 
specific. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He was… 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 93 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:  In the matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Here in the affidavit in the letter in the 
submission it was power station specific. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the pre-payment was also entity 
specific. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In respect of a particular power station.  
But your explanation takes it beyond that and that is why I 
am saying we do not have that information. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  You do not have? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We do not have the information that you 
are now putting before us.  We can only go by what Mr Koko 
has said in his affidavit which is consistent with the 
submission. 
MR MOLEFE:  You see Mr Seleka you are trying to say that 
we instructed Ms Daniels to ask for a pre-payment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I am not trying to say anything.  I am 
putting to you what Mr Koko is writing in his affidavit. 
MR MOLEFE:  But I – I admit – I say we discussed the 
20 
different scenarios in as far as judicial management is 
concerned and that there are different scenarios, different 
outcomes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is possible. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 94 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And whatever the outcome we have to be 
prepared. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  For any of the outcomes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And in the process you must inform DMR. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:  We did not go into specifics that this is 
exactly how the crisis is going to be dealt with.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  It was at brainstorming stage when I left the 
scene. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes then we moved onto the pre-
payment. 
MR MOLEFE:  And then – and then I was – I was actually I 
was mentioning the – the coal crisis because in – in this 
context the pre-payment arises twice before it actually 
happened.   
The one is there was a policy that allows for pre-
20 
payment when there is a coal crisis.   
The second one is that the DMR in their response to 
Mr Koko’s letter themselves said consider a pre-payment.  
That was Mr Mantsha’s letter which is now nice and signed 
but it has (inaudible) so that is all I was trying to explain.  I 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 95 of 163 
 
do not know if that is complex. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Ja I am not for a moment questioning 
the basis for the pre-payment whether it was allowed or not 
allowed.  I am not.  All I am saying to you is we are at the 
point where I am asking you about the coal crisis and I 
needed to know what coal crisis are you referring to? 
MR MOLEFE:  What coal crisis? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you referring to because the… 
MR MOLEFE:  At Hendrina. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Say that again. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  The coal crisis at Hendrina. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no what coal crisis are you referring 
to in November because – because the context in which we 
are talking about this decision for the pre-payment was 
power station specific and a particular supplier specific.  
This supplier would have been – the pre-payment was meant 
to assist the supplier to supply the Hendrina Power Station.  
The pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine Pty Ltd 
Eskom requires continuity of supply to the Hendrina Power 
Station of 5.5 million tons per annum at an average price of 
20 
– and then they give the price.  But that is Hendrina Power 
Station and it is in that context I am putting this to you. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson I was not part of the pre-payment 
decision at Hendrina and I can therefore not comment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 96 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot comment on it? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Because let me put 
this to you then we can also see whether you can or cannot 
comment.  Hendrina Power Station was not in crisis in 
November or December or January 2015 or 2016.  Let me 
share when this decision was made Hendrina Power Station 
was not in crisis.   
MR MOLEFE:  Was it in business rescue?  Or am I making a 
10 
mistake? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – just speak up Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:  I say was it in business rescue or am I 
making mistake? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I am talking the power station now. 
MR MOLEFE:  The power station? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes was not in a crisis. 
MR MOLEFE:  But Mr Seleka if the mine next door is in 
business rescue, the mine that supplies it with coal it – it 
20 
was in business rescue.  The outcome of business rescue 
was going to affect the operations of Hendrina. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What I am saying to you is the 
Hendrina Power Station was not in a coal crisis in 
December 2015.  What is your comment on that?   
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 97 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it...  Do you ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I was...  I was ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you denying it? 
MR MOLEFE:   I was not at Eskom in December 2015.  I 
am not in a position to... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  You had, in fact, on the 
3 r d of December, which we say – we said yesterday, your 
evidence 
that 
came 
out 
yesterday, 
on 
the 
3 r d  of September 2015 concluded the interim arrangement 
10 
with OCM to supply coal to Hendrina. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that subsisted until the end of 
July 2016. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So they kept on supplying even 
in December.  The power station was not in a coal crisis. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, can I make a suggestion? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MR MOLEFE:   To answer this question of crisis, I suggest 
20 
that the Commission’s investigators go and look at the 
Coal Crisis Committee...  And that will help Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   To talk about...  because I think we are 
not...  Well, I...  The people that knew exactly the nature of 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 98 of 163 
 
the crisis and what the crisis was... is the Coal Crisis 
Committee 
that 
was 
in 
operation 
and 
it 
was 
an 
extraordinary committee existed... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.   
MR MOLEFE:   So that is my suggestion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  We know of the coal crisis.  It is 
not a coal crisis. 
MR MOLEFE:   What is it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 23 r d of December 2015, an 
emergency was declared but in respect or Arnot Power 
10 
Station, not Hendrina.  And I am going to come back to 
this.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the suggestion Mr Seleka that an 
emergency – a declaration of an emergency is the same as 
declaration of coal crisis? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, the...  Well, I cannot give a 
direct answer to that question because the declaration of 
emergency in December in respect of Arnot Power Station 
was looking at the future in January 2016 if the Arnot 
employees were to stop the trucks from delivering coal.  So 
20 
it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, as I understood you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You seem to say there was no coal crisis 
but you use – there was a declaration of emergency 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 99 of 163 
 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in some of that and I do not think you 
can do that unless the idea is that the declaration of an 
emergency is the same as the declaration of a coal crisis 
because you said there was a declaration of emergency in 
regard to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is Arnot.  Arnot, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and not in regard to Hendrina. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Hendrina.  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if emergency and coal crisis are two 
different things, then your thinking might not flow.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if the two are different things, 
ordinarily you could have an declaration of an emergency 
and declaration of a coal crisis at the same time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, let me answer the Chairperson 
based on what we see.  The emergency was declared in 
contemplation of shortage of coal supply which then would, 
I assume – and I say I assume because I do not know.  
20 
They will have to explain to us that that constitutes a coal 
crisis.  Perhaps it does if there is a shortage, less than 
what you need.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well, it may well be the declaration 
of coal crisis is resorted to when the crisis is – has 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 100 of 163 
 
commenced.  It may well be that that is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may well be that first you have the 
emergency and then you have the crisis.  The emergency is 
forward looking. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and that is why in this particular 
case of a declaration Chair, I am at pains to explain that 
the crisis, using the word crisis, was not when the 
declaration was made.  They were saying there might be a 
situation in January which might result in the Arnot Power 
10 
Station not getting the coal that it requires.  The strike 
action 
might 
erupt 
and 
employees 
might 
block 
the 
transport, delivery.  But they will explain to us that that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, should you not first get the 
explanation then? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then we know exactly what the question 
is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Yes.  So I can leave that aside.  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   So that is your evidence Mr Molefe.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no.  That is the...  That is the...  
Of course that is the evidence given to us by Eskom.  But 
at this present moment we are talking about the Hendrina 
Power Station.  And I accept your explanation to the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 101 of 163 
 
Chairperson that you cannot comment any further.   
 
But I am putting now to you the situation as you 
would know it.  No, but I have already put it to you.  The 
3 r d of September 2015, there is an interim arrangement 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...which ran all the way to July 2016.  
And Chair, what I was saying there to Mr Molefe was that, 
Hendrina Power Station was taken care of taken care of by 
OCM under Glencore. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what does taken care of mean? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There was a supply of coal to the 
Hendrina Power Station. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was not there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You were not there. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  But you knew about the internal 
arrangements. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, I was not at Eskom in 
December.  Mr Seleka knows better what happened than I 
20 
do. 
AD SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But what it means Mr Molefe 
because we can accept the agreement, the existence of the 
agreement of OCM to supply coal to Hendrina Power 
Station, and the same breath have this discussion with 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 102 of 163 
 
Mr Koko that there is a crisis and you have to approach the 
DME(?) and request their assistance and this is in respect 
of the Hendrina Power Station.   
MR MOLEFE:   When did business rescue started? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In August. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  So in December there was business 
rescue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  So I have tried to explain to you 
Mr Seleka.  The outcome of – business rescue itself 
10 
suggest a crisis.   
 
The fact that a company is in business rescue 
means it is in crisis because companies do not go into 
business rescue because things are going well.  
 
And so the outcome of business rescue is one of 
three things, as I have tried to explain.  Firstly, the 
business rescue practitioners ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Face the Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:   The business rescue practitioners will be 
able to rescue the company.  The business rescue 
20 
practitioners might not be able to rescue the company in 
which instance they will either sell it or liquidate it.   
 
The questions for us as affected customer is.  
What happens in the event of any of the three scenarios?  
That is what I am trying to explain.  That had to be 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 103 of 163 
 
discussed. 
 
We 
cannot... 
 
We 
cannot 
pretend 
that 
everything is okay there because it is under business 
rescue. 
 
There is going to be an outcome to a business 
rescue.  If the outcome is, the company is rescued, it is 
fine.  If they liquidate, what happens?  And if they tell what 
happened.  And all I am saying, Mr Seleka, is we had these 
discussions.  We had these discussions. 
 
And that is the context of the crisis that I am 
talking about.  You talk as if because we signed an 
10 
agreement in September, everything was find.  Everything 
might have been fine, they might have been supplying coal 
but they were in business rescue.   
 
They were not a normal company that was 
operating.  It was being rescued from a disaster by a 
legally recognised process in South Africa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I think your explanation would be 
cogent if in August after you learn that – after Eskom learn 
that OCM is in business rescue to take the step that you 
took of the submission approaching the DMR.  And then 
20 
you say it is because we did not know.  But you did not do 
that.  You first go into an arrangement where ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...Mr Seleka.  [Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did not take the steps of 
approaching the DMR to make a submission to the board to 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 104 of 163 
 
make a prepayment.  What you did is, notwithstanding your 
knowledge of the business rescue, you actually had a 
meeting with Mr Ephron on the 3 r d of September. 
 
You asked him:  Let us go.  Supply to Hendrina, 
please.  And that is how the interim arrangement was...   
 
So to come in December and say:  Well, we were 
uncertain about the outcome of a business rescue, which in 
the first place, did not stand in your way to enter into that 
interim arrangement.  It is not persuasive.   
MR MOLEFE:   You are not persuaded? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is why I am saying is not 
persuasive if you look at where your argument is located 
from a timing point of view.   
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I do not understand what you are on 
about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   I really do not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the... Oh, when you look at the 
evidence, the – one sees this image appearing that your 
discussion 
with 
Mr 
Molefe(sic) 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
20 
engagement 
of 
the 
DMR 
and 
in 
turn 
leads 
to 
the 
submission to the board of the prepayment to be made was 
in fact... 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairman, I am under the impression that 
Mr 
Seleka 
is... 
his 
conspiracy 
theory 
at 
all 
cost.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 105 of 163 
 
Irrespective of what I say to him, that is the view that he 
has and there is no way of changing him.  You see.  
Because I am telling him that we discussed the fact that in 
business...  as an objective factor, business rescue.   
 
It was discussed and the possible outcomes of 
business rescue.  Now he is trying to read into a risk 
management discussion motive of conspiracy of some kind 
which I think is unfair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your position is, you disagree 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   I said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...with that?  And you have made your – 
gave your response? 
MR MOLEFE:   I disagree in the strongest possible terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thanks Chair.  So let us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are a few minutes past one.  We had 
hoped to finish before lunch. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, it is important to try and deal 
20 
with matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We should take lunch now, I think.  But 
there was aw witness who was supposed to testify today.  
And thought that they would be here in the morning and 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 106 of 163 
 
then they could be told to wait until we are done with 
Mr Molefe’s evidence.  I do not know whether they were 
here.  It is just that I was not made aware what is the 
position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, he gave me a message 
yesterday which I communicated Chair, that we will start 
with them after lunch.  So I gave them an indication to be 
here by twelve.  The legal representatives did arrive and 
they are here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  It is just that I was not 
10 
aware ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that that is what has happened. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What  is your estimate of how much 
more time you will need with Mr Molefe?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I say so.  We need to strike a 
balance between ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...doing 
justice 
to 
the 
issues 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and trying to finish as soon as 
possible.  We should not in the attempt to try and finish as 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 107 of 163 
 
soon as possible not do justice ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...but we should not take too long on 
matters where we can be brief. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, if we start at two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, no.  We have taken five minutes 
already of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can we – can I aim to finish Mr Molefe, 
10 
you and I, at three?   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can we do that?  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  So let us adjourn and 
resume at five past two and then we go on.  And then when 
we finish with Mr Molefe’s evidence, then I can hear the 
evidence of the witness who was meant to be before me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
In 
accordance 
with 
discussion 
in 
chambers.  We will interpose here ...[intervenes]  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 108 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to allow counsel for Mr Anoj Singh who 
was supposed to testify after we finish with Mr Molefe’s 
evidence to address me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Let them sanitise before you use 
that podium.  Somebody will come and sanitise quickly.  I 
think...  Ja, Mr Seleka can take his documents.  I am sorry 
Mr Masuku.  I do not know whether you have any idea 
about what was – what is happening but Mr Seleka might or 
10 
might not have informed you.  It is going to be brief. 
ADV MASUKU:  ...it is okay.  It is okay Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, he is going to be brief.  Ja.   
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, thank you for the 
opportunity to briefly address you on this matter.  Mr Singh 
was subpoenaed today to come and give evidence.   
 
In fact, it was from today until the end of the 
week to give evidence in the Eskom stream.  He is also 
subpoenaed to come next week on the Transnet stream.   
 
We have prepared a substantive application to 
20 
explain to you why he cannot be here today.  There is an 
affidavit with a number of annexures, and without divulging 
a lot of personal information, I can basically place on 
record, and you will see, Chairperson, that is the last 
Annexure AS-12.  It is a letter from the specialist that was 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 109 of 163 
 
treating her.   
 
In short, she had an emergency caesarean on 
the 25 t h and because of what transpired, she is being 
forced to be – to stay in bed for at least 10 days and those 
ten days run out, I think, next Tuesday. 
 
So it is a situation, unfortunately, where client 
needs to take care of the new-born and a number of other 
things.  So he cannot be here today as much as he wanted 
to be. 
 
So our request to you is that, we accept that the 
10 
content of the affidavit and the annexures will be read.  I 
know Mr Pule has indicated to us that he accepts the 
contents hereof.   
 
So we then ask you if we can be excused and 
that our client will be subpoenaed for the Eskom stream at 
some stage but we will be here next week on the Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I will go in accordance with what 
you as counsel have informed me, is in the papers.  The 
tradition is that counsel, when they tell a judge what is in 
the papers, that is what is in the papers. 
20 
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not something else, ja. 
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   I think Advocate Pule will 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 110 of 163 
 
confirm what we conveyed to you is indeed what the 
factual situation is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems that it is a situation that when 
he testifies that I excuse Mr Anoj Singh.  The information 
that was known to me, based on correspondence that was 
made available to me, was information that existed prior 
the operation of the wife.   
 
And I was not sure that that was – that would 
10 
have provided a different excuse but the information you 
have given me, satisfies me.  So Mr Anoj Singh is therefore 
excused from appearance today. 
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But as you have said he will appear 
before the Commission next week in respect of the 
Transnet work stream and other arrangements will have to 
be made with regard to the Eskom evidence. 
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   Indeed Chairperson.  May we 
then also be excused. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are excused. 
ADV A VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, we are ready to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may proceed. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 111 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Molefe, just back to 
that, the opening speech, Exhibit U-38.2.  We might be 
shorter than 30-minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the reference, what page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Exhibit U-38.2, the opening 
speech of Mr Molefe, page 7, paragraph 26. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, I was also saying that we 
might be shorter than 30-minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Or shall we just say... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
MR MOLEFE:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   We do not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...maybe this thing of counsel been paid 
for the whole day, then it is better. 
MR MOLEFE:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Not less than the whole day to 
be changed.  [laughs]  Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you.  The second – the last 
sentence there, Mr Molefe, which says...  Well, to read it in 
context. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 112 of 163 
 
“Dr Ben Ngubane and members of his board 
understood the situation perfectly well. 
From them, I receive the blessing to do what 
was right and for that I am thankful...” 
 
Am I right that what you are saying in that last 
time, you received from them to do what was right...  Or, 
let me rather ask you.  What is that you say you received 
from them to do which was right? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  To analyse the situation and to handle 
the matter in a manner that will be in the interest of 
10 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is what... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Well, we have covered this 
yesterday and I told you about what the board’s decision or 
the board’s version is on this. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That they wanted you to come back... 
MR MOLEFE:   They wanted me? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They wanted you to come back to 
20 
them.  The minute also says they wanted you to... Is given 
to you before it comes to the board for approval.   
MR MOLEFE:   Before what comes to the board? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minutes I read yesterday.  It says 
the matter is given to you ...[intervenes]  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 113 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...before it is placed before the board 
for approval.   
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
The 
minutes 
were 
given 
to 
me 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The matter. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, the matter? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. It was given to me before it was 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Before it comes to the board for 
approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us try and – but what I think 
what Mr Seleka is referring to is that the minutes of the 
board meeting of the 23 r d of April 2015, as he read them 
yesterday, were to the effect, as he understood them, that 
the matter was given to you by the board but you would 
need to bring it back – bring it back to the board later for 
the board to provide approval.   
 
That is what he is referring to you.  You 
20 
remember that discussion yesterday?  You remember you 
said 
you 
have 
your 
dynamic 
interpretation 
of 
the 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 114 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   My understanding was that the matter was 
given to me to handle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To deal with, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you said that yesterday.  So what I 
think what Mr Seleka wanted to remind of you that and 
then ask you questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that the board’s version, which 
seems to be consistent with the minutes, differs from your 
explanation or understanding of what you say the board 
10 
wanted you to do.  That is all I am trying to... 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  The board – I do not think they asked 
me to come back for approval.  They asked me to report 
back what happens subsequently.  And somewhere, I think 
in August or September, in my report to the board I did 
mention what happened to the matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Well, we have their version.  They 
came here.  They said:  We wanted him to give us 
feedback.  We have questions.  They said the team or the 
executives could not answer.  They said let us refer the 
20 
matter to the acting CE and he will come back to us.  When 
you read the minutes, the minutes says refer it to him 
before it comes to the board for approval.   
MR MOLEFE:   Perhaps there was a misunderstanding. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 115 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it be Mr Molefe that the proper 
way of understanding that minute might be that the board 
wanted you to look at the matter and recommend what 
should happen about it?   
 
Then once you have made the recommendation, 
they might say, okay, if you recommend that they should 
leave it in your hands, you will deal with it, they must say, 
okay, that is fine.   
 
Or if your recommendation was that they as the 
board must make a certain decision, then they would make 
10 
whatever decision if they were persuaded that the way 
forward that you would have recommended would be the 
right one. 
MR MOLEFE:   Perhaps Chairperson but that was not my 
understanding.  My understanding was to deal with the 
matter.  And in any event ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Deal with the matter to finality? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  In any event, this was such a serious 
matter that would have put Eskom out of pocket.  Not only 
was it serious and would have put Eskom out of pocket, it 
20 
was very delicate in my interpretation of the detectives(?) 
that were being employed by Optimum... and so on.  So I 
felt that we had to deal with the matter precisely.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, to the extent that you say it was a 
very serious matter, would that not have been the reason 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 116 of 163 
 
why the board might have wanted that it should not be 
dealt with and finalised without their involvement or that 
they should know what your recommendation for example 
was as to what should be done? 
MR MOLEFE:   Perhaps Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you have a debate – a discussion 
with the board about this issue prior to you terminating the 
Corporation Agreement? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot recall.  I may have had 
10 
discussions with different members of the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But not in the board meeting with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Please turn to page 5 of that 
same exhibit, 38.3.  U-38.2.  Page 5. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the opening speech. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The opening speech. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which paragraph? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 5, paragraph 18.   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 18 where it reads: 
“...I could not face Eskom employees and 
unions. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 117 of 163 
 
To tell them that their bonuses would not be 
paid.   
This was nearly the case in 2015 and that we 
had no funds to fix the apartheid wage gap 
between black and white employees of Eskom, 
while 
rich 
international 
corporations 
were 
unduly exploiting Eskom. 
As I have stated, the payments to Glencore 
would sunk Eskom...” 
 
That word exploitation, could that be what driven 
10 
you to or drove you to deal with the matter, as you say, 
decisively? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was not the only reason Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There were many? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   There were many? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, there were quite a few.  I mean, I gave 
the 
context 
yesterday 
about 
my 
dealing 
with 
the 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   ...the Glencore before Transnet, that they 
were... when the entire industry has agreed to the Take or 
Pay Agreement and that I found that this agreement was 
basically preposterous.   
 
And my information was that it is possible even 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 118 of 163 
 
ultra vires but it was not entered into... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We have spent quite some Mr Seleka on 
this yesterday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I am moving on Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The last sentence which says: 
“As I have stated, the payments to Glencore 
would have sunk Eskom...” 
 
Are you able to explain to the Chairperson, 
10 
Mr Molefe, why in January 2016, February to April – I think 
from April also to October 2016, did Eskom agree to buy 
coal from OCM via Tegeta? 
MR MOLEFE:   When? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   January 2016. 
MR MOLEFE:   We spoke about this yesterday Mr Seleka.  
That was for Arnot. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
MR MOLEFE:   And it was not just Tegeta.  There were six 
coal suppliers.  And the contract at Arnot was one 
20 
thousand and I think ninety rands per ton. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I clarify my question? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   What I am saying to you is this.  OCM 
owns the mine. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 119 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   OCM...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   OCM owns the mine. 
MR MOLEFE:   OCM owns the mine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Owns the mine. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It could go directly to buy from OCM 
and supply to Arnot. 
MR MOLEFE:   There were six suppliers that were 
requested to supply coal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will finish. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   I am not sure where they got the coal from. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No...  Oh.  But let me finish. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because the submission for the 
prepayment for six-hundred and fifty-nine makes it clear 
that they are going to get coal from OCM.  Tegeta will get it 
from OCM and supply Arnot. 
MR MOLEFE:   The submission of six-hundred? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   R 659 million. 
MR MOLEFE:   The prepayment? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, are we at the prepayment now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am linking it with the interim 
contracts that were there in 2016, from January 2016. 
MR MOLEFE:   the interim contracts were entered into in 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 120 of 163 
 
December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Six of them.  Six of them for Arnot. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but it is for Arnot. 
MR MOLEFE:   And in our discussion yesterday and I said 
at R 400,00 they were better than the R 1 000,00 than was 
being paid ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I must ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...corrected me and said it was not 
R 1 000,00, it was R 600,00. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but I am asking a different 
questions. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was even better. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am asking you a different 
question. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The contracts that I am talking about 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...are in January 2016.   
20 
MR MOLEFE:   The six to Arnot? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tegeta... between Tegeta and Eskom 
with Tegeta supplying coal to Arnot. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Those – that interim contract 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 121 of 163 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC:   ...or 
short-term 
contracts 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC:   ...between 
Eskom 
and 
Tegeta 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...relates to coal that Tegeta gets from 
OCM. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And supplies to Arnot. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I am not aware that the coal came from 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...OCM, Tegeta.  You will remember that 
that was the time when I was sick in hospital.  So 
December/January 2016.  So I am aware that there was a 
problem at Arnot ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   ...the contract was coming to an end but I 
also know that six BEE suppliers were contracted to supply 
at four hundred and something.  One of them was Tegeta.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Peculiar but you are not interested in the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 122 of 163 
 
other five, not even their names, but one of them was 
Tegeta. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   And all of them supplied at about R 400,00 
which was way below what we were buying the coal at in a 
mine from...  Sorry, in a power station whose coal supply 
agreement had come to an end.   
 
Now I was – I am not aware that they bought the 
coal from OCM, what the arrangements were.  In fact, I 
never saw the detail of those agreements with the...  
10 
 
I just came to know about it at the executive 
level when I came back.  This is the arrangement that was 
done to deal with the situation at the Arnot.  So I cannot 
comment about the fact that Tegeta was buying coal from 
OCM. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because you do not know anything 
about it. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was not aware that that was 
happening for Arnot.  I was not aware that that was the 
arrangement but that they buy from OCM supply Arnot.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you have any idea of where the 
coal – they were supplying to Arnot, they were getting it 
from? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I just know that Arnot was being 
supplied at R 400,00.  I never went into the detail, where 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 123 of 163 
 
they are getting the coal, why they are getting the coal.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Is that not rather striking? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Strikingly strange?   
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You know why I am saying that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because there is a statement you 
made about the President as the chairman of the company.  
He would have known what was happening with the 
10 
transaction. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the Chief Executive of Eskom does 
not know what is happening with Eskom and Tegeta and 
where Tegeta is getting the coal from. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   How come? 
MR MOLEFE:   Granularity.  Granularity.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Face this side Mr Molefe because when 
you face that side ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, ja face the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I cannot hear you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Granularity.  He paid(?).  So, I mean, even 
as I was in hospital, I can tell you that this and this and 
that happened.  I was aware of what was happening but if  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 124 of 163 
 
you go and ask me but – so where did Tegeta get the coal?  
That is the level of detail to which I never went down to.   
 
I just know that there were companies that were 
dealing with the situation at Arnot by supplying at R 400,00 
which was less than what we have been buying coal from 
Arnot at and that what we – what Arnot had been asking for 
including the request of purchase land for them.   
 
So I am aware of that but the granularity that did 
pay – the precise detail of, so where did they get the coal 
and on which days was it delivered and who was the 
10 
person who signed the proof of delivery?  I do not have 
that detail.   
 
Similarly, on this matter, a company like OCM, 
when it is in negotiations of a nature such as we are 
talking about here, which is that they have a penalty of 
R 2 billion and they are in negotiations to increase the 
price from R 150,00 to R 400,00 and/or R 500,00 and if 
they do not, they have a hardship.   
 
That matter would have gone.  The chairman 
would have known about it.  The chairman would have 
20 
known about it and I am saying...  Well, I think the 
chairman would have known about it because he is not 
naïve.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   What one would ordinarily have 
expected that if price was Eskom’s issue, Eskom which is 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 125 of 163 
 
in financial strains, as you have said, would have been to 
go directly to OCM and even pay a cheaper price than they 
would have had to pay ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, then what would be... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Wait.  Even pay a cheaper price to 
supply to Arnot than what they paid to Tegeta because 
Tegeta had a mock-up. 
MR MOLEFE:   What would be the cheaper price? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, cheaper in respect of the figures 
that are given.  So let us – let me give you an example.  
10 
The January contract between Eskom and Tegeta, you were 
paying R 467,00 per ton. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tegeta was paying, to get it from OCM, 
R 448,00 per ton. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You could have paid that R 448,00 per 
ton directly to OCM. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  Chairperson, the procurement people 
who were paying a spread of R 20,00 is something that 
20 
never came to my...  And did not need to because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Come closer to the mic. 
MR MOLEFE:   The procurement people were paying 
R 20,00 spread because one of the suppliers was getting 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 126 of 163 
 
the coal somewhere, is a matter that never came to my 
attention.  I was happy with the big picture, which is that, 
Arnot is getting coal at much less than what they were 
getting it from.   
 
I think that, now that you mention it, if Tegeta 
could get the coal cheaper somewhere and give it to us, as 
long as they were supplying at a price that they had 
contracted with the procurement people.  And I was trying 
to explain yesterday Chairperson, price is willing for our 
willing seller.   
10 
 
So if there is a willing buyer willing seller at 
R 468,00 and there was another willing buyer willing seller 
at R 440,00 and somebody could go and buy the coal at 
R 440,00 and sell it at R 468,00, that is how capitalism 
works ...suppose the markets work.  There is nothing 
peculiar about it.   
 
And in fact, not something that needs to be 
elevated to the office of the Chief Executive as a crisis.  It 
happens all the time.  People buy products and sell them 
at a higher price when they have an existing contract to 
20 
supply at a higher price.   
 
There is nothing irregular about it.  It is just 
when, I think when they contract – the Primary Energy 
people 
contracted 
with 
the 
sixth 
company, 
they 
contracted...   
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 127 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   But I do not know Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...if Tegeta was the only one that was doing 
that of the six. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was doing? 
MR MOLEFE:   That were getting – that were actually not 
mining the coal but buying it somewhere and giving it to us 
at R 468,00.  I do not know but it does not matter even if 
they were doing it.  It is just that you are interested in 
10 
Tegeta because of... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because of your relationship with 
Tegeta and the owners of Tegeta which dates way back 
before Transnet at IDC to establish a private bank.  That is 
the reason. 
MR MOLEFE:   H’m. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Because 
it 
seems 
from 
your 
explanations that you could not see eye to eye with 
Glencore but you were playing soft gloves with Tegeta. 
MR MOLEFE:   But I told you, even when the six contracts 
20 
were signed, I was not there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, sure.  I understand that but I am 
telling you why there is a focus on Tegeta because of the 
Gupta’s. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 128 of 163 
 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 And 
you 
will 
know 
from 
the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   So that is... that is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...the end of your story and you will stick to 
it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no.  Let me ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...despite what evidence says? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no.   
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, so you will not stick to? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am not sticking to any story.   
MR MOLEFE:   No, you are.  You are pinning me on Tegeta 
at all costs even when I tell you I was in hospital. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Molefe, all you need is to say that 
you disagree with what he is saying and if you want to 
expand, you expand.  Then he moves on.  He says what he 
wants to say.  If you think it has got no foundation or is 
wrong or is flawed, you are free to say so.  When I stick to 
it or not but we do need to move on so that there is 
purpose. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I disagree with what you say Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Because on the facts, we have 
not gotten anything from Eskom to explain why it could not 
go directly to OCM to buy this coal and ...[indistinct – 
audio cut] or not.  There is no …[intervenes] 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 129 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I was in hospital.  That is why I 
could not go to hospital in January, I was in hospital. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, Eskom, not you, the individual, but 
Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:   No but you are pinning me, you are saying 
because of my relationship with the Guptas, you are not 
saying Eskom’s relationship with the Guptas, so you are 
personalizing it and I am telling you that as a person I was 
not physically there.  I understand the transaction because 
am the Chief Executive but I was not physically there, it 
10 
was not done at my bidding, I did not say guys, you guys 
must buy from OCM, do not buy directly from OCM, I was 
not there to do that.  I have pulmonary oedema which is – 
my lungs had been flooded with water and I was still sick. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In his affidavit Mr Marsden says during 
that time in January 2016 Mr Gert Opperman had told him 
in respect of Hendrina we do not need the amount of coal 
that had been contracted for, we need less.  As a result of 
that, Hendrina or OCM had a surplus of coal and it was 
that 
surplus 
of 
coal 
which 
Tegeta 
was 
buying 
and 
20 
transporting it to Arnot. 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment on that, I was [indistinct 
– dropping voice] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, then let us see whether you can 
comment on this because the impression from all of this is 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 130 of 163 
 
that Eskom went out of its way to assist Tegeta financially 
and do so for the purposes of acquiring OCH and to 
remove Glencore from Eskom.  Are you able to comment on 
that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I disagree and I cannot comment on 
that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Let me take it further and see 
whether you can comment on this.  This is relative to the 
penalty claim.  In your testimony yesterday you were 
saying it did not sit well with you that you could leave the 
10 
penalty claim against Glencore and go to the Soweto 
residence and tell them to pay Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that was the hard stance taken in 
regard to Glencore. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When it came to Tegeta, Eskom did not 
only fail to recover that 2.1 billion.  Not only did it fail to 
recover that but it went a step further, it gave Tegeta 
temporary relief of about 13 months in terms of which 
20 
Eskom waived penalties. 
MR MOLEFE:   Is this after I had left? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is from January 2016. 
MR MOLEFE:   After I had left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You had left. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 131 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I had left, so I cannot comment on it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is what Eskom relative to 
Tegeta.  Ja, I cannot comment on that what Eskom did, I 
had left.  So that adds you would have left …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   But while I was there, there was no relief 
that was given to Tegeta on anything while I was there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but when you were there, Tegeta 
was …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   There was no relief that was given to 
Tegeta on anything, so I do not know why you are trying to 
10 
bring things that happened after my tenure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, Mr Molefe, you left in December 
2016. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This was taking place in 2016, the 
reliefs were given, the first one from the 1 September 2016 
to July 2017 and it was given on the 20 December 2016 
after they had already breached the contract. 
MR MOLEFE:   The relief was given on the 20 December 
2016? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Effective, let me tell you… 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Effective from the 1 September 2016. 
MR MOLEFE:   I officially took leave during December 
2016 until my last day at work, my remaining – I was not at 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 132 of 163 
 
work, there was an Acting CEO during December 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From beginning of December? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, from beginning of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so you were not at Eskom 
December. 
MR MOLEFE:   I was not at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and somebody else was acting in your 
position. 
MR MOLEFE:   There was an acting CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But they would already have been in 
breach from the 1 September because that is – we 
retrospectively ask for that relief. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are you aware that they were in 
breach? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I was not aware that they were breach 
but I was not party to any discussion in the relief. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Now lastly, Chair, is the point Mr 
Molefe referred us to in regard to Mr Snehal Nagar, I went 
20 
and read that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With regard to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Snehal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Oh is that the one who is supposed 
to have …[intervenes] 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 133 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Confirmed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Given calculations? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja but I think Mr Molefe was saying 
confirmed the figure of 2.17 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if we are talking about the same 
thing, Mr Molefe was saying somebody from – somebody 
came here and was explaining how the penalty of 2, 
whatever the amount is, billion rand, was made up and 
seeking to explain or justify it and I think that is what – if 
he was talking about and that is the person you are talking 
10 
about as well? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are talking the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I read the affidavit, I do not need to – 
or we can if you want to, Mr Molefe.  In – maybe the Chair, 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you want to read the affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I am not reading the affidavit, I will 
20 
explain what I see from the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then Mr Molefe can comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because – oh …[intervenes] 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 134 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if it is important to read you can 
read, I just want to understand what the connection is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With what Mr Molefe said yesterday, or 
what the purpose is of referring to the affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  In fact as I drop my head that it 
clicked in my mind that you are asking me for the purpose 
not for why am I reading, why should I read, ja.  The 
purpose, Chair, is to explain – Mr Molefe, you would listen 
there.  What Mr Nagar says in affidavit in regard to the 2.1 
10 
billion – so he puts it as a claim that could be – that Eskom 
could have – and that is at the beginning of the calculation 
and he goes on to talk about a calculation and the errors in 
the calculation that they subsequently change.  He talks 
about the 158 million that was already charged that had to 
come from that amount, it was not due, it had been 
deducted and he arrives at a conclusion that in his view he 
believed that Eskom had a potential claim of 1.1 billion, 
the ultimate conclusion.  So that is what I wanted to 
convey to Mr Molefe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, remember that he said he cannot 
comment on how they came to that amount. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was told that the claim was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 135 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was told it was legitimate and he 
sought to recover that amount. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So with regard to how it was made up 
and whether there was a proper foundation for it, it was 
justified or not, he said he has no personal knowledge, all 
he knows is people that he believed knew told him there is 
this claim that Eskom has against OCM, it is legitimate.  I 
think he said he did explain some things about it but he 
was satisfied that he should pursue the claim. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I accept that, Chair.  All I am 
saying is to clarify what came out yesterday is confirmation 
of the figure of 2.17 by Mr Nagar.  I have read the affidavit.  
One needs to clarify what he said in that affidavit, just for 
the purposes of the record.  Ja.  Because even what he 
believed was the 1.1 billion Eskom would be entitled to 
pursue on – it was still compromised, it was still reduced to 
255 million.  It is not Mr Molefe – it may not be Mr Molefe’s 
problem but just to place it on record.  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Just for the record, Chair, the narrative has 
20 
been that when I arrived at Eskom I arbitrarily imposed a 
penalty of 2 billion on Optimum so that they can sell the 
mine to Tegeta, right?  What this proves is that there was 
no arbitrary action on my part and that even the 2 billion 
was not a figment of my imagination, it is mentioned in Mr 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 136 of 163 
 
Nagar ’s papers, it is an amount that had been outstanding 
long before I arrived.  So my only purpose of including it in 
my statement was to say that the narrative that says that it 
was my scheme to impose the penalty to force Optimum 
into hardship – I think even Mr Ramatlhodi put it like that, 
that Mr Molefe arrived there and he just imposed a R2 
billion penalty as if I woke up one morning and imposed a 
R2 billion penalty.  The R2 billion penalty was properly 
documented, it was calculated – there may have been 
disagreements 
between 
the 
different 
officials, 
legal, 
10 
engineers and so on and even the executives but there was 
a basis of the penalty in the region of R2 billion.  
 
Whether eventually after I had left Eskom was able 
to recover it, is another matter that I was not involved in.  
Ja, but sometimes I even think well, by pursing the 2 
billion if we got was 200 million is still better than nothing 
than not pursuing it at all because at least something went 
to Eskom but I am not expression an opinion on that, I was 
not there.  The 2 billion is what was on the table as what 
needs to be pursued and as a responsible Chief Executive, 
20 
that is what I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, from the evidence one cannot 
conclude that the 2.17 billion was properly documented.  I 
think that clarification needs to be pointed out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat the clarification? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 137 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I said from the evidence given, even 
from Mr Snehal’s affidavit it cannot – a conclusion cannot 
be made that the 2.17 billion penalties were properly 
documented. 
MR MOLEFE:   But do we agree, Chairperson, that the 2.1 
billion was not a figment of my imagination? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not know, Mr Molefe, Ms Daniels 
testified here that the opinions of CDH were drawn to you 
and Mr Koko’s attention and you did not heed the concerns 
that were raised. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   No but it is not something that I sucked out 
of my thumb. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR MASUKU:  Sorry, Chair, now I am not understanding, 
can I just ask? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASUKU:  If Mr Seleka is suggesting that the 2 billion 
was in fact a figment of Mr Molefe’s imagination because 
that would be unfair for him to continue making that 
suggestion when he cannot substantiate it.  It will be 
20 
inconsistent with his own evidence.  Even if it were to be 
wrong on the evidence he has, it does not suppose the 
proposition that he is trying to advance which is that this 
was an arbitrary figure for which Mr Molefe just woke up 
one day and imposed. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 138 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I think we are 
talking cross purposes.  Mr Molefe is the one saying to me 
this was not a figure of his own imagination, it was not his 
thumb suck.  I responded to clarify what he said about this 
figure was properly documented.  I say when you read the 
evidence even Mr Snehal’s affidavit, CDH’s affidavit, you 
cannot come to the conclusion that the figure was properly 
documented.  I have never gone beyond that to say 
whether it was a figment of his imagination or not, I am not 
10 
saying that.  Then I put to him what Ms Daniels said.  Ms 
Daniels said these concerns in the opinions of CDH were 
drawn to their attention but they decided not to heed those 
concerns and forged ahead with the claim.  That is all.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is clarified. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that brings me to the end. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you deal last time with the 
meeting between or involving Mr Molefe, Dr Ngubane and 
Mr Ramatlhodi? 
ADV SELEKA SC:     We did, Chair, last time and we 
touched a little bit on it yesterday, we just brushed it.  For 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 139 of 163 
 
the benefit of the Chairperson that can be traversed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you should traverse that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes because Mr Molefe, as we stopped 
yesterday, there are notices given by DMR in August. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which are different from the notices 
given in November 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which are? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are different from the notices given in 
November 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The notices issues in August – and they 
say the 4 August, related to the retrenchment process that 
did not follow Section 189. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure, Mr Seleka, whether we 
are on the same page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am more interested in the purpose of 
20 
the meeting that was subject divergent relations between 
on the one hand Mr Ramatlhodi.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think to a certain extent his former DG 
– is it Ramon? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 140 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ramontja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes.  And Mr Molefe and Dr 
Ngubane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand it, if I recall correctly, 
Mr Ramatlhodi’s version was that that was a meeting where 
Dr Ngubane and Mr Molefe – maybe he said Dr Ngubane –[ 
sought to put pressure on him, I think to cancel or suspend 
the mining licence of Glencore. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of Glencore. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Glencore.  And Dr Ngubane and I 
think Mr Molefe’s version was that the purpose of that 
meeting was for them to ask him to withdraw the notices, if 
I am not mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That he had issued which had ensured 
that, I think, OCM stopped providing coal or that is the 
meeting I am talking about and I think the most important 
thing is what was discussed at that meeting really. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the purpose of the meeting, is 
it the purpose that Mr Ramatlhodi mentioned or the 
purpose that Dr Ngubane and Mr Molefe mentioned. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, Mr Ramatlhodi …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair, it is fine. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 141 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you go straight into the meeting that 
is fine, it is just that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you can deal with other matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just wanted to make sure we are – you 
understand which meeting I am talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, I am because the notices 
give the context to that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I think – Mr Molefe, you know this 
because – let us see his explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know which meeting I am talking 
about, Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, the meeting that was talked about 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, no that is fine. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
I 
just 
recall 
that 
Mr 
Ramatlhodi in his evidence said Mr Molefe was there and 
he kept quiet, he did not say …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that sentence? 
MR MOLEFE:  He says Mr Molefe was there and he kept 
quiet and he did not say anything.  My recollection, 
actually, I do not recall exactly what was discussed, I do 
not even recall that Mr Mantsha was there.  I recall 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 142 of 163 
 
vaguely that there was meeting with Mr Ramatlhodi and Dr 
Ngubane.  However, what I did say in my statement and 
even in parliament was that I found it peculiar that Mr 
Ramatlhodi said what was discussed there was that issue, 
the takeaway the licences of Glencore and that he said he 
would never do something like that because of the 
problems at Eskom when in fact he had already done it, 
with the retrenchments.  So that specific meeting I cannot 
recall what was being said but I just remember Mr 
Ramatlhodi’s statement being odd in a sense that but he 
10 
had done that, exactly that.  
 
So when he did it and how he did it – what actually 
happened at that time, I am not sure what the sequence of 
events was but the only thing – and I do not remember 
what was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Discussed. 
MR MOLEFE:  Maybe I was absentminded in that meeting, 
as he says I was quiet, but I just found it odd that he would 
so vehemently deny that he would agree or he would so 
vehemently say that he would never have taken away the 
20 
licences when in fact he had done so with the retrenchment 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is important when one looks at 
the point you made to have regard to the dates when was 
the 
retrenchment 
issue 
that 
you 
are 
talking 
about.  
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 143 of 163 
 
Unfortunately, my recollection is that none of the parties 
who attended that meeting appear to remember the date or 
they give very different, I think, times.  I think Dr 
Ngubane’s version, if I am not mistaken, suggests that the 
meeting would have been – I do not know whether early in 
August or early in July but Mr Ramatlhodi’s version, if I am 
not mistaken, seemed to suggest that the meeting would 
have been early in September or late August but Mr Seleka 
might be able as he asks questions might be able to say 
the retrenchment notices were on such and such a date 
10 
then we can take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  The notices regarding the 
retrenchment are said to have been issues around the 4 or 
the 5 August 2015 but Dr Ramontja says those notices 
were lifted on the 7 August 2015 after …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And effectively were withdrawn.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  They were withdrawn, yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Those – now we refer to as notices, you 
know, notices of retrenchment, would normally be issued 
by the employer.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These were notices to say what? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are not notices of retrenchment, 
yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 144 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  These notices, let me see what 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think 
if 
I 
recall 
correctly, 
the 
suggestion from Mr Ramatlhodi was that the employer 
wanted to retrench workers in breach of some law and 
those notices are notices that the Department of Mineral 
Resources could issue when an employer seeks to retrench 
workers in breach of the law. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  According to Dr Ramontja, he says 
the department suspended Optimum Coal Mine operations 
10 
in terms of the Act on or about 4 August 2015, the 
suspension 
related 
to 
concerns 
about 
retrenchment 
processes that were being implemented by the mine, mine 
management.  The dispute was attended to and the 
suspension was lifted on or about 7 August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So if Mr Molefe you – okay, so 
those were the – would those have been the notices that 
you 
say 
Mr 
Ramatlhodi 
had 
already 
issued 
for 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, that is the deed that had already been 
20 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  He did suspend the operations.  But when 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 145 of 163 
 
he came out in public he said I could never suspend 
operations because we were having load shedding.  But, 
Chair, the 4 t h – the 7 August is four days before we 
actually stopped load shedding.  Stopped on the 8 August 
2015.  So it was around that period, it was at a very 
delicate time and he did suspend operations of Optimum 
and – so when he came out and said but how could they 
have expected me to suspend these operations, I felt – I 
thought it was odd because it is something that he had 
done before. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must say that my recollection and 
Mr Seleka might check this, my recollection is that his 
version was that what Dr Ngubane wanted him to do was 
not just suspend any licence but was actually to cancel the 
mining licence, is that correct, Mr – or withdraw the mining 
licence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He uses the word, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, does he use the word suspend?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, he uses the word suspend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  So then your point 
20 
would come in if you say if he had already previously 
suspended the mining licence of Glencore why would he 
have had – why would he say he could not suspend the 
mining licence of Glencore in the midst of load shedding.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 146 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the point you make. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Maybe he could have given reason 
maybe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  But not that he could not because he did do 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  So he should have said well, it is illegal or it 
is contra bonos mores or whatever but not to say that he 
cannot do it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you say you cannot recall what was 
discussed at that meeting but I am under the impression 
that in your affidavit you …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:  No, I simply say that the discussion could 
not have been about the suspension of the mining licence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  In any way because it is something that we 
did not want him to do.  In any case, he could not say that 
he refuses to suspend the mining licence because he had 
already done it.  So I cannot recall what the discussion 
20 
really was about, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  As I say, I think in that meeting I just sat 
quietly and must have been absentminded because I 
cannot really recall what has been said.  I do not even 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 147 of 163 
 
remember that Mr Montsha …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ramontja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  I have a vague recollection of this 
meeting with Mr Ramatlhodi and Dr Ngubane but I cannot 
recall – but I can, by deduction, I can say but it is unlikely 
that this was the [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Because that is the meeting 
where he said – as he said Dr Ngubane went to the extent 
of saying to him in effect he should tell him what his final 
decision is about the request that he was making because 
10 
he needs to go and brief the President about the matter 
and the President was going to be going out of the country 
on that day if I can recall correctly. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is my recollection correct Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, no Chair that is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and he says he refused, and he says 
it didn’t take long after President Zuma had come back 
from a certain trip, it looks like the President did go out of 
the country, either on the same day or the following, I 
20 
cannot remember, was it the 2 n d of September? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That’s a remarkable memory Chair, 
that is 22 September yes 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So, I can read it to the Chair. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 148 of 163 
 
“It is however Ngubane became impatient as he 
advised me that he had to brief the President on the  
outcome of the meeting before he left for his BRICS 
meeting that afternoon, I did not waiver in my 
stance.  A few weeks after the return of the 
President from his BRICS meeting on 22 September 
2015 I was called to meet the President at his 
official residence, [should I carry on].  When I 
arrived, 
we 
met 
Mr 
Ace 
Magashule 
and 
Mr 
Mosebenzi Zwane whom I did not know at the time, 
10 
in the waiting area.  I privately met the President 
who thanked me for my exemplary service as 
Minister of the DMR and informed me that he is 
moving me to the position of Minister of DPSA as 
there was a vacancy at the time, I then agreed and 
then left”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, well what I wanted to say is, 
it’s a meeting, where, according to Mr Ramatlhodi, Dr 
Ngubane, among other things, you know what’s your final 
decision because I must report to the President before he 
20 
leaves, but that might not jog your memory, just in case it 
could jog your memory. 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It doesn’t? 
MR MOLEFE:   Not. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 149 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, the – according to Dr Ramonsha 
[?], Mr Molefe, he places your meeting, meaning Dr 
Ngubane and you with Minister Ramatlhodi at the time in 
early September 2015…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   30 September or 30 August? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    In early September 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, as I say, Chair I remember that meeting 
here, I don’t even recall Mr Ramonsha was there, but I 
can’t – I don’t remember the dates. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are not able to say, where about 
in 
August 
or 
September 
or 
July 
it 
might 
have 
been…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   My thought process about this thing is like 
one thing that happed there was a suspension of the 
license and of the operation and then it was exposed and 
then, a few years later Mr Ramatlhodi said…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A few years,  or a few weeks or a few 
months. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, when he was…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   When he was in Parliament, just before 
Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Two years later, so this is when this cue 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 150 of 163 
 
comes back for the first time, after a few years and he 
says that look, these people were trying to get me to 
suspend a mining license and my thought was, that cannot 
be possible because we did not want the mining licenses to 
be suspended and in any case he did do it, he did do it 
without our encouragement, he did do it.  So, that is my 
view on this issue, that is what I remember happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   And then I – unfortunately, I’ve lost a lot of 
the detail about it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, Mr Seleka, it’s a question of just 
checking whether, in his affidavit, Mr Molefe said more or 
less the same thing. I was under the impression that he – 
his affidavit reflected somebody who had a recollection of 
what happened at the meeting.  Obviously that you can 
only get by looking at his affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It’s here, I have it in front of me 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Because I’ve been trying to follow him 
20 
and find the passage in his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what did you say in the affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    He says,  during – that’s paragraph 
97, 
“Dr Ngubane and I had a meeting with Minister 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 151 of 163 
 
Ramatlhodi 
where 
Dr 
Ngubane 
asked 
him 
to 
reconsider the decision to suspend the licences of 
Glencore 
because 
of 
our 
concern 
about 
the 
negative impact on the security of supply of coal to 
Hendrina Power Station and the possible impact on 
load shedding.  We were relieved, when a few days 
later, the suspension of the licenses was withdrawn.  
The next paragraph says, I was dumbfounded when, 
in May 2017 former Minister Ramatlhodi claimed 
that the Eskom Chairman, Dr Ngubane and I met 
10 
with him to ask him to suspend Glencore’s license”.  
MR MOLEFE:   As I said that is how I recall the incident. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, is the position that the difference 
between what he says now and what he said in the 
affidavit, is that, in the affidavit you seemed to remember 
at least one or two things that were said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, that’s what I think I’m picking up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes.  Does that surprise you, that in 
the affidavit you seemed to have remembered at least one 
or two things? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Chairperson, all I remember is that 
the licenses were suspended, there were representations 
that the licenses should not be suspended, and I think they 
happened  that meeting.  I can’t remember when that 
meeting was or what the details of the conversation was 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 152 of 163 
 
and the licenses had been suspended and a few days later, 
the licenses were restored, operations were restored and 
in fact, yesterday, I was saying that in my head, it was in 
the context of the strength of Mr Glason. So, and – but 
then I cannot impute that …[indistinct dropped voice] but I 
do remember that, in that whole confusion, that individual 
licenses got suspended maybe it was a month and a half or 
a month later the licenses were suspended and then I 
remember there was a frantic effort to make contact with 
the DMR and discuss with the DMR about the suspension 
10 
of the licenses and the impact on Hendrina.   There was a 
meeting with Mr Ramatlhodi.  What I can’t remember is 
whether two meetings…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s what I wanted to find out because 
yesterday at some stage I seemed to understand, either 
from you or from Mr Seleka that there may have been two 
meetings, I think from you if I’m not mistaken. 
MR MOLEFE:   I can’t recall properly, the only thing that I 
remember is that licenses were suspended and we made 
contact …[indistinct – dropping voice]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, if…[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   This issue of the President and so on, if it 
was mentioned in a meeting where I was present, I do not 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the meeting was about you and Dr 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 153 of 163 
 
Ngubane asking him to withdraw the suspension of the 
mining license and if you accept that those notices had 
been issued, was it on the 4 t h of August and withdrawn on 
the 7 t h, then your meeting must have been between those 
two dates. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is early August. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on your – if that is what the purpose 
of the meeting was then that meeting would have been 
10 
between those two dates. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, if it was about the license, that’s the 
meeting I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   This other one, it may have happened, but I 
don’t…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t recall. 
MR MOLEFE:   So, I can’t – I complained, I remember – ja 
20 
I remember us going to the DMR office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And getting to Mr Ramatlhodi’s office as I 
say, I don’t even remember that Mr Ramatlhodi was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 154 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, Dr Ngubane’s version is that the 
withdrawal of the notices was done on the 11 t h of 
November 2015, he says,  
“The meeting was arranged by Mr Molefe, I cannot 
remember the date of the meeting, luckily Mr 
Ramatlhodi re-instated the mining license on 11 
November 2015”. 
 
So, if the meeting took place in early August 2015, 
those notices would have remained in place for the rest of 
August, October and the first week of November. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Dr Ngubane says 11 November? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    11 November yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I can’t comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    But what is also strange is this, Mr 
Molefe, there are notices that are issued in November 2015 
abruptly issued by the DMR and they stay for a longer 
period than what you see in the first notices, but we don’t 
have any evidence of intervention by officials like you, the 
Chairman, Dr Ngubane, with Minister of the DMR at that 
20 
time being Minister Zwane to reverse the imposition of 
those licenses, I mean the suspensions. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
The 
notices 
in 
November 
suspend 
operation? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    They suspended operations. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 155 of 163 
 
MR MOLEFE:   At Hendrina? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    At various mines of …[intervenes]. 
MR MOLEFE:   Including Hendrina? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay let me read from Miss 
..[indistinct]: 
 
“In the subsequent four days, three further Section 
54 notices were issued to other mines in which Glencore 
had an interest, 
 
And then he gives the names, Wonderfontein, 
Tweefontein, Goedgevonden, copies of these sections are

annexed, and the reasons provided for the suspensions are 
set out in the notices.  The first one was Koornfontein Mine 
pursuant to a Section 54 notice, ja, 26 November 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I was aware of the Hendrina one 
because of our interaction with Mr Dazendorf, I’m not sure 
the other suspensions, how they happened and how the 
primary energy…[indistinct dropped voice]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    How did you become aware of the 
Hendrina one? 
MR MOLEFE:   Sorry? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    How did you become aware of the 
notices in respect of Hendrina? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was in the press, it was in the press, I 
think in my submission to Parliament I even attached the 
newspaper article but now I’m …[indistinct dropped voice].

ADV SELEKA SC:    Say again? 
MR MOLEFE:   I say now, I’m afraid to submit them 
because you were saying they’re not credible, yesterday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You submitted what? 
MR MOLEFE:   The newspaper clippings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, now we accepted them, you can 
give them to me.  
MR MOLEFE:   They’re in my – I think they’re attached to 
my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If they are attached to the affidavit then 
10 
they are there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, well the impression to be made 
or to be – you know the impression, Mr Molefe, that has 
been expressed in regard to these notices being issued 
against Glencore that Glencore – a pressure was being 
brought to bear on Glencore to succumb to the offer that 
had been made by Oakbay/Tegeta and I’m saying the 
impression – I’m giving you a chance to comment. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I don’t agree with it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That in you and Dr Ngubane 
approaching Minister Ramatlhodi it was in furtherance of 
that pressure. 
MR MOLEFE:  I don’t agree with it. 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 157 of 163 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You don’t agree that will be the 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Masuku do you intend re-
examining or not really? 
ADV MASUKU SC:   No, I don’t intend to re-examine, 
partly because, Chair,  I do think that it’s been a long day 
for my client, and I do feel like it will be unfair to subject 
him to further questioning.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MASUKU SC:    I would though,  if a smart question 
10 
which usually comes through, if it’s something that I need 
to place before you, I will ask for an opportunity to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that’s fine.  Okay, you are 
scheduled to appear before the Commission in regard to 
the Transnet work stream sometime next week. 
MR MOLEFE:    Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so we’ll see you next week. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I’d like to make a statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   I would like to make a statement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Laugher], you’ll make your request on 
Monday.  We going to adjourn, I just want to say this Mr 
Molefe, it may be that, at some stage, even if it’s during 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 158 of 163 
 
the Transnet – your evidence under Transnet it may be that 
we might come back to it.  One of the issues that I may 
have to grapple with, depending on what the picture is that 
will emerge after all the evidence is in, is whether certain 
decisions about what was to happen at Transnet, at Eskom 
were being made outside of Eskom/Transnet and even 
Government or not and  if so, who knew about these 
decisions or who were participants in those decisions and 
so on.  One of the things I raised earlier on with you was, 
there is this situation where, in December 2010 – actually I 
10 
shouldn’t go through it because we  went through it, where 
either the newspaper associated with the Gupta’s the New 
Age in 2010 says, you are going to be the next boss of 
Transnet and if I recall correctly, in terms of evidence, you 
may not have applied for that position at that time and then 
we – or you go to Eskom then at some stage along – some 
months before that Mr Salim Essa got into Henk Esther, 
and says, Mr Salim Essa said we have made a decision 
that, the next boss of Eskom will be Mr Brian Molefe and 
then within the context of the suspension of the Executives 
20 
at Eskom there is evidence, it’s not unanimous, it is 
disputed that there are witnesses who have said on the 
10 t h of March 2015 one day before the Board suspended 
the Executives, a meeting took place at Melrose Arch 
involving Mr Koko.   
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 159 of 163 
 
Two meetings, one involving Mr Koko, Mr Salim 
Essa and Ms Daniels at which Ms Daniels was told that 
there will be suspension of Executives and names were 
given and then another one involving Mr Koko and Mr 
Salim Essa and Mr Abraham Masango where Mr Masango 
says he was also told that there would be suspension of 
Executives and I think names were given and of course the 
evidence, also, that I’ve heard, includes evidence where 
some documents that everybody seems to accept came 
outside of Eskom seemed to have been sent to Eskom for 
10 
example a document or email that was saying to the Board 
of Eskom, it should make a resolute resolution that it would 
not, I think, have any business relations with certain 
newspapers including The City Press and Dr Ngubane 
says, he did take that and present it to the Board and the 
Board took such a resolution and then the manner in which 
the Executives, the three Executives who exited Eskom it 
may well be that when all evidence is in one might say, 
maybe there were people who were outside of Eskom and 
outside of Government may be working with people within 
20 
Government, 
with 
people 
within 
Eskom, 
maybe 
also 
Transnet, I’m not sure who were influencing to say the 
least, decisions that were being taken. 
So, within your 
context the question might be, what are the chances that 
some people were planning about your life that you go to 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 160 of 163 
 
Transnet and be Group CEO and then you go to Eskom and 
be Group CEO without your knowing, without talking to 
you, without any consultation.  So, I mention that, just to 
say, as I look at the situation, I may need to grapple with 
those issues and you have indicated what you’ve indicated 
earlier on but if you have anything further that you’d like to 
say, maybe when you come for the Transnet work stream 
you could deal with it. 
MR MOLEFE:   If I can just say one thing about that story 
is that firstly, I’m not aware that there were decisions that 
10 
were taken outside, it might well be so, but I’m not aware 
that decisions were being taken outside of organisations or 
outside of the Government.  Secondly my frustration with 
that merit is that story that you just told is that it does not 
leave me with anything to answer because all of those 
things, my name is mentioned in the context of other 
people 
talking 
about 
me, 
there 
is 
not 
where 
it 
says…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Molefe said this. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, and Mr Molefe said this, and Mr Molefe 
20 
did this and so on and so forth.  So, that frustrates me 
because it looks like there is – I’m about to be accused or 
– asked questions that are about to be cast on me on 
things that I had no control over because the whole – from 
the beginning of this statement that you just said, till the 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 161 of 163 
 
end there is nowhere, where you say and then you, Mr 
Molefe, you can’t explain this or you did this and you can’t 
explain that and so on.  As I have tried to do in the last two 
days Chair, all my actions at Eskom – now I think I’ve 
given a reasonable explanation why we were doing things 
the way we were doing it was not directed from us, it was 
in what I believed to be correct and I have – I just have a 
difficulty, I don’t know how I’m going to deal with the fact 
that people who are then talking about me then [speaking 
in vernacular]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I don’t know whether …[indistinct] 
when they are planning – well I don’t know whether I 
should say they are planning making good plans for your 
career. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I didn’t need them for my career, as I 
said I didn’t need them for my career, they never consulted 
me so I am surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but the purpose of mentioning it to 
you is just so that you know what I may be grappling with 
when I have to look at the evidence and to give you the 
20 
opportunity to influence which way one should look at it 
and in part you are saying, I’m frustrated because in all of 
this people …[indistinct] [laughing], they are gossiping 
about me.  
MR MOLEFE:   And my ear, Chair, is …[indistinct] 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 162 of 163 
 
[laughing]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. Okay, we …[intervenes]. 
ADV MASUKU SC:    Obviously, the other option is if it is 
possible to have - to get those answers to you in writing. 
The 
idea 
of 
coming 
to 
the 
Commission 
physically…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MASUKU SC:    It’s quite a tiresome process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MASUKU SC:    It’s very involving. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MASUKU SC:    So, it seems to me, at the point which 
you reach where you’re needing to confirm one or two 
things regarding who was planning his career without his 
authorisation, it may well be that a good way to do it, is to 
simply write to him and say here is what I have, if you can 
give me an affidavit in response to what you need and that 
will be sufficient.  You don’t really have time now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no I think what will happen is, I 
think I will give him the opportunity of making written 
20 
submissions on what I should make of the evidence I’ve 
heard, so that will cover that ja. 
ADV MASUKU SC:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you to everybody, we are 
going to adjourn the proceedings for the day and tomorrow 
03 MARCH 2021 – DAY 354 
 
Page 163 of 163 
 
whose evidence will I be hearing Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It’s Ms Bianca Goodson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, only one…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    On McKinsey Trillian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and I think …[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Only one witness …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in the evening I will have an evening 
session tomorrow and I’ll continue with Mr Mantsha’s 
evidence in regard to Denel, just for the benefit of the 
public.   
10 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
