PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 03 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair we are ready to start and todays’ 
proceedings is Ms Mokonyane as the Chair would know she 
– she is testifying in respect of the BOSASA strain.  She 
had testified before and she is here today for further 
testimony.  I understand from her legal representative that 
10 
they want to make some few remarks before we start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  Good morning. 
ADV HODES SC:  Good morning Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
HODES 
SC: 
 
May 
I 
address 
you 
shortly 
Mr 
Chairperson just to put the following facts on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HODES SC:  I act for Ms Mokonyane and my 
instructions are as follows: 
That on Sunday the 5 July 2020 with her consent there was 
20 
an inspection in loco at her home and that is then followed 
as you are well aware by her appearance before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  In this commission on Monday the 20 
July 2020.   
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 4 of 5 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  Subsequent to her appearance here and 
testimony we were told and given a copy of a statement 
from Frederick Hendrick Coetzee it was dated the 22 July 
2020 two days after her testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  That was then followed by a letter that 
we received from the City Press on the 25 July 2020 where 
they asked us to comment or they asked Ms Mokonyane to 
comment on the testimony of Mr Coetzee that had not been 
10 
presented as yet.   
We then sent now attorneys of record sent a letter it 
was copied to the commission explaining that once again 
there had been a security breach on that the number the 
28 July 2020 my attorneys received the official Rule 3.3 
Notice of Mr Coetzee’s testimony.  That was followed if we 
can go forward then to August.  On the 11 August 2020 Mr 
Gina Pieters made a statement.   
We then received a letter from the commission 
concerning the undertaking that you were given by the 
20 
witness to provide information concerning the security 
upgrades on the 17 August 2020 and that was followed by 
another Rule 3.3 Notice on the 19 August 2020 containing 
Ms Gina Pieters’ testimony that she would be giving.  On 
the 28 August 2020 we obtained the SAPS threat and risk 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 5 of 6 
 
assessment 
from 
Ms 
Mokonyane’s 
home 
that 
was 
conducted in April 2009.   
There was then also a request and made available 
the office bearers benefit in line with Ministerial handbook 
dated 29 August 2014.  I believe that was provided to us by 
Mr Nickson the investigator.  He also had and made 
available a SAPS security audit for Ms Mokonyane’s home 
that was dated September 2010 and then as you are well 
aware Mr Chairperson on the 1 September 2020 Ms Sandra 
Thomas that is my client’s former assistant testified here 
10 
and then recently on the 2 September Gina Pieters 
testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  The reason why I am sketching this 
background Mr Chairperson is my client has cooperated.  
She has come back.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  She has very serious health concerns 
with comorbidities.  This room is not conducive to her 
condition and then what happens is each time she testifies 
20 
there is a subsequent character assassination of her in the 
media and there are leaks by the journalists. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  So the request from my client is twofold. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 6 of 7 
 
ADV HODES SC:  Firstly, to have some finality as she has 
cooperated – will cooperate but she wishes to reach some 
finality on this matter and if need will provide other 
documentation whether thus is required but would ask to 
be excused after her testimony today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  The second aspect Mr Chairperson is 
that there is a request on behalf of my client in terms of 
Rule 3.3.6.3 to apply to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV HODES SC:  We are aware that the rules say that 
there must be notification that within two weeks of such 
notice we must apply in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  And that you Mr Chairperson have the 
discretion whether to grant or refuse that application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  We will submit the written application 
and do so.  I have omitted to mention and I apologise in 
the chronology that I was referring you to a security report 
20 
was compiled and it was found as a fact that my client Ms 
Mokonyane’s IP Address had been hacked on the 29 and 
30 August from Pretoria.  So there is a positive report of a 
hacking.  So there is a security threat that she wants 
recorded in this regard and that is why with respect and 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 7 of 8 
 
she asks for finality as to her appearing here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  Should further documentation that she 
may have be requested she will provide it but she asks to 
be excused after today if she may Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  Thank you Mr Chairperson and I assure 
this commission that we will be applying in writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HODES SC:  The commission to cross –examine Mr 
10 
Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HODES SC:  Thank you Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you.  I just want to say 
one or two – or say something on one or two things.  One 
is the – one is to the leaks of affidavits submitted to the 
commission to the media.   
This has been a problem for a long time for the 
commission.  It happened soon after the commission had 
started.  I directed that some investigation be conducted 
20 
by 
our 
investigation 
team 
which 
they 
did 
and 
they 
submitted a report to me which if I recall correctly could 
not pin down anybody within the commission who could 
have leaked those affidavits to the media.   
As some of you may know I have spoken very 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 8 of 9 
 
strongly, publicly against the media. 
1. Action in breach of the regulations publishing matters 
that they are not allowed to publish without seeking 
my permission. 
There was a time when they seemed to have listened, I 
think some time last year for quite some time and then at a 
certain stage – excuse me – at a certain stage some 
newspapers began or went back to this habit.  I must say 
that as far as I know a number of newspapers seem to 
respect the regulation and seem to have taken note of what 
10 
I said and – but I think there are just specific newspapers 
and I think it is just one or two or maybe three – I always – 
I know which they are which do this.   
We have been considering what to do apart from 
laying criminal charges you know.  One of the things we 
have been considering is to withdraw their accreditation for 
– because for them to come to the venue of the hearing 
and be able to record and so on they needed to be 
accredited and we accredited a number of them in 2018.  
But it seems that if we withdrew their accreditation that 
20 
would not really be anything because they could still have 
access to everything that is happening to – in the 
commission so it might not help much.  So there has been 
difficulty with about 1, 2 or three newspapers.   
A lot of others I do not want to brush all of them 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 9 of 10 
 
with the same brush because my impression is that a lot of 
other newspapers respect the law and they support this 
commission and they – they have taken note of what I have 
said in the past.  So when there was a leak with regard to 
Mr Coetzee’s affidavit that was very unacceptable.   
So I just want you to know and your client to know 
that it is a matter we are very concerned about.  It is 
unacceptable but we just have two or three newspapers 
that continue to act in breach of the law.  Yes we have not 
laid charges but we have spoken very strongly and there 
10 
just seems to be a problem.   
I am not saying that we will not lay charges so far, 
we have not because we have been hoping that they will 
come to their senses and – and stop this habit.  So I just 
wanted to say that about that.  And with regard to your 
client wishing to be excused I have no reason to believe as 
I speak now that she would be needed to come back after 
today.   
Obviously because investigations are continuing 
one cannot give a guarantee but I think that everything 
20 
would be done to make sure that she does not have to 
come back unless there is really something serious but 
also in terms of her health situation what could be tried in 
the future in case she is needed is to have her give 
evidence via a video link so that she does not have to 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 10 of 11 
 
come to the venue.  I have allowed that in regard to at 
least one witness who had a concern relating to Covid-19 
and her age – his age and his health conditions on certain 
conditions I could – we could do the same.  That is should 
it become necessary that she makes herself available.   
But as things stand and the legal team and the 
investigation team might have a different view because 
they are much closer to the investigation than I am.  I get 
things much later.   
As far as I am concerned, we would do everything 
10 
we can to avoid her having to come back unless it is really 
necessary but in that event, consideration will be given to 
have video links so that she would not have to come to the 
venue. 
ADV HODES SC:  I thank you Mr Chairperson.  In relation 
to the pursuit of the – of the press. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HODES SC:  I know I agree with you with respect Mr 
Chairperson in the beginning there were two or three that 
were not abiding but of late there has been a blatant 
20 
disregard by one particular that I have already referred to 
and my attorney and my client will be pursuing them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HODES SC:  Because there is no doubt that they 
knew that they were not entitled to the [00:14:06]. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 11 of 12 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HODES SC:  That I thank you for everything that you 
have said thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no thank you very much.  Let – 
please administer the oath or affirmation again.  Thank 
you, Ms Mokonyane, for coming back to the commission.  
Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS MOKONYANE:  My name is Nomvula Paula Mokonyane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
10 
prescribed oath? 
MS MOKONYANE:  No I do not have. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MS MOKONYANE:  So help me God. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair it seems as if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the transcribers did not hear the record 
will reflect that we did hear that she was properly sworn in.  
Okay. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 12 of 13 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair just before we start and just one 
housekeeping exercise.  Chair must – you have in front of 
you BOSASA Bundle 1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair if I can take you to page 56 of 
that bundle.  Chair and you will notice after page 56 we 
have added about 34 pages of the transcript of the 
testimony of Mr Agrizzi.  The reason for that Chair is that 
the – before that they were – there was a transcript which 
was in very small font so we have just added 34 pages 
10 
which are nothing other than what is already in that 
bundle.  I mentioning it just to put on record what is in this 
bundle now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must – you must tell me from what 
page to what page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is – after page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on – hang on – hang on.  You must 
tell me from what page to what page the wrong pages as it 
were are to be found and where the correct pages with the 
right font are to be found. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The small font… 
CHAIRPERSON:  [inaudible]. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Are from page 48 to page 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the… 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 13 of 14 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the right ones. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The right ones are on 56.1 to 56.34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To 56.? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So pages 56.1 to 56.34 are 
basically a legible version of pages 48 to page 56. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you.  And then Chair you 
remember that Ms Mokonyane when she testified her 
10 
evidence – her evidence and affidavits were contained in 
what was called Bundle B Exhibit T20.  What now the – we 
have done we have now put her affidavit on T20.1 and this 
is the affidavit she… 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Bundle T. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No it is Exhibit T. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the name of the bundle? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair this is – my – it is – this should 
be continued as part of Bundle B.  Remember Bundle B is 
the bundle which contained her earlier testimony.  This is 
20 
the bundle just referred Bundle B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but two files cannot be the same 
bundle. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then Chair then this is the bundle that 
follows – that follows Bundle 1 wherein we had a number of 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 14 of 15 
 
affidavits.  Then this should be then Bundle 2 if I 
understand how the bundle is done.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me see.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Remember Chair the – the last hearing 
on the BOSASA stream the bundle we have was Bundle 01. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before we do that, I have been 
given what is marked Bundle B which is supposed to have 
Exhibit T20 inside. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes that is the – the – that contains the 
affidavit of Ms Mokonyane and other affidavits – and other 
10 
exhibits that went with that.  That is the bundle we used in 
her last testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Is there anything you need to 
tell me about it or not really? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, not really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Which one do you want to tell me 
something about? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes this Exhibit T20.1.  The only 
reason Chair I am referring you to that is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well remember the exhibit will be an 
20 
affidavit or document and the file will be bundle something. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Chair because of the fact that the 
previous – the previous exhibits the latest exhibits on our 
stream they were contained in Bundle – BOSASA Bundle 1.  
My suggestion then is that this should be then BOSASA 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 15 of 16 
 
Bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one is that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Which – there is one which contains 
Exhibit T20.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one that is written on the spine 
Exhibit T20.1? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You propose that it should be called 
Bundle what? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Bundle 02.  BOSASA Bundle 02. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then Chair I will – I will then refer to 
that bundle but before I even get there just as an opening 
remark.  In Bundle 1 there is T26 which contains the 
affidavit of Mr Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit T26 is actually the affidavit is it 
not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes it is the affidavit of Mr Coetzee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then in Bundle 2 the bundle we 
20 
have just marked and then on what I will ask to be 
admitted is Exhibit 20.1 is the affidavit of Ms Mokonyane 
wherein she responds to T26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but we will deal with that after she has 
confirmed it is it not? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 16 of 17 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  I am merely orientating you Chair 
on the documents that we have with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  So those are the bundles we 
will be using? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Those are the bundles that – those are 
the bundles we will be using but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has somebody explained to the witness 
the different bundles?  Has somebody explained to the 
witness which bundle is what? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I did not Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I assumed that the lawyers will explain 
to you but what I will do because they are small bundles 
when we deal with them, I will take the witness through 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they should be marked before we can 
start just like mine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The only way the only marking that 
needs to be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But BOSASA Bundle 2 must be marked. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Edwina will help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that if we say BOSASA Bundle 2 she 
knows which one.  Somebody will just come and assist you 
Ms Mokonyane.   Okay alright.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you.  Ms Mokonyane whilst you 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 17 of 18 
 
are on the – the bundle that has just been opened can you 
turn to that bundle? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which bundle has just been opened to Ms 
Mokonyane? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Bundle B. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Bundle? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Sorry Bundle 02. 
CHAIRPERSON:  BOSASA Bundle 02? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  The one that has just been 
10 
marked. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  If you can turn to item 1 of that bundle?  
There is a document starting from page 1 to page 7.  You 
see they are marked at the top and then – then that 
document on page 7 there is a signature above the word 
deponent.  Is that your signature? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes it is.  Yes it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now do you confirm that this is your 
affidavit? 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair can this affidavit be admitted as 
Exhibit T20.1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I thought it was just a statement and 
not an affidavit.  But I see that it is an affidavit.  The 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 18 of 19 
 
affidavit of Ms Nomvula Paula Mokonyane appearing at 
page 1 of Bundle BOSASA Bundle 02 will be admitted and 
will be marked as Exhibit – what exhibit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  T20.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit T20.1.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Ms Mokonyane whilst you are on 
that affidavit am I correct that the affidavit is in response 
to the affidavit of Mr Coetzee? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes it is.  It is also on the basis of 
some [00:26:59]. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  And is also –  
MS MOKONYANE:  And what was on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Mokonyane. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please face me.  If you can. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Ja.  It is better that way, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS MOKONYANE:  No I am saying I was using .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay no that is fine.  Are you 
comfortable? 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:  [Not audible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Yes Mr Notshe continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So you confirm that this was in 
response to the affidavit of Mr Coetzee? 
MS MOKONYANE:  [Not audible]. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 19 of 20 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  And to something about 702. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes.  [not audible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And your affidavit – the gist of your 
affidavit is that – or firstly before I get there Chair.  You 
read the affidavit of Mr Coetzee? 
MS MOKONYANE:  [not audible]. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you noticed that Mr Coetzee is the 
person; the owner of Victoria Guest House? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:  [not audible]. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Sorry Chair apparently there is a 
problem.  It seems as if we might have to move.  They 
cannot hear with that – on that microphone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so?   
MS MOKONYANE:  This one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Yes please. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I think in order for me – move to the 
chair ja so that… 
MS MOKONYANE:  You mean this chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  There that is better. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You – you confirmed that you read the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 20 of 21 
 
affidavit of Mr Coetzee? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes I did read the affidavit of Mr 
Coetzee. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you confirm that you read that he is 
the owner of the Victorian Guesthouse.  That is at A1 Tom 
Muller Street in West Village in Krugersdorp. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I read that.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And read your affidavit... and before 
that.  You confirm that Mr Coetzee says there was a birthday 
party held in your honour at that guesthouse? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   I can confirm that as I have said in my 
previous testimony here, that there have been several 
parties at that place and various meetings and upon reading 
Mr Coetzee statement, I can then confirm that I went for a 
private dinner and not to celebrate a birthday party that was 
said by Mr Agrizzi. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And in your statement you do confirm 
that the party that Mr Coetzee refers to did occur but it was 
arranged by your husband.  Is that correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I can confirm that there was that gala 
20 
dinner.  There was a dinner.  It is was not a party as it was 
said by Mr Agrizzi.  And as I have said, it was a surprise 
thing that happened at the venue and it was not a 50t h 
birthday.   
 
It was in my previous session.  I said that I never had a 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 21 of 22 
 
40t h... a 50t h birthday at that particular venue because that 
was the accession by Mr Agrizzi who later went out to 
change it in the public. 
 
And then also we read about the statement when it was 
out there in the public that in actual fact, they were referring 
to the 40t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I would like Mr Notshe... Mr Notshe, I 
am sorry.  I would like Ms Mokonyane to tell me her reaction 
to this version by Mr Coetzee about this gala dinner.  Just in 
your own words, tell me how it came about as you 
10 
understand it, as you set out in your affidavit.  And then Mr 
Notshe can then follow up after that.  I would like you to just 
say, this is how it came about as you state in your affidavit, 
in your own words. 
MS 
MOKONYANE: 
 
 
Yes. 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much, 
Chairperson.  I live in Krugersdorp.  And that venue is one of 
the venues that are closer to where we live and... but as I 
have said in my previous testimony here, that it has been 
used for several other activities.   
 
On this matter that was earlier on referred to as my 50t h 
20 
birthday that I contracted.  The plan was to have a private 
dinner with the family.   
 
And indeed, we left home with an understanding that I 
am going for a private dinner.  Something that we normally 
do with our birthdays when you would want space to have 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 22 of 23 
 
our own space.   
 
And we arrived at Victorian.  They provide dinner.  They 
do provide the restaurant there. And so upon arrival, then 
there were people but interestingly I could not... with the 
people that were around there, some of my friends that were 
there.  I could not identify Mr Agrizzi there.   
 
I mean, he is white.  I would have seen him.  He would 
have been outstanding in the crowd.  And it was a sit down 
dinner.  There were, I think if I am not mistaken, it is over a 
decade, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  About eighteen years or so ago. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And there were people who spoke.  And 
there was no speaker from BOSASA.  There was no Agrizzi 
who spoke.  And I then stood up.  Then I thanked everybody.  
I thanked my family.   
 
I did also say did was indeed a surprise.  I never even 
knew anyone who has made any contributions.  And that was 
it and I left.  And that is it.   
20 
 
And hence I did not deny that there had been parties 
there.  My accession to this has been on break-your-leg 50t h 
party which I have never had.  My 50t h party was about the 
journey-of-my-life. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The number of people who were there on 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 23 of 24 
 
the day of the gala dinner.  There have been... I think Mr 
Coetzee has said ultimately it was about 180 or 174 people 
although initially it was planned that it should be 80 people 
but then it moved up to 120.   
 
Is that number, does it sound more or less correct to 
you?  You might have not counted the people but if you hear 
that number, does it... could it be that number? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Firstly... sorry, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Firstly, Chair.  I got in there.  There 
10 
were people already.  And when the light was switched on, 
then people started singing happy birthday and... it was like I 
am saying a sit down dinner.  And then from there, that was 
it.  I did not even count. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you... you... 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  I would not even known the size of 
the venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   If the venue could take so many people.  
And in many instances when you go for our ANC or other 
20 
parties and stuff, even there I have never been the 
organiser.  So if had organised and I was asked who to 
invite, I would have known the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   But I went out to go and have a dinner. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 24 of 25 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you would not take issue with 
that kind of number or...? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I think... I do not understand what would 
be the reason behind the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   But looking at what Mr Coetzee had 
written, I think there is also a bit of confusing and an 
exaggeration on his submissions.  And it is up to the 
Commission, Chair to really cross-examine him.   
 
I mean, I saw some of his receipts and I saw the dates 
10 
when the tables were supposed to be picked up.  The 
additional drinks and all those things.  I really think there is 
a bit of exaggeration.   
 
I... if it was a party, it would have been a different kind 
of a thing organised by Nomvula or with my knowledge.  But 
in this instance, I think the onus is upon him.  And all I can 
say Chair is, I really think some of his figures are just an 
exaggeration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are able to admit that there was... 
there were many people but the number you cannot say? 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Twenty is many for that venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Twenty, thirty for that venue, depending 
on the seating arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 25 of 26 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   It has different size. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOKONYANE:   That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   If I start, just to check your evidence at 
the very end.  You are saying, the venue could not contain 
more than 20.  Is that your evidence? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I am saying the venue has the capacity 
10 
to take 20.  It can take more than 20.  And it has different 
sizes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   It is in different rooms and stuff. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you would confirm that Mr Coetzee, 
it was in his interest to count the number of guests because 
he was going to charge you for that. 
MS MOKONYANE:   He was not going to charge me, 
remember? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   So you cannot say he was meant to 
charge me.  He was going to charge the organisers.  So I 
would not know and it is up to the host to deal with his 
clients and make sure that they pay him for what was 
actually spent. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 26 of 27 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, I think you misunderstood me.  I 
said it was in the interest of Mr Coetzee to count the people 
because he was going to charge for how many people that 
came. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  Anyone.  Even the person who 
says bread, counts how many loafs of bread and you must 
get your money back. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, you are so right. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And therefore, you cannot dispute Mr 
10 
Coetzee’s evidence that there were 174 people who came, 
can you? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I can count myself and those that were 
in my immediate.  And I cannot dispute what he had said, 
yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And also, you cannot dispute that 
Mr Coetzee says your 40t h birthday was held there?  You 
cannot dispute it?  You have just admitted it. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I am saying the 40th dinner was held at 
the Victorian as opposed to what Mr Agrizzi said it was my 
20 
50t h and there was no such theme as break-your-leg.  There 
was... there is hardly a stage, there is a hardly a dance floor 
there that one could have danced to break a leg.   
CHAIRPERSON:   On a lighter note.  Ms Mokonyane, when I 
heard about that theme, I thought well maybe it was 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 27 of 28 
 
[vernacular] 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes!  Yes, Chairperson.  I do not think it 
was [vernacular].  I remember in some instances where we 
had danced and I could see you actually doing the 
[vernacular] dance.  That is now part of the [vernacular], 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Yes, okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And actually, Mr Coetzee confirmed that 
no one actually broke a leg that night on your 40 t h birthday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, Ms Mokonyane ...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   Come again? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I say, Mr Coetzee did confirm that no 
one broke a leg. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MS MOKONYANE:   No one broke a leg on your 40t h birthday 
at Victorian House.  So he confirms that the party was not a 
break-a-leg because no one broke a leg. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is only on a lighter note. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, but all I can confirm is that it was a 
sitting arrangement.  It was... because hence I can... I will 
keep saying, I have gone to parties to dance and have sung 
there.  This was a dinner I was taken to.  A surprise dinner 
and it was a sitting arrangement.   
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 28 of 29 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you say this was a surprise dinner 
and you do not know who paid for this, do you? 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, I would not know who paid for it 
because as I have said it was a surprise. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you cannot dispute Mr Coetzee’s 
evidence that this was paid for by BOSASA? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I cannot dispute who paid because if 
people organise the party for you, you never actually to get 
to probe further.  You appreciate.  Like I am saying, the 
10 
strange things that... there was no person who was on the 
programme who came out.   
 
In fact, we did not even had many people who were 
speaking.  It was about eating because I was taken out to go 
and out have a dinner for my birthday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may be mistaken but maybe Mr Coetzee 
did not say how many speakers there were, but I do recall 
that he said the speeches took quite long and that enabled 
them, that was kind of a blessing in disguise because they 
had planned for, I think, 120 people or 124? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   120, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 120 people but on the day, 174 
people, I think he said, arrived.  So suddenly they had this 
catering challenge.  What are we going to do?  And he said 
they only managed to deal with the situation because the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 29 of 30 
 
speeches went for about three hours.  That is what he said. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Hey, I do not know that.  I think... 
remember, I was not part of the preparation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   So I would not know what was the 
situation behind the scene. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  No, no.  That is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you also will not dispute that the 
liquor, the intoxicating liquor was sponsored by some liquor 
store in Krugersdorp.  You cannot dispute that? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know if that is what... that 
was not my understanding of Mr Agrizzi’s or Mr Coetzee’s 
evidence Mr Notshe.  I may be wrong. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I was under the impression that he said it 
is BOSASA who paid for the liquor but BOSASA bought it 
from liquor store. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, he said in his evidence that it was 
sponsored and supplied by the liquor store at the behest of 
20 
BOSASA.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, I will have a look.  My 
understanding ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is paragraph 14, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  You can put as you 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 30 of 31 
 
understand the position.  My understanding was that he 
made an... BOSASA requested that they should bring their 
own liquor and he agreed to that and he said... or they 
agreed to that because I think at that stage, he was still 
running the place with his mom, with his late mom.   
 
And he said they agreed.  And it was the first... for the 
first time in that guesthouse that they agreed that the client 
should bring something from outside.  And my understanding 
was that BOSASA went and bought the liquor and brought it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, you are correct in the sense that 
10 
the liquor was not provided by the guesthouse.  It was 
provided by the bottle store in Krugersdorp.  And it was 
sponsored and supplied by the bottle store but at the request 
of BOSASA.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay put it as you understand it.  I 
have not looked at recently but that was my understanding. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But Ms Mokonyane, you would not 
dispute that about the liquor from the bottle store? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I would not even know whether there 
was or what has been spent. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And he said also, the liquor... there was 
so much liquor that it filled his entire garage at the 
guesthouse.  You will not dispute that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I never went to the garage.  I did not 
see anything.  I was the birthday girl.  I was sitting on my 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 31 of 32 
 
table.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  And he was also, according to his 
evidence, taken to your table and introduced to you. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I only saw...  is it Mr Coetzee? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Mr Coetzee. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  I only saw Mr Coetzee when he 
was sitting on this chair.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He says he was introduced to you on the 
night.  He was taken to your table. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not remember that.  
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And he confirms that Mr Agrizzi was at 
the venue, at the party. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not remember seeing Agrizzi there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look, remember in the time “I do not 
remember”, it is a tricky one. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Because when you say you do not 
remember, you are saying he could have been there but I 
have forgotten or ...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   He could have been in another room.  
20 
He could have been somewhere else.  He could have been 
number 174.  I do not know. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So the high-water mark of your evidence 
today is that Mr Coetzee(sic) could have attended but you 
cannot remember.  Mr Agrizzi could have attended the party. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 32 of 33 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   I would not want to assert that.  It 
should not be my burden to confirm that Agrizzi came to the 
party.  Honestly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Ja-no, all you need to say 
is what you do not know, you do not know.  It is what he 
says. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you know then you say:  Yes, I know 
that.  That is how and that is what happened.  If you do not 
know, say you do not know. 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   All I am putting to you.  You are saying 
today, you do not deny that he was there but you say you 
cannot remember.  Is that your evidence? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not remember seeing him. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But you do not deny that he could have 
been there? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I would not want to commit myself and 
say he was there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Surely, there would be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   But I do not want to commit myself. And 
by the way, I have no personal relationship with Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 33 of 34 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I... Mr Notshe, I think you are 
referring to Mr Coetzee’s affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where it says: 
“All beers, hard liquor and soft drinks for the event 
was sponsored and supplied from a liquor store...” 
 
Nothing that say from brought and buy a liquor store on 
Cecille Road Krugersdorp. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know if you said buy but I 
understood... the impression I got was as if they provided it 
at their own expense. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, Chair.  That is...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Hence I said at the behest of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...of BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, Chair I do not want... Ms 
Mokonyane, I am not saying the liquor store who were the 
people who did it freely.  It is BOSASA who brought the 
liquor to the party.  You cannot dispute that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not know. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 34 of 35 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now in your evidence, the last time 
when you testified, we have dealt with this issue and you 
said your birthday was never held at this place.  You said no 
birthday party of yours was held at this place.  Why did you 
say that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I said that... as I have said, Chair.  It is 
over a decade ago and what attracted my attention was the 
accessions made by Mr Agrizzi about a 50t h birthday with a 
theme “Break-your-leg” held at the Victorian Guesthouse.   
 
I am sure and I want to submit here that hence Mr 
10 
Agrizzi it was a 40t h because you can see as the statement 
goes further down, I did say there has been many parties.   
 
I have never disputed not knowing that place.  And the 
main issue on my side, that was my own focus, was the issue 
of my 50t h birthday.   
 
So I... and hence in my affidavit now that Mr Notshe has 
and you have Chair, I do say this is what I recall as one of 
those dinners that I actually had which was a surprise 
private dinner.  Supposed to be a surprise private dinner and 
it ended up being a matter of this now. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, what jogged your memory about 
your birthday at that venue? 
MS MOKONYANE:   What made me to recall it was when 
after this testimony here that now the story was by Agrizzi 
outside in the media or whoever had did, now no longer 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 35 of 36 
 
about the 50t h but about the 40t h.  So that made me to sit 
back and to reflect. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now remember when you 
testified, you said your 50t h birthday was not held at that 
place.  You remember that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, the 50t h.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then we asked whether any of your 
birthday parties were held at that place and you said no. 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, Chair.  I think, as I have said, I was 
reaffirming the issue about the 50t h birthday.  And hence 
when I now got to hear about the 40t h, I then had to recall 
that in fact there was a gala dinner.  There was a dinner 
hosted at the Victorian Hotel. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Look, Ms Mokonyane I do not want to be 
unfair to you.  Let us not talk about... behind you there is a 
volume called Exhibit T. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You can take that out.  TA.   
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You will see that it is separated 
numbers.  Go to where it is separated with 3.   
MS MOKONYANE:   To 3? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, please.  And then there in 3, go to 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 36 of 37 
 
page... this is... just to orientate you.  This is the transcript 
of your evidence when you testified on the 20t h of July. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now can you turn to page 283? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Where? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   283.  Look at the red... there is a red... 
MS MOKONYANE:   Not this one? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, look at the red pagination.   
MS MOKONYANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Are you there? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  Yes, I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will not be able to follow.  I have got too 
many files already here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Oh, no fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Ms Mokonyane on... if you look... 
there is not... let us just start at... if you look at line 8 where 
it says Chairperson.  You see the number 10 on the side? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I can see that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Just go two lines up “Chairperson”.  Do 
20 
you see that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   “Chairperson ...[intervenes]”? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It says: 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 37 of 38 
 
“One second.  Before you... that is not the venue 
where your birthday party was held?” 
 
And then you say no.  Then Chairperson says... are you 
following? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I am. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then the Chairperson says this: 
“Yes.  The venue was at Silverstar and it is a known 
place, appears on the road on N14...” 
 
The Chairperson says:  Yes.  Okay, thank you.” 
 
And then Notshe says... he says: 
10 
“But is there a party that was ever held at Victorian 
Guesthouse?” 
 
And then you say: 
“There has been many parties at that place.” 
 
And then Notshe says... I then say: 
“I mean your parties.” 
 
You say no. 
 
And then I said: 
“You have never had a party there?” 
 
You said no. 
20 
 
And then I said: 
“You have never had a party called “Break-a-leg”?” 
 
You said: 
“I have had a birthday at Silverstar but “break-a-
leg”, no.” 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 38 of 39 
 
 
And then, let us go and I do not want to waste your time.  
Let us just go down to line 20, down the page on 284.  And 
then I say: 
“So I just want...” 
 
This is what I am reading. 
“So I just want you to confirm that you said there 
was no 50t h birthday at Victorian Guesthouse and 
you say that there was never your birthday at 
Victorian Guesthouse?” 
 
And you say no.  And then over the page at 384.   
10 
“Is that your evidence?” 
 
And then you say: 
“There had been other parties but not my birthday at 
that place, no.” 
“And I also want to confirm that at that place at 
Victorian Guesthouse there was never your birthday 
paid by BOSASA?” 
“No, there was never that they paid...” 
 
And then an indistinct. 
“And also, there was no birthday party called 
20 
“Break-your-leg” and this?” 
“No, not to my knowledge.  Not my birthday party.  
Not Nomvula’s birthday party.  Not Nomvula’s 50t h 
birthday party.” 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 39 of 40 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you said ...[indistinct] [shuffling of 
papers] you never had a birthday party there. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  Chairperson, I am saying, when we 
were dealing with this evidence, as you can see the 
accessions that I have made there, with your permission, I 
think it is on 285, that there was never a “break-your-leg” 
party.  I want to still agree.   
 
And that there was no 50t h birthday party.  I still want to 
agree.  And in the accessions that... on page 283, I did say 
that there had been many parties at that place.   
10 
 
I do concede that there had been many parties.  And 
precisely because of the pressure and the insistence about 
my 50 t h birthday being at the Victorian Guesthouse, all I 
could said it was not my birthday because I had not planned 
it.   
 
I could recall this 50t h because I had planned it.  And 
this one I had gone there for a dinner and it turned out to be 
a dinner with many other people.   
 
So that is why then post Mr Coetzee’s submissions, we 
had to depose to the clarity around the issue of the 
20 
guesthouse.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now when you testified here before, 
have you forgotten about your 40t h birthday party? 
MS MOKONYANE:   When I testified, I was preoccupied by 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 40 of 41 
 
my 50t h birthday because it was the one that was placed 
everywhere.  I have just had my other birthday before I came 
to the Zondo Commission.   
 
Now recently, I have had many other birthdays and I did 
not even focus on them.   
 
I cannot even think about them because my preparation, 
and I want to state here humbly, that my preoccupation was 
about the 50t h birthday that was framed as “break-your-leg” 
having happened at the Victorian Guesthouse.  And I want to 
formally indicate that....yes. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I do understand.  But also, your 
preoccupation was about a party held at the Victorian 
Guesthouse.  Am I right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   My preoccupation, yes was about other 
parties at the Victorian Guesthouse.  And hence I said I 
deem to and there has been many other parties there at the 
Victorian Guesthouse.  That was the accession I had. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then how could ...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   And...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, let her finish. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   And the issue of my 40 t h birthday.  In 
fact, Chair, I know other people take their 40t h birthday as 
one of the main parties ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I was about to say ...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   But for my ...[intervenes]  
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 41 of 42 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for many people, a 40t h birthday party is 
quite important. 
MS MOKONYANE:   But for me... that is why I can accept so 
much on the 50t h because it had a particular reason why it 
had to become my important birthday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then on... but you will remember that on 
that day when you testified, you remember that there were 
other parties held at the Victorian Guesthouse.  Am I right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I just said there were many other 
10 
parties. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Held at the Victorian Guesthouse? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I did. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I did say there were many other parties 
that were held.  And now when the newspapers actually said 
Agrizzi actually now said:  You made a mistake.  It was not 
the 50t h.   
 
I had to also like myself... I know he had come in with 
many statements to come and correct himself.  I had to sit 
20 
back and to reflect and say which of the parties I am 
referring to that had happened at the Victorian Guesthouse.  
And my memory then came in and I remembered that it was 
the 40t h and not the 50t h.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then just tell the Commission.  Did you 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 42 of 43 
 
have other birthday parties at the Victorian Guesthouse 
other than the 40t h? 
MS MOKONYANE:   My birthday party? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Not to my recollection, no. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now can you just tell the 
Commission this?  You remember that there were other 
parties held as the Victorian Guesthouse? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I remember that.  Krugersdorp is a 
small town and there are very few venues to those parties 
10 
and stuff and other than your private home and otherwise 
you have to go out of Krugersdorp to Johannesburg or just 
outside of Johannesburg.  So Victorian Guest House is a 
known place that hosts parties. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And so there were other parties and 
you remembered when you testified that there were other 
parties had at Victorian Guest House. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I remembered and hence I am saying 
one of those then will be the 40 t h and not the 50 t h as per 
what the assertion by Mr Agrizzi was talking about and 
20 
hence upon the submission, I then had to sit back and 
think which other thing happened at the Victorian Guest 
House and again, Chair, because I am now all – I have to 
even get reminded by other people to say look, there was 
this thing in that place and there was this other event in 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 43 of 44 
 
that place, I have attended baby showers, I have attended 
activities there, I have attended birthday parties there, I 
have attended political meetings there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So then again can I just get this clear.  
On the day you testified you remembered that the other 
parties held at the Victoria Guesthouse but you forgot that 
your birthday was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For your 40 t h. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Your 40 t h birthday party was there.  
MS MOKONYANE:   I remember that there were parties 
10 
there and precisely because, Chairperson, on that very 
night, that very afternoon, I was going out for a private 
dinner, hence I must say because it was never planned to 
be Nomvula going to a party.  And until today, I cannot 
attest how it ended up being a party because there was a 
plan to say we are going out for dinner, we are going to 
have a few people joining us for dinner and then we are 
coming back home and it turned out to be the opposite 
because then there were more people and it was – as I 
said, as I came in, then everybody then said surprise, 
20 
surprise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now, when you were – after the party, 
you must have …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that because you are now 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 44 of 45 
 
going after – to the period after the party and it does 
sound 
strange, 
Ms 
Mokonyane, 
that 
when 
there 
is 
discussion of your 50 t h birthday party, which you remember 
was no held at that guesthouse and you were asked 
whether there were any other birthday parties of yours that 
were held there, you do remember that there were certain 
parties but not birthday parties and yet you do not 
remember such an important birthday party for many 
people.  You might say for me, the 40 t h was not important, 
you do not remember that.  So I think that is part of the 
10 
point that Mr Notshe wanted to make. 
MS MOKONYANE:   In fact, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does sound strange, one would have 
thought that if you talking about birthdays, your 40 t h and 
your 50 t h birthday parties, must be quite important and in 
terms of where they were held.  If you do recall that other 
parties were held there you would remember that oh, my 
40 t h birthday party was there. 
MS MOKONYANE:   You know, Chair, because that one was 
planned to be a private dinner.  I did have a party with my 
20 
friends thereafter which I know that it was organised in 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the same venue?   
MS MOKONYANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or somewhere else? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 45 of 46 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I do not think – sure to be small, 
we had a party in Rosebank with my friends and that is 
where we partied, we had fun.  And that is the memorable 
day I know, was my 40 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, well the other …[intervenes] 
MS MOKONYANE:   I think I have had – I even had a mass 
dedicated to my turning 40, so... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And that is why I am saying the one 
that I know and I was aware of it, is the one that was held 
10 
in Rosebank sometime after that particular party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, also it does sound strange that Mr 
Coetzee could remember your 40 t h birthday party at his 
guesthouse 18 years ago but you cannot remember your 
40 t h birthday party. 
MS MOKONYANE:   It can sound strange because honestly 
speaking, that was not a party that I knew was going to 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I was looking forward to my Saturday 
20 
evening party with my friends in Rosebank and my family, 
very small intimate and that is it.  And hence a bit of my 
memory, Chairperson, reminded me that there have been 
party, so that on its own helped to unpack which other 
parties have actually been held there and I want to agree 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 46 of 47 
 
that - therefore my submission after Mr Coetzee, actually 
confirmed that along – if you read it, it was something that 
I did not know and I was not looking forward to having a 
party and the Break Your Leg kind of wow that was actually 
being said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say to the proposition that 
precisely because you had been told about a private 
dinner, family dinner, that that is what you were going to, 
precisely because of that, when you found out, upon arrival 
at the venue, that this was something much bigger than 
10 
just a family dinner, it was such a surprise, that is a factor 
that should make it easy for you to remember to say you 
know, that party, I went there thinking it was just a private 
dinner and my family surprised me with a big dinner and 
that that actually should make you remember that place for 
that surprise.  Actually, it is the opposite.   
So I wish I was well-prepared for those crowds and 
I wish – I would have preferred a better place.  I am sure 
you saw even the decorations, black table cloth and funny 
vases and stuff.  But then if people have organised, 
20 
[speaking African language] and that was it and I was 
looking forward to my weekend partying with my friends 
and I appreciated the efforts that were made and that was 
my response.  If you ask me about what I remember about 
my 40 t h …[intervenes] 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 47 of 48 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you do not like surprises.  
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not like surprises because they 
lead to this, sometimes.  They lead to these kind of things 
but in life, there are.  I have been surprised so many 
times.  I have had a husband who would always go and do 
extraordinary things to surprise me.  I have had friends – I 
have got a friend that I grownup with from the age of 13 
until today.  You know my age because everything about 
me is now public.  She just decided to wake up and come 
and join me here today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And that is the reality of me.  There 
are those surprises I cannot avoid, I do get surprise 
activities organised in my name and I also do organise 
surprise things for my own friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Notshe, I will let you 
continue but I think we should take the tea break now or 
do you want to follow up for five minutes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just to follow up about this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Mokonyane, is that not so that this 
is exactly why this should have remained in your memory, 
that it was a surprise dinner.   Whether, as you say, you 
were disappointed by the venue, that would have stuck out 
in your memory that my 40 t h birthday was a surprise but it 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 48 of 49 
 
was a venue I would not have chosen.  Is that not so? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I was looking forward to my 40 t h party 
with my friends in Rosebank and I appreciated the efforts 
that were made on that particular day. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And the problem also we have is this, 
you would have mentioned that there were parties at – not 
just parties at Victorian Guest House.  You said there were 
parties at Victorian Guest House. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But not your party.  How could you 
10 
…[intervenes] 
MS MOKONYANE:   I said there were parties and my 
assertion, Chair, with humility, was based around what was 
splashed all over and my preoccupation was on my 50 t h 
birthday. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But you will agree, and you have read 
the evidence, that we moved from your 50 t h and we asked 
for any other birthday party and …[intervenes] 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do feel that it is in the script, Chair, 
but I am saying in my mind and in my focus I was 
20 
contesting what was asserted as a fact, the Break Your Leg 
50 t h birthday and hence I have been able to then come in 
and say there was a dinner that I was supposed to attend, 
it came across as a dinner, I went and in that dinner there 
were other people there and there were people who stood 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 49 of 50 
 
up and spoke.  I do not know whether they were part of the 
sponsors and everything because those are friends and 
people I have grown up with in the township. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Do you agree with me that the evidence 
you gave that day where you denied that there was a party 
at guest house was misleading? 
MS MOKONYANE:   It was not misleading, never was it my 
intention.  Never has it been and hence I have come and I 
made the submissions having read first, before even 
getting the evidence from the Commission, having read 
10 
what was in the newspapers and also having gone back 
home to collect, what happened when I turned 40, who was 
there, how did things happen, it was not only the Rosebank 
party that I knew and we had planned for it, there was also 
this event that was done together with the community of 
Kagiso, by the way, and [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You only came out to correct this when 
the evidence of Mr Coetzee came out confirming that there 
was a party and it was …[intervenes] 
MS MOKONYANE:   It was …[intervenes] 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Sorry, I am sorry.   
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you only confirmed – you only 
corrected this when the evidence of Mr Coetzee came out 
confirming that there was a party at that Victorian Guest 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 50 of 51 
 
House and it was your 40 t h birthday party. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I went home, I reflected on these 
matters and I recall that there was this and upon reading 
what was in the media and verifying, I made this particular 
submission, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And what you read, what you read was 
that the owner of the guesthouse confirmed that there was 
a party at your place. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And will leave this issue – before I 
10 
leave the issue, when you went home after the party. 
MS MOKONYANE:   After my party? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  After the 40 t h birthday party, this party, 
you must have thanked your husband, you must have 
thanked him, thanks for the surprise. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I thanked everybody, not just upon 
arrival at home.  I thanked my family, I thanked my friends, 
I thanked the community and everyone who was part of 
organising this, something that I was supposed to just have 
as a very private thing and that was it.  I never thanked 
20 
BOSASA because I never knew that BOSASA was part of it.    
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Did you ask your husband who had paid 
for this, for the party, for this 40 t h birthday party? 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, a simply thing, it is not even about 
who paid, how did this thing get organised and the simple 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 51 of 52 
 
thing was when guys organise it and people felt they need 
to organise this thing for you around this area so that they 
can come and celebrate with you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that what she said to you? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And did you ask who the guys were? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said she, you mean he? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Oh, sorry.  You know my faults, sorry. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I know your faults including mentioning 
my home address every time.   
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  This is an [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On that note let us take the tea break.  
Let us take the tea break. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will resume at twenty five to twelve.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
[audio commences mid-sentence] 
20 
MS MOKANYANE:  ...and was tongue-tied about he and 
she, the question was did you ask your husband as to who 
had arranged and paid for the party? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe, I am sorry again Mr 
Notshe I am interrupting you.   Let me hear, I think she 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 52 of 53 
 
wants to be assisted with something.  Let me hear what 
you have to say to this proposition Ms Mokonyane.  
Somebody who has been listening to the evidence relating 
to Mr Agrizzi’s evidence, Mr Coetzee’s evidence and your 
evidence, might say it cannot be true that you would 
remember that other parties were held at that venue, but 
you do not remember – you did not remember when you 
were giving evidence that your fortieth birthday party was 
also held there.   
 
Somebody might say it was not convenient for you 
10 
to admit that your fortieth birthday party was held there 
because that would give credence to Mr Agrizzi’s version 
that BOSASA had paid for your birthday party of course he 
said fiftieth but as I understand it he was mistakenly; it 
was your fortieth.   
          So somebody might say it was not convenient for 
you to make that admission because it would give credence 
to 
Mr 
Agrizzi’s 
evidence 
that 
there 
was 
a 
special 
relationship between yourself and BOSASA or yourself and 
Mr Gavin Watson and which he says and I accept that you 
20 
deny that which he says since you have been meant for 
BOSASA to get some protection from investigations and 
prosecutions.  And that you did not think that something 
that happened eighteen years ago would be unearthed by 
the Commission investigators.  But when the investigators 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 53 of 54 
 
went to the venue, got the owner who remembered this and 
produced invoices you were caught out and that is why you 
had to now say now I remember.  What do you say to 
somebody who says that?   
MS MOKONYANE:   I would want to add the third to say I 
walked into these chambers, the whole world was focusing 
on my fiftieth birthday with a theme called break your leg 
and that was my preoccupation.  And in my assertion 
intentionally and correctly so I had to actually say there 
was no fiftieth birthday called break your leg.   
10 
          I have never heard a party called break your leg 
which was my fiftieth birthday.  So I think for me Chair that 
is where I am because Mr Agrizzi has been to this 
Commission on several occasions unearthing witnesses 
upon witnesses and evidence upon evidence and this was 
part of his last submissions which I thought was based on 
his own convictions and the truth of what he put before this 
Commission.   
          That it was my fiftieth birthday and the truth be told 
that is my third version to say I was preoccupied by this 
20 
one and I felt it would be important and hence I never 
denied ever being to that place and I will never deny.  The 
thing that I denied was my fiftieth birthday party hosted at 
the Victorian Guest House.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say when somebody says 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 54 of 55 
 
anyone who listens to Mr Notshe asking you those 
questions and anyone who reads the transcripts you know 
the parts to which Mr Notshe referred you earlier where he 
moved from asking about the fiftieth birthday party, to 
asking about any other party and asking about any other 
birthday party.   
          What do you say to somebody who says but that 
was so clear there is no way Ms Mokonyane would not 
have heard that now Mr Notshe is not talking about the 
fiftieth birthday party he has moved, he is talking about 
10 
another party and any other birthday party.   
          When she responded and said no in regard to 
another birthday party and yes to other parties.  She knew 
that her birthday party, fortieth birthday party was being 
included in terms of the question that says any other 
birthday party in that venue.     
MS MOKONYANE:   At that point Chairperson that is why I 
said I know that there has been many other parties and 
many other functions but not my fiftieth party and that was 
my assertion.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Notshe.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you confirm do you say my fiftieth 
– there was not a party there it was my fortieth not my 
fiftieth? 
MS MOKONYANE:   You never asked me about my fortieth.  
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 55 of 56 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But I am saying you never said my 
fiftieth was not there it was my fortieth, you did not say 
that.  
MS MOKONYANE:   No, I was not asked about which other 
party, I said I have not had my fiftieth it was another venue 
and as I said Chair the assertion in everybody including 
today.  The latest is a journalist from newsroom who has 
sent questions just two days ago.  He is still asking me 
about Mr Agrizzi and Mr Coetzee testimony about my 
fiftieth birthday being at the Victorian Guest House. 
10 
          So the preoccupation everything and I think even in 
my own mind I was sitting here Chair refuting what was 
asserted and hence I have never said I have never been to 
that place, I have never said there has never been a party 
and I have never said I do not know the Victorian Guest 
House.   
          I was speaking in terms of clarifying that my fiftieth 
party was never organised there but also the issue of who 
paid and what happened I think it is not something that I 
was quite interested in precisely because I have also been 
20 
part of organised news, surprised parties for other people 
and you do not actually have to be telling everybody that 
so and so bought a bottle of water, so and so bought a 
bottle of.  You just say friends we are your friends we are 
organising your sixtieth birthday and that is it. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 56 of 57 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe.       
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see, you say in your evidence today 
that BOSASA was not at your fortieth birthday, how do you 
know that?  
MS MOKONYANE:   I did not see anything branded 
BOSASA and BOSASA is an institution so I did not 
see...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Anybody from BOSASA.   
MS MOKONYANE:   A representative of BOSASA because 
in the program there was nobody speaking on behalf of 
10 
BOSASA.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see, so as you sit today cannot say 
BOSASA was not there all you can say is you did not see a 
branding and no one spoke on behalf of BOSASA.  Is that 
correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Nobody spoke on behalf of BOSASA 
and nobody came to me and said I am here on behalf 
BOSASA and nobody actually spoke or even arranged 
anything as if it is coming from…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let me put this to you and Mr 
20 
Notshe who maybe was planning to do so but maybe it is 
appropriate.  I asked Mr Coetzee quite specially when he 
gave evidence here.  I asked him the question was Mr 
Agrizzi there or I think I did ask him but he said certainly 
Mr Agrizzi was there and I even had to ask was Ms 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 57 of 58 
 
Mokonyane there because I wanted to make sure that what 
he is talking about was your birthday party because it 
could not be your birthday party without you being there 
and he said, yes.  She was there and I was introduced to 
her personally but he also said Mr Agrizzi was there and 
you said you did not see Mr Agrizzi.       
MS MOKONYANE:   No, I do not remember if he is 
mentioning those hundreds of names of people not names.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
MS MOKONYANE:   Of people. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it would be easy not to see 
everybody.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, and remember that facility is run 
by a white family and Chair it use to be run by a lady, the 
lady who use to run that facility.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe it was her Mum.  
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because first he was co-owning it with 
her Mum until 2018 I think when her Mum passed away now 
he owns it alone.   
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay yes I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MOKONYANE:   So it is between him and Agrizzi 
whether Agrizzi was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 58 of 59 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you – and Mr Agrizzi said that Mr 
Watson was also there. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Gavin was a family friend.  
CHAIRPERSON:    I mean you would have seen Mr 
Watson.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is your friend or he was your friend is 
it not?  
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I know you said not Agrizzi.  
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, so I still believe spiritually he is a 
friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so but are you saying he was not 
there, there is no way that you would have not seen him.   
MS MOKONYANE:   No, Gavin was not at the party.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you sure? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Chair not to my memory, no.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But can you recall it more than 120 
people and he did not come to your table perhaps? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Maybe perhaps I do not know.  The 
20 
only person who will know who was there will be what you 
call…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Coetzee.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Mr Coetzee because he knew that he 
is he is working with…[intervene] 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 59 of 60 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Agrizzi.  
MS MOKONYANE:   With Mr Agrizzi.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And Mr Agrizzi will also know because 
he works with Mr Gavin Coetzee and Watson.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But going back to the numbers Mr 
Coetzee has said ultimately there was a 170 I think people.  
You earlier on you were mentioning 20 but you were not 
saying that there were only 20 people.   
MS MOKONYANE:   No, I was saying…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I want to establish is 
whether you had any issue about there have been so many 
people.  Is that something that is an issue for you?  Are 
you saying that there could not have been that many 
people or are you saying look if he is saying there were 
170 people that is what he says, I do not know, I did not 
count the number of people.  
MS MOKONYANE:   That is his assertion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MOKONYANE:   That is his assertion and if I planned 
20 
an event I know that I am planning for so many people, I 
have invited so many people and I will have a particular 
number that I will keep as a possibility of you know the 
unexpected and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.

MS MOKONYANE:   So I was never near the planning of 
anything that happened there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MOKONYANE:   So I do not know how I can actually 
now say it is like that.  I am saying that place can take 
from 20 people you can have a function there and I do not 
know how they had planned for this because I was not part 
of their planning so that is it.  I do not know the numbers 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think you did say earlier on but 
10 
you must tell me if I misunderstood you when Mr Notshe 
asked you, you did say that you were not saying that that 
place could not take as many people as 170 people.  
MS MOKONYANE:   No it can take because it has a 
garden…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MS MOKONYANE:   It has the rooms, it has the little rooms 
that were the breakaways and stuff.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MS MOKONYANE:   So I do not know.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Notshe.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you do confirm that at that time 
2003 Mr Watson was already your family as you said, he 
was already a good friend and a friend of the family?  
MS MOKONYANE:   Mr Watson as I have said has been a 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 61 of 62 
 
friend before, ja before 1990.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see, now – and therefore you would 
have played a part in it, it would not be strange for him to 
attend such a party?  
MS MOKONYANE:   It would not be if he was invited, I did 
not invite anybody.  I was invited and made to attend and 
appear.  I did not even see the guest list.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now you are saying your fiftieth now 
was in 2013.  Am I right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes that is when I turned fifty.  
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And your fiftieth birthday was 2013? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What were you doing at that time, 
where were you working? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I was the Premier of Gauteng at that 
time. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see; approximately how much were 
you earning? 
MS MOKONYANE:   My payslip is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot hear you.  
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   I cannot recall how much I was earning 
but I was earning a Premier ’s salary if you need the 
numbers I can give them to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   MEC before you move because I think 
you moving away from the party, but it is just to round off 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 62 of 63 
 
on the obvious on the fortieth gala party.  Did you say that 
you do know that the party was organised by your late 
husband or did you say you do not know who organised it 
or are you saying as far as you know it was organised by 
family and friends?    
MS MOKONYANE:   I left the house being the guest of my 
family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MOKONYANE:   And I arrived at the party and that is 
dinner and then it came out that it was not just a family 
10 
dinner and I never actually came to know who and who 
actually organised it, that was it the individuals who 
organised it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am concerned about that because if we 
accept as a fact that BOSASA paid for it and Mr Agrizzi 
says it was Mr Gavin who instructed that, that BOSASA 
should organise a party or Agrizzi should coordinate the 
party for you.  I would think that your husband knew that 
BOSASA were the people who made it happen or Mr Gavin 
Watson was the person who was responsible for the party.   
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Chair, ja I would not want to venture 
into that space and conclude because organising a party 
goes beyond stuff what happened inside.  I know it is a 
matter of fact there were people who came with taxis.  
CHAIRPERSON:   With? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 63 of 64 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   With a taxi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, with taxi’s.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Because not everybody can afford, 
they took a taxi from Mandlaville, took a taxi from Kagiso 
and I know that those were some of the people who were 
organised and I remember there was a guy who was the 
leader of the taxi association who also came and part of 
the reason why he came to talk to me was to say you know 
what Mama [speaking in vernacular], all because of you 
[speaking in vernacular].  So I am trying to indicate that I 
10 
did not ask for that information it was when I spoke to 
some of the people and say [speaking in vernacular]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see my difficulty is I cannot see how 
what seems to have been a very big birthday party could 
have been done for you without you and your husband 
knowing who paid for this party, this big party one of you 
must have known.  And if you say you did not know 
because it was your birthday, they kept it as a surprise 
logic says to me then your late husband must have known 
that it was BOSASA.  Is my logic problematic?   
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   It may not be it may be, he might have 
also been approached to say listen we organising this thing 
please secure Mam Vula on that day, make sure that you 
bring her along.  Please bring her along and that was it 
and then hence from the morning Mogatsi will remember 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 64 of 65 
 
before the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
MS MOKONYANE:   And that was it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see if one accepts the proposition 
that at least one of you knew that BOSASA paid for 
it…[intervene]  
MS MOKONYANE:   So if he…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Ja, maybe he may know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   He might have known; he might have 
not known.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS MOKONYANE:   All I am saying is I was requested not 
to, actually I was instructed not to go anywhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not to go anywhere.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Exactly I was instructed not to go 
anywhere 
and 
we 
then 
drove, 
and 
we 
arrived 
and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no for now I understand your part 
20 
not knowing for now.  What I want to put to you is if your 
husband knew that BOSASA had been so good to your 
family they were responsible for this very big party.   
          It is difficult for me to think that for about what 16, 
17 years from 2003 up to the time he passed on he would 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 65 of 66 
 
not have told you that Gavin Watson or BOSASA had paid 
for this wonderful party particularly because Mr Gavin was 
as I understand he was a family friend.  So that maybe you 
could thank him because he had made it possible.    
MS MOKONYANE:   When somebody says in a party Chair 
I want to thank everybody who has organised this event 
and thanks for pulling things together.  You thank everyone 
and that is what I did and that was everyone who has 
organised and like I am saying the only other thing that I 
knew was there were people who were transported and Bra 
10 
Oupa came out and said you know what Mam Vula it is all 
because of you we doing these things.   
          So it means they are also part of making this thing 
to happen.  So I had friends and everybody was saying are 
you happy and I said ja but today you surprised me and 
that was it.  But if it so happens that he knew he would 
have known and surely, he wanted to keep it as a surprise 
to 
me.    
CHAIRPERSON:   No but I am talking about after I can 
understand not telling you before the day but I am saying 
20 
after the party has gone I would have expected that at 
some stage he would tell you by the way no I did not pay a 
cent for that party or maybe I paid only a little bit but the 
real people who made it possible were BOSASA or it was 
Mr Gavin Watson.   
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 66 of 67 
 
          So that you would know that those are the people 
who were so good to you especially because Mr Gavin was 
a family friend.  I am saying that I would expect that at 
some stage over the past 17 years or whatever before he 
passed on.       
MS MOKONYANE:   No we never ventured into that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not? 
MS MOKONYANE:   No we did not.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Notshe.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I think what the Chair is also trying to 
10 
make it clear from you Ms Mokonyane is that you, your 
husband or one of you knew that, you knew that you did 
not pay for the party, you or your husband.   
MS MOKONYANE:   We both knew that we did not pay for 
the party because we knew that we did not organise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry just repeat that.  
MS MOKONYANE:   I am saying we did not organise it.  I 
was told, advised and persuaded to come for a dinner and 
then we drove and we went to the place and that is it and 
that is all that I have now, Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say you both knew that, the two 
of you did not organise the party or pay for the party? 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, no I am saying we both – from 
where I am seated, we both went to the dinner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 67 of 68 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   We both attended the dinner, I 
together with him we have never spoken about who paid for 
this.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ms Mokonyane have I heard that you 
have just said you both knew that you did not pay for the 
party.   
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, the thing that I am saying is we 
going out, I am taking you out and then we arrive there and 
then we are told no the guys asked me that I must secure 
you, we must come to the surprise.  That is why when we 
10 
entered it was said surprise, yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So do you confirm that you just said 
now a few minutes ago that you both knew that you did not 
pay for the party.  
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, she has confirmed.  You see it 
becomes more problematic for me if that is the position 
because it is difficult for me to think that you could have a 
party that is as big as what Mr Coetzee told me how big it 
was and that cost as much as what Mr Coetzee estimated.   
20 
          I think he estimated that with the liquor that was 
brought into the guest house the cost may have been about 
R80 000,00 or R70 000,00 in 2003.  That you both would 
not have wanted to find out who is this person who has 
done such a good thing such a party for - in his case for 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 68 of 69 
 
my wife you know.  In your case for me that you would 
have not wanted – it is just difficult to…[intervene]    
MS MOKONYANE:   It does come across as being very 
difficult Chair but as I am saying there were organisers 
behind the scenes and surely there was an arrangement to 
say you keep it quiet, you do not share [speaking in 
vernacular].  Like I am saying I came to know about these 
others because I saw people coming from the township and 
I asked them how they have come and they said they were 
sponsored with a taxi from the taxi association. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I was under the impression when I 
read your affidavit...[intervene]      
MS MOKONYANE:   When my husband actually then said 
to me I wanted you not to be part of – I wanted you not to 
stay away from this event.  Hence, I pleaded with you that 
we would have wanted to have come with you as a family 
and that was the arrangement Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I got the impression when I read your 
affidavit, the one that is responding to Mr Coetzee’s 
affidavit that you were saying that you were under the 
20 
impression that your late husband was the one who 
organised 
the 
birthday 
party 
and 
paid 
for 
it. 
 You 
mentioned somewhere on paragraph 17 you say my late 
husband was a successful businessman who could afford to 
pay for such an event.       
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 69 of 70 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry Chair I think she’s trying to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I am sorry. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can you look at – look at Bundle 2 the 
small bundle.  No not that one.  The small one there the 
small one with your affidavit. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The one with the [00:00:12].  No not that 
one.  You can put that one behind you.  Put that big one 
behind you it is fine.  That one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got the right one?  I am looking 
at paragraph 17.   
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  17: 
“My late husband was a successful businessman who could 
afford to pay for such an event.  I always assumed that he 
had in fact done so.  I was taken aback by this kind gesture.  
Thanked him for everything that he had done in this regard 
but never pertinently asked him whether he had paid for 
everything himself.” 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you clearly say you never asked him 
specifically but I understand what you say before that that 
you assumed that he had been responsible for payment.  Is 
that right? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 70 of 71 
 
MS MOKONYANE:  That is exactly what I am – I always 
assumed that he paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Whilst you are in your affidavit you – on 
page – on paragraph 20 page 6 you say then the revelation 
that this was paid by – for – by BOSASA is – it – [00:01:47] 
and it now embarrasses you.  Correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you say it was inappropriate at the 
time and I am sure it is also inappropriate even now. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is not being done now Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  All what I am saying is being then now 
still inappropriate that it was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now Ms Mokonyane if we move away 
from that and deal with – we are dealing with your 50t h 
Birthday party. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:  50t h? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  No I am saying I have moved away 
from that and dealing now with your 50t h birthday party. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Why? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I am asking – I am saying we are dealing 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 71 of 72 
 
with that.  You are saying it was 2013 you were right.  Yes.  
Now you were saying at the time you were the Premier right. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And at that time is it correct you were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you – are you moving away from the 
evidence and allegations made by Mr Agrizzi? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me – I have something relating to 
Agrizzi.  You remember there was an allegation by Mr Agrizzi 
that BOSASA used to purchase groceries and liquor and 
10 
meat for your family I think especially during Christmas 
period or December you remember that evidence? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes I remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  My recollection is that you denied 
that evidence, is that – is my understanding correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:  It was – I did not deny the acquisition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  I denied the fact that they – that was 
meant for my family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  One can always check.  My 
20 
understanding and it may be incorrect.  My understanding 
was that you had denied but you are saying as you sit there 
you do not deny that there were such groceries but you are 
saying they were not for your family. 
MS MOKONYANE:  No I do not deny Chair. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 72 of 73 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  But they were never meant for my family. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Your 
PA 
Ms 
Thomas 
said 
her 
understanding was that – well she actually also confirmed 
that groceries were organised and were delivered to your 
house but she said her understanding was that they were 
meant for needy people in the community.  Is that – is that 
your understanding – is that your understanding as well? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now my difficulty at least with partly 
10 
with that is that when I look at the items that Mr Agrizzi said 
were bought. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It – or at least some of them do not appear 
to me to be the kind of items one would expect to buy and 
just give to needy people.  Mr Notshe where will I find Mr 
Agrizzi’s affidavit where he itemises… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair it is on Bundle B  - the big bundle.  
It is the big one Ms Mokonyane.  Bundle B at page 08 of 
Bundle B.  Look at – start from the beginning.  Look at the 
20 
red – red marking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe your junior could assist the witness 
Mr Notshe.  He itemises the – he gives a list of those items 
at paragraph 22.3 of his first affidavit at page 8.  Have they 
found it for you? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 73 of 74 
 
MS MOKONYANE:  Chair I have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have they found the page for you? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  He says in paragraph 22.3  
“Subsequent thereto…” 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair [00:07:31]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
“Subsequent thereto towards the end of 
every year” 
In the previous paragraph he refers to the period 2002 and 
10 
2003 so when he says subsequent thereto, he must be 
referring to subsequent to 2002 and 2003.  He says: 
“Subsequent thereto towards the end of 
every year I was tasked by Gavin Watson to 
see to her family’s Christmas needs.” 
That is yourself. 
“This 
would 
include” 
and 
he 
says: 
“approximately 22.3.1 
22.3.1  120 cases of cold drinks. 
22.3.2  4 case of high quality whiskey. 
20 
22.3.3  40 cases of mixed beer. 
22.3.4  8 lambs 
22.3.5  12 cases of frozen chicken pieces. 
22.3.6  200 kg beef [as well as various braai 
packs] 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 74 of 75 
 
22.3.7  Numerous cases of Premium Brandy 
and specially alcohol.” 
Now I would have thought that he would or BOSASA would 
have at least included items like rice and mealy meal, sugar, 
cooking oil and then such stuff which is quite essential. But 
it – the impression I get and I want you to comment on this.  
The impression I get is that this does not immediately 
presents itself as – or at least some of the items you know 
especially 4 cases of high quality whiskey and numerous 
cases of Premium Brandy and speciality alcohol is something 
10 
that one would buy for when one is helping people who really 
need basic needs.  Is my thinking flawed? 
MS MOKONYANE:  It is very flawed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes tell me. 
MS MOKONYANE:  It is flawed because it moves from an 
assumption that it was only BOSASA that does these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS MOKONYANE:  It moves from an assumption that it is 
only BOSASA that does these things for communities.  And 
yet there were many other people that would also come to 
20 
the party and make contributions of your samp, your maize, 
your rice, even your beef – canned beef and stuff.  So it was 
not – it was not only BOSASA that – and it is still not.  As I 
am talking to you tomorrow I am out dishing out blankets 
without BOSASA.  So it is not.  So it – it is a flawed 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 75 of 76 
 
assumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  They- they were contributing what was in 
their own offering.  You know when people say we want to go 
and give Ubuntu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  You – I will – you do not choose what 
they would give.  And all these things will then be kept and 
we would actually get everybody getting a bit and it is going 
home.  Over and above that we would even have a sit down 
10 
party in the community centre for everybody.  So your 
assumption is flawed.  This is not the only thing that will 
come.  Somebody brings blankets.  The other person brings 
– now recently there is something called instant porridge 
they bring.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you say it was – it definitely was 
for the needy people? 
MS MOKONYANE:  It has always been for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now one will have to check I do not know 
Mr Notshe why I was under the impression that Ms 
Mokonyane’s evidence last time she was here did not include 
her being part of groceries that were bought by BOSASA for 
distribution to the communities.  Because at least now I think 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 76 of 77 
 
that is why – that is the impression I am getting that as far 
as groceries for communities you were part of that, is that 
right? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes we will have a dinner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  We will have a lunch in the community 
centre. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  And all these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:  That whoever is sponsoring will come in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:  And make the donation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the evidence of Ms Mokonyane 
because this issue you raised, we will check in whether 
perhaps stuff was delivered at her home but for the 
community.  Her evidence was that no such stuff was 
delivered at her home for the community. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then in addition to that then – that 
her – Ms Thomas says her stuff was delivered at her home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But was for the community. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 77 of 78 
 
MS MOKONYANE:  Chair I would want to – to indicate that I 
said most of the stuff will go to the Kagiso Community Hall.  
It was only I think once or twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think you said once ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes once or twice because the township 
put under – the community hall was under renovations.  And 
hence Ms Thomas said it would not even stay for a day 
because it had to go.  So we used another venue that does 
not have a storage like the old Kagiso hall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But of course, she – she said – she 
10 
did not speak on the basis of once.  She spoke on the basis 
that it was for most of the years.  Because I asked her the 
question because she said she started working for you in 
1999. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I said well from 1999 up to I think 
when Mr Agrizzi left BOSASA I said would you say that each 
year this is what would happen or would you say most of the 
years? 
MS MOKONYANE:  It was not every year. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is what she said too.  She said it 
was not every year and I said, would you say it was most of 
the years?  She said yes it was most of the years. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So on her version it was not once or 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 78 of 79 
 
twice it was most of the years. 
MS MOKONYANE:  No it was most of the years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Inaudible – speaking over one another]. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes I take it she meant it was most of the 
years where they would make these kinds of contributions. 
But delivering it at home I think it was once or twice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:  And until – and it was now when towards 
the – the end because the Kagiso hall was under renovation 
about two – two years back or so yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You see the – the – the difference 
that I can make between her version and Mr Agrizzi’s version 
is that – well Mr Agrizzi says it was every year after 
2002/2003.  Okay.  But Ms Thomas says it was most of the 
years not every year.  But they agreed that there was 
delivery of groceries and parcels to your home and then 
where they differ also is that Mr Agrizzi says it was for your 
family 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas Ms Thomas her understanding 
20 
was that it was for the community. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that is – there are parts where their 
versions converge. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 79 of 80 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there are parts where they differ. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MS MOKONYANE:  It does happen even now Chair.  I think 
now with the lockdown. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  I have had donations being delivered at 
my house because of the community centres being closed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  So hence I am saying what I know it can 
10 
be once or twice because many a times when the things gets 
distributed it is on the night before we have the veterans and 
senior citizens lunch so they must there and we used to have 
the people who will then go and cook and then young people 
who will pack them in the bags and stuff overnight so that 
when they come – actually it used to be like the whole day 
starting with breakfast, lunch and then late lunch and then 
everybody goes home and we do the deliveries as well for 
senior citizen.  We will have volunteers coming doing the 
deliveries. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  The – the other part which I want to 
mention to you and you might wish to comment on it that 
since to converge between the versions of Mr Agrizzi and Ms 
Thomas is that Mr Agrizzi said that he was instructed by Mr 
Gavin Watson to set up a team that would – within BOSASA 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 80 of 81 
 
that would take care of whatever issues arose in your home 
that needed to be fixed you know which I guess would 
include maintenance issues.   
And he said that is Agrizzi – Mr Agrizzi he said he did 
set up such a team and it was headed by Mr Richard Le 
Roux.  And he said over time Mr Le Roux would go and 
attend to problems that arose in your house.  Ms Thomas 
said there were a number of times when your late husband 
would call her when there was a problem in the house and 
ask her to ask Richard he said – he just knew him as Richard 
10 
to go and attend to the problem.   
And she said he – she did not know then that this 
was Richard Le Roux.  He did not know the surname.  But I 
think afterwards she accepts that it is Richard Le Roux.   
So 
there 
it 
appears 
that 
her 
evidence 
also 
corroborates to a certain extent what Mr Agrizzi said namely 
the – there was a team or maybe one person maybe a team 
that used to pay special attention whenever there were 
problems in the house that needed attention in the house. Do 
you want to comment on that or you have no comment? 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:  I would not comment on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Because the – at no point is there any 
reference to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 81 of 82 
 
MS MOKONYANE:  Being part of that arrangement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  And at no point have I also interacted 
with him – Mr Le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Le Roux. 
MS MOKONYANE:  And yes.  And as I have stated before my 
husband was responsible for the maintenance and the 
running of the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  And that was his responsibility. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You see there may be some 
significance also in that. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Let me – oh sorry.  I will explain to say 
remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Part of what was my responsibility was 
not confined to one space or being at home and being 
available most of the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:  And hence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:  As in the father of the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:  My husband took responsibility including 
even procuring the services of other people that I am still 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 82 of 83 
 
using today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:  The electricians and the maintenance 
guy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No Ms Thomas also emphasised that 
most of the time I think you would not be in the house 
because of your other – because of your work.  So she did 
make that point.   
But there is also still something strange that there 
would be this person that your late husband knows whenever 
10 
there is a problem in the house I just call my wife’s PA to get 
that person to come and fix things in the house.  But he 
never tells you about this person.  You never get to know 
about this person. 
MS MOKONYANE:  I – I do not know how frequent was that.  
And hence I am saying I also know of the service providers 
who provided services to the house.  Professional. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Who continue even now to do that 
professional service in terms of electricians, in terms of 
20 
plumbers, in terms of the maintenance guys who finally gave 
us somebody who was doing the gardening and services at 
home who then worked for us full time?  So there were other 
people that I know who were actually rendering those 
services at a fee and who were paid by us. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 83 of 84 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the BOSASA ones that you did not 
know. 
MS MOKONYANE:  No not – not the BOSASA ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well in fairness to you I must also go 
back to the question of the – the maintenance in the house 
and the repairs.   
Mr Notshe had said there is a letter from your 
attorneys that deals with the question I think of installation 
of CCTV cameras.  He will deal with that but I want to go 
back to the – to Mr Agrizzi’s evidence and Mr Le Roux’s 
10 
evidence which was that maintenance issues were dealt with 
by BOSASA or contractors who would be paid for by BOSASA 
in the house.   
And they had said if I recall correctly that the CCTV 
cameras were also installed by BOSASA or a contractor 
contracted by BOSASA.  My recollection and you must just 
tell me if my recollection is not correct.  My recollection was 
that when you gave evidence – when you started giving 
evidence last time you denied all of that – you said no it did 
not happen.   
20 
But of course there was the affidavit of Mr Van Biljon 
then Mr Charl Le Roux and there were invoices and I think in 
the end you came to a point where you say look I cannot 
dispute that they did the work that they said they did but all I 
am saying is that I did not request them to do it and my 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 84 of 85 
 
husband was the one responsible for maintenance issues.  I 
never knew about it and he never told me anything about it.  
Is my recollection correct of your evidence? 
MS MOKONYANE:  I cannot recall what was Mr Van Biljon 
was about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Biljon was the contractor who sent – 
who employed Mr Charl Le Roux and he is that they – they 
attended to … 
MS MOKONYANE:  [00:24:36] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is. I think let us look at Mr Notshe.  
10 
You have – perhaps where to find it.   
 ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just a – Chair.  Still in your… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Oh well it may be that you did not 
bring that particular file if you did not intend to ask questions 
about it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair I will – I will find it.  It is T14 and 
T15.  To also Chair to explain to Ms Mokonyane it is Mr Van 
Biljon did not testify but he gave an affidavit.  But the person 
who testified worked and employed by Mr Van Biljon is as 
the Chair says Mr Charl Le Roux.  But we will find the 
20 
affidavit. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Mr Le Roux.  I think … 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I beg your pardon. 
MS MOKONYANE:  It is not on 138. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just bring the microphone closer to you. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 85 of 86 
 
MS MOKONYANE:  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS MOKONYANE:  I see there is an affidavit of Mr Le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe what we – maybe what we 
should do maybe we should park the issue let Mr Notshe ask 
you about other matters in the meantime his juniors will look 
for the relevant pages and then we can come back to it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine Ms Mokonyane? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Well let us deal with other issues around 
this and then we will find the evidence – the affidavit of Mr 
Van Biljon.  Is it alright? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But we – the gist of the issue Ms 
Mokonyane is in the end you said the issue of repairs at your 
house – of repairs were handled by your husband. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is the issue. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Do you still confirm that? 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But then you went on and you said the 
issue of security the CCTV’s were installed by government.  
Do you recall that? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 86 of 87 
 
MS MOKONYANE:  I said all security matters in my house 
according to my knowledge are done through government 
services. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Ms Mokonyane when you left you 
said you will provide us with details of which government 
department provided the CCTV at your house. 
MS MOKONYANE:  We have written to the state.  We – it is 
not even the department that one works to – that one works 
for.  It is always done through the offices of Public Works in 
the… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry Ms Mokonyane.  Please 
bring the microphone a little closer to your – go closer to it.  
I did not hear that – what you said.  Just repeat it please. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes I said all security matters in my 
house were actually done by the – by the state. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As you are saying when you left last 
time. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You said you will provide the commission 
with details of which department provided the – installed the 
CCTV at your house. 
MS MOKONYANE:  We wrote to the Department – to the 
office of the Premier Chair. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 87 of 88 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And – and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let her finish. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Oh I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja finish Ms Mokonyane. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. We wrote to the office of the 
Premier and we – we asked for this information because for 
any provincial member of the executive council this is the 
work that is being done through the office of the Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was her response? 
MS MOKONYANE:  We – we received the response just 
10 
when yesterday – day before yesterday yes.   And it is piles 
of documents that have been sent.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But – but then – sorry again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that does it confirm that the state 
did… 
MS MOKONYANE:  I have not gone through them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have not been able to go through 
them. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It says your lawyers did go through them.  
It does not confirm that the state installed CCTV’s at your 
house. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Are you asking? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I am putting it to you.  You do not have 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 88 of 89 
 
to [00:29:46] that. 
MS MOKONYANE:  I am not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not checked. 
MS MOKONYANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not had the documentation. 
MS MOKONYANE:  I am not – no Chair I am honestly not 
aware.  All I can tell is that we did receive the report, and we 
did also state here that all matters related to security were 
actually handled by the state. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, when there are security... 
10 
when those security matters are handled by the state, would 
the member not of the Executive Council in the case of the 
province, would he or she not be required to sign some 
document? 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, I do not remember signing anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, it is done directly through the South 
African Police Service and the people responsible for 
security in government.  
CHAIRPERSON:   They do not require you to request it? 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Interestingly, that I think that I wish they 
do not do.  They work on the basis of the security risk.  
Honestly speaking, I have not been closer to that space. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  But it is the position that you 
are saying you installed CCTV cameras in your house and 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 89 of 90 
 
whatever other security features and you assumed that they 
were provided by the state or are you saying you know for 
sure that they were provided by the state? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Chair, everything that has been put 
including the burglar doors and everything, as well as, the 
access, the gate and any other means of security, I have 
always assumed that it is the work of the state and I have 
never asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I have never asked because they never 
10 
even come to us.  I remember in... when we started, some of 
us were actually quite reluctant to have some of the things 
that were put in our houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So as I understand it, your answer is, you 
are not saying definitely the state provided, you are saying 
you assume that the state had provided? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, the state can be in a better place to 
explain ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   ...what they have been able to do as 
20 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And is it correct that in your evidence, 
last time, you did not say you assumed, you said it as a fact, 
it was installed by the state? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 90 of 91 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  Yes, as I said, the state provided 
all issues related to security. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Right, let us do it this way.  Evidence of 
Mr Agrizzi and Mr Richard le Roux is to the effect that the 
CCTV was installed by BOSASA at your house.  Can you 
dispute that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not know of any installation done by 
BOSASA of any security measure in my house. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But you cannot dispute that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not know. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And during break today, there 
was from our lawyers a letter from the Department of Works 
which was given by me to say that the Department of Works 
did not install CCTV’s at your house. 
MS MOKONYANE:    
“What you should also realise that the department 
does not have any record of pro-formas or requests 
for security measures in the private residence of Ms 
Nomvula 
Mokonyane, 
either 
by 
the 
Gauteng 
Department, the Gauteng Officer of the Premier, the 
20 
Department of Infrastructure.   
As 
a 
standard 
practice, 
contributions 
towards 
security 
measures 
for 
Premiers 
and 
MEC’s 
is 
administered by the province and not the National 
Department of Public Works and Infrastructure.   
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 91 of 92 
 
I trust that the aforesaid is in order. 
However, should you need any further clarity or 
information regarding this letter, then please feel 
free to contact the Head of the Prestige branch.” 
 
I see this is coming from the National Department 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just place on record what you are reading 
Ms Mokonyane. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just place on record what you are reading 
10 
from. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ms Mokonyane ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Indicating the letter from who to whom. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Let me help, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ms Mokonyane, we are reading a letter 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...which is dated the 2n d of September 
and the letter is from the Department of Public Works and 
20 
Infrastructure 
and 
it 
is 
written 
to 
Ms 
B 
Tshabalala 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   ...Acting Secretary of this Commission. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 92 of 93 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Chair, if I may inform you that 
during the break, the tea-break we received this letter from 
the Department of Works and I have shared it with the 
lawyers of Ms Mokonyane.  And hence they discussed it with 
her 
and 
hence 
she 
is 
reading 
from 
it. 
 
And 
then 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Just 
reading 
it 
again 
because 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   Must I read it again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Ja, let the witness read it, ja. 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Chair, I want to take... it says: 
“The 
above-mentioned 
letter 
and 
the 
correspondence addressed to the Head of the 
Department dated 21s t July 2020 refers. 
The department hereby apologises for the late 
response to your request for information.  The latter 
was 
due 
to 
changes 
within 
the 
department’s 
management. 
I refer to paragraph of 2 of your letter in response to 
this policy.  The department does not have any 
20 
record of the formal request for security measures in 
the private residence of Ms Mokonyane, either by 
the Gauteng Housing Development, the Gauteng 
Office 
of 
the 
Premier, 
the 
Department 
of 
Infrastructure 
Development, 
the 
Department 
of 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 93 of 94 
 
Water and Sanitisation or by herself.” 
 
Then paragraph 2 says: 
“As 
a 
standard 
practice, 
contributions 
towards 
security 
measures 
for 
Premiers 
and 
MEC’s 
is 
administered by the province and not the National 
Department of Public Works and Infrastructure.   
I trust that the aforesaid is in order. 
However, should you need any further clarity or 
information regarding this letter, then please feel 
free to contact the Head of the Prestige branch, Mr 
10 
Muzwanzi(?) 
Lesazona(?) 
at 
the 
below 
contact 
details.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  Thank you. 
MS MOKONYANE:   So what I am trying to say Chair is that, 
yes I have seen this letter just now over break.  Remember, I 
have only served for less... for what?... for five years, as a 
Minister at the national level.  And throughout, I have served 
as an MEC and the Premier in the province as it is alluded 
on paragraph 2.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think that the one point you are 
20 
making is, you assumed that the state had taken care to 
install the CCTV camera and other security features in the 
house that you do not know for sure.  That is the assumption 
you made.  And there is not much you can say about that 
other than what you have said. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 94 of 95 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  And this letter does not dispute 
anything.  It direct the Commission to Provincial Government 
that at the time when I was the minister, the state never 
provided security for me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now does not the letter come from 
the Provincial Department in Gauteng? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The letter from the National Public 
Works, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, can I also ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the office of the Premier, has it not 
been asked and whatever other provincial departments? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The provincial departments have said 
that 
they 
did 
not 
install 
security 
features 
in 
the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to raise that with Ms 
Mokonyane? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, I can do that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And to the correspondence. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And if you can go to Bundle B?  Chair, 
20 
before we do this.  Can we do some house exercises? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But make sure to have that letter 
admitted. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 95 of 96 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can we admit this letter?  And then what 
we then propose Chair to do is, to have it put on Exhibit T20.  
We put it as page 18-1.  So you it will be T20 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which bundle? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Bundle 2 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   BOSASA Bundle 2. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   BOSASA Bundle 2.  And then it should 
go as page 18-1.  And then the following page will be 18-2. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Thank you for ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ja, just... do not worry. 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We are just doing some house 
exercises.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to put it as what exhibit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As Exhibit 20.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   20 of T20? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   T20.  Sorry, Chair.  T20.1.  And then it 
should be page 18-1 and 18...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But according to 1, here is something 
else. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Remember 20.1 Chair is the exhibit on 
Bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but each letter that does... that is not 
attached to the affidavit is an exhibit on its own. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, will it... our thinking was that 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 96 of 97 
 
the... if Chair will turn to page 14, it is request... page 14 is 
a request to Public Works for information and this letter is a 
response to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  When are you... when we are we 
going to... do you intend to have these other letters as 
exhibit or not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I beg your pardon, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you intend to have this other 
letters admitted as exhibits or not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, some of the letters. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I do not want some of the letters, it is 
because on this issue the two letters, the two letters to the 
lawyers of Ms Mokonyane, that issue has not yet been taken 
by the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the letter... so what is the exhibit 
number you propose? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, the last exhibit number on the 
BOSASA is the affidavit of Ms Gina Pieters which is T29.  
Then this means that this will then go as Exhibit T30.  Then 
20 
das 1 and then dash 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think let us not... let me not admit it 
now.  I think you may need just a little bit more time to see 
where and how if it be admitted at some stage even after Ms 
Mokonyane has finished giving evidence. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 97 of 98 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you may need to do that and 
organise things properly. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We appreciate that, Chair.  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Ms Mokonyane, just on this issue, 
before we go to where I am going to refer you to 
...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   Which one? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, just a question.  When you left, do 
10 
you confirm that... remember when you were testifying, you 
said you will give the Commission details of the department 
that installed the CCTV and security issues at your place.  
Am I right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you have never given that?  Am I 
right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I have submitted the list, the document 
to my... oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, just start your answer afresh. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I am saying, all issues that are 
related to security, I had actually submitted them to my 
lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To your lawyer? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 98 of 99 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And then all other issues that are 
related to our private services at home, I can also furnish 
and I have actually sent the page of the maintenance 
company, the details of the maintenance company, as well as 
the company that deals with the electricity and security in 
the house. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Right, can you just tell the Commission 
what details did you give to your lawyers about the 
department that installed the CCTV at your place? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   I gave the lawyer the details about the 
security services that are rendered through a Department of 
Infrastructure of the province through the office of the 
Premier. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But Ms Mokonyane, let us be specific.  
The evidence is this, that a CCTV was installed at your 
house by BOSASA.  Do you dispute that?  Are you saying 
that CCTV was not installed by BOSASA but was installed by 
a government department.  Is that your evidence? 
MS MOKONYANE:   My evidence is that I have no knowledge 
20 
of a CCTV system that was installed by BOSASA in the 
house.  I have on record information that says, my husband 
and myself had a private security company that was 
responsible for the installation of our security including the 
fence there. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 99 of 100 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you are not also ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  I thought that you said that, as far 
as you are concerned, all security features in your house 
were installed by the state. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I seem to now ...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   But post... when I left the Gauteng, 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOKONYANE:   ...government nationally did not take 
10 
responsibility of security at our homes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And that is why then you had to have 
your own private security company that must then provide 
the services because in terms of government, if you have a – 
and at national, if you have an official residence, they do not 
actually provide to your private home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but did you not say at some stage, 
both when you gave evidence previously and today, that it 
was the state that took care of all security features in your 
20 
house?  Did I misunderstand you, your evidence? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, for a long time we did not have to 
take responsibility because I was really at home and my 
home was also part of an official residence for me and the 
state took responsibility. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 100 of 101 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So are you, therefore, saying prior 
when you became National Minister, when you talk about 
that time before that when you are in the province, all 
security features in your house were taken care of by the 
state? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was your understanding? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not saying it as a fact?  That was 
your assumption? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   That was my understanding and that was 
the fact because Chair, just now recently, although a few 
years back now, when I was in Pretoria, we had to again sort 
out our own security features because now the state could 
not actually maintain our services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But of course, whatever was installed 
was not removed? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Some of the things that were installed 
by the state we had to remove because they were old. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Like, some of the burglar and I do not 
know whether it was because of the quality.  They actually 
ended up rusting and collapsing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   The access control had to actually be 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 101 of 102 
 
changed because of the load shedding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you now saying, prior to you 
becoming the Minister in the National Government, the state 
took care of - as far as you knew – you are not stating it as a 
fact – as far as you knew you thought the state had taken 
care of all security features in your house? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But after you became Minister at the 
National Government, the state did not take care of security 
features in your house? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You made your own private arrangements? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS MOKONYANE:   But there are services that even before I 
left for National Government, there were services like the 
maintenance of the house ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   ...needs to... the state did not maintain 
our houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   We maintained our houses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you concede that previously when 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 102 of 103 
 
you gave evidence and maybe earlier this morning, you did 
not make this distinction to say what was the position before 
you became the minister. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I might not have done that.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you might not have done that. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   [Mic not switched on] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Put on your mic, please. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then why did you just said Ms 
10 
Mokonyane... is it not the sum-total of your evidence today, 
is that you cannot dispute that BOSASA installed a CCTV at 
your house?  You cannot dispute that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   What I can attest is that we have... I 
know of the payment we have made to service providers who 
have been dealing with the security features in the house.  
That I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That was the amount of your evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think from a legal point of view, we can 
20 
accept that she cannot dispute it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is why she says she assumed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.  I am just effectively saying to 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 103 of 104 
 
Mr Notshe and Ms Mokonyane because I think he wants you 
to say yes you cannot dispute it.   
 
But I think you are reluctant to say that.  But what you 
are saying and you have said more than once, you assumed 
that it was the state which provided the security features.   
 
So I am saying to him, that is enough to say you do not 
know for sure whether the state did provide or not.  You 
made an assumption.  So I meant that ...[intervenes]  
MS MOKONYANE:   I was never given a list of what the state 
had stopped to do. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And what the state had done but what I 
know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   ...once you move from the province, the 
state resist(?) to provide.  And nationally also there was no 
provision.  We had to take responsibility on our side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Even when we were still here, there 
were things that we had to take responsibility for on our own. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I move on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at three or four minutes to one. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 104 of 105 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I had hoped that we would have finished 
by now but I cannot blame anybody because I too have been 
asking lots of questions.   
MS MOKONYANE:   That is okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am suggesting that if possible we 
continue into the lunch hour. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And hopefully we can finish maybe not 
later than half-past one. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we then adjourn for the day. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But I almost ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that alright Ms Mokonyane?  Is that 
fine? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I am fine, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And your counsel indicates it is fine.  
Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now Ms Mokonyane, where I started 
with just this issue and you were saying in 2013, at the time 
20 
of your 50t h birthday, you were working as the Premier.  Am I 
right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And if I understand that the income, the 
total income at the ...[intervenes]  
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 105 of 106 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   Oh, you want to make it public? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MS MOKONYANE:   You want to make it public? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Well, it has to be public. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay, that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I am sorry. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The total income ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it will not be knew because your 
salary and my salary is part of the... [laughs] 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is public. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Your total income was R 143 137,66.  
Do you dispute that? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Where do you read it from? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Where do you read it from? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Turn to page... in the... do you have 
T20.1? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Start with the bundle.

ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Bundle BOSASA 2.

MS MOKONYANE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is an application form. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I am here now. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Your total income is recorded as 
R 143 137,66.  Dot 56.  Is that correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is at the time? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That is at the time ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So that we got. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, this is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Which year was that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   This is the year that you bought the 
Ashton Martin.  Am I right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And is it correct that the Aston Martin 
was R 3 099 524,99? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is it correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is it correct that a deposit of 
R 2 200 000,00 was paid as a deposit? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 107 of 108 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   How did you afford to pay that amount 
of money as a deposit? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Thank you very much.  The deposit 
Chairperson, in fact, it was part of the discussions... the 
things that I am saying, there is something about significant 
about my 50 years.  We... my husband has been doing some 
work including trying to get contract coming from your Eskom 
and so forth, a case that we are still fighting now about the 
Evergreen Project of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I remember last time you also 
10 
mentioned. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS MOKONYANE:   And he had ventured into a very closed 
fracture of our business which is the scrap from Eskom and 
from Denel and so on and so forth.  He had people that were 
actually mentoring and supporting him.   
 
And these were people who were quoting him and they 
could see that things were coming okay, that this is going to 
be a good business and it stands a good chance of growing.   
20 
 
And so he... in our understanding of why my 50t h is very 
important, he... we then said and discussed and one of the 
things that we agreed on was that we need something that I 
think I would be happy with.  And he will work with me to 
make sure that I get it.   
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 108 of 109 
 
 
And he then through them had discussions.  We then 
had a friend, a family friend, who then because of seeing 
what is coming through on the project that I am saying until 
today and I still believe that these are some of the real 
issues about real capture in Eskom, we are still in courts 
with my husband there.  We still have to pay lawyers 
because we are fighting that lucrative contract.   
 
He then made arrangements with the firm who are not 
doing business with government.  Who does not do business 
with government.   
10 
 
And they were able to then make this assistance which 
in return, they were going to be part of his partnership on the 
work of the contract, the Eskom contract.  So that is how 
that deposit was made.   
 
But the important thing that I insisted on was that I want 
to make direct contributions myself as well.  So I made that 
contribution as well.   
 
And I must say, we are a family that has got friends that 
understood 
our 
pains 
of 
always 
being 
deprived 
of 
opportunities.   
20 
 
And like I am saying, this Eskom issue was almost on 
the table.  It was a done deal and unfortunately, until today, 
people at Eskom actually made sure that it remains with 
those that have been doing that job for over 25-years.   
 
So these guys then with all this pressure of me turning 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 109 of 110 
 
50 and so forth, we have a meeting all of us and he then 
said:   Look, do this thing and Mogai(?) – that is how he 
used to call me – she will also make contributions towards 
that.   
 
And that was it.  And I did pay.  I did make my own 
contributions because I also had a pride of myself to actually 
own up to this thing.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you are saying the R 2 million was 
paid by someone else? 
MS MOKONYANE:   It was not paid by someone else.  It was 
10 
a contribution that was done to simple because at that time, 
Serge was going to get this contract... what do you call it?... 
from... 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Eskom. 
MS MOKONYANE:   ...Eskom.  And there was a dispute and 
she was actually taking them to court.  And there was that 
arrangement of saying, when this contract is coming through, 
we all... then we all are going to be party.   
 
Actually, there are three.  One of them has passed on 
and the other two.  And actually, two now have passed on.  
20 
My husband and the other partner, as well as the other 
person who is still alive.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Who paid the R 2 million? 
MS MOKONYANE:   It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Before that.  What was the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 110 of 111 
 
price of the car at the time? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It was three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was R 3 million? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Continue Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Who paid the R 2 200 00,00? 
MS MOKONYANE:   It was our family friend, Thaba. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I did not get that name? 
MS MOKONYANE:   It was our family friend, Thaba. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   She has a surname? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   It was Thaba ...[indistinct]. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So it was a loan to your husband? 
MS MOKONYANE:   It was a business arrangement to say 
look, we want to enter this space and you are into it and I 
am battling to get these guys, I am being taken from pillar 
to post and then they then said look, we can assist you 
because we can see that you have this – he has this bids 
that you have led and you are part of the – what is it, there 
is only a few black-owned companies that are doing 
business in this space you stand a good chance and bid 
20 
your infrastructure and everything and they made that 
arrangement. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And so they were times when Mr 
Mufamadi was going to take his money back once the – 
your husband’s business had matured and there was 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 111 of 112 
 
money in it, am I right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, they were going to make that 
arrangement themselves, those were the three gentlemen 
who had made that arrangement amongst themselves. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So you and your husband’s estate owe 
Mr Mufamadi 2.2 million, is that correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:   My take is that if we get through that 
Eskom deal finally, surely they would also be invited to be 
part of it as it was an arrangement. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And if you do not get the deal you will 
10 
owe Mr Mufamadi’s other – you owe Mr Mufamadi or it is a 
gift, 2.2 million. 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, we really have to pay him.  We will 
have to pay him.  If this thing does not go anywhere, which 
I think it will be so unfair.  It will be so unfair because it 
was a lucrative – it was – you could see how he has been 
short changed in the bids at Eskom. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And are you able to refer the 
Commission to some documents of this agreement between 
your husband and Mr Mufamadi over 2.2 million?  I am sure 
20 
there must be.  I mean, it is a lot of money in my 
…[intervenes] 
MS MOKONYANE:   I would not have that document, I 
know – that is why I am saying I know there were three, it 
was Eddie, it was Serge, it was Thabane.  
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 112 of 113 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now you said you also contributed 
some money. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  How much did you contribute? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I paid almost 900, 800. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is that the money you were paying in 
instalments? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I paid the bank in instalments. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  And you – this is - what I referred 
you on page 31, was that your application for payment of 
10 
the remainder after the deposit had been paid, am I 
correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then if you go over the page on 
page 32, it does say how much you had to pay which was 
20 885.71, am I correct? 
MS MOKONYANE:   H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now can you just tell the Commission 
this.  You know the attorneys De Klerk Mandelstam 
Incorporated. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I know them. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And they were assisting you. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, they facilitated. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Did you tell them about this agreement 
between you, your husband and Mr Mufamadi? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 113 of 114 
 
MS MOKONYANE:  They were the ones who were talking to 
them, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  You say they were the ones who were 
talking to them? 
MS MOKONYANE:   The three guys were the ones who 
were talking to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the attorneys. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you do not know what they told the 
attorneys? 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   What I know they told the attorneys 
was that they must facilitate this access to the bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, do not speak away from the 
microphone. 
MS MOKONYANE:   They must facilitate, assist to this loan 
because this is intended to be a birthday gift for myself 
and that the arrangements then will be made directly on my 
account for further payment. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now the reason I am asking you this is 
that – if you turn to page 65 of the same record.  This is a 
20 
letter dated the 21 July 2020, it is from the attorneys De 
Klerk Mandelstam Incorporated, it is to the Commission.  
This letter is as a result of a request for information from 
your attorneys.  Now on page 66 of this bundle, paragraph 
3.2 of the letter and where he is asked – he was asked 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 114 of 115 
 
directly about this 2.2 million and he says the following: 
“Our bank statements show that the payments were 
made from the account of Mr T A Mufamadi.  The 
source of these funds were from legitimate sale of 
property interest.” 
It seems to differ from what you have told the Commission 
about, the source of this 2.2 million. 
MS MOKONYANE:   But I have just mentioned the name. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Not but the letter …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure if it necessarily differs. 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   In the letter says the source of the 
funds were from a sale of property interest. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Of Mr Mufamadi. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  But you are telling the court is 
there was this – the money was an advance given to your 
husband because his business was going to grow and then 
he is going to repaid it.  It does not say it was a loan to 
your husband. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are combining two issues, Mr 
20 
Notshe, 
I 
think. 
 As 
I 
understand 
Ms 
Mokonyane’s 
evidence, she has not told me where Mr Mufamadi and 
whoever else were going to get their money from, the 
money from.  What she has said is her husband Mr 
Mufamadi and somebody else, I think you said an Eddie, 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 115 of 116 
 
they discussed and the arrangement, as I understand it, 
and Ms Mokonyane, you must tell me if I misunderstood 
you, as I understand it, Mr Mokonyane wanted to give his 
wife a birthday gift and there was this business that 
seemed to be promising that he was onto at Eskom or with 
Eskom. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he spoke to them on the basis that 
if they made money available which would enable him, I 
guess, to buy Ms Mokonyane this birthday gift then he 
10 
would allow them into this business that seemed to be 
promising in due course.  Is that right? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how you explained it, ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am saying my understanding is, she 
had not yet said where Mr Mufamadi and whoever were 
going to get the cash from. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson, look, I take your point.  I 
take the point that the letter seems to be explaining the 
20 
source of Mr Mufamadi’s funds and you, as you are 
testifying, you do not know the source of Mr Mufamadi’s 
funds, is that correct, Ms Mokonyane? 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, I would not know. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But, Ms Mokonyane, you confirm, you 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 116 of 117 
 
also confirmed that at your salary at that stage you would 
not afford to pay a deposit of R2 200 000. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I did not pay it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No one afforded you that. 
MS MOKONYANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What kind of facilitation were the 
attorneys supposed to do? 
MS MOKONYANE:   I do not bank with Wesbank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MS MOKONYANE:   So I needed a facility that I can use to 
10 
pay from my salary the vehicle that – the vehicle I was 
going to acquire and what then we did was to then get the 
lawyer to do the applications on my behalf and facilitate 
them, get the – and link up with the bank, between the 
bank and the dealership and that was all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that it seems strange to me.  I 
thought when people want such an arrangement with 
Wesbank, or whoever, they just walk into Wesbank or 
phone them and fill in whatever form and say …[intervenes] 
MS MOKONYANE:   Sometimes, you get [intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   …this is what I can afford rather than go 
to an attorney 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes.  Sometimes you get somebody 
who like is a broker who can assist you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, a broker, ja. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 117 of 118 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes because he is part of that, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is just that one – at least it is not 
usual for me to see attorneys coming into that space. 
MS MOKONYANE:   You can get a broker to assist you to 
get something through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And they will then do it and finally it is 
your signature and it is your finances that then get them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, can I before I just leave this 
10 
issue, the documents I have referred to and which I would 
like to have them admitted as evidence but with the 
problem I have with the – can I just indicate to you what 
documents are those that we will…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you might not need to indicate 
that.  What we might need to do is maybe one of the days 
you – before we start with a day’s witness you come in so 
that you place on record what you would like to be done. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  No, that is fine, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think so that it would be on record. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then before …[intervenes] 
MS MOKONYANE:   Can I also find out, Chair, just from 
you? 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 118 of 119 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And just for my own interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Affidavits so far, getting into this 
space, I thought I was here on the BOSASA matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And I know that somebody from 
BOSASA when they went to my house they came across 
the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MOKONYANE:   Is that that has created the curiosity? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I will allow Mr Notshe to say 
something on that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair and Ms Mokonyane, you 
remember Mr Agrizzi said you were paid sums of money in 
cash by Gavin Watson. 
MS MOKONYANE:   No. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Do you remember? 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And now you have a car which is more 
20 
than R3 million. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And there is a deposit of R2 million.  
We need to investigate where you got the money from. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And you have got the information 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 119 of 120 
 
where it comes from. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MS MOKONYANE:   You did get the information – you did 
get the responses to where it came from. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So I am explaining to you why we had 
to investigate this.  Money that you received cash – it is 
alleged you received cash, now all of a sudden you are 
living beyond your means.  We had to find out how did you 
manage to buy – it means that I am jealous to have a... 
MS MOKONYANE:   No, I have never said you are jealous.  
10 
I just wanted to know what was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How it came about it. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  But you understand that is why 
we had to follow up this. 
MS MOKONYANE:   [speaking African language] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now just – this I want I want to be part 
of the record.  Can we just go through it, Ms Mokonyane, 
just to confirm seven things.  You will see on page 31, it is 
a Wesbank application notice. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   Page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   31. 
MS MOKONYANE:    Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then over the page it is the 
application notice where it sets out the – on page 32, the 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 120 of 121 
 
price of the car, the deposit and the instalments that were 
being paid. 
MS MOKONYANE:   On page 33. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then it goes to page 33, right.  
And then also page 34.  Then page 35, the registration 
details of your vehicle. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then page 37 is document from 
financial services and then we can leave that and then go 
to page 65, 65 to 71.  It is the letter from DKM Attorneys.  
10 
Do you see that?   Yes, Ms Mokonyane, I am not going to 
ask questions about it, all I want – is just to see there is 
this on record and then I am going to ask the Chair to 
admit this document and then we will give them a number.  
That is all I am referring to. 
 
Chair, then there is one last issue, I am not sure 
whether we need to deal with it but we have dealt with it.  I 
think we resolved it.  It was the issue, Ms Mokonyane, of 
Mr van Biljon.  Remember we were saying there is a Mr van 
Biljon who was requested – who was engaged by BOSASA 
20 
to do repairs at your house.  He then employed Charl le 
Roux and then you wanted to see the affidavit of Mr van 
Biljon but I do not think that issue features …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, no, we promised her we will 
find the affidavit.  She wanted to see Mr Biljon’s affidavit.  
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 121 of 122 
 
I think if we do have Mr Biljon’s affidavit let us find it, let 
her see it.  If we do not have it here because there was no 
plan to ask questions about it then maybe my questions 
can be sent to her in writing and she can respond by way 
of an affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, we do have the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do have. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes but unfortunately, we do not have it 
for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Well, maybe if you give it to me 
10 
then because I was the one who asked the question.  If I 
may get your one, Registrar?  Is there one for the – oh, 
there would be none for the witness? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, there is, there is one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Mokonyane, if you look at item 14 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you found it under page 18, black 
numbers on the top left corner.  Ms Mokonyane, have you 
found the affidavit of Mr Biljon at page 18, if you look at 
20 
the black numbers at the top left corner. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You found it. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, I have got it, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, I think just pull the mic 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 122 of 123 
 
closer to you.  Ja.  Now the question of his affidavit came 
up when I was referring you to the fact that he or his 
company had done certain jobs at your house.  I am just 
going to have a look here.  At page 19 at the bottom there 
is a heading that says: 
“Worked 
performed 
at 
Minister 
Mokonyane’s 
residence.” 
And then he says, I read from paragraph 7: 
“I recall that I performed work at house number…” 
I am not saying the address. 
10 
“The Commission’s investigation team has provided 
me with photographs of her house.” 
That is fine.  9: 
“In addition, I have provided with the Deeds Office.” 
Number 10: 
“I 
have 
been 
informed 
by 
the 
Commission’s 
investigation team.” 
Alright. 
11. 
I was unaware that the house…” 
Blah, blah, blah.   
20 
12 
“On one occasion I was called to the house one 
evening to attend to the backup power system.  The 
generator system would not start and met Serge.  
He was a friendly guy but he did not mention his 
surname and did not mention his wife’s position.” 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 123 of 124 
 
13: 
“On most occasions Mr le Roux met me on site.” 
He gives the address. 
“…and he showed me what needed to be done.  I 
think in all of the time that I did work at this site 
there was possibly two occasions when I went to 
the site without Mr le Roux being present.” 
14: 
“Below is a list of some of the things I recall doing 
at the house. 
14.1 
Repaired 
and 
reprogrammed 
the 
generator 
changeover.  
10 
14.2 
Replaced the distribution board for the swimming 
pool. 
14.3 
Replaced the outside stair lights leading to the 
house. 
14.4 
Repaired the electric fence. 
14.5 
Called out to repair the air-conditioning system one 
night. 
14.6 
Called out to repair the generator one night. 
14.7 
Replaced a rewired some of the water features. 
15.1 
I would estimate that I went to site to perform work 
20 
there on approximately ten occasions. 
16.1 
I have searched for and located certain quotations 
and invoices for work performed at…” 
He gives the address. 
…and have managed to locate the following. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 124 of 125 
 
And then he quotes invoices there and what was done and 
the amounts and I think Mr Charl le Roux in his affidavit 
may be mentioning other things as well but the point I 
wanted to make at the time when I raised this was that you 
had, as I understood it, you had denied that BOSASA ore 
anybody sent by BOSASA had done any work in your house 
but the Commission then obtained this information I think 
after you had filed your first affidavit and then when this 
was placed before you, ultimately you had to say you 
cannot dispute that they did it but what you says is, you 
10 
did not ask them. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Chair, I said I never asked for any 
services to be done by BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   And it is not in my knowledge that they 
have come and done all this work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS 
MOKONYANE: 
 
 
I 
do 
have 
the 
professional 
maintenance company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOKONYANE:   An electrical and security company 
that provides the services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKONYANE:   That is what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
03 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 260 
 
Page 125 of 126 
 
MS MOKONYANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but I think in the end, towards the 
end, as I understand it, you did say you are not disputing 
all these invoices and what they say.  What you are saying 
is – what you were saying is your late husband was 
responsible for maintenance issues in the house and you 
never requested any – you did not request BOSASA or 
anybody sent by BOSASA to do any such work. 
MS MOKONYANE:   I never did that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Thank you very much, Ms 
10 
Mokonyane.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Those are my questions, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those are your questions.  Counsel for 
Ms Mokonyane, is there any re-examination? 
ADV L HODES SC:   Nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, okay.  Thank you very much, Ms 
Mokonyane, for coming to clarify certain matters.  I will 
now excuse you but thank you very much for coming. 
MS MOKONYANE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  We are going to adjourn for 
20 
the day and tomorrow the Commissioner will hear evidence 
from Mr Vincent Smith.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 4 SEPTEMBER 2020
